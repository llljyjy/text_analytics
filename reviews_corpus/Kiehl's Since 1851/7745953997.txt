I have never used any product from this brand and this one sadly is a NO for me. PROS:- It doesn’t leave a white cast. - Hydrating cream, with a nice texture (not too thin, not too thick)- It has glycerin,squalane and hyaluronic acid which are great hydrators.- It smells very good. I like scented formulas although it is not necessary. - Clean at SephoraCONS:- This cream doesn’t work with my skincare. It peels. This is a problem for me because I am not going to stop using my skincare, focused on anti-aging, to use this sunscreen. I would use another one on my face and leave this one for my arms.- It is a chemical sunscreen. I don’t have sensitive skin so I can use it but I can’t apply it around my eyes because it makes me tear up and I want sunscreen on that area because it is the most delicate. - If you apply the recommended amount for any sunscreen to be effective at the advertised SPF (1 teaspoon for the face), your will end up with a greasy looking face. It may have been part of the reason for the sunscreen to peel on me.- It has a lot of silicons, which I suspect are another reason for this cream not to work with my skincare.- It has a couple of essential oils. They give the cream a nice minty citrusy smell that I love but it is not necessary. They may be irritating for some so they should just not add them as they don’t provide any sun protection benefits.- I find it a little pricey.I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador This one is definitely a NO for me
