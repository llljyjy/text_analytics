A great eye cream is essential and I have been loving this one. The Super Multi Corrective Eye Zone Treatment targets signs of aging around the brow bone, eyelid, crow’s feet and under-eye. I have been using it for several weeks and definitely see plumper skin and softened fine lines in these areas. It contains collagen and peptides and is a lightweight formula that works well under makeup. Also, it doesn’t cause milia! Woo hoo! I will definitely be adding this to my repurchase list. It’s a beauty! nan
