It works! It felt fancy to mix the Serum myself with the powder.  I love that there’s no strong odor, it absorbs quickly, and I’ve been using it for a couple of weeks and have noticed some changes. Especially notice changes in my fine lines and wrinkles. I hope these changes just continue as I use this product more. nan
