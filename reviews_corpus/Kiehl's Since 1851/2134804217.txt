This is my first experience with a serum as a cream and I was excited about that thinking it wouldn’t be sticky like other thinner based serums but it was a little bit tacky and didn’t really agree with my makeup which I also use to get rid of my bags lol so I found myself only using this at night as an eye cream so to speak and for that purpose I absolutely love it. My skin does look slightly lighter and feels smoother and I see a slight difference in my crows feet but maybe I’d see more if I used it twice a day as directed. Overall I would say it doesn’t hurt to try this product as you will see some results! I like it!
