As with other reviewers, I found the instructions a little overly complicated. The product itself can be a bit harsh, but it does work. It spreads easily and absorbs quickly. I had to ramp up to using it every night, so for anyone with sensitive skin, I would advise taking it slowly at first and building up to daily usage. My skin does feel softer for using this. Good but can be a bit much for daily use
