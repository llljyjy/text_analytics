I used the Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol Serum for two weeks as a sample promotion. I did not see a noticeable difference in wrinkles, lines or firmness.  Compared to other serums the  Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol Serum has one advantage in my opinion; a tiny bit goes a long way and this product should last over a month if not more. I liked the creamy texture, it  absorbed in to my skin immediately without being oily. The serum made my skin feel silky and smooth. Although i like the serum, I don’t know if I will purchase it because I didn’t see any results in the time frame I had to use it. I’m going to use the serum until it’s gone to see if my  I i get better results. If you do decide to purchase this serum, be sure to give it at least a month or two to see results, two weeks is definitely not enough and always wear sunscreen. Nothing Spectacular
