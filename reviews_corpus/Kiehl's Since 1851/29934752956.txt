The Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream is very rich in hydrating the skin and is great at instantly giving moisture to dry skin. I used the cream during the day and night for maximum hydration. This cream might be too much for skin that is oily since the cream is very hydrating and rich. I like that squalane is included in the cream because squalane is almost like natural skin oil and helps balance the skin’s moisture barrier. The cream has no scent and absorbs fast into the skin. You can easily apply sun cream or makeup after using the facial cream. I had no problems with applying my makeup afterward and only helps make my skin not so dry-looking or dull. This cream has become one of my favorites. Hydrating and Rich
