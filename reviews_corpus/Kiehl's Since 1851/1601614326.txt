Ok I loveeee this stuff. I put it on in the morning before my sunscreen and after years of use, it’s definitely helped balance out my skin tone. I also love that it has kind of a warming sensation when you put it on; not burning, but more of that feeling of opening the oven to peek on your cookies kind of warmness. Also, Vitamin C is supposed to be kept in opaque bottles so as not to effect the potency, and Kiehl’s nailed that here so you know it’s legit. Some things worth mentioning: if your skin looks brighter after use, it may partially be because there’s a slight tint/glow to this product. Additionally, it can feel a little greasy so less is more. Definitely noticed a difference!
