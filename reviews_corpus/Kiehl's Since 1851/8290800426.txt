I had dry patches as usual this time of year, and after putting this product on them, it was relieved almost immediately. I was surprised  that I didn’t really feel the need to revisit areas I had already treated with this. I get dry elbows often and I will definitely be reaching for this when they occurs again. Kiehl’s has a great reputation for skincare and this was no exception. BUY THIS NOW!
