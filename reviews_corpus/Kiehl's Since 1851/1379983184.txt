I received the Kiehl’s Retinol Fast-Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum as a complimentary promotion. I was intrigued by the creative packaging and need to mix the power in the liquid. I was a bit skeptical when I started using it about a month ago but I have been pleasantly surprised by my lack of redness or skin irritation. No dryness or stickiness either. I have a crease on my forehead that seems to be diminished in depth. It is a bit pricey, so unless my forehead crease ceases to exist, I probably won’t spend the money to buy another bottle. No irratation!
