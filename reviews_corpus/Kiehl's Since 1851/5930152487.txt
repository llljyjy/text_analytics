I saw my bestie (with flawless skin I might add) had a nearly empty jar of this stuff. I bought my own just a couple of weeks ago and the difference is amazing. I have combination skin (extremely oily on my T-zone). I have always suffered from an uneven skin tone along with red marks that lasted for months after any breakout. I was suffering from a random breakout when I purchased this, and my skin stopped breaking out as soon as I started using it. After the first week of only using it at bedtime, I felt a major difference when I looked in the mirror. My skin was glowing, and my red marks are fading faster than anything I’ve ever tried (I’ve tried EVERYTHING). I now use it twice a day, in the morning under my SPF and at bedtime. I thought this stuff was gonna be a scam but I can say it’s honestly worth the money and I’m so so happy. Great on my Red Marks and Oily Skin
