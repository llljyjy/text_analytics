Was really excited for this to help out my sensitive and dry skin this winter. And I’m not disappointed, it is hydrating and it does do what it says. The cons, and hence the 4/5 is that is not quite as hydrating as I hoped, and the smell is just too much. All that being said, I’m going to keep buying it because the pros really do outweigh the cons. pretty good hydrator, just a lil stinky
