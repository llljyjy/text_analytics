I’m familiar with the Kiehl’s brand but I never used the Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution before. The first thing I really liked is that it’s clinically tested. It has a very strong botanical background hence the white birch and peony. It really made my dark spots disappear from my acne scars and made my skin more smooth and visually nicer. What solution also helps fight UV exposure?! It has a very light kinda floral scent. Clear formula so it can be used on any complexion from light to dark. Super gentle and great for sensitive skin. I really like it
