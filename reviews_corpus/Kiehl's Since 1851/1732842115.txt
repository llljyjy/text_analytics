I wanted to try this product but the packaging is a nightmare.  I bough and returned it three times before giving up because I was never able to get any product out  of the lid? They need to re-think the lids or provide better directions? Not sure if that store just had a bad batch? Me and like 5 employees were trying to get the product out with zero success it was very frustrating. I ended up switching to a different Kiehl’s product which I could more reliably access. I can’t imagine fighting with that container every night. awful container beware of the packaging
