I received this complimentary from BzzAgent for my honest review.  I was excited to try an eye cream from Kiehlâ€™s since I only tried their masks before. First off the consistency is pretty thick and a little goes a long way! It feels a bit tacky at first but absorbs after some time. The scent is subtle and not too overpowering (I get migraines). I do wish the texture was more of a gel consistency to be able to sink into the skin for other moisturizers. I used this for about a month before writing this review and I did notice less puffiness in my eyes. Although, it did seem to make a small difference I do prefer other eye creams for a lesser price point. Slightly Tacky Feeling
