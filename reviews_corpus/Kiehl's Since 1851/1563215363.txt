Sadly this did not work for me. The title and description of this product make it sound like it’s very hydrating, but it completely dried out my skin to the point where my cheeks were burning and my whole face was flakey. I’m not quite sure how this can be advertised as hydrating when it has salicylic acid in it, something that is meant for exfoliating/acne and has a drying effect. I’ll be returning this. Not hydrating at all. Extremely drying.
