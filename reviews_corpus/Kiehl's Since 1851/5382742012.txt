I was so excited to try this product. I saw a dermatologist on instagram recommend it so I bought it out of curiosity. It says that it is a daily serum but it definitely is not :( .. By the way, I am NOT new to retinol! It is a regular piece in my skincare routine but since this one was not as strong as my usual, I thought it would be great for daily use (as suggested by the name). So wrong. I got small bumps alllll over my skin after only two uses, so sad about this. Maybe this is just some skin purging but I have definitely never experienced it to this level. Discontinued use immediately and returned. Not happy, wish I never tried it and stuck with my Sunday Riley retinol. Would not recommend, try something simpler like the inkey list retinol. Returned :(
