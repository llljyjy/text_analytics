I used this for 3 months, applying directly to my dark spots from sun damage and a dark spot from a deep acne blemish years ago. The formula itself is lightweight, has a slight pleasant aroma, and absorbs quickly. I saw negligible lightening in my sun damage spots, but it significantly lightened the one from an old picked-at acne scar. One mention of warning - This is not for travel. I flew with it in my bag twice and both times the lid came loose resulting in loss of product. The second time, I made sure the lid was screwed on tight with the same result. Overall, I would say this is worth a shot. This bottle is still going even after the spillage and twice daily use for over 3 months. Your milage may very if you do full-face application. nan
