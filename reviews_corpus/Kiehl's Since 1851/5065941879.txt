This cream is amazing! It is a perfect addition to my night time routine. This is not overly thick but still good enough to maintain moisture in my skin. I wake up glowing every time I put this on! It doesn’t feel heavy on the skin like most thick moisturizers. It has a slight smell but I don’t think it’s overpowering which is great! A little goes a long way which helps conserve the product for a longer time.  I would definitely buy this product again! Staple to my night time routine
