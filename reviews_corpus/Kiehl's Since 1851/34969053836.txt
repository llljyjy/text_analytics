This is a gorgeous, rich, & protective night cream that has some of my favorite ingredients for skin calming & healing - omega-rich oils & squalane. A little goes a long way! I love using it after acid treatments to make sure my skin is protected from irritation or peeling, or as a night cream - I wake up with the softest skin. It also works wonders on dry skin patches on other parts of my body. Really nice cream & highly recommend! Like a healing cloud!
