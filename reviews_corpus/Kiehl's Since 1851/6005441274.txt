I’ve been using this for over a month now. Had some skin irritation/breakouts in the beginning but all good now! I love that I got to mix the ingredients together myself, made me feel like a total scientist. I’m not sure what the retinol % in this product is. It’s not too aggressive, but you will notice a difference. I like it.
