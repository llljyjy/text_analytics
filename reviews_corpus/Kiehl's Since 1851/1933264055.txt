In terms of hydration/moisturizing, yes that part works. But I would prefer something with no scent or a mild scent; I’d say anything smells better than this stuff. When I put this on, I got a whiff of stinky wet dog. As in, how my old dog smelled before I put shampoo on. Horrible. Tossed it after one use. Can’t sleep and smell like an old wet dog; I’m sure my hubby was mortified but too smart to say anything. I wanted to wash it off as soon as I applied it. So gross. There are so many other sleeping masks that smell way better. Going back to my Sisley Velvet Sleeping Mask! Smells terrible
