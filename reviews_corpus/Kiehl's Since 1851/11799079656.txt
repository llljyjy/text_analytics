I really had given up about ridding myself from some dark areas on my nose and chin. I tried everything. Now it won’t take them off, it will gradually fade them out. Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution is not greasy, did not make my skin break out, was not drying and I think that I am going to continue using this product to make sure I’m rid of the dark areas on my face. They are not NEAR as noticeable now as they were before using this product. Great product that really works.....
