I honestly thought I was going to be amazed by this cream because Kiehl’s is such a great brand with quality products. The first thing that struck me is the citronella scent. (The scent used in most bug repellents.) For an overnight face cream this is not the soft, gentle, and clean scent I am looking for. Hoping to reap the benefits come morning anyway, I slathered it on. It had to be “slathered“ because it soaked right in everytime I put a layer on. That soaking means one of two things: either my skin is dry and desperate for any kind of moisture or the product has no way of locking in moisture so it sinks all the way in. By morning my skin did look happy, which was was great, but the cream hadn’t locked in any moisture, as I suspected it wouldn’t, making my skin was super dry and thirsty. (My normal morning skin is a tad oily in the t-zone and calm everywhere else). As I rinsed off my face in prepping for my morning routine it did, surprisingly, reveal soft skin. Which is strange considering it was also dry. Very weird experience overall... I am going to shelve this cream until fall when my skin has different needs and try again. But maybe not because the scent won’t have changed. Sad it's not a total winner
