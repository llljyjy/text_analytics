I really enjoyed the Kiehl’s Powerful-Strength Dark Circle Reducing Vitamin C Eye Serum. I have sensitive eyes and this product did not irritate my eyes at all or have a strong scent. The consistency of the serum is more like a thick cream, which I personally loved since I have very dry skin. A little goes a long way, and I found that my fine lines did improve through continued use. I’m giving it four stars because I didn’t see much improvement with my dark circles, but I will continue using it for all its other benefits. Good for fine lines
