This is a great light weight moisturizer for dry skin! It’s perfect for daytime when you don’t want a heavy moisturizer on your face/under makeup or when your skin isn’t in need of something heavier. I have used it over some particularly dry spots that were a bit painful and this wasn’t at all irritating over them. I find that it’s great over the rest of my skincare and gives my skin a decent boost of moisture and leaves my face feeling very soft. good daytime moisturizer for dry skin
