I struggle with fine lines.  In a effort to be proactive and prevent deep lines, I wanted to try this product.  I have combo skin and generally do well with a wide array of skin care products.  I have tried several different retinol containing products, but this seems to be a more specialized formula based on packaging and helpful information on the Kiehl’s website. Upon receiving this product, the first thing I noticed is that this product offers a really unique powder-to-serum technology that is designed for you to personally mix.  This process creates a freshly mixed formula. Once the product was mixed, I wanted to check consistency, smell, and ease of application.  This is unique in that it’s not a pump or vat to get the product, but a push bottom delivery that makes a small, pea sized amount come out.  I especially appreciate this since I have a tendency to waste product.  I did as instructed and did 2 pea sized drops.  The consistency is not like a thick and unbreathable cream, but a more watery lotion.  I was concerned with potential stickiness, but the product went on very smooth and with ease.  There is really no smell to the product which is not a bad thing since many products are heavily perfumed with bad ingredients. It was extremey fast-absorbing and left no sticky or greasy residue.  I tried a few nights to mix with some general moisturizer and it mixed extremely well with no separation. During the day, sunblock is important when using a retinol based product.  I had a fresh slate in the morning to apply sun screen.  I continued this routine for 2 full weeks.  The fine lines around my eyes, on my forehead, and around my lip and chin area were noticibly more faint. I had no redness, drying, etc. even having used on various zones on my face with different problem areas.  Definitely a great product that is easy to apply, cost effective, and efficient in reducing fine lines and wrinkles. Excellent Product!
