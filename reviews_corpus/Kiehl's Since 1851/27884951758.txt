Open the bottle cap I can smell a light lavender fragrance that I like. The color is beautiful light lavender light purple blue. The texture is thick like icecream, easy to apply but not easy to absorb. while applying the cream I worry it will rub mud, the result is not an accident, really rub mud.Want to enjoy this face cream better, I removed dead skin with facial scrub first, and then the face mask, lotion, and serum, finally use this face cream. I have  used it for 3 days,  the moist is not enough for my dry skin. I will keep going,  hope to see surprise in future. Mysterious cream
