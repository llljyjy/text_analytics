I have been using this Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution for a couple of months now. For reference, I have combination skin and my face has some dark spots and discoloration from sun damage and also acne scarring. I’ve been applying it daily, starting with all over my face and eventually just as a spot treatment to target specific areas. My skin feels brighter and more radiant. Per directions, this item can be used to treat discoloration on hands, neck and chest, however I do not have any discoloration there so I did not try it on those areas. Overall, this product worked great for my skin! My acne scarring and dark spots are much smaller. I also love how it absorbs easily into the skin unlike some other products that I used before. I would recommend this to anyone dealing with discoloration and dark spots or post-acne scarring. I will be repurchasing this again :) works great on discoloration/dark spots!
