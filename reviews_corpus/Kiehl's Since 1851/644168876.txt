I have dark spots, hyperpigmentation and post-acne marks so I was excited to try Kiehlâ€™s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution because I have not been able to find a product that lightens these skin issues.  I used the serum on my entire face in the morning and evening for two months and have not noticed any lightening of my dark spots, hyperpigmentation or post-acne marks.  The serum is easy to apply and has a light texture.  I like that it left my skin feeling moisturized without feeling greasy.  While I liked that it left my face feeling soft and nourished, it did not perform as promised.  Therefore, I would not purchase and would not recommend unless you just wanted a serum that made your skin feel softer and moisturized. Doesn't Work as Advertised
