I received the Kiehl’s ultra facial overnight rehydrating moisturizer absolutely free for my honest review. I have tried hundreds of moisturizers and I have never tried anything like this before. The packaging is brilliant and the consistency Is very thick. A little bit goes a very long way. I apply some at night and wake up to my skin feeling like a million bucks. I also use this moisturizer as a primer for my makeup and it makes my makeup look amazing! I will definitely be purchasing this product once I run out. The best moisturizer I’ve ever tried!!!
