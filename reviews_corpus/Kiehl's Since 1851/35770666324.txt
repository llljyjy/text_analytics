I added this Kiehl’s Retinol Fast Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum to my current skin routine which includes several products, so I wasn’t sure how this was going to affect my skin. I have tried other retinol products that burned my skin, so I started using this serum every other day for the first week. The immediate results were slightly firming and my skin had a healthy glow to it. Luckily, I didn’t have any negative reactions to this product aside from slight peeling on my forehead, which I expected. I have been using this product for a few weeks now, along with my current skincare routine and I have began to notice my fine lines and wrinkles appear to be fading. I have large pores on each side of my nose that appear smaller and my skin is more firm since I began using this retinol serum. Keith’s Reitnol Serum has provided results I didn’t expect and the bottle lasts a good bit before needing to purchase more, so I am definitely happy with this product. I plan to continue using this and I will be purchasing more when I run out. I will see how my skin continues to improve, but with my current results, I would recommend this product to family and friends looking to improve their skin. I'm loving this product!
