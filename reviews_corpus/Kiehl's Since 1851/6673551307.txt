I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I do not really have dark circles or bags under my eyes so I canâ€™t really say how it works there. I do have some fine lines/crows feet and it seems like it did slightly help to smooth those. I wish I would have taken before and after photos. I used it twice a day for almost 8 weeks as advised. It has a thick creamy texture and feels nice on my skin. But would I pay $50 for it? Probably not. However, it may work well for people with more noticeable eye issues. nan
