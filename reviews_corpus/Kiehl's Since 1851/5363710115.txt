I was provided the opportunity to try this product for free from BzzAgent. I have used the corrector as directed, more so as a spot treatment rather than on my entire face because I wanted to address specific dark sun/age spots. I have noticed a small difference in these spits which seems promising. It wasnâ€™t apparent just looking in the mirror, but upon closer inspection it seems to have made an okay amount of change to it. Subtle, but promising changes
