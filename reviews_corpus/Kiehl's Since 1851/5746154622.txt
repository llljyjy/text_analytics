I received this at the perfect time, I was in the market for a facial cream, especially something that was very hydrating (the winter weather/heaters has dried my skin out to the point of peeling!) This has helped my skin so much! It is thick and moisturizing! I added it into my morning routine, Iâ€™ll use it right before I do my makeup. Luckily for me (I love the snooze button), it dries pretty quickly and I can go right into doing my makeup. This will definitely be a staple in my makeup bag nan
