This was my first time trying the Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream and boy am I impressed! Being that is is winter time, my skin is extremely dry. This cream has worked wonders on hydrating and keeping my skin hydrated. It is lightweight, not greasy/oily feeling. I love that it doesn’t have a fragrance, some are just way too strong. I highly recommend this cream and will be purchasing in the future. Must have for winter
