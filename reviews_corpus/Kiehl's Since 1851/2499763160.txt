I’m a big fan of the brand. I didn’t notice any problems with this cream but I’m not noticing any particularly great improvements either. It’s so hard to tell with eye creams. It feels good to apply. Packaging is nice. I would pay $15 for this. If you’re spending money on Kiehl’s get the ultra facial cream first, it’s the best face cream I’ve ever used. You can use it with anything, so it’s always my go to for when I’m nervous about my skin possibly reacting to something or if it already has irritation. Just a really good thing to have in the toolbox. This feels similar, in that it’s underwhelming at first but likely will stand the test of time, seems to play nicely with other products, and I trust the brand. it ain’t nothin
