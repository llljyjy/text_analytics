I love how nourished my skin feels after using this barrier cream. It relieves  my dry winter skin. Helps to restore moisture,and reduce redness caused by dryness. With colloidal oatmeal as an ingredient it helps soothe my skin. This is a thick cream. Non-greasy. Good for all skin types. Unscented. Great for winter skin
