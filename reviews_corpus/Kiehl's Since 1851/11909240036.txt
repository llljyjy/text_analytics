I have been looking for an eye cream to help with my overall puffiness and crow’s feet around my eyes.  I am getting older and noticed my eyes lost their firmness, and I am developing fine lines and wrinkles that make me self-conscious. I found Kiehl’s super multi-corrective anti-aging eye cream to be fast absorbing, light, easy to apply and best of all, it is unscented. I like that this product didn’t cause any milia under my eyes, which I have experienced with other eye creams before. I have tried Dr Jart+ Ceramidin eye cream with niacinamide but that didn’t help as much with the dark circles and is also heavily scented.  I also tried the Biossance Squalane Marine Algae Eye Cream, but the cream was too thick and heavy compared to Keihls.  I also found the Keihl’s cream lasted longer while using less product and gave me the added benefit of lifting up my brow bone after a couple weeks of use. It is important for me to preserve the sensitive skin around my eyes and this product is just what I was looking for!  My eyelids even feel more smooth and hydrated. I would definitely buy this product again and have already recommended it to my friends. Best multi-corrective eye cream I've used!
