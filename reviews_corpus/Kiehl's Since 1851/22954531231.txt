Love this stuff!! I have super dry skin that gets irritated easily, but this mask is so hydrating and calming. My skin feels so soft and smooth after I rinse it off and my makeup applies better. I love how this smells. To me it smells like black tea. Itâ€™s not a strong smell or anything. great for dry skin!
