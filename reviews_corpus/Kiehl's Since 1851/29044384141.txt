It originally comes with the serum and powder separate. You combine them and shake the bottle well. This applied on clean, dry skin. You only need a dab. You only use it at night time. Always make sure to apply sunscreen when using retinol. If any irritation occurs decrease or stop usage. I have completed a 2 week trial of usage trial from Bzzagnt. I had absolutely no irritation at during my 2 weeks. I did notice my fine lines appear to have decreased some. Not completely, but they definitely look better. So far I am happy with my results and looking forward to seeing more long term usage. Nice Retinol
