I have tried almost all of the cleansing oils on the market and this type of product is a constant in my routine. As a contacts wearer I am very careful and sensitive towards products that get near my eyes/eyelashes. There are very many cleansing oils which I have used that did not sting my eyes at all when removing eye makeup, unfortunately this is not one of them. I would not rebuy this product nor will I even use up the rest of the bottle due to this personal preference. Cleanses well but stings the eyes.
