Quick Read: layers great, cream isn’t-too thick, no strong smell, feels light, works very well. I have combination to dry skin. Detailed: I would highly recommend this to anyone who struggles to hydrate their face or even to help keep your skin healthy and moisturized, which also helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles if your skin is hydrated. I have two children and my skin struggles to stay hydrated and this makes my skin super smooth and goes great with my skin routine. I use a toner spray, h-  acid, vit c, Kiehl’s ultra facial cream, and a spf. It matters so well and especially under my make up. I use day and night. In one of my photos I have Kiehls ultra facial moisturizing cream with squalene on half my hand and the other photo it’s all over. My hand shows the best contact because it’s so dry from hand sanitizer/hand washing. (Nurse) HYDRATES so well!!!
