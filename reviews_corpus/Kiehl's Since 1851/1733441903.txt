I love the whipped texture of this cream.  Sometimes products designed to add extra night time moisture can feel a little heavy on the skin and can take a while to absorb.  The light and fluffy whipped texture of this moisturizer means it absorbs really fast and gives great overnight moisture .  and to be honest, the light blue is kind of fun too. Fantastic night cream
