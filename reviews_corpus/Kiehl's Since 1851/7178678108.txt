I’m surprised the rating isn’t even higher on this cleanser. It’s one of the softest cream cleansers I have every put in my face and it feels so good on the skin. I keep trying to remember a little goes a longgg way because I use too much. It’s just so nice! Also love the no scent scent. I’m not into some of the earthy scents of Youth to the People and Bioessance. This one is just so neutral but pleasant smelling. nan
