I really wanted to like this product, but there were some serious issues I had with it that make it so I can’t recommend.  To begin with, the bottle was completely non-functional for me.  The spout the serum was supposed to come out of did not allow anything to actually come out.  This forced me to open the bottle from the bottom (thankfully I had that option) and slowly pour a small amount into my hand.  After three weeks of use I didn’t notice any difference in my fine lines or beginnings of wrinkles.  There was not sluffing off phase and my skin didn’t look any different from when I first started.  It did not absorb well and tended to clump easily once applied to my skin.  I will say, though, that the smell of the serum is quite lovely. Was Hoping for Better
