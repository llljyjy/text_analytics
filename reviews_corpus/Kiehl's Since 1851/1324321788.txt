I love this essence! I’m on my second bottle right now because I can’t get enough of it. I use this every night and wake up to smooth, hydrated and glowing skin. It doesn’t break me out but it does have a funky smell which is probably the ferulic acid. The smell doesn’t last long and with the smell of my moisturizer and night oil after, it’s fine. I know it’s quite pricy but it lasts forever so definitely worth it. nan
