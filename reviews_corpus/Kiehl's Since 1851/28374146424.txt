I love this Retinol Fast Release Wrinkle-Reducing Night Serum from Kiehl’s. I really wish I’d have started using a retinol in my 20s but can’t go back now. It’s important to me that I’m using one now that’s not cheap and has top quality ingredients. I absolutely love the fact that Kiehl’s is now offering this in a way that it can be activated when you are ready to. So I can have more than one in hand and not worry about it going bad, just activate it when I’m ready. I had no negative effects from this product, not one! It put my previous brand to shame! My 36 year old fine lines around my eyes needed this more than I realized! I would definitely recommend anyone try this! I love this!
