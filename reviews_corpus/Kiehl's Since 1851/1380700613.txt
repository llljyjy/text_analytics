Wow! I’m in love! I’m such a skincare junkie (hence my account name) and can honestly say that I have tried an estimated 80% of skincare products on this site (obviously not many with super low reviews). I have a very extensive skincare routine because I love taking care of my skin, for both the results and the process. I use a lot of actives so it takes something quite amazing to wow me….and this product did! It is amazing at producing both quick results and shockingly even more results as the day(s) go on. I did get some slight redness after applying but that subsided when using an anti-redness serum or cream as my last layer. I’ve actually stopped using those extra products after the first couple uses due to fact that this product contains ceramides and peptide in the product which really help with irritation that can occur with most retinol products. If you’re sensitive or don’t use a lot of actives I would definitely do a spot/patch test and if all goes well w that then introduce it once a week until you build up some tolerance to the product. I use it 2 times a week because I do like to use other more gentle actives on the in between days.“  I definitely recommend this product. 10/10 AMAZING! Be prepared to fall in love…
