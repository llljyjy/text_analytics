I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. I can say I like it, but I have not seen much difference in fine lines and wrinkles. To be fair, I have only been using this for about a month. I have dry skin and my face can be temperamental at times. I experienced no irritation, dryness, or flaking. This is a yellow, thin, watery fluid. Before your first use you will have to mix the powder capsule into the liquid. The directions were easy to follow. After application it dries quickly with no residue or stickiness. Some pilling did occur depending on what I used after but it was very rare. There is no scent. Even though I did not see a difference in fine lines, my face just looked better, even toned and healthier to me. I also feel like my skin is smoother and softer with less redness. I only use retinol at night and that is when I use Kiehlâ€™s Fast-Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum. I probably will purchase another bottle when I run out. I would also recommend this for someone looking for a night serum with retinol. nan
