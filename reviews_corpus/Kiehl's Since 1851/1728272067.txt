I loved the idea behind this product.  The retinol comes as a separate powder that you mix into the serum after purchase, so that it is freshly activated.  This should give it the maximum effectiveness!  It makes sense.  I opened it, read the instructions three times to  make sure that my spastic mind took it all in, and then followed the directions perfectly.  Then POOF I was covered in yellow powder.  I tried putting the bottom back on and following the instructions again.  Still, POOF, yellow powder.  Defeated, I kept the remaining yellow powder in an air tight dish, and each night I have put some serum in my hand, touched a finger to it, dipped the finger into the powder, stirred that finger into the serum in my hand, and then applied it to my face.  I have to say that my normally oily patches of skin are gone.  I’m not dry.  My skin is silky.  It’s fabulous.  I don’t know that I see wrinkle reduction or feel more elastic, but the oily patch reduction on it’s own is enough for me to love this product.  I have struggled with oily patches since I was a teen.  I’m 39.  I’ve used prescription products to help and they haven’t done a thing.  This fixed the oily spots in a week. Three weeks later, I’m still not dried out, and I haven’t reverted to oily.  It’s beautiful.  I would recommend giving it a try.  Everyone reacts to Retinol differently and this one is obviously potent and one of the more effective over the counter retinol products on the market. I’ll be buying more for sure. Great Product/Concept, Super Messy!
