I have combination skin, that is very dry in the cheeks and nose area but ever so slightly oily in the forehead and chin area (however that is rare as those areas are more ’normal’). I wasn’t sure about this face cream, as it seemed heavy and I’m used to serum/gel type consistency facial moisturizers, as I can sometimes be acne prone. While other brands, such as aqaubomb caused major breakouts, this facial cream is a dream. I have not had any issues other than perhaps applying too much due to not being used to heavier creams. Once I figured out a tiny pea size was enough (compared to a bean size of gel moisturizers) my skin seemed to thank me, especially in the harsh winter weather that occurs in Canada. I received a trial size in one of the Sephora favourites bags and am considering buying the full size once I run out, which the tiny trial size seems to be lasting forever! I also have yet to experience any issues with the cream. Highly recommend to my dry/combo skin types! Pleasantly surprised, skin loves it!
