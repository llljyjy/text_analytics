Ok so I’ve been using this night cream for the past three weeks and at first I wasn’t so sure about it. It felt like it was too light for my combination skin. I wanted to give it a fair shot so I kept using it and after a week my skin was feeling so moisturized! If you’re expecting a thick heavy cream, this isn’t it. It’s super lightweight which makes it so much better in my opinion since night creams can be so incredibly oily and heavy. This gives me excellent moisture and after three weeks my skin feels hydrated, bright, and healthy! I’m excited to see if it starts improving some fine lines with continuous use. It’s lightly scented and does not disturb my skin when I’ve used it with Retinol. I definitely recommend this one! don’t give up! give it a chance!
