I purchased this product because it was recommended to me by a Sephora employee when I asked for a recommendation for a deeply hydrating moisturizer that won’t break me out. She was right! It was very nice on my oily/acne prone skin. I could use it morning and evening because it had a nice balance between heavy and light- just how I like a cream to feel. Only reason I won’t be buying again is it’s just too expensive for what it is. It didn’t last very long and I’ve used drugstore products that work just as well. Not Worth the Price
