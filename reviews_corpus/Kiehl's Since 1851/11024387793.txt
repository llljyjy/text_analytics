I love this. Iâ€™ve been using it for years. I get very dry skin around my eyes in the winter and it always feels so moisturizing and leaves me glowing! The key is the application -- it is important to rub the cream between two finger pads until it becomes a watery, oily texture before applying it to the eye area. It is demonstrated in the video. Looks great under concealer. nan
