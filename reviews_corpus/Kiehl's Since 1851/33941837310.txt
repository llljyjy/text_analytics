This eye cream is unlike any other I have tried, and I have been trying different eye creams forever. I have a whole drawer of eye creams. This eye cream is unbelievably creamy, and smooths on like silky butter. Using this religiously for weeks, I have noticed a dramatic change in my undereye area. It is, of course, very hydrating and moisturizing. It feels like my eyes are having a spa day. But, it seems to diminish the dark circles and the creases under my eyes. It must be due to the key ingredients in this eye cream, the vitamin C, which brightens, lightens, and tightens, and hyaluronic acid, the most moisturizing ingredient we have currently in the market. And this product contains both! This is the perfect eye cream. The BEST eye cream, ever.
