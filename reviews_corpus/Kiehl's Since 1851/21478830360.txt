I’ve almost never leave a review, but in this case I wanna say laud, cause it’s an amazing product. I’m using this cream for about 10 nights now and I definitely can say that I see visible changes. In the morning my skin looks so healthy, plumped, rested and nourished. Skin is so silky, I wanna tach my face again and again. Comparatively with other creams I like that this one absorbs really quickly and no greasy. I have an issue especially with night creams - in 90% cases cream rolls off face, does no matter what is it super fancy, professional or expensive cream. This one is a real cloud for my skin, fits all my needs for night recovery. I’m 32 so as of now I don’t have lots of wrinkles and the fine lines aren’t deep. Can’t say if the product will work at aged skin. My fav night cream so far
