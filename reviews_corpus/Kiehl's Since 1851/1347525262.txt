I was excited to try this product.  I like the concept of mixing it so you know it is fresh, however, in practice, this is not the best.  Even after considerable shaking, the powder did not fully dissolve.  It’s better now a few weeks later but it does make the initial applications a bit gritty.  I’m also not blown away by the results so far.  This is one of many things I rotate in so I’m trying to use it more consistently to see if there’s a noticeable difference but so far nothing super impressive. It’s fine
