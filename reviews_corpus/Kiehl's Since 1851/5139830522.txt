I have been using Kiehl’s Retinol Fast-Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum for a little over a month and have noticed a big difference in my overall skin texture and firmness. A little of this serum goes a long way. You only need to apply about a pea size amount. It is lightweight and doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky or tacky. Great new product
