This has such a rich and balm-like feel to it. It’s very moisturizing and feels so nice applying it to my under eye area, crows feet, and brow bone. I’m not sure if it’s helping with any discoloration but it provides very nice moisture which in turn helps the eye area look more plumped and awake. Nice!
