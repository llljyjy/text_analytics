I received this full size bottle of Kiehl’s Dark Spot Corrector from BzzAgent in exchange for a review. The first photo is before and the second one is after using this product for 4 months. I have not noticed any reduction or lightening of my dark spot. Before using this product I tried the Rodan and Fields Dark Spit Corrector and saw no change either. Kiehl’s Dark Spot Corrector was a no go for me!
