Absolutely love this moisturizer! It has been a staple in my skincare regimen for as long as I can remember. I have very dry skin due to medication and need something hydrating enough that won’t clash with my makeup. That’s why I love the Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream! It goes on smoothly and seems to melt into my skin. I don’t need to use a lot to cover my entire face. I use it morning and night and sometimes inbetween if I’m feeling extra dry. An added bonus is that it doesn’t break me out at all. In fact, it’s one of the gentlest moisturizers I’ve ever used. I also love that there is no overwhelming scent. Hands down my favorite moisturizer. I live in California, though, and don’t suffer through dry winters, so I’m not sure how this will fare in colder climates. It’s thick enough for me to keep my skin hydrated all year long. Highly recommend it for fellow sensitive and dry skin sufferers! My Holy Grail Moisturizer!
