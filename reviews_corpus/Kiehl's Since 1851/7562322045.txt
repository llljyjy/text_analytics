Kiehl’s is my first skincare brand that I bought for myself. I like the fact that this brand started as  a pharmacy and the products revolves around botanical and herbal products and, of course, you can’t miss Mr. Bone.I am a fan of midnight recovery concentrate..so I was very excited to try this cream. It’s an awesome night cream. I love the texture and the lavender smell when I opened the bottle. The reason that I’m only giving it 4 star is because I don’t think it’s not a light weight cloud cream. It is, however, lighter than the usual night cream. The ingredients for this cream consist of omega fatty acid to strengthen lipid layer, botanical blends that is rich in antioxidant, treating dull skin, dryness and fine lines, and squalane to boost absoption. My skin gets dry very easier so I always need to have a full blown ritual before going to bed. However, this cream was able to keep me hydrated till morning and my skin feels fresh and rejuvenated. nan
