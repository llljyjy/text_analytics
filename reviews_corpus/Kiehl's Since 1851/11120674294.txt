So I thought my issues are worse then they appear to me. As much I want to correct what I think is wrong, this just isn’t doing it for me. Not saying it won’t work for someone else, it just didn’t work for me. It does have a nice texture and it’s easy to apply. You really don’t need much. It doesn’t leave any greasy residue. I didn’t know a difference in my appearance. nan
