When I got this, I thought about not using it because it has salicylic acid, which has always made me break out (and not just purging). I decided to risk it, and maybe because this actually has “buffered” salicylic acid, it didn’t make me break out. I didn’t love that there was some fragrance in it. I also knew the vitamin c in it wouldn’t do much because the product comes in a clear bottle. The serum feels nice, but after weeks of using it pretty much every morning, I’m not sure it made a difference in the brightness of my. I will continue to use it till it’s gone, but I won’t get it again. It’s way too pricy to buy without seeing any results Not sure it made a difference
