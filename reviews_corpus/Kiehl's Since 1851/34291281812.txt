Applied as directed using the four dot method of brow bone, eyelid, outer corner and under eye. It is a bit sticky to touch, unlike most eye creams I have previously tried but once applied it absorbs quickly into the skin.   I have puffy under eye bags and fines lines and have tried several eye products. I used Kiehl’s for one week both morning and evening.  It definitely helped with the dryness around my eyes and brightened up my dark under eye area. I would highly recommend this eye cream. Kiehl’s Multi Corrective Eye Cream
