I wanted to love this product, but it wasn’t for me. I used this whole tub up and didn’t realize it wasn’t doing anything until I bought a different eye cream. It gave me milia bumps under my eyes and they went away after I switched products. Loved the thickness of the product, but thats the only thing it was good for. Doesn't do anything
