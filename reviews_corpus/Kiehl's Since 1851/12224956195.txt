I received this product to try and review.  I used it for over a month.  I am the first to admit I’m a skin care addict and have tried a lot of eye creams from inexpensive to very expensive and from organic/natural to non-organic.  In the past year my skin has aged quite a bit especially around my eyes and I also naturally have very noticeable dark circles.  I’ve been using this eye cream for about a week morning and night, which isn’t really very long but here are my results so far:The Good:•	This eye cream has a nice consistency and goes on so smoothly. Its touted as being light but it feels more substantial than any eye cream I have used and you only need a very small amount. It isn’t heavy but maybe because it’s a gel creme the consistency just feels rich and luxurious.   •	I can feel my skin absorbing it quickly and the skin around my eyes just feels better.  Yes, it feels softer and looks smoother but overall, the skin around my eyes just feels better. I’ve never had my skin feel like this from a product.    •	In the few days I have been using this eye cream, the wrinkles under my eyes are less noticeable and my concealer goes on smoother and looks better. •	It helped with the under eye puffiness I have when I wake up in the morning.  •	It’s Paraben-free and fragrance-free which is ideal as many fragrances make my eyes water.   Considerations•	I have very dark circles so I didn’t see any brightening effect.  Maybe if I didn’t have such dark circles, I would have seen this benefit.     •	I did not notice any brow bone lifting benefits.Overall, it is one of the best eye creams I have ever used and I have probably used hundreds in my lifetime.  So, I would not only recommend this eye cream to my friends and family but would buy it for myself. Feels rich and luxurious
