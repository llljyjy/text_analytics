I swear by Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate Moisturizing Face Oil & was so excited to see they expanded their line to include a night cream! My favorite nights to use the Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream are when my skin needs some calming & nourishing TLC. Whether you’ve overdone it with chemical exfoliants or you forgot to reapply your SPF, this overnight moisturizer has your back! This beautiful baby blue colored cream feels lightweight with its cloud-like whipped texture & absorbs easily. It is made with moisturizing botanicals infused with Omega 3 & 6 Oils & Fatty Acids that’ll gently repair & rejuvenate your skin over night, while the natural scent of lavender lulls you to sleep. You’ll wake up with visibly calmer, glowing, plump, hydrated skin thanks to the addition of its olive-derived Squalane. I wouldn’t reccomend layering this moisturizer with too many products, no more than just your toner &/or essence is needed. This night cream has everything your skin needs to replenish & strengthen its moisture barrier. Plus, some products may cause pilling depending on their ingredients. I like to mix a couple drops of their recovery oil just because I like it so much & my dry, dehydrated skin can handle it. Calming & Nourishing
