This product is activated with pure retinol infused powder that you mix upon opening the serum. The application of the serum was smooth, but the product watery, unlike others that I have seen. The product has no smell with a smooth texture. Unlike other products, there was no stickiness to this serum. Result to the pure retinol on this product it was a visibly smoothing confirming this to my skin. Other retinol products in the past have caused redness to my skin after use, I did not experience this at all with this product. This is definitely a product I will continue to use and recommend to my friends. nan
