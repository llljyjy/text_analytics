I was originally introduced to this product about 5 years ago when I received a sample after purchasing the Avocado eye cream. At the time I did not feel like facial oils would do my spot-prone-combo skin any favors, but I decided to give it a whirl and applied this oil alone after cleansing. I was pretty pumped that after it went on it almost disappeared and performs like a dry oil. It didnâ€™t leave my skin greasy, although it did give a nice glow. I love the scent of lavender and the overall strength of the fragrance is quite subtle. My skin can be sensitive and reactive so I was happy this did not cause any sort of flare up. The next morning I was absolutely floored at how clear, bright and luminous my skin was after ONE use. I was hooked. This oil never breaks me out, never makes my skin oily and always imparts gorgeous, fresh and awake looking skin in the morning. After continued use it faded old acne scars, brightened my overall complexion, added moisture and smoothed out my texture akin to buttery soft velvet. I now use it before a night moisturizer after toner and retinol and I donâ€™t think I ever want to be without it. Do You Believe in Magic? ðŸŽµ
