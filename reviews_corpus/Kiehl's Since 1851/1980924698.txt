I’M IN LOVE WITH THIS TONER! I never used to think that toner was necessary in my skincare routine until I tried this toner!! I use it after I cleanse my face and before my serum and moisturizer and it’s sooo gentle and leaves my skin feeling so plump and moisturized. The fragrance is also very subtle and there are no ingredients in this that breaks me out! And I have very sensitive skin. 10/10 would recommend and I will most definitely be repurchasing. I’M IN LOVE!
