I was introduced to this product a few weeks ago. I was very excited to try. Kiehl’s is a very known brand! I have always struggled with dark circles my whole life. I thought this product would do me some justice! Unfortunately, my dark circles are hereditary. However, one thing I liked about the serum is the consistency, it’s so silky smooth. It didn’t irritate my eyes which is wonderful! I just wished it worked for me! Kiehl's vitamin C Dark Circle Serum
