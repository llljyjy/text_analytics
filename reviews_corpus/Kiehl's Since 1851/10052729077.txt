I really like this facial cream. My face tends to get very dry in the winter, and this cream does a very good job providing moisture over night, and throughout the day. The texture is light, and absorbs easily into my skin without leaving an oily residue. I have been using this in place of my previous moisturizer ( Cetaphil moisturizing lotion) and I think I like this one more, as the hydration lasts longer. I will be repuchaing this to use in my night time routine. Great facial cream!
