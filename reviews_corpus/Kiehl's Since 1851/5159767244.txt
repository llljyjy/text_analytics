This product felt good and it definitely did lake my skin feel soft and smooth. I didn’t notice it having any real effect on anything other than texture after a month but then I am used to a much stronger retinol. I would reccomend this to someone who is just getting started on retinol as a good starting point. My only real criticism is that the packaging isn’t user friendly. When you first get it you have to mix the ingredients and there is no real way to tell that you have gotten all of the retinol powder into the serum. nan
