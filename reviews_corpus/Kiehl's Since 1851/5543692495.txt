The new Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream has proven to be a great product. The formula was the very first thing I noticed. I was a bit skeptical, because it is so moisturizing that is appears nearly serum like. However, I was so pleased by how fast absorbing this eye cream is! I love the gel like formula! I was worried that by using it in my morning routin I would fight makeup transfer or melting. Definitely not! It absords so well and has nearly immediate results. I’m definitely looking more well rested and the sensitive skin around my eyes has much less of that crepey like texture! I tend to have puffy and dark under eyes. I’m truly noticing a difference! I Can’t wait to see the results in my fine lines. I love that the Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream contains Niacinamide and Collagen Peptides for anti-aging and under-eye brightening. The multi zone eye work out that Keihl’s has included is a good addition for added benefits! The work out covers the brow bone, eyelid, outer eye corners, and the under-eye areas. Good ingredients and recyclable packaging is always an added benefit. I only wish the price point was a bit more reachable for everyone. I would consider purchasing it again. Splurging on this would certainly be a worthy treat. Awesome
