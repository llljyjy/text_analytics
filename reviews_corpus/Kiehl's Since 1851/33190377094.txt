Having suffered from acne most of my life, I have several visible scars, dark spots, and discolorations on my face and chest. I was hoping Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution would help lighten those up, but after a few months of daily use with my normal skincare routine, I am not noticing any significant improvement. I have tried other dark spot solutions in the past and they didn’t seem to help much at all either. It’s a shame because I was really hoping it would work, but at this point, I’m just starting to think it’s a lost cause. Not Quite Sure It Actually Works
