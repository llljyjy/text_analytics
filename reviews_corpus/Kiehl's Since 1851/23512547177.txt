I’ve been a user of this product (on and off) for at least 7 years. Purchased this in July and in October I started to notice gross blue fluids from the large sized container. Very disappointed. Wrote to Kiehl’s customer service and they got back to Oct. 11. It is now Oct. 21 and I haven’t heard of them since. Why bother buying a large one when it’s going to go gross within three months of using? No explanations given. Would stay away moving forward… Sorry I had to leave it here but it’s very disappointing from a company you’ve been using from for over 10+ years (across other products) to have such customer service.
