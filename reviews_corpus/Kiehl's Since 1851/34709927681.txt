I received this free and have been using it twice a day for 2 months. I noticed surprisingly quick results - my eye bags and hyperpigmentation got noticeably smaller/ lighter in about 2 weeks. However, I haven’t noticed continued improvement. It has a nice smooth, non- oily texture that makeup applies well over - no piling or creasing. I will continue to use it before makeup application until I run out. However, I’ll stick with The Inkey List, The Ordinary, and Tree of Life BeautyVitamin C eye creams/ serums once I do because they’re less than half the price and work similarly well.  The only time I normally use an eye cream/ serum is if my regular serum/ moisturizer is too heavy or too strong for the eye area or if I’m applying eye makeup and concealer and want to ensure there’s no interaction between the product and the makeup. No filters were used in my photos / no “selfie mode“ enhancements. I’m 38 and have lifelong very sensitive/ reactive skin that often gets hives/ rashes from products and this one didn’t cause any sensitivity. Overall it’s a nice, luxurious product and if you have the money to spend, I really enjoyed it but I think there are similar products that work as well for much less $ though they don’t have as nice packaging or as luxurious of a feel. Oh, and it’s free of added fragrances which is a plus in my book as far as eye creams go. Good product but spendy. Others as good for less
