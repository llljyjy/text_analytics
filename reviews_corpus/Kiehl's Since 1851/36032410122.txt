I have tried many products over the years specifically for the eye area and I can honestly say that Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream with Niacinamide & Collagen Peptide is the absolute BEST product I have used. Not only were there results that were visible almost instantly, the best results were when I woke up the next morning!!! My fine lines and crows feet were nonexistent! The skin around my eyes appeared fresh and moisturized! This product did not irritate my eyes at all, which most other products have no matter how careful I am when applying! This is the first product by Kiehl’s that I have ever used and I am beyond pleased at the results! I will definitely be looking for other products in this line. IMPRESSIVE RESULTS!!! Definitely worth trying!
