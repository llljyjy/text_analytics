Was very happy to be chosen to test this product out. I have tried some body care products from this brand in the past, but never facial care products.  I am a RN and work 12hr nights and everyone at work noticed a difference but couldnâ€™t put their finger in it till I told them what I had been using. They stayed I looked more refreshed and the under eye darkness was gone. Some even said I looked a little younger, was very happy to hear that as I am 42yo.  Lol. The product goes on smooth, is not greasy and no odor. Amazing
