I love Kiehlâ€™s line in general, and this new mask is no exception. It has a thick balmy-buttery texture. As you apply it, it melts and becomes a nice rich moisturizer. This jar will probably last me forever because you really need only a dime amount. I like that it has no added fragrance. After you apply it, your face does not feel greasy or heavy. It hydrates and protects my skin especially well now that it is cold and windy outside. Highly recommend! One of the best masks!
