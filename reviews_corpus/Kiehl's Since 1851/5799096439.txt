I have had roughly about a month and half to test this cream and OH-My-GAWD!! It’s so moisturizing, no joke, the area around my eyes feels so nurtured and I know that with time the Niacinamide will deliver so I am very excited to continue using it for a long while. My eye area has been so dry since I entered my 30’s and am always looking for a good eye cream which I hadn’t found til now. I’m a very happy camper right now and definitely recommend this to everyone. It is bot greasy at all and it dully abaorbs by the time you have to start doing your makeup. Y’all have to try this Best eye treatment hands down.
