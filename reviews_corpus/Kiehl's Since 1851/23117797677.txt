I received the Kiehl’s dark spot solution free from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review. I was excited to try this product as I’ve had dark spots on my for awhile now (likely due to sun exposure or aging skin). This dark spot serum has been good for lightening the dark spots pretty well. It does take a few weeks to start working his magic but after that it makes your skin feel so renewed again. The serum does have a light scent to it, but it goes away pretty quick after putting it on your skin. I do recommend it! nan
