I really like kielâ€™s clearly corrective dark spot solution. I have noticed a big difference in my skintone. My skin is soft, skintone is even, darkspots and redness are gone. Easy to apply. Does not feel sticky on skin and absorbs into skin quickly. My mother and sister n law have already purchased a bottle after seeing my skin. The packaging is nice, the dropper is good quality. I recieved this item from bzzagent in exchange for my honest review. Skintone is even,darkspots & redness gone.
