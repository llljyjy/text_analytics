I really like this eye cream. I have very sensitive skin, particularly around my eyes, but this cream doesn’t irritate my skin/eyes at all. I haven’t seen any life-changing results in terms of fine lines or under eye darkness, but it does a good job of moisturizing and makeup seems to apply well over it! Amazing
