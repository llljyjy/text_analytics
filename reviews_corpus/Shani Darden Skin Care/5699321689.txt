I received this CLEANSING SERUM complimentary from Shani Darden in exchange for my honest review.  This serum-like cleanser is lightweight and produces a lovely amount of lather. I have dry combination skin and hormonal acne. This serum cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean and soft without tightness or dryness. It contains sodium hyaluronate and oat bran extract to help hydrate and protect my skinâ€™s moisture barrier. I love that I can use this cleanser alone or as a second cleanse with no irritation or excess dryness. My skin feels silky and hydrated after cleansing even before applying any other skincare. I definitely recommend this cleanser to anyone with dry or dehydrated skin. nan
