This wand reminds me of a mini massage gun, except for the face. I do not see any difference in my face. Which makes it hard for me to justify the price point of this product. I do like that it comes with a booklet for proper morons in certain facial areas, itâ€™s own charging cord, and the second attachment though. nan
