I’ve been using this exfoliating serum every other night in my nighttime skincare routine for the past two weeks, and I’m really liking my results so far! I struggle with monthly hormone acne and hyperpigmentation, and I’ve found it’s doing an excellent job fading my spots, and quickly! My skin is so bright and clear when I wake up in the morning, and so smooth. I’m a big fan and will be getting another! nan
