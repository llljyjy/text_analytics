This is a really cool tool to add to your skincare routine. It feels great on the face, I personally also use it on my neck as well for wrinkles and relaxation. I don’t have a ton of wrinkles but some deep set neck lines and a few on my forehead as well. There’s some immediate plumping action that is quite nice but I’ll have to use this for a while to see if there are lasting results. The gel it comes with is really nice but I think you can use just about any hydrating serum with some slip. The downside is that it is VERY expensive. Honestly, a great tool if you have the money for it! Great Addition!
