I was excited to try this one of a kind facial tool. I love that it has different settings and attachments. It does provide fast results for me in the morning. It helps to get rid of puffiness and tone my jawline. It is important to read the manual before using the tool for effective results. My skin feels refreshed and toned and ready for all the skincare products. Great tool!
