I thought using the facial sculpting wand would be a lot of work to add into my everyday routine but it only takes a few minutes! I read the instructions and watched the video just once and was able to do it on my own since then. I like using it right after I wash my face when it’s dry since it can get stuck on the hydra gel or facial serums if you don’t use a lot. My skin doesn’t pull when it’s just dry. It’s super relaxing to use and I think it’s definitely helping me with preventing wrinkles. Relaxation
