Great product. I am new to skincare and the past few months my cheeks have been rosier than normal, as well as the pores look more noticeable. I’m not sure if it’s the weather causing my skin to act up, hormones, or what… but this product has been helping keep things in check. I hope that this trend continues as we begin entering the warmer months. This is a great starter, simple product that really does work, at least for me. I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. Opinions are my own. nan
