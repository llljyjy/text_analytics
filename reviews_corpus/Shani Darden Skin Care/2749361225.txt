It’s a really good product. It didn’t irritate my skin and my skin definitely looks better after using it. We love us a gentle retinol. The packaging is really chic also and the consistency of the product is perfect. I received for free but I would repurchase. I received the product as a free sample in exchange for my honest opinion. it’s great
