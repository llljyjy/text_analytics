I gave the Shani Darden LACTIC ACID EXFOLIATING SERUM a chance because I was looking for a solution for my dark spots. The consistency is light and there is no fragrance which I appreciate. The formula is non-sticky and left my skin glowing after a couple of uses. I noticed my dark spots improved considerably after two weeks. Great for dark spots
