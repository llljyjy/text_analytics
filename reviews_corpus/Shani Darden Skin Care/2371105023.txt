This is my first time trying a product with lactic acid and I am very pleased with the results. At first I was a bit hesitant because of my dry skin thinking the lactic acid might dry my skin even more but that was not the case. I apply the serum at night after my toner and stack it with a rich moisturizer and I wake up with glowing skin. After the first week of using it consistently, I even noticed that some blemishes went away and I no longer feel the need to wear a full coverage foundation. I simply apply a CC cream and concealer. Wake up with glowing skin!
