So good! First of all the packaging and components are so chic and sleek which I like. But as far as the product itself, I felt results immediately. Then I starting seeing the results in about two weeks as I incorporated it into my usual skincare routine. Itâ€™s like a new skin effect. I did find it to dry my skin a bit but I just bumped up on my moisturizer and it was fine. Perfect timing also, certainly prepped my skin for my wedding, that glow came in full force! Definitely a great product, highly recommended! Yasssss!
