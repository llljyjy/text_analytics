This is one of the best eye creams I’ve ever used and I don’t say that lightly. One of my biggest skin concerns is dark under eye circles and I also have smile and find lines under my eyes. This has helped brighten the area and reduce their appearance after 2 weeks of daily use (am and pm). I love the texture- it’s a bit on the thicker side than what I’d expect from an eye cream. No fragrance. Absorbs quickly. It’s truly a delight to use! I’m impressed
