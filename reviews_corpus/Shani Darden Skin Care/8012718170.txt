I received this product for free on Influenster and I have been testing this on my skin for several weeks.  I’ve seen a pretty big change in the dark spots on my face. They have become dramatically lighter and my skin is overall brighter. I love that this retinol formula has other great ingredients in it like Lactic Acid, Niacinamide and Aloe. I’m very glad that I was able to try this product and I will definitely be repurchasing. Great product
