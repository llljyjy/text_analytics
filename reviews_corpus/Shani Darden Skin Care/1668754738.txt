I received Shani Darden retinol reform complimentary to test and review from Influenster.  My concerns with skin currently is fine lines and  uneven skin tone. ‘Ive heard about Shani Darden but never tried it. I ve used products with retinol but I wanted to give this one a chance.  Let me tell I loved this product.  Right out the gate I noticed my skin was softer after about 2 weeks I began to see a difference in my skin, less line , and brighter healthy looking.  Plus it didn’t hurt that strangers were asking me about my skincare routine. They loved the way my skin looked.  I could one use twice a week because of my sensitive skin but that was okay.  My skin tone is beginning to even out as well. My skin reacted very well to Retinol Reform!  I am very happy with my the results so far. The fine line eraser
