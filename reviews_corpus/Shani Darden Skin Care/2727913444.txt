After using this moisturizer for a few weeks now, I can definitely give it 5 stars! I opt for lighter moisturizers in the summer and my go to has been summer fridays cloud dew oil free gel cream moisturizer for years. Although I still love that product, I get antsy and start trying new things! This is the first light moisturizer that has been as good, if not better, than my OG. It is so smooth, hydrating, and absorbs quickly.  I will need to switch to a richer moisturizer soon, as I have fairly dry skin, but for a daily, non-greasy, one, I would highly recommend this product. A great, silky, daily moisturizer
