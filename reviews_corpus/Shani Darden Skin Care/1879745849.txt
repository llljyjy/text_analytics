I have been using this lactic acid serum for about a week now and have seen a difference in my skin! I use it nightly, after cleanser and toner and before moisturizer. It has definitely improved the texture of my skin and reduced the uneven tone as well. The lactic acid is not too harsh on my skin which I like. Every morning I wake up with smoother, more glowy skin. Would definitely recommend! I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. Skin feels smoother with less redness!
