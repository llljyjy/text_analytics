I’ve heard lots about Shani Darden skincare and was given the chance to work with the brand before, however I wasn’t fond of the customer service I received. Which is a huge bummer because the products are expensive and do work well. However. I have seen plenty of issues with the creator of the brand and how she recommended using ingredients and products. The package came and was beautifully wrapped, which made me excited about the product. Unfortunately, it was too abrasive on my skin. Nope
