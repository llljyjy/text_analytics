Just in the little bit of time I have used this Retinol formula, I can see some changes happening. I have some pretty deep creases (a.ka. wrinkles) that need some extra attention, but if you’re consistent, and dedicated.....I could see the potential outcome continuing this product. The fragrance isn’t over powering and it is extremely lightweight. I did receive Shani Darden’s retinol skin care as a complimentary trial run, but I plan on making it part of my regular skin care routine. What wrinkles??
