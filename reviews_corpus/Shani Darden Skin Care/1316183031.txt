After using this product a handful of times over two weeks, I am impressed. The changes are subtle, but my skin feels softer, my pores look smaller, and my face is overall smoother. The redness around my nose has also improved and my sunspot appears lighter. I’m not crazy about the scent but it’s mild enough and goes away quickly when dry. The serum isn’t sticky and layers well with moisturizer. Gentle and effective
