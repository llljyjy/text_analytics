When I tell you that this is one of my top five skincare products ever, I mean it!I’ve been using this since it first launched and have gone through more bottles than I care to admit. The texture is incredibly lightweight and the formula, while exfoliating, is so hydrating. Your skin won’t peel or flake, but looks visibly radiant overnight.It layers well under the rest of your skincare and does not exasperate my psoriasis.You might notice a bit of purging, but listen, after a month, it stop.This is worth every single last penny!! I Cannot Live Without It
