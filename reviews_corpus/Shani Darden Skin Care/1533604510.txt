Well I’m impressed! First box box ever and I am digging that it was free and it actually works. I’ve used it for a week now. It is a sheer easily absorbed yellow serum that sinks right in. No annoying smell is a plus! My makeup is applying smoothly since starting to use this at bedtime! Try it at the store as they give samples! You won’t be sorry. It is gentle also! My sensitive skin didn’t cry! Please never discontinue this!!!
