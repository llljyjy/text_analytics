Shani Darden gifted me their Lactic Acid Serum in exchange for my thoughts. The Lactic Acid Serum includes 9% lactic acid, to remove dead skin and reveal bright, smooth, glowing skin. Gluconolactone (PHA) evens out complexion through exfoliation while clarifying & hydrating. A Soothing Complex comprised of Aloe Vera, Green and White Tea extracts in addition to four molecular weights of HA soothe skin and reduce irritation. I have been surprised to find such immediate results, with my skin appearing more radiant, plump, hydrated, and smooth in just one week. My skin favors Lactic Acid products so I have tried several, and this one is, for me, superior. Despite the rather high percentage, it hasnâ€™t caused irritation, which is why I will continue using this in place of my previous lactic acid product. I am truly excited to try more Shani Darden products now, as this one has been such a success for me! Excellent & Effective!
