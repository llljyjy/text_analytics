Got this for my wife. She has used other retinol products in the past, but this was her first time trying Retinol Reform. She really liked it and will continue using it.She has combo skin, which tends to be sensitive, and she used this in her normal nightly skin routine. She had no reaction and said her skin feels very soft and smooth in the morning. I agree, it looks great!We recommend it! Shani Darden is the Real Deal
