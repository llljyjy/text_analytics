Sahni Darden gifted me Lactic Acid Exfoliating Serum in exchange for my honest review.  It comes in a sleek white pump bottle. At night after cleansing I use a few pumps and gently apply to my face with my fingers. It is a serum and has a liquid texture thicker than water. Next I wait 5 minutes for the product to absorb and dry before applying moisturizer. It is imperative to use sunscreen the next day (and everyday) since freshly exfoliated skin is more sensitive to sun exposure. It is recommended to use this product once or twice a week. It is not recommended to use exfoliating products on the same nights you use retinol products.  The serum has no scent which is a huge plus for me.  It gently exfoliates the skin with 9% lactic acid (AHA) and Gluconolactone (PHA).  This helps to brighten dull skin and give it a nice glow.  It also contains hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, green and white tea to soothe skin and help minimize irritation.  I did not experience any irritation, but my skin is not very sensitive.  My skin has a nice glow in the morning after use and feels refreshed and wonderful. nan
