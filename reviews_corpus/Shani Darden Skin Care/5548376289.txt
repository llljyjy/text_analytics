I’m nearly done with the sample, and overall liked this product - it was light and gentle on my skin and didn’t break me out, which I really appreciated. I have combination skin, and areas where I typically get dry, however - on my cheeks area - I could have used a bit more moisture. I felt like I had to apply extra quantities of this moisturizer to feel like it was doing it’s job and was still left with some dry spots. Wouldn’t purchase, as it’s a bit less moisturizing than I was hoping for, but this one would probably do better used during the day, with a heavier night cream in the pm (I like keeping it simple with just one product, however). My skin looks nice/calm with this product, besides the dry spots, so it’s really pretty good… A bit less moisturizing, but doesn’t break me out
