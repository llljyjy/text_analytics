This wand is worth it if youâ€™re willing to commit the time to using it. It is not a 1 time fix but I can defiantly tell that if you use it properly it will help you in target areas. The wand comes with instructions to guide you and gel to use with it. I do feel tightness in the areas I targeted. I think its worth it. I was impressed and cant wait to see the results over time! A great wand!!
