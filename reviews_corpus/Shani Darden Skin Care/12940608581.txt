I did not think this was going to work that great and I was wrong! I get sun spots and my skin looks rough after being in the sun. The serum faded my sun spots and my skin looked great in the morning. I only used the serum 2-3 days a week for a few weeks. My skin keeps looking better with every use. Works wonders
