I absolutely LOVE this cleanser! That is saying A LOT, because I review beauty products a lot and currently have 3 different cleansers in my rotation. (This one became my da work e though.) It took me by surprise because I already own a serum cleanser, and I like that one, but now as much as this one now. The Shani Darden serum cleanser left my skin so AMAZINGLY silky soft, and bright! I am absolutely addicted and will be buying more! This is my first Shani Darden product, so now I get the hype. For reference, I have kind of sensitive skin, and ITD combo-oily but gets more dry in the cold. I didnâ€™t use it to remove makeup, so not sure how it would perform for tougher makeup, but I wash my face morning and evening, and this is so gentle. LOVE IT!
