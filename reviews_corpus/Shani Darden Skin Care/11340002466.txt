Love this lactic acid! It’s my choice of acid when I want a gentler exfoliant and this one from Shani Darden is perfect! It cause no irritation. I love how I can use this and get smooth, glowy skin almost immediately! With the colder months coming retinol is something I’ll be using very sparingly and this being way gentler is the perfect substitute for me. I love this serum!
