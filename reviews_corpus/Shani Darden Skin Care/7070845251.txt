I received this product from Influenster and Shani Darden for my honest review. I really like the Lactic Acid Serum. I’ve tried other serums in the past but not a lactic acid. I was worried I would break out from a new product but I haven’t had any issues. It is a little sticky when you put it on at first but after it dries It feels smooth. I can feel a little tingling for a minute but nothing extreme. I can see improvements in my skin by brightening and clearing up pores. I would recommend this product! nan
