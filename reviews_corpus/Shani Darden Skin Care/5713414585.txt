I usually use lactic acid and retinol in my skincare routine, so I was excited to try this product that had both ingredients in one product! It is gentle on my skin and did not cause any dryness which is rare for a retinol. I was able to use every day in my routine immediately because my skin was used to the ingredients and it did not irritate my skin at all. Iâ€™m giving it four stars because I did not see a difference in my skin after three weeks and will most likely go back to my old routine because it was more cost effective. Great gentle retinol!
