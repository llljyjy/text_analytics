This is a really cool sculpting wand! I have never used one of these in my life so this would be the first time. I was always curious to know if these tools work and well...they do! With time ofcourse you can see even the littlest of result. The results for me while using this along with the cleanser was seeing how wrinkles in my forehead started to become less prominent and my smile lines look less now as well. This device was also very easy to use and I love the vibrating massage it gives off. This really soothes the tension in my face as well. I have a nerve issue and half the time I can’t move my mouth/jaw in certain ways without my nerves hurting me. This actually helped to relive some of that pain in tension but yes it’s still there. Overall I am really liking this tool and I love how it really is changing my face alonf with my skin. What a great tool
