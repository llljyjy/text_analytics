Received this product, lactic acid exfoliating serum, complimentary by Shani Darden in exchange for an honest review. This product had a very light scent, and I can’t pin point what it reminds me of. It’s not off putting, it’s almost undetectable. The moisturizer is somewhat thick, but my skin loved it. nan
