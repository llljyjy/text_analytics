This is my first product.from this brand and I’m quite impressed!I have dry skin , especially dry in the winter so I was worried this would strip my skin but it DOESN’T! It foams a bit and leaves my skin feeling clean, hydrated and refreshed! I really enjoy it and love the pump packaging! Great Cleanser!
