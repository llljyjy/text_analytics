This is a very rich eye cream. I don’t think you need a lot of it per application. Unfortunately, I am someone with extra sensitive eyes—certain eye shadow, liner, mascara, and eye products in general just seem to bother my eyes more than other people. This was really uncomfortable on my eyes and caused slight irritation to the point I needed to wash it off. Wouldn’t recommend for sensitive eyes
