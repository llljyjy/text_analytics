I love the consistency of this. My skin is fairly resilient so I was able to use this daily from the start.  I have fine lines and some dark spots, I was hoping to see results in the first few weeks but have yet to see any noticeable change on the lines... I do like how it makes my skin feel, definitely smooth and pairs nicely with my other products, but I havenâ€™t seen any real noticeable change in 3 weeks of nightly use. Hoping for results soon?! Feels great but haven't seen results
