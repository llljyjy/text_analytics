Product was gifted by Shani Darden in exchange for my honest review. This is one of the best cleansers Iâ€™ve tried! I love the luxurious gel-like texture. After massaging for a few seconds, it turns into a rich lather. I was happy that this also dissolves makeup while cleansing, eliminating the need to double cleanse. For such an effective  cleanser, it is impressive that it remains gentle to my skin, leaving my face feeling soft and smooth. Love the texture!
