I really enjoy this skincare tool! I’ve found it super effective for lymphatic drainage. It’s definitely very powerful, but helps me manage puffiness. Using every day for a few minutes is really easy to do, and I like how this fits into my routine. I’ve found that using this one prepped skin is really important for helping the tool glide across the skin. Also helps with product absorption! Love how easy it is to clean and that there are two tips included so you can get into the areas you want to target.  I’m excited to keep using to see if I notice any long term benefits. This is definitely an expensive tool, and while I don’t think it’s a need to have, it’s nice to have this in your skincare toolbox! A godsend for puffiness!
