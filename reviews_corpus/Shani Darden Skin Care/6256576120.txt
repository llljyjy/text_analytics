I received this product free to test for an honest review. I personally am not a fan of this serum. I tried it for 2 weeks and found that it made the texture of my skin worse. I have been having tiny bumps show up on my forehead which aren’t quite pimples, but definitely annoying. My chin had been breaking out in large red bumps are are painful and leaving scars. I don’t have an issue with acne, so I contribute it to this product. I have heard that retinol can make your skin purge, but this is not worth it to me when my skincare routine was working before. Before and after photos included (after photo only has eye makeup on, nothing on the skin) not for me
