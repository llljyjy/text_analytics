This is a great product to use if you want to implement retinol in your routine but don’t want the dryness and irritation that comes with it. I can barely tolerate regular retinol but have no issues using this 2-3 times per week. I’ve definitely noticed an improvement in breakouts and smoothness of my skin. The product has a gel like consistency and can be used under makeup. Great product
