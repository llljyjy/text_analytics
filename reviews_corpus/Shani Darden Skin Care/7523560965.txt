This Lactic Acid Exfoliating Serum has really made a difference in the look and feel of my skin.  It is a more watery like serum with no fragrance and I feel it is very gentle too.  I have been using daily for over 2 weeks and I have already noticed fading of my sun spots, shrinking pores and a lot less breakouts.  My skin feels softer and just looks overall brighter and healthier.  My husband has even taken notice as well.  I really like that it has hyaluronic acid and is free from harmful skin irritants like mineral oil, sulfates and parabens, just to name a few.  I will definitely continue this in my daily routine. Great For Oily, Blemish Prone Skin
