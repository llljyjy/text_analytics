So far so good. Super gentle formula. I feel like I could upgrade my usage to more than 2-3x a week. Has a similar consistency to other formulas I’ve tried. I can’t say I notice anything dramatic but with retinol it’s definitely something over time. I like it I have no complaints. Has not irritated my skin. Though the price on this is hefty. super gentle formula
