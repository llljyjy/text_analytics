LOVE this serum. I use it 3x a week with 2 day breaks in between and find itâ€™s gentle and effective this way. I have sensitive and acne prone skin and did break out more when I used it more often, probably because it was too harsh for my skin barrier. But using 3x a week it keeps my skin clear, glowing and smooth. Great when used sparingly
