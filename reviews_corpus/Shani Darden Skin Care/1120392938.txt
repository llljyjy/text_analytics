I have never tried a product with lactic acid in it before but have been using Tret for a while. Even though I have been using Tret consistently for a while now, it still makes me really dry and peely. However, after one night of using this, I woke up the next day with my skin super soft and hydrated. I have been using this consistently for a few weeks now and my skin isn’t dry at all. In fact, it feels visibly softer and smoother each day. One pump of this serum is all I need. It absorbs quickly and feels nice. I have also been doing laser treatments so I can’t say how much this product has contributed to my glow and even texture on its own. However, I’m a huge fan and like that it’s gentle enough to use everyday without making me super dry. works like a charm
