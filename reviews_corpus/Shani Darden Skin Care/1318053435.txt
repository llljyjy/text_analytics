I purchased this after trying a sample and I love it. Lactic Acid is a fantastic ingredient for it brightens, renews skin cells but doesnâ€™t dry out your skin. While the price tag is a little steep, 1-2 pumps is all you need every other night or whenever you want to work it into your routine. This product has already helped to brighten and even my complexion. Recommend and would repurchase. Recommend/Would Repurchase
