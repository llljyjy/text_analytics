What an amazing tool! I absolutely love face massages and I’m happy that I can finally do them at home. This wand lays in the hand perfectly,  is super easy to use and offers different levels of intensity. I use it in the mornings/nights after applying the serum and usually go with medium intensity. It’s not magic and you won’t see all of the fine lines gone after one use, but if you stick to the routine - you will definitely see how your face changes! After a week of everyday use my skin feels a lot more firm, some of the lines became barely visible and the whole structure of face looks more defined. I also use this wand in the mornings when I wake up puffy for a quick refresh.All in all- I’m super happy with the results so far and will continue using the wand everyday, since it’s a great and safe alternative to going for face massages once a month.Highly recommend nan
