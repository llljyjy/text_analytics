I received this product for free on Influenster and I have been testing this on my skin for 4 weeks, 2-3 times a week, as directed. Unfortunately I don’t see or feel much of a difference with pores, texture or fine lines. My skin looks better the next day but that is it. I’m in late 30’s with oily/combo skin, large pores, labial lines and forehead lines. Didn’t see much of a difference.
