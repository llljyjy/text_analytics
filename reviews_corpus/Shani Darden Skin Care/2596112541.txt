I have been using this retinol reform cream for two weeks. I was afraid it would irritate my skin but thankfully I had no redness or irritation (I have used retinols in the past). My skin seems a bit brighter and make up glides on a bit easier. I have no yet noticed any anti-aging properties but time will tell! I must note that I hate the smell of this product and as such removed one star. Brighter Skin, No Irritation
