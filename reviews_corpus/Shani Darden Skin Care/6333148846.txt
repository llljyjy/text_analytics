Shani Darden gifted me this facial sculpting wand and I have really been enjoying using it. It comes with two attachments, primer gel and a charger. The flat attachment is for all over and the rounded smaller attachment is for the eyes and lips area. The shape of the wand makes it really easy to hold and navigate. I also love that it comes with detailed instructions to use! I will definitely continue using this! nan
