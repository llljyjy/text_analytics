This is a really nice lactic acid serum that I feel is pretty gentle on the skin.  Typically I use stronger AHAs and Lactic Acid is great since it’s a step down in terms of strength. I found using this that it was hydrating and didn’t give me any sting I get with AHAs, so I’m going to keep this in my routine.  The packaging is beautiful and my skin was glowing in the morning. nan
