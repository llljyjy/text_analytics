My favorite thing about this is the texture. I love anything that feels like a serum. I’ve been using this in my double cleansing routine, and it’s very effective and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I wish her products weren’t so expensive, but they’re very high quality. The price of this one is comparable to other cleansers on the market. Love the texture
