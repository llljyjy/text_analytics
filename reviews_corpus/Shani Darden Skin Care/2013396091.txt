This facial sculpting wand feels so good to use! It definitely makes my face and neck feel more sculpted and toned but I’ll need to use it more to see long-term benefits. I don’t have many wrinkles but I do have fine lines and some bags where my orbital bone sits so I have confidence it’ll be able to address those main concerns and I love that the attachments are easy to swap out. Great for lymphatic drainage and an overall luxurious self-care experience nan
