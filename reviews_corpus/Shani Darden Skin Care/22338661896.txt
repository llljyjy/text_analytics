I received this complimentary from Shani Darden. I have this serum and eye cream from this brand and next I really want to try the moisturizer. This Lactic Acid Exfoliating Serum is really cool. It soaks in and leaves my skin feeling like velvet. I like that it’s an exfoliant and brighten and refine all in one. This texture is great, and it is not sticky, and it absorbs quickly. I used only a small amount in the morning and at nighttime. I haven’t used this product for very long and I already love it! Starting to see results fast. A must have for my routine.
