This is an EXCELLENT retinol. I have dry and sensitive skin so, I always layer my retinol over my hydrating serum and moisturizer. Then, I lock it in with an oil. This retinol has improved my skin texture. Iâ€™m excited to continue use and see what it does for my fine lines and wrinkles. The packaging is sleek and beautiful. nan
