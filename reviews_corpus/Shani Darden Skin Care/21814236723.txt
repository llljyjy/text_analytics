Gifted by Shani Darde. I was so excited to try this device! I do appreciate that it comes with a manual, I found it very helpful. It shows exactly how you’re supposed to use it and I loved that. You definitely don’t want to apply any pressure while using it, otherwise, I can see how it can be too much for sensitive skin. My skin felt silky smooth, fresh, and relaxed after using it. Also, I feel like my skincare applied better after using this wand. I’m excited to keep testing it out to see more benefits. nan
