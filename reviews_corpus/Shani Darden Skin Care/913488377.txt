I received this for free from Influenster to review. I’ve tried a product very similar to this but I like this one better. I use retinol every day so my skin is not overly sensitive to it. I’ve been using this every night during my skin care routine. It sinks in very fast. I haven’t noticed any positive difference at this time after using it for a few weeks. I will update as time goes on if there is a change. It’s pricey so I’m hoping for some improvement. Interesting
