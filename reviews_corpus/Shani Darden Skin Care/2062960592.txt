I received this product for free on Influenster and have been testing it on my face for 2 weeks. The redness that I typically experience on my cheeks and under my eyes has greatly improved, and I also noticed that the lines I have on my forehead became smaller over the course of these two weeks. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was because my skin became very dry (which it does say can happen on the label - it tells you to use by using 1-2x per week and increase as your skin can handle). I used it 1x the first week and 2x the second week, but noticed this week that my skin really needed a lot of moisture on the days after I used it and does feel a bit tighter and drier than normal. I was not shocked by this, since I have very sensitive skin and my skin is a bit on the drier side. However, I am hopeful that my skin will become used to it as I really think it works very well, and Iâ€™m excited to keep on using it to reduce my red/uneven skin tone and forehead lines. nan
