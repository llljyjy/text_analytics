I’ve living off of a few 10 ml bottles of the Retinol Reform and want to delay purchasing a full bottle because I have too many skincare products to use up. However, I have to say I really miss having this retinol in my night routine!! This is so far the only retinol product that has lived up to the name of retinol, this magical ingredient that so many products now include. When I use the retinol reform at night, I wake up with super smooth skin the next morning and it doesn’t dry me out like other retinol products do!! Definitely worth the price and I will be buying a full size bottle soon!! The only retinol I love!!
