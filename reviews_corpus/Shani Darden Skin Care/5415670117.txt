My skin has become more textured with age, especially in the winter, and after two weeks of use, I’ve actually seen some noticeable improvements! The texture seems to have smoothed out a bit, and I’ve noticed my tone looks less patchy after use (less redness). Smells a little like glue, but that stopped bothering me after a while. I also like the consistency of the formula; it isn’t sticky or tacky. Would recommend! nan
