I received this product complimentary from Skin by Shani and Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. This retinol is great! I have noticed a difference in my skin texture, redness, and breakouts. It was a little bit drying but I alwasy use a moisturizer after any skincare routine I do. Currently I’m using it 3 times a week. Product is pricey and I’m still trying to  decide if I will purchase it. #SkinByShani #complimentary @shanidarden @Influenster#SkinByShani #complimentary @shanidarden @Influenster Love It
