Feels really nice and therapeutic on the face like I’m at the spa. It is easy to use and switch the attachments. It also doesn’t take long or feel like a chore. I did notice my face feels depuffed and firmer appearance after I use it. My face also just felt tighter. The speed also wasn’t too strong when you use it and I appreciate the different speeds. I do want to note as a dryer skin gal, don’t apply the gel all at once, it would dry out and the device would be hard to use. I needed to apply gel section by section so the drive will glide! The only negative I would say is the steep price. nan
