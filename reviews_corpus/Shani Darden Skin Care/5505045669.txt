This wand is very intriguing to me. If feels like a massage gun almost but for your face. It has two attachments for different parts of your face and 3 different intensities. I put it on the most intense. I watched the demo and it is super easy to use. And very fast. So far I haven’t noticed a huge difference in my fine lines, but I’m going to continue to use it because I’m hopeful. Slow progress
