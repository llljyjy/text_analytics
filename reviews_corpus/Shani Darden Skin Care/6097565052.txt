This retinol has changed my skin! My complexion is smoother and brighter after just a few uses. My skin texture is much less noticeable as well as my fine lines. I’ve purchased two bottles and received one as a sample. My skin had no problem adjusting to this product. I didn’t have redness, peeling or irritation and I generally have sensitive skin. I definitely recommend this retinol if you’re looking for something that’s not irritating and very effective! The best retinol for sensitive skin
