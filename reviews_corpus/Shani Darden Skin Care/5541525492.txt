Great serum. Easy to apply. It is lightweight. This was my first time using lactic acid and I have sensitive skin. It didnâ€™t irritate me at all. It will take a few weeks to see a difference though. The packaging could be a little better though. Upon receiving it, it was already leaking. And when I do a pump, it comes out pretty strong and splats. I received this product for free in exchange for a review. All opinions are my own. Great serum
