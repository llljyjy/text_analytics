I actually really love this eye cream. I have terrible under eye circles, and this was the first product that really helped brighten and tighten. I loved this product so much, I always had a back up under the sink. I’m writing this review because the packaging is absolutely horrible. For the price, it’s absolutely insane that you can’t get all the product out. Today I went to open a brand new box, just for the pump to not work at all. To say I’m disappointed is an understatement!!! SHANI PLEASE FIX THIS!! Looks like I’m not the only one frustrated with the packaging. great product - horrible packaging.
