Such a cool tool and am seeing my fine lines already soften after one use! I like to use it after my skincare when I have oil in my face while I sit in bed and watch tv haha. It is pricey but if you’re looking to enhance your skincare routine, this sculptor is it. The light vibrations also just feel really nice on my face so it’s like a nice little massage after the day. Excited to use it every night! nan
