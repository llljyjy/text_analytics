The Lactic Acid Exfoliating Serum is fabulous! I love that you don’t even have to rinse it off. Just apply 1-2 pumps, that’s it for super smooth skin! After applying, I do wait 5-10 minutes to let it all absorb and then follow up with my moisturizer. This serum is doing a great job for my skin but also gentle and no tingling or irritation. Love this stuff! Super Smooth Silky Skin
