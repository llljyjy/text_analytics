I received this product complimentary from Skin by Shani and Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. This retinol is great! I have noticed a difference in my skin texture, redness, and breakouts. I did switch to a more moisturizing lotion because the product was a bit drying. I am currently using it 2-3x/week. Itâ€™s a pricey product but I would consider buying it!#SkinByShani #complimentary @shanidarden @Influenster Great!!!!
