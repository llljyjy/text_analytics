I am in my mid 40s and have been using non prescription retinol products, or retinol alternative products, for the last few years. I have combo-leaning dry, sensitive, reactive skin. I take pretty good care of it but I have been having issues with texture on my forehead and on my cheek areas - basically beside my nose going downwards on the sides of my mouth - for years. I have wished at many times to have my oily skin back, but I reckon this is just aging. I have used a lot of different acidic products with varying degrees of success. I prefer glycolic acid over lactic but went into trying Retinol Reform with an open and hopeful mind. First, it’s incredibly gentle. I had zero reactions, redness, anything negative. Absorbs quick, and doesn’t have much of a scent. It’s more moisturizing than I expected. I currently use it 4-5 nights a week and l think this is one of the, if not the, best retinol products I’ve tried. The texture on my forehead is gone, and the other areas I had issue with has drastically decreased. I can see/feel a huge difference. My skin looks clearer, smoother, and feels great. The only caveat is (and maybe this is just across the board w/retinol, idk) if I don’t stay consistent using this, the texture slowly comes back, and my skin feels really dry and flaky. I am aware this is (for me) an expensive product, but the results are there, and I plan to keep using this. I’m very pleased with the performance and have had no problem using this with my other products. I really can’t think of a negative, other than price, and if you don’t use it regularly you won’t continue to see results so… just keep on using it and your skin will look great! I always follow up with a moisturizer and use a spf 50 during the day if I’ll be outside. Very good quality and hope to try more products from Shani Darden soon. Real results found with this one…
