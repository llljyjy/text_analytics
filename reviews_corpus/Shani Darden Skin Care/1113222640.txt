Excellent for sensitive skin. I have very dry very sensitive skin with rosacea. I started slow, only once per week and am now up to twice per week. No reaction, no purging. I know it takes a while to see results, but I am very happy with this. I can already see that my skin is more smooth from the actives in it. Itâ€™s expensive but this bottle will last me an entire year. Highly recommend! Good for sensitive skin
