I had never used retinol before but I am so glad I tried this product. I am leaving this review in exchange for receiving the product for free from influenster, and was asked to leave an honest review of the product. I was satisfied with the scent and texture of the serum as well as the efficacy of how well it helped reduce the redness I deal with on a day to day basis. I am a male so I don’t wear makeup and have always felt self conscious about being a little more red than others, sometimes even get asked if I’m sun burnt etc. The retinol serum did help reduce the redness, it didn’t eliminate it completely but the change was noticeable enough to earn my 5 stars. Helps reduce redness
