No Beauty Sleep required for glowing skin! Grateful to test out this Shani Darden serum to do anything to look more awake since my baby loves to scream out “Mama“ at midnight and 4 am. It has been 3 weeks of using Shani Darden Lactic Acid Exfoliating Serum at night. The combo of lactic acid, aloe vera, and white and green teas help renew skin overnight.I’m not sure if I see a dramatic difference in my skin but I do prefer lactic acid as an alternative to retinol. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin and am always looking out for clean and vegan skincare lines like this one. Bonus that it’s a Black-owned beauty brand to support.What I don’t like is the application process of having to wait 5 minutes after using the serum before putting on moisturizer and the rest of my skincare routine. As a busy mom with a baby waiting for me, I need a quick routine and don’t have 5 minutes extra to spare. Glow with vegan lactic acid
