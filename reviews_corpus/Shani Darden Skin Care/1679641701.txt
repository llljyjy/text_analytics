In my mid-thirties one of my growing concerns is crows feet aka fine lines around my eyes. This product was sent to me just in time I was looking for a serum/moisturizer that helped with fine lines. I have been using 4+ weeks and have seen a dramatic difference of diminshed fine lines. Other than it being on the pricey side I would definitely repurchase. nan
