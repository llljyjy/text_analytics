I usually steer away from retinol products as they always seem to be too harsh for my sensitive skin. However, this particular formula is gentler and leaves my skin soft and plump in the morning. I’m not crazy about the smell, but it isn’t a dealbreaker. I’ve been using it 3x a week for 3 weeks. I’m still not sure if I would repurchase, but it’s been a staple in my routine and I really love the results. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. Sensitive skin babes - choose this one!
