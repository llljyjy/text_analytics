I wanted something to replace Sunday Riley’s good genes in my skin care regimen, and I think this is it! It’s a much thinner consistency, which is nice because I feel like ou spreads more easily and doesn’t cause pilling if I’m layering skin products. My skin is pretty reactive, like weather changes and hard water can make it oversensitive for a few days. It definitely took a week of using it every other day for my skin to calm down, but now that I am used to it, I really like it. My pores stay clearer and my fine lines aren’t as pronounced. It’s a minimal change that i don’t think anyone else would notice, but i’d also been using a different lactic acid before. Also even though it did make my skin more sensitive, I do think it’s pretty hydrating. Obviously you still need a moisturizer, but it’s not as drying as some acids can be. I’m sure you could get similar results with cheaper products but the consistency and effectiveness are worth it for me. nan
