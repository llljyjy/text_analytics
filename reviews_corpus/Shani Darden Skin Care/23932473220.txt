I have been using the Facial sculpting wand by Shani Darden Skincare for stubborn facial lines. I have forehead lines that I would love to diminish as much as possible so I was happy to try out this wand. It’s not easy to use and comes with a gel to apply to face right before use. The motions almost feel like a massage across the face and is enjoyable. This wand coupled with Shani Darden retinol seems like a great way to help lessen the appearance of lines. I’ve been using for several days and my forehead lines appear softer and a little less noticeable. nan
