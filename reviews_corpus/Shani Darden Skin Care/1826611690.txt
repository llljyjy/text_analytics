This stuff is magical and I don’t know if I’ll survive if it’s ever discontinued. I have always had problematic skin. I’ve tried so many different things, and my skin just kind of hates everything. Everything I try makes me break out, peel, or most commonly it makes my oily skin literally ooze oil within an hour. So oily that I can’t even try makeup because my skin will be an oil slick before my makeup is even finished. I got this as a sample packet with an order and tried it, and was shocked. The next morning, only minimal oil production. I tried it again, and again until I used the whole packet and then bought the full size. Not only does my skin actually agree with it, but it works wonders! My skin is smoother, clearer, dark spots are fading, skin tone is evening out, my skin looks better than I can ever remember. Where have you been all my life?
