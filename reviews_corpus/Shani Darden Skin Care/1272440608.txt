I received this free in exchange for my review. I started using this 3x a week, gradually increasing to 5 days a week alternating with my usual day/night regimen. This is lightly scented and lightly formulated, does not feel greasy or leave a thick residue on your skin. Apply to face, throat and chest. Easing into use kept my skin from drying. My skin feels moisturized and looks fresh. Pores are less visible around brows. Non greasy, light feeling
