I love the sleek packaging of this serum and the ease of application. So far, I have been using this retinol for almost 2 weeks and I am already so happy with the results. My skin feels a lot smoother than it did and applying makeup has just become a lot simpler. I have noticed my skin does not look as dull as it did before I started using this amazing serum and I canâ€™t wait to see how my skin feels in the months to come.Also, this retinol serum does not tend to dry out my skin. Definitely recommend! nan
