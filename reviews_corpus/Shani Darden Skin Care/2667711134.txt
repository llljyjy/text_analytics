As with a lot of facial massager tools, the effects from something like this will take a little while to see a difference, but so far this tool seems like a high-quality product that has the potential to make a huge difference in your routine! If you are feeling up to the challenge, and you want a heavy hitting machine, I would say that this one would be a great choice to get started. And I know that this brand has a reputation for putting out high-quality products! nan
