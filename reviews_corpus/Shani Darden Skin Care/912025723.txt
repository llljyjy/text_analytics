I have used so many eye creams over the years. This one is really top notch. The cream is in a hygienic pump dispenser, which I prefer over a jar. The product itself is nourishing, hydrating, and so soft and creamy. It applies really nicely and leaves the eye area skin smooth, soft, and youthful looking. The cream is thick, but not too thick. I love the texture and consistency. It’s not greasy or runny. It doesn’t irritate my eyes. It feels like it does something to instantly hydrate, but also helps treat the eye area over time.  I had my husband try this one and he also commented on how wonderful the texture of the cream feels. It feels rich and firming, but not tight (in a good, more normal way!).  I know there are a lot of options, but this is an excellent one.  Also, a little goes a long way. This will last me a while. Nourishing, Non-Greasy Eye Cream
