Shani, your packaging feels so expensive and I love it. This lactic acid has AhA so it’s an exfoliating & brightening serum which has made some good improvements to my skin. I do have hyperpigmentation so I need something that’s not harsh & drying so my Shani Darden came at the perfect time. So far my skin looks brighter & my dark spots seem to be going away. The product is however a little liquid so he mindful that a little goes a very long way nan
