I’ve graduated to my mid forties and have noticed my fine lines around my eyes, at my smile, they were become more defined instead of fine lines:  My combination skin, with dry being the biggest contender, was in need of some assistance.  Influencer sent me a free Shani Darden Retinol Reform to review at just  the right time.  Retinol is a scary word and there are safety concerns and instructions addressed on the box and witching the packaging.  I started using the product the very night I received it.  I was pleasantly surprised that my skin instantly felt firmer yet not dry or the “stretched to tight” feeling that sometimes occurs with creams.  It also didn’t feel as if it over compensated the dryness by leaving my skin greasy looking, it could have even been a bit more moisturizing.  I’ve used the Retinol Reform for over two weeks and I’m quite pleased.  My skin feels better, my uneven skin texture had improved greatly, and my fine lines are a little less noticeable.  I am excited to continue using Retinol Reform and seeing what more it can do to improve my face.  Shani Darden Skin Care made a product they should be proud of, it delivers the retinol needed for improvement without being harsh to the skin, even if your skin is a little on the sensitive side like mine, you won’t be let down.  Nobody needs to be in their forties looking like they are over forty, this product can assist in keeping the masses guessing on how you could really be a grandmother.
