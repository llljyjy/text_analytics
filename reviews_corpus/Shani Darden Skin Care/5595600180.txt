I love that itâ€™s both an exfoliator and a serum. I use 4 pumps which covers for my face, hands, neck and chest. It is very sticky (especially) if you use too much product. That said, it does dry down though after about 20 minutes and feel great on the skin. My skin also feels noticeably firmer and more taut after applying. Great multitasking work horse!
