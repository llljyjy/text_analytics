I received this complimentary from a Influenster for an honest review. I honestly forget about this product so I only used it once a week at most. I liked it when I used it but not enough to really put into rotation. It had a good consistency but found I needed three pumps. A slight warming when I used it but well tolerated. I did appreciate the texture of my skin when I woke up. It does feel high end. Pretty good stuff.
