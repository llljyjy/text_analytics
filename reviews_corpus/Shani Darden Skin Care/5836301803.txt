I have dry sensitive skin that can get easily irritated by actives, so I am always careful with what I use. I thought this would be too much for my skin to handle at 9% lactic acid, but it was not. I see myself being able to build up to 2-3x a week with no issues. Gentle enough for my sensitive skin
