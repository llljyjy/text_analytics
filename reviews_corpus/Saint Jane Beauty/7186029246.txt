I’ve had mixed reviews about this product. This was my first time trying it, and the smell wasn’t the best. The product had a tint to it, and if you rubbed it, traces were on your hands. I recommend exfoliating before you use this product because it does enhance dry patches. It has a thin formula, but if you’re looking for a more moisturizing sunscreen, I dont recommend it. It does apply smoothly on the skin, and gives a sheer finish. Other than that, I love what the brand stands for. I have mixed reviews about this product!
