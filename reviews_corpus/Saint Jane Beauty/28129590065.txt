Saint Jane does it again! I am absolutely including this into my nightly skincare routine for the long-term. The texture of the cream is wonderfully smooth and applies easily and evenly on the skin. It feels like silk going on to your face. Every morning I woke up I felt like my skin was brighter and brighter. I am usually really bad at having a solid nighttime routine, but this product made it easy and enjoyable to take the time. I am excited to see the continued benefit this product offers and the impact on my skin. Incredible. Will use for the long-term.
