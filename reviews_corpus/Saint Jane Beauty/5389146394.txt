I looooove this oil. It makes my skin so soft and hydrated. It sinks into my skin well instead of sitting on top of my skin so my other skincare products work really well with it, and doesn’t make me break out either. The smell is strong so I suggest smelling it beforehand if you’re sensitive to smells, but it smells like my favorites herbal tea so I don’t mind it at all. nan
