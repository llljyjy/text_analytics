I’m impressed! I have been searching for a sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white cast and isn’t greasy and I have finally found my match! It is so hard to find sunscreens that work well on brown skin but this product just melts right into the skin. It’s also great for the face because it’s smooths the skin like a primer. I highly recommend adding to the daily routine! Love the finish!
