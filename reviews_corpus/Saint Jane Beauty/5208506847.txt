So so so happy Sephora is carrying this now!!! I’m on my 4th bottle of it from Credo Beauty, everyone needs to know how good this spf is!! I replaced my skin tints with this, even though it doesn’t have a color to it, it just perfectly blurs and filters your skin. Add a lil spot concealer and you’re perfect. Seriously so good, clean, non irritating or pore clogging, the whole brand is honestly great. perfect. perfect. perfecttttt.
