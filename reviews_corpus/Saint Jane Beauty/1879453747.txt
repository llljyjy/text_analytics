The consistency reminds me of a BB cream. It’s thick but melts into the skin once applied. There is no fragrance to the product and it has a nice clean feel to it. It definitely minimizes pores and works great as a primer for either foundation or a CC cream. I have very dry skin so it feels very soothing once applied and doesn’t leave my face feeling heavy. I’m glad that it’s not a greasy feeling SPF, so I know I won’t break out with this product. The Perfect Year- Round SPF!
