Saint Jane is really growing on me! This sunscreen exceeded my expectations!I usually don’t even bother with mineral sunscreens because I don’t want to worry about any sort of cast or residue (I have melanated skin,) but this one completely sheered out and left the most beautiful finish. On top of being an SPF, it made for a really impressive makeup primer too- my makeup kept that fresh satin-matte finish all day with a super natural glow and smooth appearance. Plus! My eyes didn’t burn or water at all while wearing! That’s NEVER happened with SPF. 10’s across the board. Really glad I found this product! BEST Pre-makeup SPF!
