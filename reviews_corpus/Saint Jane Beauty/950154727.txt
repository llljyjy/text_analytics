I had been on the lookout for a *perfect* face sunscreen. Something with a little glow but not greasy looking. Something that wouldn’t make me breakout. I ordered this based on the great reviews and I’m totally in love. I might cry actual tears if this is ever discontinued. It goes on thick but dries down beautifully. Gives my skin a little tint and glow so that I don’t have to wear anything else on non-work days. It also wears well under my Summer Fridays skin tint. I will mention that I’m on the more fair side so it doesn’t leave a cast on me but idk about on darker skin tones. I am a forever fan. This is IT!
