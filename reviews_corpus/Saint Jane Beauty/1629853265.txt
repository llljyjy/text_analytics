This is a winner! It smells SO GOOD and does such an amazing job of smoothing pores while protecting your skin. As you can see in the pictures, the texture is incredible. It lathers into skin perfectly (shown on my hand before rubbing all the way to see texture/quality). 10/10 - apply 15 min prior to sun exposure and youâ€™re good to go. This is a new must for skin care/protection!! Skin Care's new best friend!!!
