First, the packaging is typical Saint Jane Beauty- which I love! Looks beautiful on the vanity. The color is also an eye catcher. Iâ€™ve been using retinol for a bit so have tried many brands, but will say none have given my skin the hydration this cream does. The next morning my skin was glowing, hydrated and calm. No redness or irritation from the retinol whatsoever. Even calmed some razor bumps. This and their serums are a must try! Hydration! Glow!
