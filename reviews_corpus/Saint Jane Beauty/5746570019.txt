Been on the market for a good tinted moisturizer and also has spf at the same time. I browsed for a good sunscreen that does not give me white cast and does not oxidize too! (the last part is so important since the sun makes us sweat and clearly we have to reapply every now and then). I’ve tried so many products in the past, many of them were disappointing (giving too much products that makes my skin so oily, gives me pimples, etc). When I found Saint Jane, I fell deeply in love since this product blurs and corrects my uneven skin tone. Second, it doesn’t oxidize too fast, (any product will oxidize for more than 4-5 hours, but with Saint Jane, at least I don’t have to reapply every hour). I use Saint Jane as a primer, before my foundation and concealer, then I will put compact foundation or spread some bb/cc cream on top of it. The result has been so fantastic, I have not been getting any reaction from using this product. Definitely would recommend to someone who has acne skin prone like me! Primer/Sunscreen/Tinted Moisturizer? I'm in!
