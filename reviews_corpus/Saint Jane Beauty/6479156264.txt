This is an excellent moisturizing oil, love the initial fragrance of this also.  Normally, I can’t stand fragrance in my skincare, but you can only smell this when it is initially applied then you can’t smell it anymore.   The oil absorbs quickly, gives a glow and sits well under makeup.  I had received this as a sample but will pick this up. Excellent facial oil for dry skin
