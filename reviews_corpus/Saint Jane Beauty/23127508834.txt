Saint Jane Beauty gifted me mini samples of their Luxury Sun Ritual Pore Smoothing Sunscreen SPF 30. This luxurious and clean, mineral sunscreen provides resilience against sun, heat, and environmental stressors, and leaves the skin feeling moisturized and hydrated. The texture blends into my skin beautifully and doesn’t leave any white cast, but rather a sheer and invisible finish. This sunscreen also acts as a primer to help blur the look of pores and give a soft-focus effect whether you choose to wear it under makeup or alone.I really love the fact that it acts as a moisturizer, SPF and primer! I prefer products that can multi-task especially for my morning routine because I like to keep it short, simple and quick. I would actually consider picking up the full size of this SPF given it’s price range, quantity and benefits. A great Multi-Tasker!!!
