SPF is an essential step in my skincare for many reasons and this sunscreen has become my favorite with its ability to smooth out the look of my large pores. Since it’s a mineral spf, it reflects the sun which in return doesn’t heat my skin and make it oily. It has a nice floral fragrance that fades after a few minutes. It absorbs nicely leaving my skin ready for makeup, if I choose, and leaves zero white cast. I love that it is free from harmful chemicals and is verified as a clean formula. I had no skin irritation or blemishes when I switched to this spf. Often times my skin gets moody when I start a new product but not this time. I actually captured it’s blurring effect in my picture after I rubbed it in. I definitely recommend to all, especially those with sensitive or blemish prone skin like mine. Bye Bye Large Pores
