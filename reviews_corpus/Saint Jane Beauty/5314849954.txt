Wow. Not sure what this was supposed to do but this completely cured my skin of textural issues. All the small bumps are gone. (Still have some under the skin) hydrated my face beyond belief but what makes it worth the price is what it has done for my huge pores. They are still there but closed and smoother than ever. Greatest purchase Iâ€™ve made for my face. juuuuust buy it.
