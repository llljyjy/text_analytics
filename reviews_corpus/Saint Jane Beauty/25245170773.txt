I recieved a cute little sample of this SPF and I have to admit - I’m obsessed! It doesn’t leave a white cast, the scent isn’t strong and it wears well with my makeup. I love that it’s not heavy so I don’t feel super greasy or oily throughout the day. I’ll definitely be picking up the full size of this as soon as I’m done with the samples I got. Whether you have dry skin, oily skin or skin that’s combo I think this would be a great SPF if you’re looking to try something new. nan
