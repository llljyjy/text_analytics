I’ve noticed in my mid-30’s my skin has been on the drier side, even after moving to a more humid climate. I’ve also noticed since wearing a mask that my skin barrier hasn’t been at its best and breakouts come back now and then. After using a favorite blue retinol oil of mine for a long time I decided to make the switch to a something that sinks in a bit better, a more moisturizing retinol and THIS is the one. Now after a good 3 months of using 1-2 times per week, I can say it’s amazing. A little bit goes a long way with this one. It’s a sleeper hit— literally. I wake up the next day with baby soft glowing skin. Much like that favorite blue oil of mine… but now more moisturized. You’ve found retinol gold! Retinol gold for your 30’s
