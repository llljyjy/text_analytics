After using this sunscreen for couple of days, I must say that I am in love with it. It blends like a dream in no time. It has a tint yet its not visible. It didnot leave any white cast. This sunscreen didnot cause any irritation to my eyes or skin. My makeup went on super easy on top of it and stayed in place looking fresh the whole day. Love!
