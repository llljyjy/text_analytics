Best daily sunscreen I’ve tried! Goes on smooth and provides smooth, even, natural coverage. Blends easily and feels light on my skin. I even use it on the backs of my hands and chest to protect against sunspots. I love that it gives me enough coverage that I don’t feel like I have to wear foundation or powder on warm summer days. nan
