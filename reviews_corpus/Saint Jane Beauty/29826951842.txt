I wanted to write a review the day I purchased this moisturizer because I loved it so much but I forgot. I’ve been using this moisturizer for at least six months now daily every morning and it has helped my red, rosacea prone, sensitive, and dry skin so much. I’m obsessed with all Saint Jane products…they are all so hydrating. I use three drops of the C- Drops every morning before the Petal Cream. I feel like it seals in hydration and your skin doesn’t look oily. I usually apply makeup on 20 mins later and it looks flawless. nan
