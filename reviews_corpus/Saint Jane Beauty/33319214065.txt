I love this new SPF from Saint Jane Beauty! It goes on smooth and is slightly tinted, and the smell is fantastic! It’s my new go-to for my daily coverage! Because it’s SPF 30 I use some for my morning walks and apply another layer for my afternoon walks. Leaves my skin feeling fresh and smooth with no residue, and no clogged pores! It is a primer, moisturizer, and sunscreen all in one! My new go-to daily SPF!
