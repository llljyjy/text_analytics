I’ve been using this sunscreen for a week now and haven’t had any breakouts. I have oily and acne prone skin so it’s a little scary testing out new skincare. I’m glad I did this sunscreen blends well to my skin, no white cast, dries quick, and has a nice scent. It’s a lightweight sunscreen and has a yellow tint to it. The smell is pleasant, smells like some type of fruit but it isn’t overwhelming. My skin looked matte and did see the pores of my nose diminish. It’s easy to remove with my facial cleanser and no residue is left over. I would definitely buy this product. A great sunscreen for acne prone skin
