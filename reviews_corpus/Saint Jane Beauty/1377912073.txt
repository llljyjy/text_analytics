My first container was not full, which left me suspicious.  Also, I now have a dark patch on my cheek, no redness or irritation though.  I’ve heard you have to give retinol a chance and be patient so I’ve ordered another jar of this.  However, if this one arrives and I see that it still looks some is missing, I will probably return it and buy a different retinol product. Giving it one more try....
