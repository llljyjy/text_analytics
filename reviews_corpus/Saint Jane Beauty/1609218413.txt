I can’t believe this is a mineral SPF! I get absolutely no white cast and also the tint blends out so I think it could work for a large variety of skin tones. It definitely has that primer texture and helps me skip some steps in my skincare and makeup routine in the morning, and I’m not a morning person, so this is amazing to me LOL. The one thing I will say is that it definitely doesn’t take the place of a moisturizer, at least not for my dry skin. It pairs well with other skincare, but I don’t find it to be particularly hydrating. This isn’t a dealbreaker to me but I wanted to mention it since it’s billed as something that can take the place of a moisturizer. nan
