A super nice sunscreen base for makeup! The color and texture reminds me of the Benefit Cosmetics The POREfessional Face Primer, just not quite as thick. I also enjoy the light scent of this sunscreen, isn’t too much. So overall it’s a nice sunscreen, I didn’t see too much pore smoothing, but would certainly keep using it. Nice SPF base for makeup!
