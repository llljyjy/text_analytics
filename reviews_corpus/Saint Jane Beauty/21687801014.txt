I really like using this sunscreen. Itâ€™s light, smells wonderful, has a great consistency, goes on easy and blends well. It is like a moisturizer that is your spf but with some color to help blur imperfections. I was out on the lake a week or so ago- kept reapplying every 2 hours as needed and NO SUNBURN at all!! I will continue to be use and make part of my skincare routine. nan
