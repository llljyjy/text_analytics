I live in Florida and anyone from here knows how brutal the sun can be on your skin. Before leaving the house I applied my Saint Jane’s pore smoothing  sunscreen. It’s so light and airy you can’t even tell that I have it on; not to mention it isn’t greasy and transferable. I am very happy with this product and I look forward to my next use ☺️ I LOVE IT!
