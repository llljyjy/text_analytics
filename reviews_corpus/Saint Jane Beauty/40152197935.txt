Living in Southern California, it is so important for me to wear sunscreen daily (I donâ€™t want wrinkles or sun damage in the future)! The Saint Jane sunscreen is luxurious and one of the best I have tried. I love that it feels lightweight, and is great at blurring. It works as a primer/ moisturizer too! My skin looks great when I wear it. I would recommend this product! The Perfect Daily Sunscreen
