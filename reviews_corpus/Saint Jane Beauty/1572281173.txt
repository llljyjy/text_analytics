This SPF St. Jane works very well. It does not leave a white cast on the skin, which for melanated skin is a huge plus. I have used this under my makeup and I really enjoy how smooth my Foundation applies and how beautiful my Foundation looks. I like that this does not clog my pores and I have not had any irritation or breakouts from it, which makes it definitely very different from other SPFs on the market. Two thumbs up
