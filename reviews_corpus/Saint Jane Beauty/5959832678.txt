this is my new favorite sunscreen, simply because it’s a multitasker that actually does what it claims. It has a lightweight consistency with a light pleasant scent, and absorbs seamlessly into the skin with no residue left behind. I love the blurring effect it has on my skin and the fact that it effectively smooths out my pores. I’m very pale and this spf works really well at protecting my skin from the sun. nan
