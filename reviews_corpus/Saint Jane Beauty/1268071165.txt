This product is a definite luxury! It feels so nice and smooth on the skin. Contrary to other SPF sunscreens, this product is not oily and does have a pore smoothing effect. I especially wore it under makeup as well for extra added protection. The feeling of the SPF feels not oily either and combined with the skin, that is true as well. I like the color of the sunscreen too - it is kind of tan in color, and it blends really well. Almost feels like it is a matte material and blends nicely on the skin without adding a tint to it. Iâ€™ve included a before and after picture  - see if you can see the difference! nan
