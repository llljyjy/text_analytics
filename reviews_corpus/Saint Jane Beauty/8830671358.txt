I love the Saint Jane Beauty Luxury Pore Smoothing Sunscreen.  It seamlessly blends into my skin.  It does have a slight fragrance but is not overwhelming.  I love that my skin looks amazing even without makeup.  And, when I do wear makeup, I donâ€™t have to use a primer before applying makeup when using this sunscreen.  It allows my makeup glides on effortlessly.  I have worn this every day for a week now and feel confident that my skin is protected. My new favorite sunscreen
