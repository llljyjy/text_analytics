So far loving the product. Skin not as red and seems to help with fine lines . What I am not loving is for $70, jar should be to the top. Like others have stated, jar was not full, maybe 60%? Certainly didn’t look like jar in this picture, that’s for sure. Product didn’t seem to leak either . Other than that - great product . nan
