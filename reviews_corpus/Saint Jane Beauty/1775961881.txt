I had been wanting to try this product from Saint Jane Beauty and got a few samples of the Luxury sun ritual pore smoothing sunscreen. This is a mineral sunscreen that has no white cast which is amazing. The product itself has a golden tint which blends into the skin and adds a little glow. My skin is dry and this product felt lightweight yet moisturizing. I love that it gives me a smooth vibrant finish glowy goodness
