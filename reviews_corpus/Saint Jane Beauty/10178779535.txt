Saint Jane Beauty recently sent over some samples of their new botanical infused sunscreen and Iâ€™ve been enjoying the product. The consistency and texture is medium to lightweight and blends beautifully into my skin. The pore diffusing technology minimizes the look of pores on my nose. The formulation is easy to re-apple throughout the day, works beautifully underneath makeup or alone and leaves a natural finish. Lovely new sunscreen
