I am in love with this product! My favorite part is the fact that I felt hydrated all day with no makeup and my pores look super minimized. I struggle with having large pores especially after a long day. It also has almost a mattifying effect, but that is very very minimal. Maybe it was just the effect that it had on my pores that made it feel like it was mattifying. Also when it went on it was very smooth on my skin. Love this product canâ€™t wait to wear it under my makeup during the day. Need this sunscreen in my life!!!
