This is, for me, the ideal mineral sunscreen. Although it looks tinted, it’s completely invisible on the skin - which is imperative for my very pale skin, on which most any tint shows up orange. Not this one! It’s silky-smooth and almost feels cooling when applied. There’s no pilling whatsoever, no matter what I put on under or over it. I’m diligent about putting on the full amount of sunscreen, which with a lot of mineral screens means I end up a goopy mess - but this one stays invisible no matter how much I put on. It never stings my eyes. Lastly, it’s not remotely greasy - it’s actually quite mattifying! As someone who typically prefers chemical sunscreens, I can’t say enough good things about this one - I would actually choose it over most chemical screens. nan
