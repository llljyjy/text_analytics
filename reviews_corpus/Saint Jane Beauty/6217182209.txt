I love this 3-1 sunscreen!The formula’s consistency is very rich and not runny yet it leaves your skin feeling soft and without the annoying white cast a lot of sunscreens still have.In addition to being a sunblock, I love how it’s also a pore smoothing primer which actually works! I could clearly notice how my makeup application went so smoothly and the finish was perfectly flawless when I used this.Overall, I definitely recommend this sunscreen. exceptional
