I love the fact that this melts into my skin and doesn’t leave a white cast like other SPFs. While it is a bit pricy in comparison to other products the quality is better and due to its consistency it acts as a moisturizing primer as well and made my foundation application super smooth… it is scented(smells great) so keep that in mind if you need to avoid scented products Great multi purpose SPF
