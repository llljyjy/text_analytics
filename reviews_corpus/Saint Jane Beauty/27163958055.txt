I love this sunscreen. It is so smooth and blurring. Doesn’t pill and it’s not too greasy, but still adds a nice shine where you need it. Just buy it, beats Supergoop any day. I wish it had more spf though and the tube is not that big, I wish there was bigger sizes. I know this is going to be my go to sunscreen from now on. One of the best sunscreens I have ever used
