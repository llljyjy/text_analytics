I have been using this in the morning and at night for about two weeks and love it! It’s light and absorbs quickly making it okay to wear underneath makeup. I have noticed a difference in evenness under my eyes, fine lines, and brightness. Most eye creams I’ve tried around this price point are much heavier and feel like they are just sitting on top of my skin. New favorite eye cream!
