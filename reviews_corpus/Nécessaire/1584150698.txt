I love the simple and bright packaging. ✨ First time, applying and using this sunscreen. First impression is that this product is fragrance-free which I really love so much. That is one thing I look for in sunscreen no chemical fragrance. Most sunscreen have that chemical fragrance. This sunscreen gives you that healthy glow ✨ This sunscreen is also great if you have dry skin as it boost skin hydration and support skin barrier. Only few things about this sunscreen is you have to really work the sunscreen as it gives a little white cast and it is not sweat proof or waterproof as it is a treatment sunscreen and the ingredients are for more on skin hydration.
