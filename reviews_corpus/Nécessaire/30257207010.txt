The The Neck Serum With Peptides by Necessaire works great. My neck is prone to fine lines and I’m always looking for a way to improve it. I have been using this serum for a couple weeks and noticing improvement in fine lines and firmness. I like that it’s a serum, so it’s instantly absorbing without any oily glow or residue. It instantly hydrates the skin. I also like that it’s fragrance free and works perfectly in the morning under any make up, and I also use it at the end of the day as part of my night routine. Love
