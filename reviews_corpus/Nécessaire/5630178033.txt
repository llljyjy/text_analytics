I’m a big fan of Nécessaire, which I was super excited to try their new mineral sunscreen! First of all, love that their packaging is environmentally conscious. This formula is amazing as well! It aborbs well into the skin, not greasy at all. It doesn’t leave a white cast either which is what I’m always looking for. nan
