I love this sunscreen. This is 100% mineral sunscreen. It has a lightweight lotion-like texture and does not feel sticky or greasy on my dry skin. It does not leave a white cast and it is perfect for the face and body. I also love the ingredients here. It contains hyaluronic acid,    Vitamin B5, Niacinamide, and vitamin E. I recommend this. I would repurchase this!
