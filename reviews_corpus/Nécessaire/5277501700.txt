I love Necessaire products & the neck creme is no exception.  I’ve been using it a.m. & p.m. for over 3 weeks now. The formula is very lightweight. It makes your skin feel so soft & smooth immediately after application. I haven’t noticed a difference in neck lines or plumping, but that may take more time. The glass bottle is really nice, but not travel friendly as it’s heavy and well, glass… Very nice formula
