I love this SPF. It doesn’t have a gross smell, the texture is great. Blends in really really well. My number one thing is that it wears great under makeup.  Foundation, powder, tinted moisturizer - doesn’t really matter what you use! If you’reSomeone who struggles with that please try this one! If you’re medium to dark complected try this first to see if you get a cast, I didn’t get one but I’m very pale! New favorite face sunscreen
