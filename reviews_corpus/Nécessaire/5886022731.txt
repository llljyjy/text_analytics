I am super impressed with this spf! I love how hydrating it is while still working well with my other skincare and makeup. I didn’t notice any pilling or sliding of my makeup while using this. I love that vitamin E, b5, and hyaluronic acid are added to the formula. If you have oily skin I would definitely recommend using this in place of moisturizer as it is really hydrating! It also reapplies beautifully throughout the day. It does take some time to sink in fully but I don’t notice a white cast after it is set. So good!
