I used this treatment for a month before writing this review. Firstly, I absolutely loved that the product is fragrance free. As I delve more into clean skincare I love to see fragrance free on the bottle. It does smell a little like mineral sunscreen but the scent dissipates after it absorbs. I used this every night for a month before bed and did notice that the skin on my neck is more hydrated, firm and healthy after use. The serum has a nice consistency and absorbed into the skin nicely without leaving a greasy feeling. I don’t think it’s a game changer but I did notice some small effects. Really Nice Serum
