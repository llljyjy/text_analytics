I love this gorgeous serum. Comes in a glass bottle with a pump dispenser (hygienic!). The product has a silky, slightly oily texture that absorbs surprisingly well. Skin is left very soft and moisturized. My neck skin tends to be dry, but this product alleviates that. Definitely see its rejuvenating properties. Has a cleaver formulation too, which is what I gravitate towards lately.  Pricey, but worth it in my opinion. Great neck skincare
