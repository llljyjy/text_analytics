Before starting the neck serum, I didn’t really think it was necessary to have neck specific serum. I was using the facial serum on my neck, but now I am convinced that having neck serum is much more effective in addressing neck specific issues.  I just didn’t get the same result.  The serum has a texture of light weight lotion . It glides and absorbs easily. I used the serum at night time during usual skincare routine for my face. After daily use, my neck area feels more hydrated and smooth. When compared from before and after, I can see that my lines on the neck is softened and the look of my skin improved. Works!
