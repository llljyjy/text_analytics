I love how light weight and creamy this sunscreen is. It doesn’t leave behind any white cast and it’s pretty much unscented. Does have a faint sunscreen smell. But it really works well with makeup. I like that you can use it on both face and body. Perfect for every day use. The packaging is adorable, the yellow is so fun! Great for everyday use!
