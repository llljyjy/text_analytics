I’ve been LOVING this sunscreen! The consistency is so hydrating and silky smooth. It absorbs quickly with no greasy residue or white cast at all, feels like nothing is there. I especially love that it has hyaluronic acid in for an extra boost of hydration-something I’ve never seen any other sunscreen have! The best mineral based sunscreen I’ve ever used hands down, my skin loves it. Amazing, Hydrating and non greasy
