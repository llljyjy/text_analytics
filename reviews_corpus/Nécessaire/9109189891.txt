This formula is super light and creamy in texture. It doesn’t leave behind any white cast, it’s truly unscented, and works amazingly well by itself or with makeup. Perfect for every day use, I start seeing some sun damaged spots on my face, and after that never left my house without applying sunscreen. Love, love, love
