Wearing SPF is a must for me I live in Florida and I usually outside most days for long periods of time, so I need a good sunscreen that will protect me and not make my skin break out. This sunscreen WORKS! I love that it it has no silicones and that its a Lotion type texture. Not to mention the amazing Hyaluronic Acid that is in it, my skin love that. Its also fragrance-free and that help. It works great on it own and also under makeup. I rather use it alone on days i dont wear makeup up, to me I like it alone better.  All and all this is a great sunscreen to have on hand, and its a great size for home or on the go. Great for everyday
