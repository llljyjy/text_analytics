So good. This is my new favorite Sunscreen. The Nécessaire The Sunscreen - 100% Mineral, Broad Spectrum SPF 30 with 20% Non-Nano Zinc, Hyaluronic Acid and Niacinamide. It’s a very gentle formula that applies beautifully and it’s hydrating as well. I like the ingredients on the formula and the bottle as well, it’s great for travel and a small amount goes a long way. I like that it’s for face and body a two in one which is very convenient. Highly recommend it. Obsessed
