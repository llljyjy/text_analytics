This is a great product! It goes smoothly, is not oily, it doesn’t irritate my skin. I like formula 20% Non-Nano Zinc Oxide, Algae Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, and essential vitamins that help protect and hydrate skin and visibly reduce lines and wrinkles. 100% mineral with non-nano zinc., I can wear it every day.   Broad Spectrum UVA/ UVB and pollution protection. No silicones. No PEGs.It leaves skin feeling soft and comfortable with a satin finish. I’m in love with this sunscreen, in love
