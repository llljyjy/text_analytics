I really love this sunscreen. It has a very nice lightweight texture that goes on smoothly and is absorbed rather quickly into my skin without leaving a sticky or greasy feeling. It feels so hydrating and I love that it does not leave a white cast. It works perfectly with my makeup without getting oily or greasy during the day. I also love that it is fragrance free. I highly recommend this hydrating sunscreen! Hydrating without leaving a white cast
