I have been using sunscreen from  NÉCESSAIRE for a week and I love it so far. The formula is perfect, its not too greasy and doesn’t dry my skin out. It does have a little white cast but its easy to blend. I usually put a good amount of sunscreen over my two fingers and apply it all over my face and neck. I totally recommend to try it! Love it!
