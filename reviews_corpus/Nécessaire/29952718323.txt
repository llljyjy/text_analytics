I love that it doesn’t contain cancer-causing oxybenzone first off. My skin doesn’t feel heavy when I put it on unlike many other sunscreens out there. It contains hyaluronic acid so it’s very much hydrating to my skin and I usually put it on as the last step to my morning skincare routine about 5 minutes after putting my moisturizer. It doesn’t feel heavy on my face
