Not only has this brand become one of my new favorites because its consistent quality of amazing and simple products earned my trust but this particular sunscreen impressed me. Sunscreen has always been hit or miss for me (and I thought this might be the same with Nécessaire) because minéral SPF products are hard to get right but I actually ended up loving it. It absorbs well (doesn’t leave a white cast) and doubles as great skincare because of the ingredients used. I almost gave it less stars because it pilled at first but that’s my fault (learning curve) rather than Necessaire’s. Just let your other products not only dry but really set first. Then you’ll be fine Another thing excellent product by nécessaire
