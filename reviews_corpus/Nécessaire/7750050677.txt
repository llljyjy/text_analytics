I love all things Necessaire, and this product is no exception. First off, they have the best packaging and their products always look good in my space. This sunscreen was great, but one thing I didn’t enjoy was the fact that it doesn’t mix well with other face products you may be wearing on your face like serums. But on its own with a moisturizer it’s fine. It’s nice and thick and you get that UV protection needed. I especially like to use it on my hands. nan
