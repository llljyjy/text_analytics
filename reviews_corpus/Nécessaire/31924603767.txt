This has such an interesting texture, almost like a whipped feeling with the pump applicator. It feels hydrating on and leaves very minimal white caste once it’s settled into the skin. I love that it can be used for both face and body. So far it’s caused zero irritation and looks great under my makeup as well! Pumped Perfection!
