The texture of this product is really light but luxurious. I like the glass bottle and packaging- it looks really sleek. I didn’t see any crazy changes in my neck lines, so it didn’t seem to be amazingly effective for me. It’s a nice serum, and I’ll continue to use it and hope for some results with more time. nan
