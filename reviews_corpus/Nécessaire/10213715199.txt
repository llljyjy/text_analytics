Necessaire has always been one of my favorite brands when it comes to body care. I was super excited to try their skincare. This neck serum is really nice. It absorbs quickly and you donâ€™t really need a lot of it.  It works to provide firmer-looking skin around the neck. I havent seen any crazy changes just yet but i am gonna continue using it. Do try it and see for yourself if it works. nice
