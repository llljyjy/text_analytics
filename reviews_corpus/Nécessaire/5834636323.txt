Received from Nécessaire for my honest review. So applying SPF is something I personally do daily as I have had a fought skin CA. I have been wearing this SPF the last week and this is it! I am super impressed with how fast it absorbs and it doesn’t leave any white cast or any residue. This is definitely a SPF I plan on using daily forever. i love that it is made for face and body, face so you know it’s gentle and body so you know it is strong.It’s super hydrating it has 20% sync oxide as an active ingredient so you know you’re gonna be protecting from the sun. And it’s also fragrance free so you don’t have to deal with that fake smell all day long. It has no parabens it’s in recyclable packaging and  no silicones. This is all around just an amazing UVA UVB protection also pollution protection it’s perfect for daily use, Not to mention hyaluronic acid which happens to be one of my favorite Ingredients to be using on my face my Holy Grail SPF
