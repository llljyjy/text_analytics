I’m always nervous about sunscreens because there’s so many and I never know what’s the best so I was really excited to try this out since I love this brand. It’s actually great! I pat it into my skin rather than rub and find it’s easier to absorb and you avoid pilling. I don’t think there’s any white cast and it doesn’t feel heavy. I can’t even tell it’s on my skin so 10/10 Me likey
