So far so okay.  I’m not seeing the instant results that other reviewers mention, but I assume this product may need more time.  I’ve been using it for 2 weeks daily and have yet to see any difference, but maybe my neck lines are deeper than others…we shall see. The serum is nice and light weight though and leave my skin feeling very hydrated. Not a miracle worker
