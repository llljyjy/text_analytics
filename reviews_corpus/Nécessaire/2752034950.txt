I love this neck serum— not watery at all, rubs in beautifully, and is unscented. The consistency is thicker than face serums I’ve used (which can be a bit runny / watery)— which I really like. I’m a fan of all of necessaire’s products and was happy to add this to my routine to give my neck a little TLC. Perfect consistency! Love this neck serum
