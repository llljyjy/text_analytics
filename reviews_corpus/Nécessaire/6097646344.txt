I wanted to love this product, but it was a huge miss for me. It leaves a white cast unless blended in intensely layer by layer. The packaging is perhaps even worse, by the second or third day I was using it, I was unable to get any product out of the pump. It seemed to be stuck or faulty. I do not recommend at all. There are way better sunscreens on the market for a fraction of the price. White Cast and Horrible Packaging
