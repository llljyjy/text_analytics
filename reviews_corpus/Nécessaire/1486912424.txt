Sunscreen is a must for me every day, so I’m always excited to try a new one. This sunscreen feels lightweight, absorbs into the skin quickly and leaves just a slight dewiness. I have normal skin and this is all I need to give me both sun protection and long lasting hydration. I don’t need a separate moisturizer when using this sunscreen, and I am very happy about it. While this is a mineral sunscreen, it doesn’t leave a white cast on the face, so it’s great with or without makeup nan
