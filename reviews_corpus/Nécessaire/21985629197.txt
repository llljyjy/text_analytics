I love it. I can apply it under my makeup and it does not interfiere with the components instead I feel it blends well. I do will apply a bit because it is white creamy and with a good massage the cream will disappear which it’s good that a bit goes a long way. Also I use sunscreen to take care my high pigmented acne and scars and this product had help me out.   I have not had any breakouts after using this cream. My skin really appreciate it. It is really gently to my skin. Love that it’s fragrance free. Protects
