Usually i am very sensitive to sunscreen products, my eyes burn as soon as i apply it on my face even when i avoid any application round the eyes area. This sunscreen cream however seems to be safe and goes well under my make as well, without mentioning all the benefits it includes such as Niacinamide and Hyaluronic Acid. Also it doesnâ€™t leave a white cast on my face but i have a pale complexion. Over all i love it, however it is not waterproof so if you have in mind going to the pool or the beach this might not be the one for it, however it is great for an everyday use, Love it
