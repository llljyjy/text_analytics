I normally just pull my face skincare down my neck, but when I was offered The Neck Serum from Necessaire, I was intrigued to try. It is light and silky to apply, with a barely-there-except-for-a-light-floral scent, even though it’s no fragrance added. I’ve been enjoying how hydrated my neck looks without being sticky or greasy. It’s a little pricey,  but a little goes a long way. Would definitely repurchase! dewy soft skin
