Really nice product. It surprised me because it’s a neck serum, but it reminds me more of a lotion. Though, it’s much more moisturizing than a typical lotion and it feels so smooth and just soaks right in. I am not a big fan of scents in facial skincare and this one appears to have a scent but it disappears almost instantly. So I do not mind it at all. I need more time to use it to see if I get results, but I can tell you that the ingredients are absolutely incredible. Incredible Ingredients
