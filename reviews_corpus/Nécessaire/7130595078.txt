This sunscreen is great for my dry skin! It’s hydrating but not greasy. It also doesn’t sting my eyes. I love the finish and my makeup sits beautifully on top. I have a light skin tone and it doesn’t leave a white cast. I also appreciate the added antioxidant protection! This is the perfect mineral spf for me! Love it!
