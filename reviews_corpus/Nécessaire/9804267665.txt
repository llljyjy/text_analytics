I liked Necessary mineral sunscreen overall but some few things i noticed. It’s was a little heavy for my face cause i have oily skin but my husband has dry skin and he loved it so i think this works perfectly for dry skin. Loved that it doesn’t have any fragrance in it. Easy to apply. Super hydrated and because it’s 30 spf i would use it in winter. Perfect for winter
