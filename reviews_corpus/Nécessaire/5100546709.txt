This sunscreen is going to be my new go-to for the rest of the summer! I appreciate that it is unscented and the ingredients are easy on the skin, just like other Necessaire products. I’ve been using it on my chest and arms daily. It doesn’t leave a white cast, isn’t sticky, and it is gentle enough for daily use. The only downside for me is that it isn’t water or sweat proof. nan
