I have used Necessaire’s The Neck Serum $60/1.7oz diligently for the past month on my my neck and décolletage in the morning and before bed. I love how the serum comes in a pump, which makes application super easy. A little product goes a long ways, a small press of the pump provides plenty of coverage along the neck and across the chest.The lightweight serum is moisturizing without being greasy or sticky and feels great on my skin.I’m now in the 40+ age bracket and starting to see lines on my neck. I am a side sleeper on my right and have some creasing on the right side of my neck. It’s a big claim but The Neck Serum somewhat reduced the appearance of the creasing. I don’t have expectations of fine lines or wrinkles disappearing ever but if products can help moisturize and firm, I am all for it.Cons:Does contain Coconut Alkanes and does contain some fragranceI was a skeptic about neck cream but this is a winner for me:I was already a fan of Necessaire products, The Neck Serum did not disappoint. I prefer pump vs tube packaging and I love the dark glass bottle.Very subtle rose fragrance does not bother me.How Necessaire could improve The Neck Serum? Also offer a Fragrance-Free version. Pleasantly Surprised!
