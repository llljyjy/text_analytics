This sunscreen is pretty good. Not completely wowed by it. It has a pump feature which surprised me, I used two pumps and immediately was purple, let it absorb, then rubbed it in further and it blended nicely. Doesn’t feel thick, no scent which is a plus and doesn’t have a sticky residue. She’s cute
