I am a big sunscreen advocate and I sometimes find it hard to find a good sunscreen that accomplishes what I want without leaving me chalking white for hours. The Sunscreen has so many benefits on top of being an SPF. It’s silky texture is the first thing I noticed and it’s non greasy and nom white color were the next. I really love that it’s UVA and UVB protectant as well as à hydrated and pollution protectant. What’s not to love about this product!? nan
