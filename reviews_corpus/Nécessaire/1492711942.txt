I’m so in love with the milky texture of this serum. I love that it doubles as a neck cream as well. I’ve been looking for a good neck cream but a lot of them are too thick for my liking but the Necessaire neck serum absorbs quickly and feels perfect to me. I’m definitely going to continue using it and look forward to the decrease in the lines on my neck. Exactly what I've been looking for!
