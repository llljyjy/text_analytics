I loved the texture. I found that I only needed half a pump to cover my neck and décolleté. I applied it every morning after doing my face skin care. I also loved that it was fragrance free so it didn’t interfere with any perfumes I wanted to spray in that area. Overall I could feel some tightness after 14 days but I didn’t see much improvement in the amount of lines. nan
