This is a face and body spf with very little to no white caste or smell. It gives a natural satin skin finish with a slight tackiness. This is only spf 30 and I wish it was spf 50, but that is my personal preference and really my only complaint. Contains niacidimide, HA, vitamins B5 and E and can be used in place of moisturizer if you prefer. Hypoallergenic which is great for those of us with sensitive skin! So far I am liking this! Looks great on the skin!
