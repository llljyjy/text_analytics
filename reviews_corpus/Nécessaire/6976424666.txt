It comes in a glass bottle with plump packaging, easy to use. The Serum has a creamy lotion-like texture that is lightweight, easily blends into the skin, and absorbs quickly. It doesn’t make skin oily, greasy, or feel heavy! The neck area looks softer, well-hydrated, and a little firm after using this. It’s been only a few days so it’s quite early to give my final judgment, but I am very excited to see the results as I have a tech-neck issue! So far I found it easy to use and a lovely neck serum!! Lovely Neck Serum!
