Now that I’m in my 40s, taking care of your neck is a must. I like this neck serum because unlike other neck creams I’ve tried, this is lightweight and it doesn’t have the smell of perfumes and florals as I like to wear fragrance daily and my other neck creams always clash. I think the “serum“ refers to the consistency as you don’t need to top up with a cream or anything, this is moisturizing enough on its own. nan
