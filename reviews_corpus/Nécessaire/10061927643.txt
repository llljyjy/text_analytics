I was really excited to find another option for sunscreen on my picky skin. I always use a mineral, silicone free sunscreen and this one fit the bill. When I felt the texture and saw how incredibly white the formula was, I knew this was not going to work. I have light-medium skin tone and it’s crazy how bad the white cast on this is. It feels like a very outdated mineral formula, sorry Necessaire! There are so many more skin-like feeling mineral formulas on the market now, this one took a step backwards. not it, I’m sorry Necessaire
