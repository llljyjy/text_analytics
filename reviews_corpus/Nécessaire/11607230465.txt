I love Necessaire products and was excited to try their sunscreen. I really like the bottle it comes in and how easy it is to take on the go. The texture is creamy and lightweight. It does take a minute to absorb into my skin and did feel a bit sticky at first and left a white cast. But eventually the white cast fades and it settles nicely on my face. My makeup went over it well and I didn’t have any residue or piling. It didnt leave my face feeling greasy and gave me a nice glow.Overall it’s a great sunscreen and I will definitely continue to use it. Nice sunscreen!!
