Love the use of peptides in this serum because peptides are clinically proven to work in helping smooth the fine lines. In contrast, niacinamide helps with discoloration and any uneven skin tone. Love how luxurious this is and even tho it is an additional step in my skincare/bodycare routine I love using it at night. I like to bring it down to decolletage as well.  I follow with hydrating body lotion. It keeps my neck firm and lifted and more toned. Great peptide serum!
