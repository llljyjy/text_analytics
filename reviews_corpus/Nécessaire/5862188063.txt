The packaging is lovely, but I don’t think I’d use this on my face. The pump expresses a LOT of product, too much for facial use. It did leave a slight white cast which is definitely a no for someone with a darker complexion. It’s very creamy and smooth in texture which I love. Overall it’s a good sunscreen just not the sunscreen for me. Great texture.
