I’m a huge fan of Necessaire and this sunscreen is no exception! Of course the packaging is adorable, but I really love the formula. It’s medium-weight and very creamy. At first it seems like it might be too thick but it’s not at all. I do need to rub it all the way in so that there isn’t a white cast though, which doesn’t bother me at all. It layers beautifully with makeup too and makes skin look extra dewy. 10/10 would recommend. My kind of fancy sunscreen!
