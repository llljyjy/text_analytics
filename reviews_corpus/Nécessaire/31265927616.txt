I recently received this spf & it is super hydrating!  I love that it has Niacinamide & Hyaluronic Acid in it because my skin feels so dewy & moisturized after use.  I definitely prefer mineral sunscreens & this one does not disappoint.  It has a medium weight texture to it & does take a bit to work into my skin, but afterwards I have a pretty glow to my skin. nan
