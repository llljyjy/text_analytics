I love Neccessaire’s products so when I found out they were putting out a mineral sunscreen, I was so excited to try it! The feel is extremely lightweight, but has that luxury creamy texture. I mixed it with a little bit of a tinted serum so I wasn’t so ghostly looking and it blended perfectly into my skin. Definitely a huge fan! So good!!
