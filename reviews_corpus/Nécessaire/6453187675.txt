As I’ve gotten older, my skin has been more sensitive and I’ve been swapping out my products for more gentle ones. This mineral sunscreen has not irritated my eczema and acne prone skin at all, and my skin feels nourished by the hyaluronic acid and vitamins. Given that it’s zinc based, I haven’t had any issues with a white cast, though my sister (who is more olive toned) experienced a mild white cast when she borrowed it. I like how I’m left with a healthy, dewy glow after application and that it works well with my makeup. I will definitely keep this in my product rotation. Sensitive skin approved
