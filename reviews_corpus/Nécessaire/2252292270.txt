I don’t have sensitive skin but I somehow struggle with sunscreens. My skin often breaks out and looks very full when I use sunscreen but this is different. I love how it absorbs in my skin without any sticky or white cast. It goes  well under makeup and doesn’t make my skin breakout. I did not notice any adverse affect using this sun protection Good Sun protection
