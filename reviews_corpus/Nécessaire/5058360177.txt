This is a really nice, lightweight serum that soaks in fairly quickly and doesn’t leave a sticky feel behind.  After a solid month of use I did see that my neck appeared softer and more hydrated than before. I’m 40 and don’t have thin, wrinkled skin - but ... you could tell I had aged. I didn’t notice a HUGE difference but enough that it was worth using. The neck area was ignored for a long time so reversing entirely will be out of the question, but some improvement is nice.
