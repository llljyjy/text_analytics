The Necessaire Neck Serum is a lightweight cream serum with a silky texture. In addition to adding moisture, it makes my neck feel smoother. I have only been using this for a week so I cannot judge longterm results but I can tell you that using my typical facial moisturizers on my neck do not make it feel as smooth and silky as the Necessaire product does. It isnâ€™t greasy or fragranced. I am really enjoying this! This product was gifted. Wow! Better than a regular moisturizer
