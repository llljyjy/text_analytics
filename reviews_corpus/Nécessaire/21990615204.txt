Is there anything Necessaire makes that isn’t good? This is seriously an amazing serum I’m currently laying under a neck cream both morning and evening. I love that it’s fragrance free so there aren’t any drying components especially when your neck needs that extra moisture during these summer months when we’re typically exposed to more sun. nan
