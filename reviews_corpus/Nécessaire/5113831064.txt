Probably the best mineral sunscreen I’ve tried! Truly Blown away by this product. I was so shocked by how it blended into my skin. I have darker skin so I always have trouble with the white casts from mineral sunscreen, this one had absolutely none! Literally looked as if I didn’t even put anything on, except skin seemed a little more moisturized of course. I love that is 20% zinc oxide and no harmful checmical sunscreens. Not to mention there’s also Hyaluronic acid and niacinamide, definitely a plus. I feel like this is great as a stand alone and perfect for under makeup! This will be my new go to, not sure if anything can top this one! Absolutely obsessed!!
