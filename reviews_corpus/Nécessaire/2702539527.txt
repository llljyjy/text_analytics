Love this sunscreen! Most people donâ€™t realize that mineral sunscreens tend to be thicker and whiter. But the benefits of the ingredients make it worth it. I built up little by little blending on pump into my skin and it looked great! Cute packaging too. Not many sunscreens at sephora are non nano zinc so I love this option! nan
