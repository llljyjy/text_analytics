I love this stuff. Was super excited to try it. There is zero fragrance and it glides on very smooth. It isnâ€™t tacky like some sunscreens are known to be. I will note that because it has zinc oxide it has a tendency to have a white cast so it may not be appropriate all over your face depending if you care about that or not. nan
