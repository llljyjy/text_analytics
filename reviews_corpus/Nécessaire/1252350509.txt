I love the clean ingredients in this mineral spf. Non-nano zinc is reef-safe, which I can appreciate. The added skincare ingredients, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, are a huge bonus! This does take a while to work into the skin. There is a bit of a white cast and a slightly sticky finish until the product absorbs completely. Not great if you are in a hurry. I have other sunscreens that I would reach for over this one. Takes a while to absorb into the skin
