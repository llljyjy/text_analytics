This is a 100% mineral sunscreen formula that includes 20% Zinc Oxide (Non-Nano), Laminaria Saccharina, Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide and Panthenol. Being a physical sunscreen the whole experience is completely different to that of a chemical or combination formula and comes with its shortcomings such as it not being sweat or water resistant. The presentation is great for easy transport (fits most purses) and the pump makes it easy to handle without much of a mess. The formula is thick, leaves a very faint white cast and feels incredibly hydrating. However, it left a more greasy rather than glowy finish on my face which is not what I’m going for. With it not being sweat resistant it requires constant reapplying if you’re outside or it’s a very hot day. My main issue with that is the chalky sensation it left on my hands. Overall it wasn’t my favorite formula but is an option if you’re looking for a 100% mineral sunscreen. I will probably use it up on my body but won’t be repurchasing.Do you prefer mineral or chemical sunscreens?*PR / gifted in exchange of my honest opinion nan
