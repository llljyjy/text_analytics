I am constantly testing out new sunscreens looking for my new holy grail and couldn’t wait to get my hands on this mineral sunscreen. Unfortunately, upon application I found that it was hard to rub into my skin, left a white cast and a slight stinging to my face. I tired a few different means of application in conjunction with my other skincare and still found it challenging to rub in. Once I did rub it in, I was left with a satin finish and a slight white cast. I’m disappointed because I love so many of Necessaire’s products, but I think this one will have to be a body only sunscreen. nan
