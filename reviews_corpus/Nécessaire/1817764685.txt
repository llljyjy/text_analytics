I really wanted to like this. And there are some good things about this product. But in the end, it’s a no from me. I received this product free from Necessaire. I am a huge fan of their products, and their new deodorant is one of few I found that works for me. So I was excited to try this. On first application of just a pea sized amount, I was amazed at how smooth the texture was. I also love that it’s unscented and doesn’t have that yucky sunscreen smell. But the cast, oh the cast. It’s just unacceptable. I’m glad they don’t market it as sheer, but it’s hardly workable even on my NC 42 skin tone. It takes a ton of blending to make it somewhat presentable on the face, and while I’m glad this didn’t irritate my eczema, the end result was less than stellar. I even tried it on my body, but the white case was super noticeable. Unfortunately this is a miss for me. Love the brand, but no
