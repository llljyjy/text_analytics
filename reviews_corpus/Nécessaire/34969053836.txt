TLDR: Perfect makeup base for powder foundation, pump packaging puts out the exact amount you need in one pump, no smell at all!, can use in place of moisturizer, doesn’t irritate my eyes. As a sunscreen junkie, I’ve tried all kinds. I think this one is best suited to those with sensitive, dry skin who enjoy a moisturized/dewy feel. It is a thicker formula, but with a whipped feel that makes it smooth on quickly & evenly. It does take a minute to work into the skin, & I am pretty sure this would leave at least a temporary white cast on darker skin tones - I have light skin & could see the cast on myself until I had worked it fully into the skin. The finish is emollient, dewy, & slightly tacky, which makes it absolutely perfect as a makeup base! It works fantastically with my powder foundations, which I prefer using in summer over liquid formulas, but have a hard time making them look good on my dry/combo skin. This helps them apply evenly & avoid any dry patches. Also, the best feature of this sunscreen: it has NO SMELL! Seriously, absolutely no scent that I can detect. I haven’t tried it on my body yet but I love it as a moisturizing makeup base. Also, I love that the pump spits out just 1/4 tsp at a time, which is exactly what I need for face & neck. This is a win for me! Really, really good mineral sunscreen for dry skin
