This sunscreen looks good on my skin.. I have a dry skin, with this sunscreen on my skin doesn’t look dry.. It kinda look and feels hydrating.. It doesn’t leave white cast and it gives a little glow.. It doesn’t feel heavy and it doesn’t leave sticky feeling.. I just wish the spf is higher like 50 or more.. Works great!
