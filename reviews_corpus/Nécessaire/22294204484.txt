For the few days I was able to use this, it was excellent, and it was going to be my new go-to sunblock. It worked so well on my dry skin, it wasn’t giving me acne, the white cast you usually get with Zinc Oxide sunscreens faded significantly about 10-15 minutes after application, and I had no trouble wearing makeup over it. The biggest selling point for me is the fact that the ingredients list is so trustworthy. ...But the pump broke before I could even use up 1/3 of the bottle, and it can’t be pulled open without significant effort, which of course would break the bottle. As of right now I have no plan of repurchasing, but if they could just change the packaging I’d be completely willing to give it another chance Good product, but packaging makes it unusable
