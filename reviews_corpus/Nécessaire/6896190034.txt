I have been testing Out the sunscreen by Necessaire and am really enjoying it . It is a broad spectrum mineral SPF of 30 for face and body . I like their neat and efficient packaging made from recycled materials . The pump helps with mess free application. I love that it’s fragrance free and also free from hormone disrupting chemicals . It is easy to blend. I pat it into the skin instead of rubbing it. I have tan skin and this doesn’t leave a white cast on me. It gives me a lit from within glow which I love . Looks great under makeup too . Glowing even toned skin
