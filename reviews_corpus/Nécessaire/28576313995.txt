I shouldn’t be surprised that I love this product! Everything from Necessaire is amazing! I own every single product from the brand and I am obsessed! It is so hydrating, easy to blend, and doesn’t leave a white cast! I am a big fan of the mineral filters, plus the added HA and Niacinamide make it such a complete package. I have sensitive skin and this one did not irritate at all! It is a bit on the pricey side but if you love this brand, you won’t be disappointed! Get the protected summer glow!!! If you love Necessaire, get this!!!!
