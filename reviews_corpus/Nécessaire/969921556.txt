I received this in exchange for my review and I’m really enjoying it! It’s a mineral formal, medium thickness, so there’s a slight white cast when applying it at first, but it goes away quickly. It sits well on the skin; no pilling. It feels nice on the skin, not too heavy. I enjoy using it on both my fave and body and I like the pump bottle. This is a great SPF with fab ingredients, and I have zero complaints about this! So good!
