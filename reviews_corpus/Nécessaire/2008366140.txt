I’ve only gotten to use this for a week so far but I’m hoping that it continues showing benefits since we all know tech neck is a thing! My skin is definitely more nourished and I feel as though it feels slightly more firm. The application is easy and it hasn’t irritated my sensitive skin. It’s not overly fragrant or chemically smelling. Im hoping with continued use I will see lasting benefits! I will update after using for a month. nan
