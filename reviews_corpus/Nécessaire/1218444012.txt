I’m a huge fan of this brand and this neck serum is on point. I use it at night in the final step of my PM routine. I actually leave the bottle on my night stand so I won’t forget. I love it! It smells nice and isn’t sticky. I have only been using it for a week, but I think I’ve noticed some tightening up in my neck. Can’t wait for the long term effects! Perfection!
