I received the Necessaire Mineral Sunscreen complimentary for testing and review. The standout ingredients are definitely the Niacinamide and Hyaluronic Acid and I love the simple packaging. My favorite thing about this sunscreen is that it’s mineral based and great for sensitive/acne prone skin. I’ve had no issues with breakouts despite its thick texture. A warning for those with darker skin, this product has strong white cast but that is typical of mineral sunscreens. The price is to be expected and there are definitely more affordable options on the market but if you’re of fan of the brand I think it’s a good product to try. nan
