I was so excited to see that necessarie came out with an spf! I think the packaging is so cute, but most importantly the ingredients are amazing. When I applied it there is a white cast which is basically the norm with most mineral based sunscreens. So this wouldnâ€™t be a great option for POC. Which I would say is a a big down side to this. It did take a while for my to blend it out. However it did leave a nice satin finish on the skin and it was hydrating. But the white cast never fully went away. Almost amazing!
