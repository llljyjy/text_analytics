I am huge fan of Necessaire products! I have been loving the sun screen in how easy it goes on and blends nicely in. I have been applying it everyday while sitting at our pool and love how it has no PEGS and Silicones. Very light in smell which I love because one thing about sunscreen is it usually has a smell it to that is very strong. Love this sunscreen
