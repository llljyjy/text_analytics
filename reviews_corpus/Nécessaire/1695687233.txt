Necessaire just gets it! This neck cream is the best. It’s silky, moisturizing, sinks into my skin, and overall has the perfect consistency. I already notice a difference in my neck and chest. They both look more supple, moisturized, and smoother. I use a small amount and massage in an upward lotion on my neck, and then apply the rest on my chest area. Once those areas start aging, they can be harder to reverse so start early! Yes, the price tag is a bit high but this bottle should easily last 6 months or so. You don’t need much! My new go to Neck Serum!
