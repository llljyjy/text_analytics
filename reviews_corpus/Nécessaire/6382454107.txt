What i love about this sunscreen is how easy it is to rub in, and on my tanned skin you can’t even tell I’m using a 20% zinc oxide sunscreen! It feels pretty weightless on the skin too, not so thick or heavy. It also feels moisturizing! I’m happy with this one and it will be in my beach bag from here on out. I’ve tried hundreds of sunscreens and this one has added HA, and vitamin E this one is well worth it. In my picture, my left leg has the SPF. You can only tell because it looks extra hydrated. So moisturizing!
