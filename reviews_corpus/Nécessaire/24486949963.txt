This sunscreen makes my skin feel so silky and hydrated and looks perfect under my makeup. I love that this sunscreen has hyaluronic acid in it. It’s so hydrating and feels more like putting on moisturizer than a sticky sunscreen. I apply a pump to my hand and then pat it into my face and continue to press it into my skin until my whole face is generously covered. I was worried it might burn my eyes if I sweat while wearing it because it’s not a waterproof sunscreen, however I never noticed any issues even being in the 100 degree heat this weekend. I really love this sunscreen and it’s generously sizes as well! Very Hydrating!
