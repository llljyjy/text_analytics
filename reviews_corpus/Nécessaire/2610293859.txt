First, the packaging on this spf is so cute. It’s also a great size to take with you for reapplication. Now onto the product itself. This does leave the tiniest bit of a white cast but I really like how this feels on my skin, it’s smooth and creates a nice base for makeup. I’ve also been using it on my body and have not broken out like I do with some other sunscreens. Overall a good spf! nan
