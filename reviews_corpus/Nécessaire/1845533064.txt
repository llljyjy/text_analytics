I love everything I’ve ever tried with Necessaire and this neck serum was one I was super excited to try! I have some fine lines and wrinkles already on my neck (I’m 40). I like the plastic packaging and the simplistic easy to push pump. And unfortunately that’s where it stops for me. I can’t use this like I wanted as it has a strong roses scent and I’m allergic to roses so I patch tested and broke out into hives. So if you’re allergic to roses or ingredients, check the list. I’m sad and it says fragrance free which maybe they didn’t add additional fragrances per se, but it is so strong of roses that I wouldn’t be able to use it. nan
