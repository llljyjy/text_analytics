I’m a big fan of the Nécessaire products, especially for sensitive skin and I had high expectations for this sunscreen because it’s a product i use daily. However I’m not a huge fan. It’s a good product overall but it didn’t go on as seemlessly as i had hoped, and it felt as though it left a slight white cast on my face and didn’t love it under the makeup. It’s a good product to use on the body at the beach. Slightly disappointed
