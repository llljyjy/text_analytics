I was really excited to test out this SPF because I absolutely adore any products that this brand releases. It does say it’s a body SPF in addition to face, but I will say with the size of the packaging there is no way that you could apply this on your body. As for being a face spf, it’s incredible. I love the formulation it’s incredibly hydrating it does take a moment to blend out and it leaves a slight white cast. The finish is very pretty, not super glowy but not matte. Overall I think it’s good, but it is a little pricey. Hydrating mineral spf!
