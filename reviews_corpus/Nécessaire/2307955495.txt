Beautiful mineral formula! I gave melasma and never skip SPF. Recently only using the mineral kind, and some of them are pretty drying. This Necessaire formula is pleasant, water, glides easily! It does give a white cast at first, but after few seconds of rubbing in it does go away and melts into the skin. It’s none irritating and does not sting my eyes at the end of the day. Absolutely love the ingredients! And its not scented. I don’t get a heavy spf smell. Love this travel friendly bottle
