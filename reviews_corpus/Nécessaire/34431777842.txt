The first thing that appeals to me about this SPF is the extra goodies in it, that mirror the other Necessaire products. The skin loving ingredients of niacinamide and vit e go such a long way for me. This SPF is so light weight, almost watery, so my skin adores the extra hydration. I like that this is 100% mineral as I can apply the same spf to myself and my one year old without worrying. I can also apply this over irritated skin. It is so important to always apply your spf every day! This is a convenient purse size to bring with you for reapplication. It is worth noting this is not waterproof, so you do need to really!! Light, mineral spf
