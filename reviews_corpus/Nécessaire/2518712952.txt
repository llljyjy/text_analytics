This is definitely another staple from Necessaire! I love the texture of this sunscreen, itâ€™s easy to apply, and it blends beautifully into the skin without too much effort. There is no white cast once it absorbs into the skin. To me this feels more like skincare because of the amazing ingredients such as Niacinamide and Hyaluronic Acid. It has a light scent that dissipates after a few minutes and the glow this gives my skin is beautiful! A definite MUST
