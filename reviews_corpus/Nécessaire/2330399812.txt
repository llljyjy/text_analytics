This sunscreen is truly wonderful. I absolutely loved the list of ingredients. Mineral sunscreen is great for sensitive skin as mine. It feels so good on the skin, leaves it protected and moisturized at the same time. This product is a daily must have. I love that it has no silicones and that it can be used on the face and body. Best sunscreen I have ever had!
