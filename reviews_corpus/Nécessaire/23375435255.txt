Okay, so the first few days of using this I was like “????“.  However, I found a great routine with it and I LOVE IT!  Before doing my makeup, I do my skincare, rub a pump of this on my face, neck, and chest THOROUGHLY (make sure to really rub it in to avoid a white cast) and let it sit for about 5-10mins while I rub lotion on the rest of my body.  By that time, the sunscreen has dried down and left a beautiful glow on the face.  This right here?  Amazing.  Allow it time to sit and settle and you’ll never go back.  This is a new must have! YES!
