It is a great sunscreen for the body . I tried it for the face as well but I feel it works better for the body than for the face. It does take some time to absorb. I like that it doesn’t have any scent to it the packaging is very pretty and the pump is convenient and easy to use. Also it’s very hydrating, it gives your skin a beautiful glow . It’s a perfect body sunscreen to keep in your purse to reapply your sunscreen throughout your day. Great sunscreen for the body
