Your neck is one of the first areas to show signs of aging so when Necessaire developed a product dedicated to your neck I knew I wanted to try it. It has a very nice consistency, a silky smooth serum feel and a nice mid range viscosity (not runny and not overly rich or thick). It pumps out the perfect amount to fully saturate your neck and down onto your décolleté, leaving your skin feeling smooth and very hydrated. No oily or greasy residue but more of a moisturized feel once it is rubbed in. Also it’s competently fragrance free. I have not seen any noticeable differences in my neck after two weeks of use but am excited to continue to use it daily if anything for prevention purposes. Amazing ingredients for aging prevention
