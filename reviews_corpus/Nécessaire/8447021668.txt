I am so into mineral SPF products lately. Especially with zinc - it makes my oily skin less shiny. And I absolutely love that there’s hyaluronic acid and niacinamides in it - these ingredients works super nice for my skin. The packaging is great - I love the pump on it. And it’s also sleek and elegant.  Price point is also ok. Me like this. Great ingenuity
