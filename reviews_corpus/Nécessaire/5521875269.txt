I love the feel of this serum on my skin, so lightweight & moisturizing! It leaves my neck feeling very hydrated & soft & it absorbs beautifully! After using for about a month once or twice daily I feel like my skin is in better condition, itâ€™s softer & much more hydrated which has led to less noticeable wrinkles & folds. It definitely has improved the look of my neck! Lightweight & very moisturizing!
