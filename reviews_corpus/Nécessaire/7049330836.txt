Typically I love every Necessaire product and while this sunscreen is good it’s not my favorite of their products. I love the ingredients, that it’s hypoallergenic, and that applies similar to regular lotion. The size is certainly more suitable for face. If you were to use it on your entire body it wouldn’t last long and would be very expensive. One full pump however is too much product for just the face. There is a white/blue tint upon application I assume from the zinc. If you rub it in it will absorb but just something to note. nan
