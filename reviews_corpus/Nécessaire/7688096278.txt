I was very excited to use this as I have issues with my neck and double chin. Unfortunately I saw no results. BUT that could be because I had to go on a dose of steroids and I always puff up so it ended up being unfortunate timing for me. I plan to set aside what I have left and give it another go once I’ve released the water weight and hope to see some markable results. Overall it’s a very beautiful serum and easy to implement into one’s routine. hopefully it works the second time around
