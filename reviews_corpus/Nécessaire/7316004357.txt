It has absolutely no scent to it! It does not feel greasy and tacky like most sunscreens. Doesnâ€™t smell like a sunscreen either, or anything. Never seen a sunscreen in such a nice mustard color bottle before. Product comes out like a facial serum dispenser. Layers well with makeup, as well. This stuff is really good! Love this sunscreen!
