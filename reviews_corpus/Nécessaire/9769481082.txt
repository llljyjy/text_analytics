I love this mineral sunscreen it is so amazing, it’s perfect under make up moisturizer with spf. Texture is rich and creamy and absorbs very well. It doesn’t leave white cast afterwards. I love the cute packaging  and easy to apply on my skin. I think it’s perfect for my dry skin i will buy and recommend to others. So hydrating sunscreen
