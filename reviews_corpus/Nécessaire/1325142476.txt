I absolutely love everything necessaire has came out with and this is another product that I love. It has such a nice finish and doesnâ€™t leave a white cast. It leaves a really nice finish and works well under makeup as well. The ingredients are great from sensitive skin and I love that it has niacinamide as well. I use this all over my neck chest and face and the pump makes it super easy to use. It absorbs quickly and has no fragrance nan
