This is my first time trying this brand but upon receiving it I love the minimalist packaging and sleek design of the bottle. The serum goes on nice and light but very hydrating and doesnâ€™t leave any sticky or oily residue. It goes on very well and the skin absorbs it quickly. It has a light scent and the pump dispenses the perfect amount. I love that this serum is made specifically for the neck as I do have some lines already and want to prevent any further aging on my neck. nan
