20% zinc oxide?! I was expecting this to be super thick and white but it was actually very easy to rub in and light feeling (without feeling drying). No grittiness and a nice light moisturizing formula. Yes there was a slight white cast but I haven’t yet found an SPF with this much zinc that doesn’t. Love the airless pump. nan
