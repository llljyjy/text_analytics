As a HUGE fan of all things Necessaire and being a woman over 40, I was thrilled to try their new Neck Serum and it does not disappoint! Loaded with peptides, this serum sinks into the skin and hydrates the skin while giving an instant and cumulative lifting and firming effect to the neck and décolleté area. I’ll be incorporating this into my daily routine for the unforeseen future to help prevent sagging and crepiness and highly recommend this to others with similar concerns! Loving It!
