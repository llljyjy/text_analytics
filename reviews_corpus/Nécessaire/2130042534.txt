I absolutely love this sunscreen. I love that it has hyaluronic acid and niacinamide to nourish and replenish skin while protecting it. The mineral formula means it takes a little longer to absorb and work into the skin, but it does blend in beautifully and doesn’t feel greasy or tacky. It’s completely fragrance free which is another plus. Packaging is adorable and the size is perfect for throwing in my bag! Easy to use and effective
