So innovative and exciting when it comes to mineral sunscreens. Love that I can use it in place of my moisturizer because it’s very hydrating and has hyuluronic acid and other great ingredients. I reapply it several times since it’s not water or sweat proof - which is very easy to do and 100% worth it. Amazing product and good for the reef too. Love it
