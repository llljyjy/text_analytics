I was so excited to try Nècessaire sunscreen and I absolutely love it! First off, it’s clean and planet positive as well as reef safe spf which is very important to me! I love that it’s free of silicones and PEGs so it doesn’t leave you with that greasy sunscreen feeling, which makes it easy for me to use everyday. You can use it for your face and body as well. It pairs great with my makeup routine, I just put it on after my moisturizer and before my makeup and you could never tell, but I feel protected all day! I highly recommend this sunscreen!! Totally obsessed!!
