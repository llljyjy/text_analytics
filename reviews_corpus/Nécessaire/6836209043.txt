It’s everything I’ve been looking for in a mineral sunscreen…It’s so lightweight, it absorbs quickly, non greasy and hydrating. Plus it leaves my face with  a natural glow.Definitely a must have for the summer, it works amazingly on my combination skin, since it’s non-comedogenic. Get that natural glow!
