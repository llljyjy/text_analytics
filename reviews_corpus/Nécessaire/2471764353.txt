Yay for clean beauty sunscreen! I love a two in one skin care solution so I’m happy for this sunscreen that’s also moisturizing! I definitely can feel the moisture as it applies pretty dewy. However, applying it is a little tedious because you have to pat it in other wise it will pill. It’s hard to spread around that way, so it’s just something to keep in mind. I love the bottle and how there’s no strong smell or crazy white cast. nan
