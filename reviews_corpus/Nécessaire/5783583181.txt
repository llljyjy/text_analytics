As I am entering in my mid 30s one of my biggest concerns is the lack of firmness, especially in the neck area. This Neck Serum from Necessaire has been a great addition to my nighttime routine. I have been using it every single night for a month now and I can say that IT WORKS.  The serum has a nice texture that goes into my skin easily and a little bit goes a long way. It has a pleasant scent and a good list of ingredients. It works well with my established skincare routine. What I have noticed was a visible improvement in my neck area that became firmer and smoother. Now thatâ€™s a winner for me! YES to this product!
