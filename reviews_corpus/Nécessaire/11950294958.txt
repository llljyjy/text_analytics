This is a great sunscreen for more individuals (like me) that have dry + sensitive skin. I have always had issues with chemical sunscreens causing irritation when used on my face (particularly around the eyes + on/around the lips). This 100% mineral SPF causes me zero irritation whatsoever, and leave your skin with a healthy glow.2 things I noticed however that are important to note are that if I use it on top of certain serums, I noticed it does pill. It also pills if I use pore-blurring/mattifying primers on top of it. I did find however that I can press tinted powder-based mineral SPF on top of it without any pilling. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, just more of a need to know how to use the product to avoid pilling. Lastly, it does leave a white cast (even on my already light skin), however this isn’t an issue after it absorbs more and you lightly press on it before applying a tinted spf powder on top of it. All in all, I enjoy this product, however have tried a couple other 100% mineral sunscreens recently that I’ve enjoyed just as much without having to worry about the pilling issue. I do see this being a holy grail product for individuals with dry/sensitive + fair skin tones that are not really applying anything on top it this! Great SPF Once You Learn How To Use
