I am picky with sunscreen but this one is easy to apply I can blend it into my skin and it leaves almost white cast, specially if I blend it in for a little bit. I like that it is zinc-based because thatâ€™s what my dermatologist recommended for me and overall always love necessaire products! Good zinc formula
