I thought this sunscreen was pretty good. Definitely not my favorite but I did like it for what it was! I love that there is hyaluronic acid & niacinamide because they work to hydrate & protect the skin. I found that it left the slightest white case & that it did feel greasy even after it had time to absorb. I love that there is no fragrance! Since it isn’t water/sweat proof I wouldn’t recommend wearing to the pool or if your going to be sweaty. I liked it!
