WOW! The Necessaire neck serum with peptide is really nice! My 59 year old neck is showing visible signs of aging: laxity, some crepiness and rings!  When I first tried the serum I was surprised on how hydrating it was! Iâ€™ve now been using it for about two weeks and although the results are not similar to plastic surgery, my neck does seem more hydrated and less crepey! Hydrating serum!
