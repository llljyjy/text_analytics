I love Necessaire products so I was so excited to try this and it did not disappoint! This is probably my new favorite sunscreen. It is light and so hydrating on the skin and does not leave a white caste. The ingredients are also great! It leaves your skin feeling great and also protects you from the sun! I canâ€™t wait to keep using this summer. nan
