I am loving this SPF.  The pump gives you just enough on the first pump to cover your face. It dries down to a nice satin type finish. The only downfall is that it isnâ€™t sweat resistant which makes this something I can only use in the winter or at home since I live somewhere where the weather is 100+ most of the summer and very humid. Lovely finish
