Great basic sunscreen! It’s not drying on the skin and not too whitening. I can barely feel it on my skin once applied. I can apply my regular foundation on top, and it goes on smoothly and doesn’t cake. The only thing is that it’s pretty thick and it’s a little tricky to you to spread it evenly as it dries up pretty quickly. nan
