This is a really nice all mineral sunscreen. First of all, I love the classic necessaire packaging and the pump as it makes it easy to measure how much product you’re using and also makes it more sanitary and stable.I like to use this in the morning after cleansing and moisturizing but making sure my moisturizer has fully absorbed to avoid pilling (if it’s an especially hot humid day I will skip moisturizer and use this sunscreen instead). I like to press this on gently instead of rubbing it in again to avoid pilling. It sits well on top of other skincare and under makeup.I like that it has ingredients like niacinamide to brighten the skin and Hyaluronic Acid as it also hydrates it.It does not feel greasy or heavy on the skin and it reapplies well.Overall I’m really enjoying this product and highly recommend for your next mineral SPF! Great mineral sunscreen
