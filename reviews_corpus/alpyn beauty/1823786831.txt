I am absolutely enjoying the new juneberry and collagen cream cleanser.Texture is super creamy and has super tiny beads which gives an exfoliating feel. I love to use it as a mask, I just keep it on for 2-3 minutes and wash it off. A little goes a long way.This leaves skin smooth, clean and hydrated.I am loving the light herbal scent as well.I would say overall a great sensorial experience. Overall a sensorial experience
