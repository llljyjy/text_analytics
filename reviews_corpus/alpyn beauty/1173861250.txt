I love this exfoliating mask! Yup, my face feels as smooth as a baby’s you know what! I have been dealing with autoimmune skin flushing, and have very sensitive skin, so I turn a bit pink after use. But it isn’t a big deal. I follow up with the Alpyn moisturizer and Laneige Cica sleeping mask. I also feel great about using this since I’m a big fan of the Grand Tetons, Jackson Hole, WY where this is made. So psychologically, it is comforting to use an effective product from a place that holds many wonderful, nature filled memories for me. nan
