I’m obsessed with this cream cleanser! It feels like such a luxury product when applying it to my face. The jojoba beads mixed in with the cold cream makes for the perfect texture & consistency. I applied this product like a face mask and left it on for about 5 minutes per the suggestion on the package and I feel like it gave my skin an extra glow. I absolutely love the way my skin looks after using this product. I’m already looking forward to getting this product again once I start to run low. Obsessed with this cream cleanser!
