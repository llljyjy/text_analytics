I haven’t actually tried the mask yet, but opening the packaging was disappointing. It’s already a small jar and to be almost half full was disappointing. Even if I like the results of it once I try it, I probably won’t re purchase because to me you don’t get enough product for the price and I can buy similar masks with more product and similar cost. deceiving packaging, jar not even full
