I really love the way Alpyn cleanser leaves my skin feeling hydrated after each use. My skin is very sensitive and tends to dry out, especially after using a cleanser. Since I started using Alpyn, my face feels very soft and I have to resist the temptation of touching it)) Overall, a great cleanser! Plus, the cooling sensation feels like a spa treatment on my skin after a long day of wearing makeup. Feels very refreshing on my skin!
