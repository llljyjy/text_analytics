In all honesty one of my favorite things about this mask is the color, it reminds me of a tropical fruit or maybe like a nice smoothie on a hot summer day, the color is definitely fun, now to the actual formula, I feel like this is a very nice lip mask and I do like the fact that it’s nice and sweet because of the agave in it, but I do feel like it’s a little bit pricey for what you’re paying, I feel like the lip mask market is so oversaturated right now and there are so many options, you have to be a little bit more unique to justify this price point, other than that it’s a really nice product, thank you :) Nice but pricey :)
