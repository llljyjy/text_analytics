I received the bearberry and vitamin c glow serum free as a trial from Alpyn. I want to share that the company is amazing and I am passionate about their entire line. With that being said, I feel this serum enhances the appearance of bare skin, but I struggled with its performance under my Neutrogena Hydro Boost foundation. My recommendation is to make sure you let it dry first before applying foundation. The end result is that it does give a beautiful glow, so try it to see if itâ€™s right for you. The serum that worked wonders for me is their Wild Nettle & Niacinamide Firming Serum. It dries matte and worked great under my foundation without any issues and definitely has a firming effect!
