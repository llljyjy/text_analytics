This is a great find and multi-taking serum.  This plant based survival serum by Alpyn Beauty is a win. It contains vitamin c for brightening, hyaluronic acid and squalane for hydration , and my new favorite ingredient, bakuchiol, for fine lines. The packaging is beautiful and the serum itself has a glorious shimmer. I usually do not like glitter or shimmer but this doesnâ€™t leave glitter specks on your face. It just adds radiance and glow. The smell of the product is a bit natural or earthy to me. It feels great on the skin. Definitely worth checking out! multiple benefits !
