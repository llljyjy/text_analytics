I bought this cleanser as part of a travel set and it one of my favorites. Adds instant brightness to my skin without drying. I absolutely love every Alpyn product I’ve tried so far (Melt Moisturizer, Huckleberry Polishing Peel and Bounce Cream. (Alpyn gifted me with Bounce, but I was already hooked :) Love the subtle scents and, of course, that they are infused with wild botanicals. I am an “un-makeup“ person, so the whole line feels simple and clean. Can I say, they are a joy to use! Their creams and serums get all the love, but the cleanser is also a keeper. A keeper
