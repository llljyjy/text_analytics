Iâ€™m really loving this cleanser! I have been searching and searching for the one and finallly found it. Most importantI love how it removes all my makeup  which is hard to find. I leave it on for 5 min for extra hydration. My skin feels super refreshed and clean but not overly dry like some cleaners do!It feels like a spa day every time I wash my face :)The feeling of my face being refreshed and clean is a wonderful feeling after a long day! Excellent product!! Super happy!!
