Iâ€™ve been using Juneberry & Collagen Hydrating Cold Cream Cleanser for the last month, and my skin never felt so clean and refreshed. This product is truly amazing. It is gently yet thoroughly and easily removes dirt, oils, makeup, exfoliates dryness and leaves skin soft, radian and smooth. Also, yah, this cleaner is a bit costly, but  in my opinion it worth every Penny as it lasts a long time and the results are unparalleled. This is one of the BEST cleansers
