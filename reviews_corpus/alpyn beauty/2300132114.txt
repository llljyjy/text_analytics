This cleanser is fantastic! A little goes a long way and it leaves my face feeling fresh, and moisturized (but not oily). It has a faint and natural fresh smell but nothing too perfumey or overpowering. I have eczema and when my skin is even mildly irritated some products sting but this cleanser so far just gives a soothing cleansing effect. It doesnâ€™t create too much lather but it does effectively remove makeup and oil. 10/10 I would introduce this into my forever skincare routine! New addition to my sensitive skincare routine
