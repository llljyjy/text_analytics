I received this product from Cohley for my honest review and I honestly LOVE the Juneberry & Collagen Cleanser. I’ve been using this to kickstart my mornings. I like using it as a mask and leaving it on while I get ready. It leaves me feeling refreshed and my skin hydrated and glowing. The texture of the product is pleasant and very easily glides onto my skin. The cooling sensation energizes me without feeling too overwhelming like other brands products I have used. This has been a go-to and I’ve been using it almost daily since receiving it. I will probably purchase more once I run out! nan
