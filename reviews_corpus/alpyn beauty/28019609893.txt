Not what I expected but not exactly bad. I was expecting a taste but this doesn’t really taste like anything, good for those who don’t like flavored lip product. It doesn’t smell either.Mine seems to be quite hard in texture and quite hard to get the product, but surprisingly it’s quite moisturizing. The plumping seems to come after a little while too.
