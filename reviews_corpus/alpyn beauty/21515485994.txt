I LOVE the smell of this cleanser, and I love using it, however the results aren’t great. I’ve been using it for 5 months now.  It does remove makeup, but not deeply-- like, it will remove mascara, but not bronzer. This was my first Alpyn product, and I will try others because I love it’s clean ingredients and aroma. However this cleanser also brought back the clogged pores on my nose, and my skin never felt really clean after using it. I have combo skin with an oily forehead, nose/bridge and chin, and it’s not very good for the oily areas. Would probably work fine on dry skin. Final complaint; it stings your eyes, like, a lot, which is surprising for a facial cleanser. Smells lovely, removes makeup, stings eyes, oily
