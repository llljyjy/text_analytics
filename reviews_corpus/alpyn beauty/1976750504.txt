This is the 2nd product I’m trying by Alpyn and so far I’m really pleased. For my undereyes, I’m always looking for products to help with hydration to prevent wrinkles and to help me look more awake. I’ve been using the Alpyn eye balm for three weeks now and I’ve noticed the thick texture definitely helps moisturize and lock in hydration in my undereyes. I also love that the formula is thick and creamy and glides on very smoothly without pulling or tugging my skin. The caffeine helps reduce puffiness and gives my eyes that overall more awake look.  As for my dark circles, I haven’t noticed much improvement yet but I know that it will take longer than a few weeks to see results. Overall I think this is a great eye balm and that too at a reasonable price point. Great Option and Reasonable Pricepoint
