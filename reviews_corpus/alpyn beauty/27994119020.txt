when I first applied this lip Mask there was like there is grains of exfoliate on my lips which felt really weird and I didn’t know if that was supposed to be there or not and i didn’t like that feeling at all for a lip mask. Besides that there’s not a sensation of lip plumping happening at all but I can say it is a really nice and thick formula which I like, it makes my lips nice and soft . Just okay
