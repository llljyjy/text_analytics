I’ve been using the Alpyn Beauty Firming Serum for a lil over 2 weeks now and i haven’t noticed a change in my skins firmness yet, but I will continue using it and hope it will improve over the time. What i did noticed though was that my skin overall is way clearer, shinier and healthy looking. I use it in the morning and at night. I love that it is really easy to dosage and apply. It’s creamy texture makes it easy to spread and it dries up quickly without leaving a greasy film on the skin. Overall I’m very satisfied with the serum and i hope it’s benefits will be more visible over the time. Definitely worth a try!
