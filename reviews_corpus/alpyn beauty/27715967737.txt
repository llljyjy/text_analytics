I was gifted this lovely Plant Genius Line-Filling Eye Balm by Alpyn Beauty in exchange for my honest review. This eye balm glides on quite effortlessly and works well at smoothing, brightening and hydrating the undereye area once applied. I love that it’s a line created with natural, non-harmful ingredients and plant based alternatives like Bakuchiol to aid in anti-aging benefits. Packed with that plant-based retinol alternative, Bakuchiol, as well as with vitamin C, caffeine and algae, this moisturing formula is suitable for all skin types and works nicely to hydrate, plump, smooth and give the appearance of a brighter, more youthful undereye appearance. While the results were on the subtle side, I could definitely see a difference in how my undereye area was rejuvenated every time I’ve used this balm. It is non-irritative (even for someone like me with highly sensitive eyes), absorbs quickly and even wears well under makeup which is a plus for me! Hydrating and smoothing eye balm
