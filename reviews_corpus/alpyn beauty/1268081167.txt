This product doesn’t have a fancy scent or flavor, but it leaves my lips genuinely moisturized. I’ve noticed I’ve been using way less lip balm since getting this a week ago. I’ve been applying it in the morning and before bed, and barely using anything else in between! And this is from someone who uses lip balm all day long for the last 25 years! nan
