This Alpyn Beauty Juneberry & Collagen Hydrating Cream Cleanser makes my face feel so refreshed! This at-home resurfacing facial reveals brighter, smoother skin in 5 minutes. Antioxidant-packed wild huckleberry and skin-refining white willow bark reveal an instant glow. It’s a double-exfoliant gentle enough to be used daily. I simply apply thin layer to my washed face and leave on for 5-7 mins. I like to add a little water to my fingers and rub in circles at the end before washing off. It gives my face a brighter, flawless look and it feels so much smoother! I was blown away with how soft my skin is! Packed with antioxidants from the Wild Juneberry’s from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, it exfoliates all my dead skin away and has leaves a cooling sensation on my skin. It washes away my makeup effortlessly. You guys HAVE to get your hands on this! 😍 Love this cleanser!!
