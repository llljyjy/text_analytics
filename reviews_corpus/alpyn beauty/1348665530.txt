You don’t need a lot of this moisturizer, a little goes a long way. It’s very rich and velvety. Super hydrating and smells delicious! after I cleanse my face I like to apply this before putting on my makeup. I have very sensitive skin and when I used this, it didn’t make me break out which is great. velvety and rich!
