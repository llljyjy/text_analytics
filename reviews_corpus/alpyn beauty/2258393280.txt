In love!!! My skin has always been oily-mixed and this cleanser is my savior. I love cream products and have them not only as a cleanser BUT you can also use it as a mask is a 10/10 for me. Enjoy a snap at me while adding more product to my face because I just canâ€™t get enough. I really recommended it because the cream really has a cooling sensation that immediately you can sense that the product is hydrating your skin! Not only that but if you are a mask lover then this is like a 2-in-1 product! In love with this cleanser
