Alpyn just can’t do wrong! Everything I’ve tried from this brand has exceeded my expectations and been really agreeable with my skin. This lip mask is very viscous but a little goes a long way but it absorbs really quickly, leaving my lips feeling soft and smooth. I like to apply this in the morning and at night, and have especially found that overnight my lips love it! I look forward to continuing to use it. silky smooth
