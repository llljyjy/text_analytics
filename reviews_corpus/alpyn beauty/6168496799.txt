Oh hi my pretty!!!! Well it definitely does glow. Ok Alpyn Beauty does not come to play with this formulation. The best way to describe it is there is a misty fog like iridescence to this serum that just illuminates the skin. It’s not a chunky glitter look nor it is a metallic highlight. It’s truly a glowy kiss of a shine that catches the light really beautifully. Now on the packaging, it means use as a primer and that’s where I’m inclined to use it. It gives me just a dewy glow that doesn’t look fake. Beautiful formulation! Wonderful
