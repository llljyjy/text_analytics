Rant below: one of the products I’ve purchased with my own money that reflects all the good incentivized reviews. I’ve purchased several products in the past few months because of all the great reviews..that were mediocre products at best. I only read verified purchase reviews at this point. I get that influencer allows exposure for products and generates more reviews for more products, but when it’s an incentive review, you’re actually more likely to get a good review and not an honest one. There’s nothing wrong with giving your honest opinion on products. The people here purchasing the product with their own money appreciate the honesty. rant over wonderful
