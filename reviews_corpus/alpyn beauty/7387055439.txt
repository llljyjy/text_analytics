I really love this serum. I can’t say with certainty exactly how effective it is because I started using a bunch of products at once, but the overall appearance of my skin has definitely improved. It’s very gentle, and I can tell it helps hydrate my skin before I use my regular moisturizer. I do recommend shaking it periodically, as it does settle. nan
