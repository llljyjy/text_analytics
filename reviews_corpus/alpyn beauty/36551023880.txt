I have fallen in love with this product.My skin is very oil and very acne prone. Due to the sensitivity on my face, I often find new face washes to clog my pores.With this hydrating cleanser, the light and fluffy texture felt great on my skin. I love the little added scrub with the beads inside the formula. This helps me activate my pores for a deeper clean.I highly recommend this product for oily / acne prone skin types! Love the texture
