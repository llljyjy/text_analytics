my first alpyn product! very intrigued by the natural ingredients and I like having a retinol-alternative like bakuchiol in my morning moisturizer... this product is light and absorbs quickly. I am very happy with this for my combo skin and look forward to trying more from this brand! Lovely texture and moisturization
