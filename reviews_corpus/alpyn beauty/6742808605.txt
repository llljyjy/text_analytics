First product I’ve tried from the brand. I wish there was an applicator I’m not a fan of dipping my fingers in lip product. Minimal tingling for me. I do thing they packaging could be a little better aesthetically. As for the lip plump I didn’t notice a big change in the size of my lips. It does give my lips a pretty pink. It’s ok. nan
