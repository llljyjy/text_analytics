When you have kids, you need a good eye cream, I have been looking for the perfect one and I think I finally found it, I have been using it for a couple of weeks and I love it, it makes my under eye look brighter and smoother, it doesn’t have a strong smell and its not too thick. It also feels like velvet and the packaging it’s so cute. My skin is extremely sensitive and it has work perfect for me. Love it
