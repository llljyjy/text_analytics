I would give it 4.5 stars if I could; officially I am giving it 5 because my skin looks AMAZING after putting this on; I rarely show my face without a BB or tinted moisturizer on top of it, but it really looks good with just this on it. I would take a teensy portion off because it does have a bit of a sticky aloe vera feel to it on that face, and its not the *best* primer if you are wearing it under makeup because the aloe vera gel will pill up some products. I think I will use it primarily as a night cream or weekend no-makeup cream to switch off from retinol nights. My dry winter skin looks amazing
