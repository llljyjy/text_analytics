I have dry skin which extends to my lips, so I’m always looking for a remedy. The pretty pink lip mask comes in a cute, sturdy jar though I wish it came with a tool to help scoop some out since the texture was a little harder than I thought and would be more hygienic. However, once applied and smoothed out on the lips, it hydrates, softens and subtly plumps the lips. It doesn’t feel tacky or thick and I like that there is no scent/flavor. Lovely Lip Mask
