As someone with dry skin, this cream cleanser has been a treat! It’s silky and smooth to the touch, with jojoba beads that help gently exfoliate your skin. The cooling sensation is really refreshing, and I look forward to using it every night. I love how soft and smooth my face feels after each use. It’s currently the most hydrating cleanser in my skincare routine. I highly recommend giving this product a shot! Hydrating & Refreshing!
