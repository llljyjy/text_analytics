This is such an incredible cleanser. I have never once felt like a cleanser changed my skin... until I tried this. It actually brought life back into my dry skin after using it for a few days. I put this on as a mask for five minutes in the morning and night, and then rinse off. It does an incredible job at removing makeup plus it feels so good on the skin!! The cooling effect is EVERYTHING. I would 100% recommend this to friends and family, and even as a gift. I have never loved a cleanser more
