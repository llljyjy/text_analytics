I’ve been using this product for the past few weeks now and it’s been a game changer in my routine! It’s the perfect consistency to use without making a huge mess and my skin feels so fresh after I use it. It’s a very creamy product without being too much on my sensitive skin. My skin feels cool and refreshed after every use! A little goes a long way as well, I’d definitely recommend it A game changer!
