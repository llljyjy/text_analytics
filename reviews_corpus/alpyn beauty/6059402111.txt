I am really pleased with this cleansing cream. I find it to be perfect for my dry sensitive skin. I love how it thoroughly removes all my makeup, including eye makeup, without stinging my eyes. Sometimes I also use it as a face mask, I apply all over my face and leave it for 5 minutes and my skin feels super hydrated and soothed after I wash. I recommend this product! I love how it moisturizes while it cleans
