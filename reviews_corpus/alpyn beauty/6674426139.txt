The pictures to this products are really deceiving. This pictures make it look like a thick gel. It’s rock solid. It’s hard to get out of the jar, even. The product is ok but it’s not a lip mask. It gives hydration in the moment and it’s not sticky, but it’s too hard to get out of the jar and isn’t plumping. Very disappointed. not as pictured
