Oh. Em. Glee! This cleanser is an absolute TREAT. I want to start off by saying I normally shy away from most cleansers- they make my (tends to default on the DULL side) skin feel like there’s a film- or they dry it out.The texture is phenomenal- and I absolutely loved the mild exfoliation. It smells amazing, removes makeup easily, and left my skin feeling so silky. Honestly, after I moisturized I cannot stop feeling it! I feel like I went to the spa.I also love the brand’s story- a portion of all purchases supports national park restoration. And I’m also such a sucker for this packaging. A new MUST-HAVE in my face care routine!
