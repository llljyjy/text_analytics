The Perfect Pillowy PoutI’m so excited I finally got my hands on this Willow and Sweet Agave Plumping Lip Mask. This stuff seriously lives up to the hype and truly plumps to perfection. After seeing this viral lip mask all over social media, I was beyond intrigued by the natural ingredients used in this formula. I’ve seen this product being compared to many other brands. I am particularly excited about Alpyn Beauty’s take on a Lip Mask. Their brand continues to lead the forefront of innovative products in the clean beauty space. Best from the few times I have used this mask, I can already tell that this is going to be a regular monthly purchase in my Sephora basket. Pillowey Pout
