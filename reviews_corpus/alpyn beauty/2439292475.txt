I am absolutely obsessed with the feeling of this cleanser, it’s like little bursts of fresh eucalyptus every time I wash my face, it’s so refreshing I just can’t get over it. The fact that the packaging is sustainable is just a huge plus for me, not to mention this brand is clean! So much win win win! Everyone needs this product, and I will continue supporting this brand and their mission! A must have! Refreshing!
