I had very high expectations given the price tag—honestly, I was expecting to be disappointed. But not only does this moisturize well, it brightens and makes a noticeable difference in my fine lines within 30 seconds of application. That can’t possibly be the bakuchiol working yet (I look forward to evaluating those results in a few weeks/months), but it is a testament to the great hydration and plumping effect. My skin is also extremely sensitive due to past struggles with perioral dermatitis and sensitivity to silicones, but this didn’t cause a flare up or break me out at all. My one complaint is the price, but this is a moisturizer that I feel could also replace a serum in my routine. $60 for 1.7 ounces starts to look a lot more reasonable when I think of it as two products in one, neither of which irritate my skin. She’s pricey, but worth it
