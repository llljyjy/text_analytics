This product is so refreshing and leaves my face feeling clean, smooth and hydrated. It also exfoliates and can double as a mask. A true multi tasker. As always the wildcrafted active ingredients coupled with sustainable harvesting is always a plus in my book. Thank you Alpyn for another stellar product. My favorite skin care line.
