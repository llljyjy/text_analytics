I really thought I would love this but it is quite expensive for such a small amount. Although I saw some changes to my skin after use it is not better than youth to the peopleâ€™s Microderm polisher. I felt disappointed because, overall, my skin did not look that much impacted after a few uses and product runs out quickly. Not worth the $$$$$
