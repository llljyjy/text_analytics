I love this lip mask! I wear a thin layer during the day and a thicker layer at night. It’s smoothing, hydrating and leaves a healthy pinky glowy glossy lip. I love the consistency-- it’s thin without feeling sticky!Like some of the other reviewers, I do wish it came with a metal applicator to keep it sanitary and add that extra touch of luxury.I also am sensitive to smells and I love that Alpyn kept the scent all natural without adding anything more. It’s beautiful! Beautiful Formulation
