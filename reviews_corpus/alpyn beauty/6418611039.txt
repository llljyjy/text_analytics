I’ve been using this cold cream cleanser EVERY DAY and I couldn’t have better things to say.  It is so cooling on my skin and feels beyond invigorating.  Quite frankly, it feels like a cleanser that would be used at a spa! The texture is so gentle & massaging and the scent is subtle yet divine.  The first time I tried it, I had some leftover makeup on my face & this cream cleanser took it right off.  The duality is amazing and I couldn’t be more thrilled to add this to my collection.Not to mention, the packaging is also so dainty and cute so I love having it on display on my bathroom.This product is a must-try.  I’ve never had anything like it. INVIGORATING & HYDRATING!! A dream for my skin
