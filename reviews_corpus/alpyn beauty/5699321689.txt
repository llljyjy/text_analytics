I was sent this Willow & Sweet Agave Plumping Lip Mask from Alpyn Beauty in exchange for my honest review. This hydrating lip mask contains willow bark to gently exfoliate and soften along with hyaluronic acid and blue Agave to hydrate and plump. This Lip mask has a lovely pink hue that appears clear when applied. The texture is a thick and silky balm that feels incredible on my lips. I notice an immediate moisture boost and my lips appear fuller and subtly plumped. This Lip mask is perfect if you have dry chapped lips like me or if you are looking for that perfect pre-makeup pout prep. I would absolutely recommend this Lip mask. Beautiful subtle Plumping effect
