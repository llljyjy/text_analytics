I have been using for about a month and the results on fine lines have been impressive. I am 37 so my lines are light, but I have noticed big improvement. I just finished using Skinceuticals AGE complex, Sturm’s eye cream, and Neocutis rich eye cream, and I have noticed the biggest improvements on lines with this product. One thing I don’t like is that it takes longer to apply - you have to massage it in more to get it to sink in. I haven’t noticed much with dark circles yet, but I would buy again over the others alone just based on the wrinkle improvement. Amazing on Lines & Wrinkles
