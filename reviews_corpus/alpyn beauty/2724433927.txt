I have been using this moisturizer for the past two weeks and all I can say is WOW! The product is very moisturizing and has a velvety matte finish. I have been using this product every morning and evening and it leaves my skin feeling super soft, hydrated and plump. I have also been using it as a primer underneath my makeup and will continue to do so! I love that this is made with all clean ingredients too. Super Moisturizing!!
