I think itâ€™s one of the best skincare purchases I have recently made! I have combination skin and normally I end up with too dry or too oily skin after skincare routine. I love that after this peel mask my skin feels hydrated and brightened! And it feels like the normal skin, just perfect. I love the texture with tiny micro elements! It also has a nice scent. Good finding as for me, great refreshed look after mask! Recommend it! Great product!
