I missed that this product has mica in it, which I don’t really like in my skincare. But besides that, I’m not a fan of the consistency/texture of this. It is more creamy than most balms but not a cream. It has to be used before any skincare (at least before MY skincare products) or it doesn’t absorb & it just leaves white streaks. I haven’t seen any benefits yet but I’ll continue to use it til it’s finished since I usually don’t return makeup. And it seems to take a beat to absorb before I can continue with my other skincare & makeup which can be annoying if I’m in a hurry. I don't like Mica in my skincare
