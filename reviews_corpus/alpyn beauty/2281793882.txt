It’s such a beautiful product, truly! My lips have been super dry recently, so this came at the perfect time; it really moisturized them. It also has quite a thick texture, so it lasts on your lips for a good amount of time. I don’t feel like I have to reapply very often, which is a good thing. It also has a scent that reminds me of a strawberry lemonade. I also wanted to mention that I don’t notice any plumping, but I will say that wasn’t something I was interested in to begin with. So if you are looking for a plumping effect, I’m not sure you’ll notice anything with this product. This is quite pricey, but I do think it is a great product in general. My only big complaint is that I wished it came in another container. I don’t like dipping my fingers in the jar, especially when I’m out and about, so this will be kept on my vanity. nan
