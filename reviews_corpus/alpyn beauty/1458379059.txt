Ive been using this Juneberry & Collagen Hydrating Cold Cream Cleanser for more than two weeks now. I have to say that Iâ€™m in love with this cleanser. My skin feels so clean but not dry. It takes all my makeup very easy. The cooling effect is perfect for the morning. And I love to leave it as a mask for a few minute. So good to the skin!
