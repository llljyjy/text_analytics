Thought Id write a review after using this for over a month now. I really like this brand and since there was a promo, I grabbed this cleanser to try. Prior to this, I had been using YTTP Superfood cleanser for over a year.  I really like this cleanser. The price is a bit higher than I would have liked it to be but, you can get away with using less because it foams easily. It is also very hydrating and feels refreshing to use especially in the mornings. A pro-tip I found out recently is that you can leave this on for 5 minutes as a daily mask. I use this in conjunction with Vitamin C serums and feel that overall,  that my skin has a nice glow to it. nan
