I love this moisturizer.  I am a big retinol girl so I was interested to see if this does in fact have similar results, and I am not dissappointed.  This leaves my skin, smooth, bright, and hydrated.  I love that the ingredients are wildcrafted from Wyoming.  It is a great clean product that I will be using for a long time. wonderful moisturizer!! Wonderful Moisturizer
