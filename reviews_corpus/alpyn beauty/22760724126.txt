Finally a moisturizer that doesnâ€™t make my skin feel heavy and oily. Love how it melts into my skin leaving a velvety finish. Also love how clean the formula is and that it uses plant based alternatives to ingredients like retinol. My skin feels smooth and hydrated. Highly recommend it! Great for oily skin!
