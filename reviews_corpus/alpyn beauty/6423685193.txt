This is my favorite moisture. I live in San Diego where the weather can be very dry and this moisturizer is all I need to keep my skin feeling happy. It is thick without being too thick and sinks right into my skin. I can use it morning and night and it works great under makeup and sunscreen. It is also one of the only moisturizers I can use that doesnâ€™t burn my skin when using retin-a. Favorite moisturizer
