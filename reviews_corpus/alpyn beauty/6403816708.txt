This hydrating cold cream is so great to my skin! I love how cool and relaxed my skin feels after using it. I love balm cleansers so this was a little new to me but I did really enjoy it. The best part is all the extra hydration I get after using it, which is a must as winter is almost here. Def recommend checking it out! Great product for the winter!
