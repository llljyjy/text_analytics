This cold cream is the best thing I’ve ever use to clean my face. It gently yeah perfectly removes all the dirt, oil and make up from my face makes it feel supple and hydrated and not dried out after all. The scent is so wonderful and fresh and my face has a natural glow after cleansing. It’s the perfect two in one formula as I feel like it also acts as a moisturizer not just a cleanser and I don’t need to use multiple products at night. The perfect cold cream
