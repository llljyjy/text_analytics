Refreshing & cooling, and I love the texture as I feel like I’m exfoliating my skin as well. My skin feels soft after cleansing and I just feel like everything is clean, right down to my pores. Very hydrating & skin-plumping & it’s clean & vegan. My skin isn’t stopped at all, just glowing & fresh! A GOOD FOR YOUR SKIN CLEAN!
