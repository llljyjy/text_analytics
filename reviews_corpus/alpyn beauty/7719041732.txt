I’ve been using this product for the past two weeks and have seen a ton of improvement in the hydration and texture of my skin. It has a menthol-y smell which I love, and it really does feel cool when you put it on your face. I use it as a mask as I’m brushing my teeth and getting ready for bed, then rinse. A game changer
