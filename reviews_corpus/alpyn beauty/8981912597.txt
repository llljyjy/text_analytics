I really wanted to love this product. I think it does work, but the texture and smell are not for me. It is filmy and waxy in a chunky texture rather than the smooth texture I prefer for lip masks. It will work into a smooth texture, but does not feel as nice. Much prefer the lawless or tacha lip mask. Not my favorite.
