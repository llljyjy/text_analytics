I’m on my third jar of Alpyn’s bounce cream. It’s makes my aging, sensitive skin (I’m 50) feel dewy and nourished. I’ve bounced (ha!) from moisturizer to moisturizer for ages before finally settling on something that my skin loves -- it absorbs well and really does seem to work a little magic. Great cream for my aging, sensitive skin
