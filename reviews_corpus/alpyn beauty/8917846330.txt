This is an airy, gentle, yet exfoliating cream cleanser that is as hydrating as it is clarifying. I have sensitive skin around my eyes and mouth yet I did not encounter any adverse side effects from this cream. It smells like heaven and doubles as a cleanser and exfoliator! It has a slight cooling effect with application that made my skin feel tighter and rejuvenated. I highly recommend you giving this cleanser a spot in your skincare routine! A must have cream for your routine!
