I have been wanting to try this peel for a while now and finally was able to, thanks to insider community. The name “peel“ sounds a bit intimidating, but it’s actually very gentle, yet effective. I saw immediate results just after one use. It’s not harsh or irritating. I have dry and a little sensitive skin and the peel didn’t break me out. It left my skin so clean, bright, soft, and my pores looked so much smaller. It didn’t leave my skin oily, no greasy residue, no dry patches, nor did my skin get oily later on. The gritty texture also helps a lot with improving uneven skin texture. I can feel the extra exfoliation when I gently rub it in circular motion. Totally in love and will be using the mask for a couple of times a week! nan
