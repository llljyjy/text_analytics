My face routine is my favorite part of the day and my favorite selfcare moment. Being able to add something to my routine and it be for my lips is so refreshing and fun! My lips are already plump so I didn’t imagine that this would make much of a difference, however, I am intrigued by the amount of hydration it gives my lips throughout the night and the day. Before using this my lips were peeling from having a baby and they were still a little dark! NOW THE PEELING IS GONE AND MY LIPS ARE PINK AGAIN! My lips are one of my favorite features on me so you know I’m really enjoying it! Fun and Hydrating
