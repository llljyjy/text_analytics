Great cleanser for dry, normal, combination skin types.I like the idea that you can use it as a mask or a cleanser. Itâ€™s luxurious cream texture with jojoba beats that give you super gentle exfoliation without irritating your skin.The scent is so relaxing, I can definitely smell eucalyptus and I can feel cooling sensation. It removes my everyday makeup so easy and now every evening I am looking forward to use it. Great cleanser
