This moisturizer is a game changer! It has such a velvety-matte finish and easily pairs well with and under makeup! I tend to have oily skin, but this did not contribute to oils on my skin like some moisturizers do; it even made it matte without dryness. My skin feels so soft, plump, and moisturized with it on. The smell is so nice and natural too which is a bonus! nan
