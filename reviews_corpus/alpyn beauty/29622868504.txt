I have been using this cleanser and I am OBSESSED. I am that girl that hates taking her makeup off after a long day and it has been a lifesaver. It helps remove all of my makeup and doesnâ€™t leave my skin feeling irritated like a lot of other makeup removers I have used. I do have really sensitive skin but I love how soft the cleanser is with the beads so it provides exfoliation but does not irritate my skin!Overall it is great for my skin which is pretty sensitive and has helped me to remove my makeup and go to bed with a clean face! Busy girl with sensitive skin lifesaver!
