The Juneberry Hydrating Cream Cleanser is going to be a staple in my winter skin care routine. This product left my skin feeling so smooth and hydrated. I absolutely love how the mask is cooling and hydrating but also does an incredible job removing my full face of makeup without leaving my skin feeling dry and irritated. Nothing feels better than removing my makeup all while making my skin feel soft, supple and refreshed. I will forever be re-purchasing this product! A Must-Have in any Skin Care Routine!
