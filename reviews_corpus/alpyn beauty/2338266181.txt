This product is super moisturizing and helps soothe my chronically dry lips. The texture is thicker than I expected and it doesn’t melt away or disappear quickly. It’s not very plumping” (your lips won’t look fuller like with a lip plumping gloss) but your lips will look a little more juicy and hydrated. There is no strong smell, just a slight sweetness from the agave. It’s a small but mighty product! Hydrated lips!
