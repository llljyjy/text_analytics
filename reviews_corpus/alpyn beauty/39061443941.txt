Yall! I’m in love. This was my first time trying the Melt Moisturizer, and I will definitely be adding this to my skin routine. I struggle with oily skin, and I have to be careful with what moisturizer I use, or it will leave my skin very oily. The Melt Moisturizer leaves your skin feeling hydrated, soft, and velvety. Because of the matte finish, it’s perfect for layering under your makeup if you have oily skin like me. It’s also perfect for layering under sunscreen. So, if you are debating about trying out the Melt Moisturizer... do it! Trust me! You will not regret it. My Newest Holy Grail!!
