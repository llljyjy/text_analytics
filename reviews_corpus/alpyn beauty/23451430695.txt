I am totally in love with this lip mask. It has really helped me treat my dry and chapped lips. I love that itâ€™s not at all greasy or sticky. It has a very light formula which slowly melts when you rub it on the lips. I use it in day as well as an overnight lip mask and it has been successful in keeping my lips soft, smooth and moisturized. Best thing for dry and chapped lips
