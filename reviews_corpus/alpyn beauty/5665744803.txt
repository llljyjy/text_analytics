I’ve tried a lot of lip balms from Sephora over the years and I must say that this one and Milk Makeup are my favorites. I’m pleasantly surprised because I wasn’t expecting it to be this good. It appears thick and can be a little hard to get out of the jar at times, but when you put it on your lips it goes on smooth. It doesn’t feel sticky on the lips at all. It moisturize your lips. The only thing it doesn’t do is plump your lips as it claims. I still have it 5 stars because I wasn’t expecting it to. Good lip balm
