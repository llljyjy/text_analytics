Winter is coming and I have to be skin care read!! Alpyn beauty Juneberry & Collagen Hydrating Cream Cleanser has been preparing my skin for the cold weather. It absolutely feels amazing on your skin and the light texture doesn’t feel to heavy on the skin. I’m not going to go on about how it didn’t strip my skin.....of course it wouldn’t because it’s hydrating!!! It’s a light creamy cleanser that effectively cleanses the skin, removes impurities and make-up. Leaves skin feeling clean, hydrated, soft and refreshed.  I love the cooling sensation it gives after removal, you can also use this as a mask, which makes the product unique. It’s may daily go to when it comes to makeup removal, it’s like one and done. A Product you Definitely Should Use.
