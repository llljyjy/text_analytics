This is such a great cleanser, for me personally I have dry skin so having a cleanser that is hydrating as well as cold really brings some life back into my face and wakes me up in the morning! I love how itâ€™s not too heavy on my skin like other cleansers as well, and that it does a good job of taking off my makeup. I would definitely recommend this ! An awesome cleanser !
