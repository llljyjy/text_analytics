Iâ€™ve been using this product as a cleanser and mask for the past few weeks and I was pleasantly surprised how much I loved it. The cleanser has a very creamy consistency and has little cleansing beads that melt on to your skin. My favorite thing about this is the minty cool feeling it gives your skin. I also prefer using it more as a mask because after rinsing my skin feels and looks hydrated, glowy and refreshed. My new favorite!
