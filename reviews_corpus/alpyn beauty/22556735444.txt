I am an Aesthetician and I love the unique ingredients in this product. Nettle is good for acne, also. And the Rambutan is another alternative to retinol. The serum makes me a little red on days when I am sensitive, unlike most niacinamide serums I have tried, but this serum is chock full of antioxidants and very active and strong botanical extracts. I love that it is fragrance and dye free and free of sodium chloride. I have layered it with Vitamin C or Copper or retinoids with no problem, and I am super sensitive. I think the main point of this serum is healing, a glow, and firmness. I am dry, sensitive, and extremely acne-prone. Unique retin-alt plant serum
