This cream is absolutely fantastic!! The texture is so soft and when applied to the skin it feels like butter. The refreshing and cooling sensation while on is something else, let me tell you. I use it in the morning to start my morning routine with a fresh face and at night to remove the makeup of the day and sleep with a clean face. The feeling of the jojoba beads exfoliating my skin feels nice and the skin is left soft to the touch after using the product and with the sensation of being highly hydrated. Fantastic!!
