Oh my goodness this product has gotten rid of my crows feet and lines under and around my eyes in just a couple months! I’m 45 and switched my eye cream to this on a whim and so glad I did. It has shed years off my face! And just fyi the cetyl alcohol is not the same as rubbing alcohol, it’s a like a wax. So rest easy with that. I love this product. I wish it helped get rid of my undereye darkness, but I’ll take it for line reduction. Posting before and after photos. bye bye lines!!
