I wanted to love this so badly especially after spending $60 on it but my skin was not reacting well to the product. i washed my face with my normal face wash and then dabbed this on and it caused my skin to burn a bit and get red and splotchy in certain parts as you can see in the images, some parts on my cheeks and across my eyebrow. I thought it was a one off but I tried again tonight and again my face got red and splotchy. When I tested it at the store on my hand it did exactly what it was supposed to and felt absolutely amazing which is why I can’t for the life of me figure out why this is happening to my face. It is worth noting I wouldn’t consider myself as someone with “sensitive skin” and it can get a bit on the dry side but I really do take care of my skin so I can’t tell if the next morning it looks great because of or in spite of the product. I will be returning it though and trying hopefully something else that won’t cause my skin to react this way. I give it two stars because on my hand it was beautiful and felt amazing, unfortunately on my face it didn’t. Wanted to love but got a skin reaction instead
