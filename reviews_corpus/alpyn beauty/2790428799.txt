I almost never write reviews, but I felt it was necessary with this product.  With so many products to help with fine lines and wrinkles, it’s often overwhelming.  However, I read through countless reviews and decided to try this moisturizer, full size, for half a year.  I’m so pleased with the results that I am restocking my supply and buying one for my sister.  Love the company’s commitment to natural ingredients that occur in the wilderness, lack of fragrance, and results!  My skin is noticeably different, fine lines have definitely eased.  Overall, I feel like I’ve noticed better elasticity and appearance of my skin.  Granted it’s not botox, but for a lotion, it makes a huge difference.  Very pleased, and this has made a permanent spot in my very basic beauty routine.  I’m tempted to try their other products as well.  Try it, it’s worth it! Permanent spot in my beauty routine
