I received a few samples of this cleanser from Alpyn beauty and was pleasantly surprised. This juneberry and collagen hydrating cold cream cleanser is unlike other cream cleansers out there. I have dry skin and my main issue with cream cleansers is the film they often leave on my skin. This cleanser is creamy and refreshing without leaving a weird feeling on my skin. I also love that this cleanser can be left on as a mask, I love a multipurpose product. This product is gentle yet so effective and has left my skin feeling and looking so plump and hydrated after every use. Creamy and refreshing
