This cleanser looks and feels expensive. I get a refreshing/cooling feeling when I apply it to my face. I love that you can use it as a mask as well as a quick cleanser. My skin feel so hydrated after using and you can really tell that your face is clean and the cleanser removes the dirt/oil from your skin. This has been my go to cleanser since I received it. Skin feels so soft and refreshed after using
