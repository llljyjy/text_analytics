I’ve been using this serum for a little over a month and I love it! It is very soothing and calming- so I enjoy putting it on my skin. The scent is light and non offensive. It absorbs extremely well into the skin and I’ve had no problems putting make up on over it. My skin looks and feels revitalized. This serum has an excellent ingredient list. I am very excited to try other products from this brand. Soothing and lovely
