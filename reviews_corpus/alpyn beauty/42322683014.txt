As the weather gets colder this cleanser has been great for keeping my dry skin moisturized! I love the way it feels when I apply it to my skin. It creates a cooling sensation as you rub it into your face and I love the feeling of the jojoba beads exfoliating the skin making it feel so refreshed and hydrated. It also works really well with removing makeup! Great for my dry skin!
