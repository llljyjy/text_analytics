I’ve been looking for a clean alternative to the Laneige lip mask but sadly this is not it. The tub is so tiny for price I was truly shocked when I opened the box (my fault for not reading the product description more closely tho). Also, this mask just does not perform compared to Laneige. I put Alpyn on my lips at night and when I wake up my lips are still dry and flaky, whereas the L brand seems to start working as soon as it’s applied and when I wake up my lips are soft and supple. Needless to say I will not be purchasing this again. *Sigh* Not Worth the Price
