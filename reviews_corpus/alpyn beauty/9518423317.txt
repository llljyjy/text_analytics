This lip mask feels really nice without being heavy or greasy. I use it mostly at night and don’t see it on my pillowcase. I didn’t get the plumping effect as much as the moisture.  As much as I like the sustainable packaging, I wish it came in a tube or twist up because I hate the feeling of using my fingers to apply lip masks. nan
