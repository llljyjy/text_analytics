It’s my first time trying this moisturizer, I love that the main ingredients are plants because I’m truly prefer natural products, the consistency is light, ease to spread, nice but strong aroma, I like it but, my skin sometimes is very dry, sometimes very oily, and for those days my skin is dry the product not moisturize the way I would like to, however, I seen an improvement of the texture of my skin THATS A BIG PLUS! in general is a good product I like it!
