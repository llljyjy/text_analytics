I’m always looking for a great makeup removing product for my nighttime routine and this is an amazing find! I love the light refreshing smell, and exfoliating effect. It removes all my makeup effortlessly. I love the beaded texture paired with a cooling component. It leaves my skin feeling clean and energized. I also love that it doesn’t leave you skin feeling tight but instead it feels supple and hydrated! Its very gentle yet super effective! Loving this cooling cleanser!
