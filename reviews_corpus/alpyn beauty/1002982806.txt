I was gifted this product to try and I like it. I am picky with my lip products and this one I underestimated. I barely have to use a scratch and when you swirl it in the pot it really melts down the product into an oil like texture and really glides on the lips. I have darker pigmented wrinkly lips and this leaves a slight glossy texture! This lip product is not greasy or sticky. This has no fragrance to me and no taste, I re apply often but technically not necessary, I loved to use this during the day time and at night time! This is a unique product, I do get the slight exfoliation from the willow bark and the hydration from the hyaluronic acid the agave! A great lip product
