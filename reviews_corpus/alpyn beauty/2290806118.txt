My skin feels a tad stingy after I put it on, but it quickly fades. Only reason I took off one star. I think that’s because I have sensitive skin, and there are some plant-based oils in here that may affect very sensitive skin. However, this moisturize is really nice, firming, and just lovely! ￼ A new firming addition to my routine!
