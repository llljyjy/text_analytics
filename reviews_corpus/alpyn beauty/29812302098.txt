I absolutely love this brand and I’m so excited for this new lip mask !!! This has become an instant favorite! My lips are always somewhat dry but not anymore ! This lippie hydrates and plumps and provides lasting moisture! I love the all natural ingredients and that they source the Willow Bark pretty much in their backyard! I do think the price point should be a little lower , maybe $22 but still it’s almost justifiable. All in all , if you are in the market for a lip mask you should absolutely give this one a go. The scent reminds me of pink lemonade for some reason and I love that ! Amazing Lip Mask!
