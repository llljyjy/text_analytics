I received a complimentary bottle from Alpyn Beauty and it definitely checks all the boxes!  I was already using Alpyn Melt Moisturizer (which smells divine) and loving it.  This serum is perfect to use in the morning.  It works as a nice moisturizer and layers great under my sunscreen and foundation.  It never pills which is great.  Looking forward to trying more of their products.  I love their brand philosophy too! nan
