Absolutely LOVE this eye cream. I was hesitant to try at first because I have a really sensitive eye area and have had to return multiple eye products because they have caused reactions on my skin but this has worked like magic and has done an amazing job in helping with my under eye circles. A little bit goes a long way and you just Pat it under your eye and they instantly look and feel hydrated. Amazing. Must have
