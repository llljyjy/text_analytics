A Worthwhile InvestmentI’m thrilled with the results I’ve been getting from Dermaflash Luxe! It has been such an upgrade from facial razors that I’ve tried. I didn’t even know I needed this in my life until I compared the two. With ease, any peach fuzz that I obsessed over was gone (in a flash, some might say!). I love anything that exfoliates but it also has to be gentle on my skin, which Dermaflash Luxe certainly is. The hair regrowth is slower and not coarse. I’m blown away! A Worthwhile Investment
