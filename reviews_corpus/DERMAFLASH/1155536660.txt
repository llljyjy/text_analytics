The tool did virtually nothing. I have visible blackheads on my chin and this did not extract them whatsoever. It did help with the blackheads on my nose though. My forehead is usually pretty clear of breakouts and I noticed that a couple days after I used this, I got a bunch of little bumps on my forehead. Almost like it spread bacteria more than extracted it, or maybe my forehead is just a more sensitive area..? Either way, I returned this since I can’t justify keeping a tool that only works on my nose. I also couldn’t really see or feel much of a difference with the infusion mode. Meh
