Ok this thing is actually amazing. I’ve had it for a couple of months now and I use it either once a week or every other week. One piece of advice is you have to go realllllly slow when you’re using it. Give it a second to vibrate on your skin so it pushes the gross-ness to the top. You really don’t have to push very hard if you go slowly. The next day I can always see a difference in my skin! Love this + some advice
