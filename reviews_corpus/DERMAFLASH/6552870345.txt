I suffer from dry skin patches. Especially in the winter! Iâ€™ve tried every at home skin treatment. (facials work well but they are costly) This brought the facial results I get from the spa to my home. Super easy to use. I truly wish I would have taken a before and after to prove how well it worked for me. Also getting to see everything that came off and out of skin was beyond satisfying. I recommend doing it the night before a event for your makeup application to look flawless the next day! So if your like me, stop overthinking buying it and DO IT!!! Game Changer in my skin care!!
