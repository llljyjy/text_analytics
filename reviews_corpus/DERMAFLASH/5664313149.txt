Ok I really love this- makes my skin look 5-10 years younger and so clear and smooth! Not just the morning after, but for several days and I have very oily skin and badly clogged pores. What I wish they tell you in the directions is you have to go very very slow, and over problem areas you do have to make multiple passes (just be sure to keep your skin wet for each pass!). They do give you a direction in the instructions, but I’ve found certain directions work better for certain areas.  ALSO, the angle is VERY VERY important, so experiment! If you don’t see a little bit of gunk on the metal edge after a pass, then it’s not working and you need to try going slower or from another direction or angle.  Get up close and personal so you can see what’s working and what isn’t.  I wouldn’t be afraid of the bad reviews, as I can def see someone getting it and following the directions, but still not getting it to work bc of one of the above things I mentioned… Now for me, this wasn’t as effortless as the videos make it seem- but my pores are seriously bad so that could just be part of it- takes me probably at 15 min but it works so well I don’t care LOL. If you’re willing to put in the time, though I’ll think you’ll be very happy! Does this clean everything out? Scientifically probably not, however I kinda don’t care- my skin looks beautiful for the next week and I can even feel the little newly unearthed pores being exposed to air which feels awesome. Works 10xs better than any pore cleaning product or wash I’ve used and it’s pretty non invasive- unlike pore stripes which can harm your skin. Skin looks younger! Some tips they don’t tell you!
