Others have dumped on this product, but I have found it to be amazing. It really does clean out your pores!  It’s fast, easy to use and effective. I use it about once a week; it’s the first product I’ve found that actually cleared the pores on my nose that was fast and super easy to use.  1) Make super sure that your face is *wet*  2) If your skin dries out, add more water!  The ultrasonic vibrations will make the water jump off and disappear rather quickly. Dry skin leads to redness and irritation, so stop and rehydrate if you need to. Easy to use and fast, too
