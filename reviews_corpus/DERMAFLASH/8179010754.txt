This product was first introduced to shopping channels, so in that fashion, it’s IMO built pretty cheaply. They definitely added a huge mark up to it when it could probably be sold WITH a large profit margin for $50. I don’t regret my purchase… but you could definitely get an Amazon version that does the SAME for less of a markup. works but feels cheap
