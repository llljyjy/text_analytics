The first time I turned this on, my cat was in the same room napping. After about a minute on infuse mode, I turned around and she was SHOOK like I have never seen her before. Not like cats are sometimes afraid of vacuums or balloons. Like how I imagine Havana Syndrome. She was on edge for at least the next hour. Now, the product pamphlet does contain a one-line warning to avoid using this near pets, which I do not recall seeing anywhere before purchase. I’ve since experimented and this device can be turned on without visibly disturbing the cat if I am on the entirely opposite side of our house, which is a big suburban colonial. But I was hoping to use this tool regularly, and it’s not exactly convenient to have to always worry about where my cat is chillin so I can go infuse some moisturizer as far away as possible. So I’m considering returning.Importantly, I cannot imagine this possibly working in a small apartment with pets. Maybe I am just a newbie to the ultrasonic world, but if I had known it affected pets like this, I probably would have passed. Pet Owners Beware
