Love the blades and my Dermaflash. Really don’t like the excessive packaging on replacement blades, and the cleanser and cream that comes with it. Can’t use them as they don’t work on my sensitive skin. Please, please, please listen to the overwhelming comments from customers on this. Get rid of the cleaner/cream, give me more blades instead, and cut down on the the excessive packaging. Hate the cream/cleanser and excessive packaging!!!
