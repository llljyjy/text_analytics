Holy Batman! This thing is amazing!!! I don’t understand all the negative review. Granted, I purchased this while it was on sale, and it was SO worth it. I have always had medium size pores with a ton of blackheads. They aren’t super huge blackheads or anything, but I have a lot of small/medium blackheads all over my face and body. I frequently clear out the blackheads around my nose on a semi-weekly basis. I would usually just use my fingers to squeeze them out after a shower and then wash my face again. I used this ONE time, and it completely cleaned out all my blackheads on my face for over a week. The trick is to keep splashing water on your face, and to follow the directions (45* angle) and move the device sideways (lateral) across your face. This device is so worth it in my opinion if you have to deal with constant blackheads or dirt in your pores.This device cleared out my pores better than any mask or tool I have ever used before. I am very happy with the results. While the picture only shows a little bit of debris on the wand, I was constantly cleaning the wand off throughout using it. Amazing!
