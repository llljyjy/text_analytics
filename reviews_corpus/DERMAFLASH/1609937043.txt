Read all instructions! Must be used while skin is wet! I love using this to clean out the pores on my nose, easily navigated around the creases of my nose (you know those problem areas) without having to mash my skin trying to squeeze things out by hand. Great for days when I need a little extra deep cleaning. I will say that my dogs arenâ€™t huge fans, the high frequency bothers them but they just stay out of the bathroom when I use this tool. Clear out those pores!
