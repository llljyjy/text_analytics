I was recommended this product by a Sephora employee during their Spring Sale event and as someone who suffers from acne and clogged pores, this toner helped clear up my face in less than four days. I’m not exaggerating! I’ve only been applying it at night prior to sleeping as part of my skincare routine and it has worked wonders. It’s helped maintain my face hydrated and fresh. Planned to pickup another one for my mom and it’s sold out in stores within a 30 mile radius of me. Need I say more? Toner Works Wonders
