I received this gifted by the brand and I live the lightweight texturem it absorbs under my eyes quickly leaving them feeling soft and hydratedm what I love the most about this under eye cream is that I could tell the difference right away, my eyes looked less puffy and brighter. It works well under my makeup and I definitely recommend. Could tell the difference almost immediately
