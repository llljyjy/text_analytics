I have very sensitive skin under my eyes—even the most gentle products can burn. So my usecase for this product is maybe a little different.  I just wanted to find a moisturizer I could put around my eyes both proactively and reactively as needed in the event my skin reacts under my eyes to something (such as occasional SPF stinging). This serum works wonders and takes the burning feel away.  No clue about the dark circles—I’m using this to help tame my sensitive skin and I’m feeling so much better already.  A definite good buy! Very soothing for sensitive skin
