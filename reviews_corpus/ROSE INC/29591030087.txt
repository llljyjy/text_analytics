First of all, I can say that the ingredient list of the product is very successful. In its formulation, moisturizing and illuminating ingredients are used, and I am very glad that it does not contain perfume. Perfumed products can cause problems for sensitive skin like me. The packaging of the product is also very stylish and minimal. I can say that its moisturizing is more ideal especially under make-up. I think it is necessary to use it for a longer period of time to talk about its illuminating effect. I would recommend it to people who experience dryness around the eyes. I canâ€™t wait to see the effect on dark circles! Like it!!
