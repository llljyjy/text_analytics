I haven’t used this product for very long, but the product feels very moisturizing and good on my skin. Sometimes I don’t like the way that creams feel, but I really like this one! I definitely think my under eyes looked less puffy and way brighter! I can’t wait to continue using this product to see even better results! Good So Far
