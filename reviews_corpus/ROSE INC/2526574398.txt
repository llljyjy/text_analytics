I wanted to love this moisturizer so bad. I’m looking for a new moisturizer after my favorite was discontinued and unfortunately this made my skin break out so I had to return in. If I hadn’t broken out it would have been great, I liked the texture and it felt nice on my skin but I have fairly sensitive skin and know within a couple uses if something will make me break out. Wanted to love it
