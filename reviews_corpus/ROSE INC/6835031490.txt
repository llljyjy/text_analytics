This is my second product from the brand Rose Inc and I have been pleasantly impressed by both of them. This product works really well and absorbs into the skin very quickly without leaving it sticky or tacky. It made my under-eyes feel very hydrated and less dull. My makeup easilly applied over the product and looked less puffy and dark! However I think I will be using it at night with my nightly skincare routine unless I feel like I need a nice under-eye pick me up in the morning! I love the packaging of this product and the slight rose scent that it has. A little goes a long way so donâ€™t use too much! This product will definitely last me quite awhile. The product was gifted to me by Rose Inc. Great Eye Cream for an under-eye pick me up
