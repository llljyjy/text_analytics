There is very little product in this very heavy container lol. I guess I should have took them more seriously for calling it Mini. I have very dry skin, especially in the winter, and this seems to do nothing. It feels very liquid and like it sits on the skin and then dries without doing very much. The little beads donâ€™t seem to add much to this. nan
