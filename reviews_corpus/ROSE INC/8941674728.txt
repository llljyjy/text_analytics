This is a really nice eye cream. I have already tried this brand and loved it so I was very excited to try the skincare. I like to use this eye cream especially in the morning since it helps depuff the area. It also visibly hydrates my under eyes so I like to use it at night as well. It blends effortlessly and feels very light weight on the skin, and it does not irritate my dry skin. It has a slight pink tone that blends away but also helps to illuminate the area. I also really like the packaging as it feels very sturdy and well made and I like the pump. Great for AM and PM
