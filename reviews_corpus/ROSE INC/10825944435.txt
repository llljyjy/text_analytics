Ok, so this is a first review when somebody purchased the product and was not sent it for a review. This stuff is worth your money. First of all - innovation. This bursting technology creates a unique experience and omg I love it. Secondly, the hydration is out of this world - I have dry skin like Sahara (but oily forehead prone to closed comedones - perfect combination) and this gel(!!!) works. I’m used to creams and decided to bite the bullet (a $68 bullet mind you) with this one, and it’s totally worth it. Very calming on the skin and very very hydrating. I am shocked
