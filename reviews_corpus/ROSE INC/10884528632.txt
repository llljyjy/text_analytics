This eye cream is amazing! First off the texture is amazingly hydrating, and plumps my undereyes before I apply makeup. The cream gives off a brightening effect under my concealer but doesn’t feel too thick where my makeup won’t stick. I would recommend waiting a little before applying makeup to make sure the cream melds completely with your skin. But overall it’s an amazing cream that is perfect for makeup application! Brightening and Hydrating!
