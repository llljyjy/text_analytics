I recently purchased this product after going through a week long obsession on researching ingredients. I have oily acne-prone skin and now fine lines/aging are also on my radar. I discovered the moisturizer I had been using a couple times a week had comedogenic ingredients. I had just used up the bottle and was due for a new one anyway. I’m so glad I came across Rosie’s YouTube channel and her product line that specifically highlights non-comedgenic ingredients as this is a huge concern of mine. It is still a touch difficult to relate to her but I find it easier than most other celebs and their skincare/makeup/perfume, etc lines that they come out with. She seems pretty down-to-earth considering. I also relate to the difficulties she says she’s had with her skin which enticed me to try her line. So far, I am very impressed. The gel texture of this moisturizer is light and upon application provides a nice glow without any weight or greasiness. I’ve only used it at night so far but I love the feeling of it. I have not used it long-term but so far am really enjoying it. I typically shy away from hydrating products but this one just feels right. If you have similar concerns to mine, I encourage you to try this! It is a slightly steep price point but worth it in my opinion. I can’t wait to try the toner next! So far so good!
