This product was gifted by Rose Inc in exchange for my honest review. I think this is a great skincare makeup hybrid product. Itâ€™s not life changing skincare, but it has some nice ingredients like niacinamide, squalane, acetyl tetrapeptide-5 (claimed to improve puffy eyes), and some antioxidants. The slight tint and sheen looks really nice in the morning for minimal makeup days. Overall well done! Great skincare/makeup hybrid
