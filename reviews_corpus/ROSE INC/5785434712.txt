My personal opinion of Rose Inc. Eye Revival Brightening Eye Cream, FYI…..Okay, Just so you know-  it’s not easy to impress me, especially when it comes to products for my eyes! Of course we ONLY want the absolute best ingredients, rating’s, multiple sites before a single purchase. Well I can say Rose Inc. is a fabulous product for anyone at any age, I especially love the hint of shimmer to deflect light & it’s am amazing formula. It’s easily absorbed, looks natural, & feels amazing! I’ve used her for about 8 days and I’m HOOKED! Thank you so much for introducing us! She’s definitely a compliment to eyes, i’m sure to do the same for you too! Now I’m new to Rose Inc. but feel like they’ve created a superb serum I can only Imagine what the other products you faded can do for me! It’s so good, play’s well with others as well. ; ) RECOMMEND! 5 stars  I need more Rose Inc. On my face! Mahalo!! nan
