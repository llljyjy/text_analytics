This eye cream is wonderfully lightweight and feels instantly refreshing on the skin. It has a nice balmy texture that really feels hydrating, smoothing, and plumping. I feel this eye cream not only really helps hydrate the skin and it brightens the under eyes. You don’t need much of this eye cream at all. It works so well underneath makeup. It doesn’t interfere with the texture of your concealer or foundation. It absorbs quickly but still feels really hydrating. I highly recommend this formula! Refreshing, hydrating, smoothing
