Gifted by rose inc Admittedly I’ve tried a few eye creams and they’ve all just been meh. But this is totally different . It actually lives up to its name and does it’s job. I’ve worn it alone and under makeup and it really does an amazing job of giving the under eye area a more brightened , fresh look . I feel more hydrated which is great because product sits nicely there and I notice my fine lines just look less apparent. nan
