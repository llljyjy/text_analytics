I love how lightweight the formula is yet still left my skin hydrated. My skin absorbs it immediately without any residue and it feels hydrated afterwards. The microencapsulated dissolve as you applied it into the skin and it gives a cooling burst of hydration. It also comes with metal spatula which I really appreciate! Cooling and Hydrating
