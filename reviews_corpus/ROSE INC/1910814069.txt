This review is a first impressions review and was gifted to me by Rose Inc. I usually prefer eye creams out of a tub (and I still do) but the pump of this is actually really nice to get exactly the amount of eye cream you need. It has a lightweight texture and applies super evenly and feels dewy and soft on the skin. Even an hour after applying my under eyes feel soft and look good! Iâ€™m excited to keep using this and hopefully see a difference! Good first impression!
