I was super excited to try this product and I’m SO glad I did because it’s amazing. I love the way it feels on my skin, the tiny microcapsules really just add to the experience. My face felt so hydrated and it layered under makeup beautifully. I have super pale skin so any redness is super noticeable. I feel like this moisturizer really helped calm & sooth my face overall. nan
