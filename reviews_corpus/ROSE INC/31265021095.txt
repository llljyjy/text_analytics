This is the best best eye cream up to date. Lightweight but very nourishing. It immediately gets rid of dark circles. Perfect for everyday use as it doesn’t clash with make up and absorbs fast. I love the glass packaging. It has a very luxurious feel. I am in love with the nourishing ingredients. My skin absolutely loved this! It’s very hydrating and nourishing. My under eyes are always smooth and soft. I kind of want to use this cream for my whole face. Highly reccomend. This is the second product I have tried with them. So far loving this brand so much.
