Adore this toner. I use it as part of my night routine and saw a great improvement in my pores and skin texture. I was afraid that the amount of acids would cause discomfort or burning, but I’ve not had any issue. The only con is that you have to apply with a cottonpad and it doesn’t come in a travel size. nan
