really love this moisturizer! not only did it leave my skin feeling super hydrated and plump, but it has a beautiful scent. the spatula it came with could be my favorite part, and i also really liked the hydration beads. my skin felt super hydrated and plump after using this in the evening for a few times first week. left my skin feeling baby smooth
