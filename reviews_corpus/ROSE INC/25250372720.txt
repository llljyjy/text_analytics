This is my first time trying Rose Inc and I must say this eye cream is not too shabby. It dries down nice and doesn’t leave me feeling sticky. It left a sheer glow  and my makeup sat beautifully over it. I’m pretty oily and after hours of wearing makeup, my under eyes stayed matte. Can we put this all over our face? Lol. I like it
