Look at what fascinating this texture is! and it belongs to the new Hydration Replenish Microencapsulated Moisturizer by Rose Inc. It claims that instantly increases hydration an average of 183% and guess what? Itâ€™s true! I just started using it and I am already recommending it to my friends and family. It glides beautifully on the skin, it akes a little longer to be absorbed by the skin and it feels a little bit sticky, but it for sure replenish the moisture right away, making my skin feeling and looking hydrated, with no more dry patches! nan
