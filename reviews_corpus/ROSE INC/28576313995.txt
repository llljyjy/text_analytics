I would say this is a good product for someone who has very minimal under eye problems - slight darkness and puffiness! I have used this one for 2 weeks and I love this on mornings when I want a little pick me up. Great for brightening the under eyes and it works as a substitute for a concealer. A little goes a long way too! Love that it comes with a pump, very sanitary! Good product for brightening!
