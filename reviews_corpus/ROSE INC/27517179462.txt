It’s my first time trying this brand and I was impressed by the packaging + quality from them! I got this mostly for helping to brighten up my dark under eye circles and I do believe it makes a difference. It’s my favorite to wear in the daytime for a boost of brightness, since it works like a concealer a bit (compliments my makeup well).Can’t say I’ve noticed less puffyness under my eyes though since I don’t get much of that anyway. Overall, I enjoyed the quality and effective ingredients that helped in brightening me up! Effective!
