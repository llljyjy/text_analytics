The Rose Inc Eye Revival has a beautiful, pearlescent formula that instantly brightens the eye area. It has a blurring effect on the skin and a natural, soft focus finish. It is lightly moisturizing and absorbs quickly so it works best as a daytime eye cream for me. It works well underneath makeup and helps to give eyes a smooth, refreshed look. It has a pump dispenser and is packaged in a glass bottle. nan
