I was really excited to receive this product. Not only does it have a cool aesthetic and unique color but I love the way this feels and spreads on my skin. It’s more of a gel moisturizer than a cream and I’m glad for it because my skin sucks it right up. I also love that it plumps and preps your skin for make up because it eliminates an extra step and you don’t have to worry about an additional primer potentially pilling on your face as it reacts with your skincare or makeup One of the coolest products I’ve ever seen
