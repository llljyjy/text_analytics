I paired this with the rose inc tinted serum and it looks beautiful BUT if you have really dry skin like me this one product won’t hold you over on days where you wear nothing but moisturizer. Upon first applying it it feels wet and you think wow this’ll do it and then the capsules burst and even more hydration given! But then it absorbs and dries down into the skin and like I said, some areas on my skin just need a little more. I think this would be amazing on someone with normal skin. nan
