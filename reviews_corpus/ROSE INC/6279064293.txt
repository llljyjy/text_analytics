This eye cream was super hydrating, I felt a very slight tingle after application but nothing major. It brightened my under eyes and smoothed out my dehydration lines. It has essentially no fragrance, which I love. It feels slightly tacky until fully dried down, but  once dry it feels comfortable. I suggest waiting until dry before layering with makeup. It does layer nicely with other skincare and makeup, there is no build up, greasiness, separation of products on my face(concealer remains full coverage and not patchy). It’s kind of a rich texture. I love the aesthetic of  the packaging and the light pink cream that helps brighten underneath my eyes. My only complaint is that when I opened my product there was some product missing (definitely some air gaps in the tube). Over all I think this cream did a nice job with hydration and brightness. I haven’t been using very long, and according to the timeline it has taken me to see effects with other eye creams, It would likely take about 4 weeks for me to see long term effects. I have high hopes for this though! Hydrating
