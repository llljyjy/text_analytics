I received this eye cream complimentary from Rose Inc. This eye cream has a beautiful nourishing texture but goes on very smoothly and feels lightweight on my skin., I apply this cream on the area around my eyes and tap it gently into my skin for better absorption. The lightweight texture spreads easily and absorbs fast and does not leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy. I love that this eye cream feels lightweight on my skin and that it does not irritate my sensitive eyes. My skin feels instantly hydrated and soft and it really helps to reduce the appearance of my dark circles and puffiness. I love how it has a beautiful soft brightening effect. Since using this cream the skin tone around my eyes has improved It looks brighter, less tired, hydrated and plump. My skin feels so soft, and the dark circles are less noticeable. I have added this eye cream to my daily skincare routine, and I am really impressed by the results. I highly recommend this eye cream. Soft brightening effect
