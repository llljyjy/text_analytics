This is a really interesting eye cream as it has a pearlescent finish so it does give your under eye area a brighter appearance. It has a pretty thin consistency and I like that it comes in a pump packaging. I really enjoyed using this, but I think my skin kind of reacted to this since my under eye area would pill when I apply moisturizer on top and it turned a bit red. Also, I noticed that you canâ€™t apply too much or else it would get goopy... My skin reacted to this eye cream
