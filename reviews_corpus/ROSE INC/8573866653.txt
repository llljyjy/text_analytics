I really like this moisturizer. It’s really helped the texture of my skin smooth out and evened out/brightened my skin tone. My only complaint is that it makes my skin super super oilier. I already struggle with oily skin but combined with the weather being hot and cold and then hot again in the south, the oil is just dripping off my face at this point. Other than that, I really love the results of this moisturizer! Maybe I can find an spf that’s mattifying? Something other than Murad cuz it pills haha. nan
