I am obsessed with this product. Even after a few uses, I’ve noticed a change in my under eyes. They’re overall more bright & hydrated! I like to use this product before makeup during my skin care routine because it gives an instant brightening affect and it sits well under my concelar. If you’re thinking about purchasing, do it! I’ve tried so many eye creams & this is one of the best. Brightened & Hydrated Under Eyes
