This eye cream is thicc. A little goes a long way. I live in the desert and need this type of moisture on my dry sensitive skin. It doesnâ€™t cause milia, and is a great primer under makeup. I love the heavy bottle with pump. Very sanitary and luxe feeling. Complimentary from Rose Inc., but would repurchase! great value for great moisture!
