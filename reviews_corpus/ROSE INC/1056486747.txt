First off, I love the brand. They have been coming out with high quality products and cute packaging. This light weight eye cream is hydrating, has really nice texture and consistency.  It absorbs quickly I use it at night and also in the morning before my makeup. Works really well under makeup to avoid creases and dryness. Little goes a long way! There is no scent which is good! I knock off one star because price is a bit high. Gifted Quality ingredients
