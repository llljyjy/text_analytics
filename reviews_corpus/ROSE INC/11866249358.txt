Iâ€™ve found my new favorite moisturizer! I am loving how weightless the formula is and how hydrated my skin feels. The little capsule balls dissolve as you rub it into your skin and give a burst of hydration. It has a mild scent of rose which is so refreshing and it comes with a little metal spatula so you never have to reach in with your fingers. Absolutely love it! Obsessed!
