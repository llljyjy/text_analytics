I went into sephora to purchase a moisturizer for my dry skin and this moisturizer has improved myRedness and within 1 use i noticed a significantly difference on my skin softness and hydration. My skin feels tighter and hydrated. My mom even started using it for her skin and her skin looks refreshed and tight. One thing i donâ€™t like is the smell. It smells like rose . very hydrating
