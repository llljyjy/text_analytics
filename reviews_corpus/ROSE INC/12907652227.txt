I have seriously the dryest skin in the winter (midwest problems) so I need a really good moisturizer and let me tell you, I was blown away by this moisturizer. The way it actually melted into my skin and fully moisturized my face. Not to mention, the little beads in it are a great touch. If you have dry skin, I really recommend this product! 10/10
