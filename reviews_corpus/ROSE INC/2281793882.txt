I had high hopes for this moisturizer because it sounded quite unique and different than what I have in my skincare routine currently. I do enjoy this product, but I think it’s important to note who the product is ideal for - dehydrated, stressed, sensitive and/or congested skin. If you have a drier skin type, this product alone won’t be enough to hydrate or moisturize your skin. It is fast-absorbing and it has a really light scent that isn’t irritating for most people with more sensitive skin. I have combination skin and I like to use this under my makeup. For my nighttime skincare routine, I like to layer an oil over this moisturizer. nan
