I am experiencing winter dry skin and this gel formula is very moisturizing. It feels weightless, makes skin bouncy plump, and my complexion looks radiant. The tiny microcapsules melt into skin with a watery consistency. Smells a bit like roses. I absolutely enjoy this for day use before makeup application! hydrating formula
