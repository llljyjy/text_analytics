I am really obsessed with everything I try from Rose Inc. I purchase a lot of eye creams because my eyes are puffy and dark. This one did a fantastic job! I put this on my tired eyes in the morning and it looked instantly brighter and less puffy after I dabbed it in. My under eyes felt hydrated and were hydrated because they were not dry and rough like they usually are. After applying my makeup routine, my eyes truly looked brighter and again there were no rough patches showing through my foundation or concealer. In love!!! Lovely!
