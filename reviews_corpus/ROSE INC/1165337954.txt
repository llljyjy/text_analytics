Wow. My new favorite daily moisturizer! So hydrating and leaves skin dewy and glowing, but once dry leaves no stickiness. The faint rose scent is really nice too. As I am inching towards age 50, have noticed that my skin is a little dryer and more sensitive, but I still have an oily T-zone. I don’t really want a heavy cream moisturizer though because it feels like my skin can’t breathe. This does the job perfectly in that my skin feels super hydrated and plumped but not “weighed down”. Also don’t have any issues with foundation going smoothly on top afterwards. I understand now why this has 5 stars! my new holy grail
