I was gifted this product by Rose Inc to try and review. I really enjoy this product! I would definitely say it’s more of a serum texture than a cream or balm texture. It’s super lightweight and feels very cooling and soft on the skin. It doesn’t have glitter or shimmer in it, but it does have some kind of reflective/luminous quality to it that really does make my under eye area look brighter. It’s also very hydrating. My under eye area felt very moisturized and soothed after using this cream. It also didnt irritate my eyes at all, which is a big plus since i have very sensitive eyes. And for those of you who wear makeup, you’ll be happy to know that this layered beautifully under a couple different concealers for me! Really lovely and luminous!
