It’s quite pretty and the handle is nicely balanced. It does feel relaxing to use and I enjoyed using it in my routine however I just do not feel that it really did anything. I didn’t see any sculpting or really any difference unfortunately. Pretty to look at and fun to use but that’s the best I can say about it Didn’t see any results
