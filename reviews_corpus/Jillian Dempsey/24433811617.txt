#gifted by Jillian Dempsey This facial massager promises to lift and sculpt, reduce puffiness, and provide an overall revitalized complexion. The T-bar massage head and rounded opposite end are coated in 24-karat gold, giving this tool a super luxe look and feel. Va Va Voom!! The on-off function makes it very easy to use and its small size and portability make it the perfect tool to pack in your overnight bag when you travel.How to use: Start with clean, dry, and makeup-free skin. I suggest applying your favorite moisturizer all over your face and neck prior to using it. Overall Thoughts: This is product is stunning and looks beautiful sitting on my bathroom counter. I like that itâ€™s small, light, and comfortable to hold  in my hand. I am not sure that I love the buzzing sounds of the massage- but easily tuned out with AirPods. Tbar
