I received a sample size of this serum in an Allure Beauty Box. I had no expectations about this product, but was very pleasantly surprised. After wearing this overnight layered under my night cream, my skin felt so smooth and hydrated. It is a bit pricey, so I will add it to my wish list and wait for a VIB sale. Lovely Serum! I Am Pleasantly Surprised!!!
