This takes gel moisturizer to a whole new level. It’s so liquid-y that if you tip this over, product will definitely run out of the packaging in no time. I think this is a decent moisturizer for people only with oilier skin types. I definitely don’t agree that this is for all skin types, unless you plan to layer it with something else. I have combination skin and I feel like I can get away with using this strictly during the summertime. The ingredients look great and the scent is light and fresh. It’s an okay product; it’s just not very versatile in my opinion. If you don’t have combination-oily skin, I would definitely say pass on this. nan
