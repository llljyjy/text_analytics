The packaging is the absolute prettiest! I was so impressed I truly didn’t know what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised even with the cream it self. I love the way it’s felt on my skin. I can’t believe it’s taken this long to give this brand a try. Definitely worth trying out! Don’t wait on it
