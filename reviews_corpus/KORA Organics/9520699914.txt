Good moisturizer, I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks now.The consistency is thick, almost balm-like cream, glides easily on the skin and it isn’t oily, at least on my dry skin. Definitely I wouldn’t recommend to people with oily skin.It is very hydrating and I like to use it as last step of my nighttime skincare regime to lock all the moisture in.It has a pretty strong smell in the beginning, like essential oils, but it goes away almost immediately.I like that you can purchase a refill vs another whole jar, very convenient. nan
