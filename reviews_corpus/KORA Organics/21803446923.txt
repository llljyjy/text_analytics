Itâ€™s smells wonderful and spreads very easily, and I love the way my skin feels. I use it as my morning moisturizer. I do use a vitamin C serum underneath for better results. I like the consistency of this moisturizer compared to some other similar brands. Love it and absolutely will recommend it to my friends. Very moisturizing and feels great on my face
