Absolutely love it! Since I started to use it, it keeps my skin moisturized and soothed. After a couple uses, it made my skin feel healthier and brighter. It smells nice and absorbed quickly after gently massaged. My skin has a natural glow since I added this moisturizer by Kora to my skin routine. I can tell my skin texture has been improved. Love it!
