I love to use this oil in my nighttime skincare routine as the last step. It has a little thick texture but doesn’t feel oily or greasy and is absorbed well into the skin. I have noticed my face feels brighter and smoother and much more glowing after using it. It does have a little strong scent but I don’t have any irritation from it. nan
