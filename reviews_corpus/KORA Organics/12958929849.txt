This is the first face oil I’ve used, and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn’t break me out! My skin has been tipping more dry than usual due to the winter air and dry indoor heat, and I needed something extra in addition to my moisturizer to calm some flakiness and redness. My skin is generally balanced and somewhat sensitive, and I do think this oil helped without causing any negative problems like clogging or breakouts or extra oiliness. I don’t think it works wonders in and of itself, but used within my routine, I think it did make a difference. I would recommend this product if you’re looking to fix certain skin issues like dryness, however I would not recommend if you’re looking to take your skin from good to great. The claim that it will make your skin perfect and glowy I think are overstated :) Pretty Good - Helped Dryness, No Breakouts
