It’s a very good moisturizer for everyday use I really like it it didn’t break me out , my t zone is oily but outer part is normal and this is very light moisturizer but keep my skin hydrated I really like the smell it’s kind of herbal but refreshing it doesn’t make me oily sticky and it lasted me quite awhile even though me and daughter are using it, i use Sk ii essance and then this and combination is wonderful  and I bought it myself it’s not for testing or free sample product Amazing……. Must try
