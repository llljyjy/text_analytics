Here is a perfect moisturizer for summer! It was my first time trying a product from Kora Organics, and this product worked very well for my skin. The packaging is stunning, but what I love the most is how lightweight this moisturizer is. It is also very hydrating, it makes my skin soft and glowy. I apply it every morning and my skin feel hydrated throughout the day. Summer staple
