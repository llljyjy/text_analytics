What a unique cleanser I have ever tried! Besides it being Clean and organic,  I really like the main ingredients that it has which is the Turmeric. We all know the good benefits of it. I also like that it does not have the odor surprisingly. It lathers perfectly and did not stripped my skin. Packaging is so nice & sturdy! I am obsessed! Great cleanser!!
