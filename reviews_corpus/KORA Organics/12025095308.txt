This is a very lovely and refreshing face wash.  It feels very smooth on my skin with a bit of what I can only describe as a tingly clean feel as you use it.  It perked my skin right up after using it.  I liked the scent too - itâ€™s definitely heavy on mint from the peppermint oil mixed with a nice blend of fresh herbs / florals.   I was surprised by how much I liked this one. nan
