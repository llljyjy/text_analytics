The NEW Active Algae Lightweight Moisturizer from KORA Organics is like a super-charged green juice for your skin! Not to mention that it’s refillable and sustainable.The Kora lightweight gel moisturizer is non-greasy, provides long-lasting hydration, evens skin tone, and soothes without leaving an excessive shine. This lotion, which is rich in naturally derived powerful active substances including Green Tea, Alpine Rose, Green Algae, and Swiss Glacier Water, delivers hydrating and anti-aging benefits for healthy, radiant-looking skin. I have a combination of oily acne-prone skin so I’m currently leaning towards light gel moisturizers for the summertime and this is just perfect! nan
