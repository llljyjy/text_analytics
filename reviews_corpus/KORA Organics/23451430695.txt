I am totally loving this moisturizer. I specially love the formula of the moisturizer, it is light weight and does not feels greasy/oily, which definitely makes it perfect for summers. Also I have noticed that this is really helping in calming my irritated skin and helps to brighten and bring that healthy plump to my skin. Summer Favorite
