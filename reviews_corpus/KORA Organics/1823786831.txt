I love the refillable packaging and the jar is so pretty. Turmeric is a great ingredient for brightening so I was looking forward to this moisturizer. But I think texture is really thick and feels paste like honestly I did not quite like it.Scent is ok it is not so overpowering. I liked the algae moisturizer better than this. nan
