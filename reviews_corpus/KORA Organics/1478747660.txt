I love this moisturizer. It’s light weight and absorbs into you skin. It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. I have been using it in the AM after applying my vitamin c. I find that it does help my skin look plump. One thing I really enjoy is that you can buy a replacement pod, which is really great for the environment. nan
