Cleansing my face is an important step in my skincare routine, I was so excited to try this new cleanser with turmeric yes plz because turmeric has so many benefits to the skin. This cleanser lathers so nice and has a cooling sensation which is so refreshing in the morning and has a light subtle scent which I love. you need just one drop for your face and does a great job in cleansing the skin and feel so soft and fresh without drying it out. Highly recommended if you are looking for a new cleanser to try. So refreshing!
