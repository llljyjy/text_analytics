I’ve always wanted to try Kora Organics and I’m so happy to have been given a chance to try their moisturizer! I think this one has made it into my “holy grail” list. I have been loving how my skin looks & feels lately, on top of that, it’s so hydrating that a little goes a long way! I think this is THE perfect winter moisturizer. I’ve been really dry lately, so this has definitely helped moisturizer my skin while at the same time giving it the glow it’s been missing. I definitely recommend!!! Luxurious but worth every penny!
