I have normal to dry skin, which is why I think that this product works well for me. The consistency is a bit stiff when you first use it you need to warm it up in your hand and then it will be easier to apply to your skin. I like to use this in the morning to create a natural plump affect on my face. I love how this container is reusable you just need to replace the pot inside. I mean concerns are dry skin, fine lines and aging. nan
