Perfect daytime moisturizer for dry skin. I usually prefer lightweight moisturizers for the daytime that wear well under sunscreen or makeup, and this particular one does the job. Hydrates beautifully, sinks in the skin and doesnâ€™t cause pilling of the products you put on top. Love that it is a refillable jar! Great daytime moisturizer
