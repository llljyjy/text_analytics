I usually am skeptical of natural skin care brands because Iâ€™ve done my research on how they can be harsh for sensitive skin like mine. However, this was a pleasant surprise for me! I loved the scent, the way it lathered, made my skin feel nourished and not tight, and ultimately really cleaned my skin. I personally find it to be a bit more expensive for a cleanser, but if you want to splurge on something nice for yourself this is definitely the route to go! Smells amazing!
