This cream is very heavy, more a night eye cream. Not for use before applying under eye concealer. The eye cream did nothing for my fine lines around my eye area. It has helped a little for my dark circles. Iâ€™d recommend this to someone in the 20s looking to brighten the eye area. Not for anyone trying to reduce fine lines. nan
