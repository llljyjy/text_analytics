The first thing I noticed about the Kora Organics turmeric glow moisturizer is the bejeweled container. It is so pretty when it catches the light. I am glad I can reuse it with their refillable pods. The moisturizer is thick,creamy, yellow and definitely smells like turmeric which is a staple in my Indian kitchen. I warm a bit of the product in my palms and massage it on my skin. It keeps my skin hydrated all day. I has AHAs , so I follow it up with a sunscreen. I look forward to using it every day. Itâ€™s become the favorite part of my skin care routine. So creamy
