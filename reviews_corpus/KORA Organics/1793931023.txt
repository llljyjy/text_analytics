love this moisturizer. It’s light weight and absorbs into you skin. It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. I think it is  too expensive plus the smell I don’t like it. It smell like bug spray. I have combination skin so far it has not Break me out yet. I don’t like the idea of expensive a lot of money to replace the pod. Plus is expensive too. Waste of money should’ve made it like a normal Moisturizer. I would recommend my friend if they change the smell. Moisturizer
