I have a super dry skin and usually I don’t like changing my skincare. I love how just one drop of this foams and leaves my skin clean&moisturized, without making face feeling sticky or tight. Plus, this cleanser has a cooling effect too. The glass bottle feels nice and beautiful, good size. Product smells more peppermint fresh, not turmeric. I think it’s because of the essential oil ingredient. This product was gifted by Kora Organics Peppermint fresh
