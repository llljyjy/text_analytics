First time trying anything from Kora and this was a really nice moisturizer to introduce me into the brand. The gel cream has a nice gel consistency and the smell is herbal. The cream absorbed right in to my skin and had a nice cooling feeling. Not sticky finish and as a dry skin person this will be a perfect summer moisturizer! nan
