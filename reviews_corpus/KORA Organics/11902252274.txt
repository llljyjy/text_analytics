This moisturizer is THICCC. The consistency is that of a really thick icing, kind of like room-temperature cinnamon roll icing but a lot smoother. It smells great. The packaging is a little strange because there is a LOT of room in the glass container compared to the little re-fillable pod, but I find that to be the case with a lot of re-usable containers.I tried using it during the day and it was way too heavy to wear at the end of Summer. I tried even using a tiny amount and it was still too much. Like covers-your-phone-in-oil too much. There are a lot of beautiful oils in this cream, so I didn’t mind. Then I tried it at night and I woke up with really glowy beautiful skin! As a night cream or a winter/dry skin solution this is perfect. A little goes a LONG way and it doesn’t soak in really well. Very Thick but Great!
