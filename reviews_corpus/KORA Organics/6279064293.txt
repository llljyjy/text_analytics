There are a few things I love about this. I love how this foams and lathers without my face feeling sticky or tight. My face does feel clean and kind of has a cooling effect- calming my skin. I also LOVE the packaging. The glass bright orange bottle feels so nice and looks beautiful on my shelf. Now there’s a couple of things I don’t necessarily love. I wish this smelled more citrus or fresh, especially to match the beautiful bright orange bottle. Instead this smells more  peppermint/ essential oil like. It’s not a bad smell, it just doesn’t necessarily make sense to me. There is also essential oil ingredients which makes me a tad bit weary to use this type of cleanser every day, since I can be a bit sensitive to these. I didn’t have any problems from first use though. I do love how a little product goes a long way and the bottle is a pretty nice size! I think this cleanser feels very lightweight and moisturizing upon application, and easily rinses  off! I like a lot about this cleanser I just would change the scent and the essential oil ingredients Great-wish there were a few small changes!
