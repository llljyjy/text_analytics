I love it! This moisturizer is so hydrating for my dry skin and I put it on after showers. It has a very light, natural smell and it’s yellow color but doesn’t make you look yellow at all. It’s a little bit greasy to start so don’t use more than a pearl size but after you let it set, my skin already feels softer.  I’ll continue using it every day to help with my dark spots! (So far I haven’t seen any changes but I don’t expect dark spots to just disappear) So moisturizing!
