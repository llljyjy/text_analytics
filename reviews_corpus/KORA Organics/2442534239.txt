As the weather is transitioning, my skin gets drier and lines I didnâ€™t know I have are showing. But adding this lightweight oil to my skin, my skin is dewy, brighter and softer while the lines are slowly disappearing. I like to use it as the last step to my skincare routine to seal in the deal in the morning (prior makeup) and night. nan
