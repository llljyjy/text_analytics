Ok so first of all the packaging on this product is A+! Very pretty, very high end, very sturdy. It’s also refillable which is great! The product itself has a gel feeling. It’s very smooth and slightly sticky. When you apply it to your face it almost has a cooling effect, which makes it great for right after a hot shower. I have fairly dry skin and I find that it works well, but I prefer something a little heavier for the extra dry spots on my face. If you have normal to combo skin I think you would really like this product! nan
