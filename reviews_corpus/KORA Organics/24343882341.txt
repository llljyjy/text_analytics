First I want to say how much I love the luxurious heavy glass packaging and that it can be refilled. I have combination skin and this moisturizer was just alittle to heavy for me during the day so I have been using it in my night time routine. My skin is more on the oiler side so it does take alittle longer to absorb and I have to really rub it in and I only use a tiny bit. Once soaked in my skin feels smooth and plump. For the scent I am really picking up the subtle alpine rose the goes away after alittle but. Over all I do love the end results from this moisturizer. Lightweight
