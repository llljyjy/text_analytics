Finally a good foaming cleanser from Kora! I used to use their old foaming cleanser that came in a blue tube, but that one didn’t really foam that much and it didn’t really offer the best cleanse. Then I used the cream cleanser and it wasn’t that great…was moisturising but it didn’t remove my makeup well. This one…absolutely amazing! Foams up nicely, cleanses well, feels so nice and refreshing on my skin with the peppermint oil, and my skin feels so velvety smooth afterwards. It also smells great…slightly floral but very minty. Also, the glass packaging and the ingredients are a plus! Best cleanser I’ve tried in a while!
