I’m already a huge fan of Kora Organics and this moisturizer did not disappoint at all. The packaging is absolutely gorgeous and looks amazing on my vanity. I love that you can refill the container with pods , such a great idea. The moisturizer has a gel like texture that feels lightweight on my skin. It absorbs quickly and goes well with my combo skin type. It makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth all day, while looking plump and dewy. I love that it’s s packed with good ingredients that is healthy for my skin. Overall this moisturizer had been a hit with me and I definitely could see my self switching from my other product. It works well and makes my skin feel amazing. Love it!!!
