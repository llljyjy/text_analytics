On my second jar of this gem. It really makes my dry and dehydrated skin less dull and more glowy, hydrated more plumped, and overall healthier looking. Love to use it in the Am and Kora oil at night to get the most of hydration especially when the colder weather hits. This also works so well to brighten and even out the skin tone. Highly recommended Glow baby glow
