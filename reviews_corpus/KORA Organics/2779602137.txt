I really loved the Kora Turmeric Glow moisturizer! The packaging is the prettiest I’ve ever seen, but I love how it’s reusable and how you can just buy the reusable pods to pop in and out! My first impression was the moisturizer is the color of turmeric, but blends invisibly into the skin. It also smells like a spice market in the best way. Applying it feels like I’m at a spa, and I really enjoyed the scent; spicy but not overpowering, and it dissipates once rubbed in. I feel like just in the few days I’ve been using it, it has already significantly brightened my tone, and I already love it. My complexion was looking a bit dull, and this really made it glowy! Love the glowy skin it gives me!
