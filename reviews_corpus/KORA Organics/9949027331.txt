First of all, I like the packaging. The bottle is made of glass; it’s luxurious and practical. Just for that, I want to use the product every day.  The smell is subtle and pleasant to me. The oil isn’t “greasy”; it penetrates the skin very well and leaves a healthy glow. I usually use three drops of oil like in the AFTER picture, but if I want more glow, I can use more product without any discomfort.  I can not say anything about the long-term benefits because I’ve been using it for less than a week.  So far, I like using it at the last step of my dry skincare routine. Healthy glow
