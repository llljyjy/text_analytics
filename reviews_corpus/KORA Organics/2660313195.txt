Beautiful packaging but I cannot stand the smell. It smells like glue/crayons, that plasticky smell. I received the product, excited bc its beautifully package, but as soon as I opened it, i decided to return. The cream is also on the thicker side, almost sticky feeling. Back to Sephora for me. bad smell and very thick consistency
