I have tried several Kora products like the turmeric moisturizer and this one is by far my favorite. itâ€™s lightweight yet leaves the skin super hydrated. I apply the product before I go to bed and I wake up with my skin feeling plump and hydrated. I also love that the pods are refillable which is great for the environment. The scent is all-natural and does not have any odd smell to it. Lightweight yet super hydrating.
