I was so excited to try this moisturizer and this is the first product that I tried from this brand and I have to say that I am so impressed with how well this moisturizer works, I have combination skin and this moisturizer leaves my skin hydrated without feeling greasy or sticky on top of that it leaves my skin super soft! I love the texture because it is lightweight and has a nice scent! hydrating
