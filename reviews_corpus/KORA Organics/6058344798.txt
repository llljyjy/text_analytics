Omg I have to mention the packaging, even though it’s probably the least important thing about this product, nevertheless, it puts a smile on my face every time I use it. Very eye catching and beautiful. The moisturizer itself is super lightweight, gets absorbed momentarily but it moisturizes my skin very effectively. It has a nice silky gel-like consistency that slightly reminds me of aloe vera gel, but much more delicate. It’s almost watery but in a good way, not in the sense that it’s runny. To me, it’s absolutely perfect for summer when it’s hot outside and the last thing I want to do is to apply a thick white cream on my skin. I’ve noticed how soft this product makes my skin. It also seems to do a really good job at calming skin down after sun exposure or any irritation. The list of ingredients is very interesting and promising. I’m going to continue using it but so far it’s amazing. nan
