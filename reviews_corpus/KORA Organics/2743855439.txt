The moisturizer has a thick consistency but melts into the skin quickly. It has a beautiful scent to it. Upon application it instantly boosts the moisturizer on the skin. However, I didnot find the moisturization long lasting. I have used this moisturizer as my nighttime moisturizer so far and in the morning I donâ€™t feel the moisturization intact or having the glow. Note: I have combo skin. This might be ideal for me for day time and I really look forward to reap the benefits of brightening or glowing effect this moisturizer promises to deliver. The packaging looks luxe and I love that the pot is refillable! Did not blew me away!
