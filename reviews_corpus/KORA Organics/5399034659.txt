I really like how balanced my oily skin feels after using this, so it’s a shame that it smells and feels so minty. No irritation, but minty-fresh skin is just not my thing. I would’ve expected a turmeric and aloe-vera based cleanser to be more soothing. Great cleanser, but don’t like the minty feel!
