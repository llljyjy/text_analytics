Wow! Such a luxurious feeling moisturizer—the texture reminds me a little of beeswax hand lotions I’ve used. A tiny bit goes a long way. I put a small amount on the tip of one finger and warm it up between two fingers, and it’s enough for my whole face. It kind of melts on my skin when I warm it up, which feels really nice. It almost looks like a mango sorbet in the jar: I like the vibrant orangey/yellow color and fresh herbal aroma, as well as the packaging! In person the lid is kind of mesmerizing to look at in the light; it’s plastic, but it reflects light like a gemstone. Great that it’s refillable! Definitely a “splurge” kind of skincare item. I’m enjoying it! Luxurious
