I REALLY wanted to love this product. First, I purchased this is July 22’ and I didn’t start to use this until late August ( after I finished my Drunk Elephant Vitamin c). After using for about two months, I realized the expiration date was July 2022. I am not sure how they stay on top of expiring product but that was disappointing. I have been finding that Kora products are sticky and do not absorb as quickly. Seems to leave the skin a little tacky before you can apply the remainder of my nightly routine. I will say that although it was an “expired” product, I noticed more of an even skin tone. I am currently pregnant and have dark spots on my neck and face. I have seen a slight reduction in the dark spots (due to horomone changes) The low rating is due to being sold expired product and the little bit of tackiness when applied. Otherwise, I have found some items I love from the Kora line. Tumeric Face mask and the vitamin C eye cream! I will be checking expiration dates for future purchases. I saw texture improve but had some cons
