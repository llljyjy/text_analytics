First of all I love the size of this glass bottle cleaner. The gel formula applys nice with just the right amount of lather. It is very soothing and then washes off nicely. It did a good job cleaning my face and removing my eye makeup too.  It’s made with great ingredients, I’m excited to try other products from this brand and would definitely buy this again.
