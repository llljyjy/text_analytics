It absorbs very well and provides excellent protection. I mainly use it in cold windy weather before going out for a walk. Water based creams are poor protection in such weather. Also, it is the best treatment for a badly dehydrated skin. I have sensitive/combination skin, so the balance is so refreshing! Itâ€™s too soon to tell but I think it helps my skin stay moisturized. nan
