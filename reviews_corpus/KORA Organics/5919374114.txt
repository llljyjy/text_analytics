I love this refillable design! The cap is shining which is gorgeous. To refill the capsule simply just need to twist and remove and install it. This moisturizer has the scent of turmeric. It has a thick cream texture, not too hard to spread out. It takes some time to absorb. I took out the 2 peas size and it’s enough for the whole face. It’s very hydrating and I can feel a shield formed on my face. (a little sticky) I have dry sensitive skin. I personally think that it’s a little too thick and it’s good to use in winter. It doesn’t show an instant effect so more time is needed to see the result. nan
