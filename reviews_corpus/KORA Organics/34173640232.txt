This face oil smells lovely in an essential oil way which I can see some people liking. However I’m not a fan of essential oils in skincare as it can cause reactions in people. Goes on skin almost matte with a hint of healthy glow. Subtle and beautiful. It’s ok if you’re fine with essential oils and caprylic triglycerides but those definitely put me off this. nan
