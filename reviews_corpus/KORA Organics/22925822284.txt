Truly blown away. This is the softest most clean my face has ever felt! My face also feels hydrated, not stripped. It bubbles up beautifully, just perfection honestly. The packaging is also gorgeous, high quality glass with a pump! There’s is a peppermint scent that I was unsure of at first but I don’t mind, I think it covers up the smell of turmeric. i HIGHLY recommend this, definitely a new holy grail! INCREDIBLE
