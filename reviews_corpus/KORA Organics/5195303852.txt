The Noni Glow Face Oil has been a great addition to my skin care routine. I wear it both a.m. and p.m. and I have incorporated it as a last step to my routine by applying 4 drops and massaging the oil between the palms of my hands to warm it up and then gently tapping it onto the skin. It absorbs very quickly, feels lightweight, plays well with other products and does not leave a greasy film behind. It feels incredibly moisturizing and gives my skin a beautiful and healthy glow. Additionally, it has a very light and pleasant scent that makes the experience very enjoyable. I highly recommend this product! Gorgeous Face Oil!
