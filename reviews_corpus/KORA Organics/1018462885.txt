Brightens my undereyes so well I was able to see a difference within the first 3 uses of a sample I received from one of my orders. It doesn’t have a perfumey scent but I expect that from something that has honest and good ingredients. I don’t need perfume under my eyes to know that this eye cream does what it says it’ll do. I use mine morning and night and just make sure to use sunscreen on top of it during the day. Will definitely be repurchasing when I run out, and hushing by the amount I use with each application that should be several months from now. nan
