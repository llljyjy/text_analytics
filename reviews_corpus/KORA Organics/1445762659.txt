I’ll be the first to say that I’m suspicious of gimmicks, and the celebrity endorsements and freaking gorgeous packing of this moisturizer raised red flags.  Wrongly, as it turns out.  It is actually impressively hydrating even to my dry, barrier damaged skin.  What’s more, it is BRIGHTENING like nothing else.  It’s a no-makeup-required moisturizer.  As a bonus, I really do adore the stunning, vanity worthy packaging which is reusable and refillable! Glowing!
