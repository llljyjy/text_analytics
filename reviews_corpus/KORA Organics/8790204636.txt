Iâ€™m in love with this moisturizer! I have dry, sensitive acne prone skin and decided to try this out paired with the noni oil. I LOVE it! My skin feels supple and hydrated and I have no redness or inflammation that I get in other products. I also have a nice glow after applying products. I think this is truly great for sensitive skin. I will continue using and hope to see more results as time passes! Such a great moisturizer!
