I love how lightweight this moisturizer is while still feeling hydrating! The gel consistency is wonderful, it makes my skin feel smooth and my fine lines disappear! The larger pores around my nose look a lot smaller too. I love it under makeup it keeps my skin from getting too greasy/shiny looking throughout the day. I use a small amount because a little goes a long way for me and I use it morning and night and my skin already feels smoother and more moisturized. And the packaging is so beautiful so I get excited to use it every day!! So Lightweight!!
