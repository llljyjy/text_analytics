It provides a gentle but thick lather and doesn’t strip my skin. It has a light scent but nothing overwhelming at all. I’ve used it for almost a week and have not experienced any irritation. So far my skin loves it! Glad I tried it and will definitely be my new go to face wash. A little goes a long way! Two pumps and you’re good to go! Will definitely repurchase once this bottle runs out which will probably be for a long time because a lot of product comes in the bottle. nan
