This was great to have in the dry winter months and was not at all oily as one would think with an oil beauty product. My skin felt very hydrated and I did notice that my skin tone evened out a bit but this took nearly a month. The sent is very faint and not over powering. I cannot place the smell but would relate it closely to flowers. I put a few drops in my hand and then gently pressed it into my skin and did a sweeping motion to my hairline. Overall, very pleased Great!
