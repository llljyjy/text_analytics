I love the Kora moisturizers and this one is great if you have dry skin and need extra hydration, or you just need something richer for nighttime. I have combination skin and I use this at night for extra moisture and radiance. I like the texture because itâ€™s not too thick on the skin and rubs in really nicely. When I wake up in the morning my skin is hydrated, the tone looks more even, and less dull. Definitely recommend, and I love the eco friendly packaging! nan
