I am loving my turmeric glow moisturizer by kora organics! It feels super luxurious on my skin. Kind of like a high-end product you would get to try at a spa, know what I mean? Im using it twice a day - in the morning before I apply my make up, and at night after my cleansing routine. Just a little bit product goes a long way. Turmeric has amazing benefits and is especially great for dark circles, dark spots and dull skin which are my main concerns. it took two weeks of consistent use to see an improvement in the overall dullness, but I definitely see a difference. I plan to continue using it to see more benefits. Totally recommend! So luxurious!
