I tried a different KORA moisturizer and it was a little too heavy for my combination skin. This one is perfect, it has just the right feel and texture that doesn’t make my pores feel congested, and it actually keeps the skin moisturized. Also, the packaging is gorgeous! I love that it’s refillable too! nan
