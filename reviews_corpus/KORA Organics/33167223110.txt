I love this moisturizer. I was impressed by the beautiful packaging as soon as I opened the box. I just want to put it on display. The moisturizer itself has a bit of scent but it’s not overwhelming. It’s very moisturizing without leaving any oily or greasy feeling on my skin. I absolutely love this product. Absolutely beautiful
