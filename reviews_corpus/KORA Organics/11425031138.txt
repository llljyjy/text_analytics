I’ve used this moisturizer for a couple of days now and I am super happy with the results thus far. I have sensitive, dry, dull skin and this has helped a ton! It’s helped keeping my skin glowing, moisturized and bright all day. I use it during the day on top of my serums and under my sunscreen. It has a rich thick texture, which melts right on your skin leaving it hydrated for the whole day. nan
