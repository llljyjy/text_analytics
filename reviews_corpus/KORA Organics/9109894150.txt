This cleanser has a lightweight gel consistency and it doesnâ€™t lather up much. It has a minty scent and upon contact with the skin, it actually leaves a cooling sensation. As someone with dry skin, I was decently surprised at how gentle this cleanser is. It effectively cleanses my skin and leaves it soft, supple, and hydrated! Great cleanser for dry skin!
