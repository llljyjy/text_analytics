I’ve been always loving Kora! I’ve been using their turmeric mask for years, and it’s absolutely fantastic. 5 years ago or so I heard in one of her interviews, that Miranda herself loves using rosehip oil, and I started using it as well. I was super excited to receive this oil (also rosehip based), and I must admit it’s superior. It balances out my oiliness, I know it might sound counterproductive, but it actually helps to keep my skin oil free. It didn’t break me out, and my skin is very sensitive and acne prone. Vit C in this oil helps to fade dark spots and acne marks naturally. I really love this product and will continue using it for many more years to come. The best oil for my sensitive acne prone skin
