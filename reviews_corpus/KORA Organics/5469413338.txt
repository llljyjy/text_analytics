I was sent this from Kora Organics. First off, I love the packaging. It looks so beautiful sitting on my sink! Secondly, the smell! OMG! Its a strong scent but I absolutely love it! I feel like it helps wake me up when I wash my face with this in the morning ( I use it at night as well ). My skin feels SO CLEAN after using this. It is a pricey face wash so Iâ€™m not 100% sure if I would purchase it once I finish it. But on a sale price I would buy it. LOVE THIS
