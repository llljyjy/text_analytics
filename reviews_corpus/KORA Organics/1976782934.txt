super refreshing cleanser - wasn’t expecting the cooling sensation to be so strong, it’s almost like when you use charcoal or tea tree oil on your scalp and the cooling feeling lingers for some time after cleansing. i really like the way it thickens up as i cleanse and it leaves my face feeling super clean and refreshed. i use this as my second cleanser at night! super generous amount and will last me a while so i’d say it’s worth the price for the volume! leaves my face feeling super refreshed and cool
