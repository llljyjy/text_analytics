The packaging is gorgeous and I love that the key ingredient in this moisturizer is Turmeric. I have grown up seeing my mom add turmeric powder to homemade masks because of its many benefits. I found it to be very hydrating but the texture was quite silicon-y to me, it took a while for my skin to absorb it. Love the idea of the refillable pods and it has a beautiful earthy smell! Like it but donâ€™t love it
