I love using this as part of my am routine because it has such a lovely, energizing scent. The gel-like consistency foams up nicely to deeply and gently cleanse my skin without stripping it or irritating it. The cooling sensation feels so refreshing, like my skin is waking up. Iâ€™m loving how this cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean, healthy and smooth. I also really like the pump and glass packaging! Love this cleanser!
