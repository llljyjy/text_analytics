The moisturizer has a balmy texture, so I first warm it on my hands and then apply it on my face. I love that It givesyou a glowy finish. I have combination skin so this is perfect for me for fall and winter, might be too much for summer when my tzone gets slightly oily.   I love the ingredients overall and love how it feels on the skin. Also, how GORGEOUS is the packaging omg, so amazing they have refills. Glowy skin!
