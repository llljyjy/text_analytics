I received this facial cleanser complimentary from Kira Organics and I’ve been loving it so far, I use it daily to either remove my makeup or as the first step of my skin care routine, it doesn’t fully remove waterproof mascara, but other than than it gets rid of everything and it’s very gentle, I don’t find it drying on my skin and it has a wonderful herbal scent that I enjoy as well, it lathers up nicely and the glass bottle gives it a super luxurious touch, I love it and would highly recommended it Wonderful facial cleanser!
