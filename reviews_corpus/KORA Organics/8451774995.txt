Love this cleanser! It’s gentle and leaves my skin looking really glowy. I’ve never tried a cleanser like this but I’m really loving it. It has turmeric to help brighten dark spots but I don’t think it’ll do much brightening since it only sits on your skin while your cleansing. Overall, it’s a great cleanser! Amazing!
