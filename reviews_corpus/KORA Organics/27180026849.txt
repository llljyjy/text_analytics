Loving this kora cleanser so much. It has a lightweight serum feel to it that cleanses my makeup off well, doesnâ€™t leave my skin feeling tight afterwards, and leaves me feeling refreshed due to the subtle minty scent. You get quite a lot of product for the price too. This bottle will go a long way. My skin has been glowing since using this so I will be purchasing again. Highly recommend. Awesome cleanser
