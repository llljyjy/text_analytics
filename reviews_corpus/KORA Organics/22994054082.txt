I love that this cleanser is vegan and made with great ingredients such as turmeric and aloe Vera. It gives a nice foam after lathering. Does not dry out my skin and I can tell my skin looks brighter after a few days of using it. I wash my face with this cleanser morning and night and there is no irritation. nan
