I have normal/combo skin with some very fine lines beginning to show up. I love the packaging that this moisturizer comes in! It looks so chic but the fact that you can swap out just the refill rather than having to throw away the whole container is great. The cream is quite thick and feels very luxurious on the skin. Although it’s thick it doesn’t feel heavy at all on my skin and sinks in nicely without leaving any sticky or greasy residue. I like to take a dab and warm it up on my fingertips for a few seconds before pressing it into my skin and then gently smoothing the remainder in. I’ve noticed my skin looking a lot more glowy and bright since using this. I wake up looking like I’ve had a good night’s sleep even if I haven’t. It’s definitely helped my dullness and made my skin feel so smooth! Smooth Glowing Skin!
