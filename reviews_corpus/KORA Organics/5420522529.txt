This is the first moisturizer I have tried from Kora Organics, I am a big fan of their facial oil! I was a bit worried to try this since it is suppose to leave a radiant finish and I have combination oily skin but this provided enough hydration to make my skin feel good during the day. I would also recommend this at night since it is deeply hydrating! I am looking forward to seeing results on my fine lines around my forehead and smile line as well. nan
