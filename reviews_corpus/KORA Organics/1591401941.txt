I received this product as a free sample on my last order. I love how this moisturizer felt on my skin, it is hydrating and it absorbed well. Unfortunately, the scent is so awful it negates the benefits of the product for me. I am not scent sensitive, but this was so unpleasant I am glad the sample only lasted 2 applications... awful scent
