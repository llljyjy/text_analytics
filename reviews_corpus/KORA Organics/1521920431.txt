I have never tried Kora brand products before so was so excited to try out the turmeric glow cleanser. The packaging is beautiful and I love the ingredients list as well. Once applied into hands the cleanser becomes a soft  foam on the face and is the perfect second cleanse after using a cleansing oil when taking my makeup off. I get a nice thorough cleanse on my skin that isnâ€™t stripping or drying. nan
