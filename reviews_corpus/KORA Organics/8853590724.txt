Unfortunately FOR ME this product was awful.1st, I was looking for something to replace the Primera alpine berry watery cream since that isn’t sold in the US anymore. From kora I already have the Noni body and face oil, oil cleanser, eye cream, turmeric mask, and I’ve tried the turmeric lotion. The products mentioned I LOVE. so I figured I would give this a try for moisturizer. It’s terrible. For one it oddly lathers up as you try to work it all over your face. I have to drag it all over (and it just streaks even more green)  even when I use a tiny bit, and then even that tiny bit doesn’t moisturize enough. There’s also the fact that it doesn’t fully sink into the skin, rather it sits on your face so later on you HAVE to scrub your face because it will pill/leave product on your face. The scent doesn’t bother me like it does for others, but it makes sense cause it’s not fragrance free. Anyways, will not be buying this one again. I’ll keep the container and just refill it with the turmeric lotion or something else. My sis has the actual turmeric container, so even if we both had the tumeric refills itll be easy to tell who’s belong to who since I’ll have this blue container instead (same size as turmeric lotion container, refills for both are the same size). Still on the hunt then for the perfect replacement for Primera A let down
