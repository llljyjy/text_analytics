This face oil is very moisturizing. I use a few drops with another moisturizer in the morning. At night, I just use it by itself. Very little goes a long way! I love the ingredients and the fact that most of them are from organic farming! Rose hip oil is the first ingredient.  I have definitely noticed a glow! nan
