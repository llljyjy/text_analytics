OK cleanser. Have been using for over a month and haven’t noticed substantial improvements in my skin. More like keeping it up. Not the best pore cleanser and almost acts as a first cleanser (that’s how gentle it is). This doesn’t completely make the skin tight after washing but there is some dryness. Overall hasn’t done much to improve oiliness or give the skin a complete transformation. Simply just an ok cleanser. Seems to improve redness and doesn’t cause irritation - but not a miracle worker. Would recommend if you have normal skin and clogged pores aren’t your concern. OK cleanser
