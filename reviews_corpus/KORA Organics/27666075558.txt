I have been using Cora products for few years now. I am a big fan of their products. I love that their products are vegan, gluten-free, and cruelty-free. I use a moisturizer daily I prioritize my skin care routine. I love this turmeric glow moisturizer , anything with turmeric I love . I like the texture of this cream not greasy or oily itâ€™s perfect for my not too dry skin. It definitely leaves my skin super hydrated and glowy. I love the ingredients in this cream and it smells amazing. I would definitely buy this in the future and this would also be a great gift to someone you love. I recommend this glow moisturizer to anyone looking for amazing results. Great Glow Moisturizer
