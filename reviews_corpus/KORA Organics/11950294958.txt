This moisturizer is my 2nd favorite in the KORA line with the Turmeric Glow being my all-time favorite. If you have ultra-dry skin like mine, you may find you need to apply a couple layers of this to leave your skin feeling hydrated — my skin seems to just eat this right up (I have 2 heavier layers applied in the image attached). That being said, I bet combo/oily skin types would find this moisturizer to be a dream come true. It has a very subtle earthy/natural smell to it that I actually really enjoy, and it layers well under an SPF or heavier moisturizer without pilling.  As we move into the warmer more humid months, I can see myself grabbing this off the shelf more often. All in all, it’s a win in my book, however with my skin being so dry, I cannot say this moisturizer when used alone is enough. Great for Combo/Oily Skin - Absorbs Beautifully
