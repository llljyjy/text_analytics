This is a cleanser unlike any other. I was skeptical because of the price. I was gifted this product but even still. I am quite happy with it I think the hefty price comes with how cute and sturdy the packaging is. It is a glass. The peppermint oil gives the product a nice refreshing feeling to the face. I used 4 pumps when using this product. t makes my pores look non existent. I would recommend but I am giving it 4 stars out of 5 for the price. Refreshing
