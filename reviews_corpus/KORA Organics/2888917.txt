Love this product. I have very sensitive skin and scaring from years of acne and irritation,, and this does the trick! I can only use it once a week, but that’s a enough to get the results I need, exfoliation and clearing. I took off a star because this stuff gets everywhere. Tumeric always stains things, so that just is what it is. All in all I’d recommend this, but be mindful if you’re skin needs and reduce usage if needed. Tumeric to the rescue
