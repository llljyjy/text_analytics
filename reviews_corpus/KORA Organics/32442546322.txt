I have been using this for a few days now. First of all, packaging is super cute I love the gem look it def looks chic on the bathroom counter. First thing I noticed about this is the scent, itâ€™s very earthy almost smells like matcha. The consistency is gel like. It goes on very light and leaves a smooth matte like finish. Ultimately this is good for a light summer moisturizer nan
