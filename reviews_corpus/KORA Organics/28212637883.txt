The Active Algae moisturizer is summer hydration at its best! It has a gel-like texture, and feels very lightweight yet provides AMAZING hydration! It has a delicate marine scent, which smells soooo good! This has become my go to moisturizer in the morning - It instantly melts into my skin and leaves it feeling ultra soft and plump! My skin feels thoroughly hydrated and nourished, but not heavy or greasy. LOVE this moisturizer so much!
