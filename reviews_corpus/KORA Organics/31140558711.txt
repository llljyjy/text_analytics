I was gifted this lotion, to give my honest review so here it is. I have never heard of a moisturizer with turmeric, but I am aware of the benefits of turmeric, so I was excited with the opportunity arose to try this. The moisturizer is light and does on light, leaves a nice coating without a greasy film. Leaves my skin glowing. Do recommend. Great Product
