Wow! This isn’t like any other face wash I’ve tried before. I enjoy using it day and night. The smell is strong but it’s enjoyable. It works up to a rich lather. I love the skincare benefits the ingredients offer. It is cooling and refreshing! My skin is sensitive to exfoliation so I appreciate that this handles my rough patches without leaving my skin dry and stripped. Cooling and refreshing
