This is my new favorite face wash! It is light but lathers well on my skin. It leaves me feeling clean without stripping my face (giving you that tight, over-drying feeling). The smell is lovely! Not too overpowering and doesnâ€™t linger on the skin! I use this after I cleanse with an oil to remove makeup and then this removes any additional makeup/grime! Love this
