I wanted to love this for the summer months since it is lighter in texture than the turmeric cream but wasn’t impressed.  I have all of the Kora products and love them but this one didn’t do it for me.  The turmeric cream is the best, give a glow and moisturizers to the perfect amount amount without it feeling too thick. Just okay
