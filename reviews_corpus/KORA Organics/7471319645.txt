I saw this product on IG and I wanted to give it a try. I receive it yesterday (3/11/22) and I followed the directions. I woke up this morning (3/12/22) and my skin felt itchy and irritated. I noticed on the bottom side of my face it was dried. I gave this a 3 star because I’m just not sure if it’s this that’s making my face feel itchy and irritated or my other products. I’m going to wait and try this again and see if I’m still feeling the same thing nan
