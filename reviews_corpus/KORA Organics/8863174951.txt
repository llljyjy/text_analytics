Super important: the peppermint oil scent is strong in this! I’m surprised Kora isn’t emphasizing that aspect more as the scent of peppermint can be very polarizing. You’ll either love or hate the cooling sensation and scent!As for the product, it’s in stunning packaging. Kora consistently nails this for me: I loved the packaging of the turmeric moisturizer, and this is just as visually appealing (and beautiful glass). If aesthetics are important to you, I think you’ll love this presentation!It’s also wonderful to use. Very gentle and yet still cleanses the skin thoroughly. It’s awesome to see aloe listed in the ingredients before water, and I think it contributes to the lovely texture of this cleanser.Overall, it’s very well done - but keep that peppermint in mind! PEPPERMINT!
