I received this complimentary from Kora Organics. This is a very bouncy gel texture that sunk into my skin very quickly for lightweight hydration. If your skin is super dry, I don’t think this would be enough. If you’re combo of oily, you’d love how lightweight this is.I don’t find it to be super hydrating, ideal for a hot humid day. Packaging is beautiful! Ideal for combo/oily skin
