I was so excited to try the new Kora Organics Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser and was not disappointed. First off I pump a little into my hands and it lathers nicely which is something I like in my face cleansers. It also feels really gentle on my skin being the perfect morning face cleanser. It leaves my face feeling soft, smooth, healthy and clean. It has aromatherapy and you can smell Rosemary but itâ€™s a nice smell and goes away after cleansing. The turmeric leaves a nice glow to your face and overall it has amazing ingredients and is a great cleanser. Perfect Morning Cleanser
