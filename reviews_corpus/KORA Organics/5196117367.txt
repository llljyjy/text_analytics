Really am enjoying this lightweight moisturizer. I have combination skin that gets oily easily and this definitely did not make me feel like my skin got too greasy. I think itâ€™s a solid option for me in the summer. I also appreciated the amazing ingredients this moisturizer boasts and am excited to see where it takes my skin! nan
