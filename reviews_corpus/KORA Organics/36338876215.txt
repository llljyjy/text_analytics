I love this turmeric moisturizer. This is great for my evening skincare routine - since it is a little heavier I love to put it on before bed.  I feel like this moisturizer will be perfect for winter when my skin seems to be a bit dryer and need more moisture. It’s super light and not greasy. I also love that you can buy refillable canisters so you’re not wasting the bottle. The packaging is absolutely beautiful. nan
