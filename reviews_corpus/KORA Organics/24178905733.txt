Perfect cleanser on its own but works especially wonderful after the Kora Organics milky mushroom cleansing oil. It doesn’t produce massive amounts of suds but it does get nice and foamy. The smell is very herbal and it feels very zesty but it doesn’t irritate me at all. I only need about 2 pumps each time I wash. The bottle is heavy and really beautiful as well. Leaves my face clean and soft. It’s pretty spendy for a cleanser but love that it has clean ingredients. Zesty!
