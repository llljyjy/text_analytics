I was so excited to try this product! The actual product is small in relation to the size of the container but the packaging is sooo beautiful! I love how you can purchase a refill instead of receiving a whole new package. The moisturizer is definitely light-weight which I love for my oily skin. It leaves my skin hydrated and dewy, perfect for summer! Perfect for my oily skin in summer!
