I was initially apprehensive to try the product as I was afraid that there would be a high turmeric fragrance, however I was pleasantly surprised with this cleanser. It lathers well, does not have a turmeric odor, and does a great job of cleansing skin without feeling like it’s been stripped. I will say, for those with sensitive skin, there is peppermint oil in the formula which leaves the skin with that “fresh“ feeling which I personally like, however may not be for those with fragrance-sensitive skin. Almost done my 1st bottle! love!
