The packaging of this is absolutely breathtaking. It’s refillable and when the lid hits the light it’s really a sight to behold. The moisturizer is a whole experience. It’s lightweight and best for combo oily skin for sure. I’d love to see an essential oil free version in the future but it truly is beautiful if your skin isn’t overtly sensitive. The packaging tho
