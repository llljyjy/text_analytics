First off, I love the packaging of this product! The gem-stone lid is gorgeous, but the refillable pods makes this eco-friendly and reusable (plus buying refill pods is usually cheaper than purchasing brand new product.) The smell is great, it has a bit of an ocean-like smell (in a good way.) I have dry skin and this is AMAZING. It has a gel like texture that spreads easily all over your face. It gives me such a nice glow, I love to wear it by itself, or even under my makeup. I will definitely be using this moisturizer throughout the summer. Gives you a great glow!
