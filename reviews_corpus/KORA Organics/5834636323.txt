this is a glow moisturizer, and it keeps my face incredibly moist throughout the entire day. I don’t get dry patches, especially during the winter that’s an issue that I’ve dealt with before. I have been complemented many times about the glow to my face and I believe it has to do with this moisturizer. It is incredible. The texture is creamy. There’s no film left on your skin. I cannot say enough amazing things about this product. I noticed my fine lines diminishing, and the darkness on my cheeks seems to be lighter. I don’t know if it’s from the Glowy affect or from how incredible as moisturizer is. Incredible Moisturizer
