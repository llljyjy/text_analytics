First of all, can we appreciate the pretty packaging?! It looks so chic AND looks gorgeous in my vanity!! I also like that itâ€™s refillable!! Anyways, this Algae moisturizer has a smooth gel-like consistency and smells heavenly! It melts into the skin effortlessly and feels lightweight on!! It keeps my skin hydrated all day long as well (btw, I have combination skin)! I apply it both in the morning and nighttime after I apply my serum. I warm a little product in the palm of my hands and massage it onto my clean face + neck areas. This definitely became one of my holy grail skincare products this year! Glowy, hydrated skin must have!!
