Anyone remember that apricot and walnut scrub people used in the 90s? Well this is a more expensive version of that. I felt like I was using sandpaper on my face. This accentuated the texture on my face, made my face burn afterwards, and made me break out. It also has a very strong scent, almost like menthol, which is probably the peppermint oil; and ingredient btw that can be sensitizing. Terrible
