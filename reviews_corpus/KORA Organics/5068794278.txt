This product does exactly what it says.  I can’t say enough good things about this product.  Expensive yes, but let me tell you.....it does not dissappoint.  I purchased the smaller size to test it out and I’m hooked.  I will be purchasing the larger size on my next order.  My skin felt so soft and  gently exfoliated after I used it and no irritated skin or redness. Make-up went on so silky smooth after I used it.  I have combination skin with no major skin issues.  Loved it. Holy Grail!!!!!!
