wish it wasn’t this expensive cause it feels and smells like nivea cold cream.. lol it definitely moisturizes my face and it helps get rid of my super dry areas like around my nose. it leaves a glow without feeling oily. a little goes a long way!!! like a dime size amount goes a long way even less than that. so it does last a while, I usually use it at night after i’ve washed the make up off. feels luxurious
