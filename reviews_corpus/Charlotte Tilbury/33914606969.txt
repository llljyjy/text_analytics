After seeing all the hype and rave reviews about this I decided to go for it, why not? (Uh, Jade, maybe beacuse it’s like $200??? Anyways…) I convinced myself that if this cream was all it was hyped up to be, the high price rage may just be worth it… I really didn’t like itAfter using, I will admit my skin felt more moisturized, but there are hindered a of $5 options that do the same. After putting this on, I hate how this made my skin feel. I have dry skin, and this made my pores feels so gross and clogged. I felt like I needed to wash my face after applying it, it was made me feel icky.But the thing that really made me hate it was the sticky and greasy texture. This is a day moisturizer, meaning that you should be able to put this on before makeup, or wear alone without a worry. But no. This stuff is so sticky in the face, like glue. Dust and hair and whatnot would somehow appear on my face, so gross. And this did not go well under makeup. It made my makeup look gross and oily, as well as sometimes chunking up when trying to spot my foundation, so weird.I thought maybe I was doing something “wrong”, but I wasn’t. Really disappointed :( it’s a miss for me…
