I love this moisturizer! It smells heavenly but just subtle enough—a hint of lavender and rosewater.  My skin feels refreshed and moisturized without feeling like I have product on. I use this a night time moisturizer because I have combination skin and live in the South. It was too heavy for me in the daytime, but will be perfect when traveling to drier climates. I noticed my skin looking more radiant and my fine lines seem less noticeable. This product and packaging feels like you’re getting your money’s worth! I look forward to my nightly skincare routine!
