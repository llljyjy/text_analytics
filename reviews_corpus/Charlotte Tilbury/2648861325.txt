I have been using this face cream for around a week now and I can say that it definitely helps the hydration level of my skin. Before I started using this product, my skin was quite dehydrated to the point where it pulls when I smile. I apply quite a thick layer of this cream as the last step of my skincare routine every morning and night. It absorbs pretty well and I love the glowy look it gives. So far, it hasnâ€™t made me break out and I love it! Truly a magic cream for dehydrated skin!
