At first impressions, the glass bottle is beautiful and a really nice product to display on a vanity. The scent however is slightly offputting and not what I expected. It’s a very strong fragrance which can be problematic for sensitive skin or noses. The product itself is easy to use, the pipette makes it easy to dispense product. The serum is opaque but doesn’t feel too thick. My skin felt silky after use with a little bit of a glow. I would suggest allowing the product to sit and fully absorb for a few minutes before layering others, or else you might have pilling. The price tag is very high and the brand has great cosmetics, but I don’t think this serum has done much for my skin in terms of brightening or minimizing pores or skin texture. nan
