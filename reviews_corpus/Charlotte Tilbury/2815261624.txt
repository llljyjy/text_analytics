I love a good moisturizer as I am a dry skin girl. This was my first time trying Charlotte Tillbury products and it was ok. I was expecting a lot more for the price point and the reputation the brand has. I’ve used better that was not high end. It does make your skin stay hydrated for a time but not as long as you would expect.i wore it during the day and at night. I had better results when I wore it during the day. Happy to try this brand but it’s not over the moon product. #Charlottetillbury #moisturizer #voxbox #highend #dryskin #warmweather #meh #skincare #free #melanin #melaninskin It's ok
