This is a 3.8/5 star product for me. I hate that I like this product as much as I do. Do I think the price point is absurd for what it is? Yes. But do I reach for this on a daily basis while trying to ration every ounce? Also yes. I specifically love this product for daytime paired with my usual skincare routine. So many of my daytime moisturizers pill under my makeup no matter my routine which is uncomfortable and frustrating. This gives me this effortlessly luminous, hydrating base with no pilling, no makeup clinging to fine lines around my face, nada. I like to have this around as one of the last steps of my routine before SPF for a medium dose of hydration. Iâ€™ve yet to find a moisturizer that gives me the same dewy and luminous effect that this one does so I guess until that day comes, the Magic Cream will remain in my routine. The clunky packaging and price are a bit of a bummer though. nan
