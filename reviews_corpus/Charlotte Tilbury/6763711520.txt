I’m always looking for moisturizing product with hyaluronic acid so I was excited to receive this product to try. It is very creamy and a little bit goes a long way. It even comes with Charlotte Tilbury’s tap method to give yourself a facial massage while applying. However, there were some drawbacks for me. It is quite heavy on the rose scent, which really isn’t for me. It also doesn’t absorb as quickly as the moisturizer that I use as part of my regular routine - it stays sticky for a bit. nan
