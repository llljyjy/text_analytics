I just started using this serum, it’s very light and doesn’t have a fragrance. It at least it’s barely there. Which I absolutely love! I did start to break out in my problem areas. Not sure if it is because of this Serum. Follow me on youtube Jessi Maee for a follow up. Definitely will give this another go and hopefully its not the culprit of the breakouts. The vitamin C gives my skin a brightness that is so glowly, over time it should help even out my skin. My skin loves Niacinamide. This definitely helps minimize appearance of pores and improves skin texture. Polyglutamic Acid which is 4x more than hyaluronic acid. Which actually could be why I’m breaking out. It’s doing its job. The price point I’ll never be able to get behind.  I don’t think I would be repurchasing, unless I noticed 100% change. Lightweight Serum
