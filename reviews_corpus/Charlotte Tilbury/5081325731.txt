I really like this moisturizer. I get dry areas on my face especially during colder months and after just one use of this my skin feels soft, and moisturized. It has a very light scent to it which is perfect since I don’t like over powering scents in my face cream. I love the consistency of it too. It’s a little thick but not overly which helps it melt into my skin. I use it every night and sometimes before I apply makeup as well. Also the packaging is so cute and luxurious. This is the first CT product I’ve ever used and because of how much I like it I bought a bunch of other products as well and have been enjoying everything from CT. Such a great moisturizer
