I really wanted to love this product, because I love everything Charlotte Tilbury. Unfortunately, as my skin is sensitive and the Crystal Elixir did not play nice, I experience significant irritation. Irritation aside, I liked how the product applied and felt on my skin. It worked well with my existing makeup routine and did not cause pilling. nan
