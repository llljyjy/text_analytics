I received this products for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The cream is soooo nice and thick. You could hold the container upside down and nothing would spill out! It does have a slightly greasy feel but that’s not a dealbreaker for me. It helps me know it’s really moisturizing my skin. I walked past a mirror and took a look at myself and had to do a double take and I thought to myself wow my skin looks great I don’t need to wear foundation. And then I remembered I had just started trying this new moisturizer so I completely credit that with making my skin look so great. Looks so good I don’t need foundation.
