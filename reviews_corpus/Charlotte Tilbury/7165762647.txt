This cream is GORGEOUS. The packaging is higher end and just lovely and the smell upon opening is very light + nature defining. When applying the cream, it was actually such a soothing experience. Itâ€™s rich but not greasy and it soaks into my skin beautifully. It left me feeling very moisturized and glowy / dewy - which is my favorite look as I have fairly dry skin. The price point is the only negative for me. This really is more of an indulgence cream then anything but if you suffer from really dry skin like I, I do believe this product will desperately soak this in wonderfully! nan
