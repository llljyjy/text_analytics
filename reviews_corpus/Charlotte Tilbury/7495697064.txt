I’m super surprised at how much I like this serum! I love CT makeup product but I didn’t think another serum would actually do anything to my face. My face actually glows after I use it (see pic) and feels great all day without makeup. Really happy with how it’s been going these last few weeks using it in the morning with my skincare (using it after neutrogena hydroboost serum and before lotion) and at night (using it after Paula’s choice exfoliate). Great serum, not a great price
