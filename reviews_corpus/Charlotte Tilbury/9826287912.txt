I received this product complimentary from Influenster to try for my honest review. First off I love the cute jar it came in. The cream is thick but not too waxy or greasy. It gets easily absorbed in the skin, moisturizes well and has a mild, pleasant rose smell. Iâ€™ve used it for a few days and am loving it! Would definitely recommend. Great moisturizer, gentle on the skin
