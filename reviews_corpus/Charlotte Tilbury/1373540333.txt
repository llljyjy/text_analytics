This is my second jar of this cream and it is one of my absolute favorite face creams. I love how itâ€™s rich and nourishing (which my dry skin needs) without feeling heavy on the skin. It layers well with other products and wears beautifully under sunscreen and makeup. It truly leaves my skin looking plump and glowing with or without makeup and works for day or night. I am also a big fan of its light, delicate scent and always look forward to using it. Face Cream Favorite
