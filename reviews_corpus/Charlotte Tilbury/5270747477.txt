This cream was easy to apply and spread evenly on my face. It is slightly on the thicker side but still my skin was breathable. I apply make up over my cream and it was very smooth. I also like the fragrance of this cream but it is not for everyone, as it is not very subtle. Overall a nice cream I am hoping will continue making my skin beautiful. Magical and amazing cream
