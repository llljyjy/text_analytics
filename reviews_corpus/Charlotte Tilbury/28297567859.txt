Although it is a bit pricy for an under eye cream, I think a little goes a long way.A wonderful under eye cream. It does not cause irritation and provide an almost immediate brightening of your eyes. I enjoy the texture of the eye cream, which makes it really easy to apply to the under eye and it feels nice on your skin. nan
