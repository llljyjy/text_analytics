I received a complementary @CharlotteTilbury Magic Cream from @influenster to try for my honest review. The jar at first glance doesn’t look huge, however, there is a generous amount of product. The #magiccream is very thick. Luckily, the magic cream isn’t greasy, which is a huge plus due to my oily skin. It glides on and absorbs pretty well. I find that the next day my skin looks smoother. The moisturizer would be great for winter due to the consistency and it isn’t too heavy even in the spring.The Magic Serum that comes with the cream feels really nice. I liked the fact that there was a mini bonus product tucked in with the product. nan
