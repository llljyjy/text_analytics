Absolutely in love with this Charlotte Tilbury Cream! It does have a fragrance, so beware if you’re sensitive or do not like that. However, I find that I look past it as it makes my glow! I find this best to use in the AM as it’s not very heavy. It doesn’t make my skin oily at all while providing my skin with amazing hydration. nan
