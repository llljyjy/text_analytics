I love this product. It’s a super thick cream but absorbs beautifully, it doesn’t leave your skin feeling sticky or oily. I have combination dry skin and this cream was very moisturizing and left my skin feeling smooth and moisturized all day/night. It has a light scent, which I don’t mind and comes in a very heavy jar. After using this cream for a few days I see noticeable improvement in the texture of my skin, and the length of time that my skin retains the moisture. Improved moisture and skin texture
