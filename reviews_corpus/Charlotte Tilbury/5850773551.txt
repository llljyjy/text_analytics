I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. Let me just say, I really like this moisturizer! I’ve never tried this brand previously and I am shocked because this moisturizer is the truth! I have really dry skin. This Magic Cream literally melts into my skin and leaves a perfectly moisturized but not greasy or shiny finish. Immediately afterwards my skin is transformed into a velvety soft surface. I apply this after showering and before bed. After a week of using this Magic Cream I can see how much brighter and softer my skin looks. The fine lines on my face seem blurred somehow. I will definitely be trying other products from Charlotte Tilbury now that she’s on my radar! Youth in a pretty little jar!
