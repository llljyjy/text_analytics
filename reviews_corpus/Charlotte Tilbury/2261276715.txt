I have wanted to try this cream for some time, but have had such a back stock of face creams I hadn’t tried it yet until Influenster sent it to me to try. The packaging is beautiful and luxe; very hefty. The cream is dense and has a faint clean scent. It has hyaluronic acid in it, which is great. Unfortunately, despite it feeling rich it wasn’t moisturizing enough for the drier spots on my combination skin. It feels great going on, skin looks and feels plumped and hydrated, it just doesn’t last. Might be better in the warmer summer months for me. Good, but maybe not "magic"
