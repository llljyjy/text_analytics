I like it! I use it as a day or night moisturizer. I don’t wear much makeup these days but after testing it with this as a base, my skin did look glowing & smoother under my foundation.I have to admit, it reminds me of a cheaper drugstore moisturizer I absolutely love, so the price definitely isn’t worth it for me because of that. But it’s a good moisturizer if it’s in your budget! Pretty jar!
