This product was gifted to me by Charlotte Tilbury. For reference I have very dry skin, rosacea, and am easily sensitive towards fragrance. That aside, I loved this product! However, I will say it felt more of a cosmetic than a face lotion id regularly wear.  Though it didnâ€™t irritate my skin, and it was very hydrating, it had a lot of (what seems like) artificial fragrance. I found this product to be best right before applying makeup, since it gives a very nice dewy and youthful look to this skin. I would recommend but keep in mind it may be a pre-makeup-application product and not an everyday use product. Great but not for everyday use.
