This cream is formulated for those with drier skin types, however my oily normal skin LOVES this moisturizer. It is soft, creamy and slightly thicker in texture but not overwhelmingly. It has a light scent which personally doesn’t bother me. It is anti aging and is formulated with hyaluronic acid. I love this moisturizer for makeup prep in myself and clients as it’s smoothing and hydrating for all skin types. This cream is also perfect texture for if you practice lymphatic drainage or use a gua sha magical
