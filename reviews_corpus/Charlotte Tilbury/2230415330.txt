I received this product free from Influenster and Charlotte tilbury in exchange for my honest review. Good for dry skin and anti-aging! This cream is thick but applies like butter and absorbs well, so it does not weigh the skin down or feel greasy. I always love to look for hyaluronic acid for skin hydration purposes, so I was automatically in love when I reviewed the ingredients. I also think the Bionymph Peptide Complex works well with improving smoothness of the face- I was starting to see fine lines in my forehead but it has dramatically decreased since I started using this magic cream. It is slightly fragranced with an elegant subtle rose smell. Has a luxurious feel when applying. Comes in a gorgeous jar which is refillable as well! Perfect for reducing waste, which is something all companies should aspire to do! Makes me feel like a million bucks
