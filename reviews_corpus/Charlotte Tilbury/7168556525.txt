If you’re going to be spending $100, get a moisturizer from a skincare brand. While this moisturizer works as a beautiful primer for makeup application immediately following, I found that I become quite oily throughout the day rather quickly. I don’t have oily skin to begin with, so that’s not great in my book. Would be great for editorial or content creation, but not for every day use. Not worth the price tag
