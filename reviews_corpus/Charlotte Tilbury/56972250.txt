This toner has been great for my dry and sensitive skin. My skin feels nourished, smooth, and glowy! It doesn’t sting, doesn’t dry me out, and the exfoliation is so gentle, but effective. I’m definitely planning on restocking on this after I finish the bottle as it is the best toner I have ever used. Love it! Gentle, nourishing, and effective!
