I’ve been using this consistently for a few months now. I started out with a trial one that I got with a set, and I loved using it as I felt like it was helping get rid of my dark circles. But over the months, I haven’t noticed any significant change yet. I will try it for a bit longer and see how it goes. But so far, there is no way that it can be used under makeup as it creases makeup so much, so can only be used at night for me personally. And I don’t see much of a difference when it’s used that way. Still giving it a chance, but not too great so far
