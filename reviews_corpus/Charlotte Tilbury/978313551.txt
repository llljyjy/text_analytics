Ahhh-mazing! I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect when I received this from Influenster to test, the name alone sets the bar high. I was shocked. It has such a light and subtle scent but packs a lot of punch leaving your skin so soft and moisturized and ready for your makeup. The fact that it also has hyaluronic acid is a huge bonus. While it is more on the pricey side, a little goes a long ways. This definitely plumps and leaves your skin glowing. I highly recommend! nan
