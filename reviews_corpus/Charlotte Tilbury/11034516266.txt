Disappointed I was so excited when I received this moisturizer in my VoxBox. I always think of Charlotte Tilbury as a good brand and thought that this cream would probably be amazing. I must say I do have very dry skin with no oiliness whatsoever, so this cream may work great for someone of a different skin type.I put the cream on after washing my face for the night as I always do with moisturizer. It felt great going on. I woke up in the morning and my face felt dry to the touch which isnâ€™t typical when I use my normal moisturizer. Once I looked in the mirror I had a bit of dry skin on my forehead and around my nose which also is not the norm for me after moisturizing.I will pass my cream in for my daughter, who has a different skin type to try, but unfortunately, I myself cannot give this one a good review. Not as expected
