I love any cream with hyaluronic acid, especially as someone who has really dry skin in the winter months. I’ve heard so many people talk about this product, and I’m glad that I finally got to try it out. I love that it also has vitamin E and C in it, which really helps boosts the glowiness of my skin! Love this magic cream!
