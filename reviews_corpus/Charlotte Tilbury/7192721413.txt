This moisturizer is above all else. The feeling my skin is left with after applying is simply amazing, but rather than that the way my skin looks when I wake up after applying this at night is so youthful. I can visibly see a difference in the space between my eyebrows specifically as well as the lines around my mouth! The only thing I personally don’t love is the mature scent, but it’s not bad just not to my liking. It reminds me of fancy french perfume. Great for dehydrated winter skin!
