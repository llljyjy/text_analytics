Loved the smell of this moisturizer however it left a terrible grease film on my face almost immediately after applying. Made my skin feel super uncomfy. Not sure what kind of skin this would work on considering i have combination skin and didn’t help either dry or oily spots. Didn’t necessarily break me out though. Wanted to love it
