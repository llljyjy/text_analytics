I received this face cream from influenster for my honest review. I absolutely love this cream! It smells like roses and is nice and thick. It moisturizes my face and leaves it feeling smooth without being greasy. This is hands down the best face cream I have ever used. I have combination acne prone skin and this does not cause me to break out. This cream is worth every penny. Beautiful
