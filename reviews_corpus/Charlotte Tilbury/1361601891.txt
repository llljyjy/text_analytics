Not only is this moisturizer so creamy and effective it’s also the most beautiful packaging I’ve seen. So chic! I’m loving the texture and to use it in my morning skincare routine before applying makeup. It instantly gives my skin a natural glow and keeps it hydrated all day long but not oily which I love. Big fan of their makeup line and now just got hooked with their skincare too! nan
