First of all, I received this product for free from @Influenster and @charlottetilbury in exchange for my honest review. And, I promise, honest is exactly what I’ll be. I rely on reviews & want to be honest!! Luckily, I can leave a darn glowing review on this. I am 49, have the usual fine lines, and sensitive skin. So, I’ve tried a lot of eye creams, and have been underwhelmed every time. This stuff actually is magic! First, the petty stuff: the packaging is gorgeous!! Absolute Art Deco decadence. And it’s refillable, so that makes me happy. The cream is thick & tech, but goes on light & absorbs quickly. No scent, which is great. But, the biggie for me is performance. Within an hour, the fine lines around my eyes were less noticeable. The skin felt less thin & crepey. The best word I can find is it felt plumper. I’m have a permanent crease under one eye from my CPAP & I think it has started to help it some! I did pictures at an hour & at a day. On the 1 hour pics, I only had 3 hours sleep! Still made a difference. My eye skin feels better. It feels healthier. And it’s visibly noticeable. I can’t wait to see the difference in the longer term. Great Results Quickly On Mature Skin
