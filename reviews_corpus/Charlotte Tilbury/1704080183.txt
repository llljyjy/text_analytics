I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review.  I am so lucky to have received this, and I’ve used a few times, but not long enough to judge if I notice a huge difference in any skin tone or texture after long-term use.  Regardless, I love the packaging. It comes in a beautiful glass jar with a mirrored top. The moisturizer itself is light peach in color, but when applied in the skin, applies clear and smoothly with no tugging. It dries down to more of a balmy texture. It’s very moisturizing, so much so that I only feel comfortable using this before bed. I’m not sure what this would do under makeup. It doesn’t make my eyes water after application like some other eye creams. Overall, I love this stuff and look forward to continued use to see what it’s full capable of! Extra moisturizing and balm-like texture
