I really like the thick texture of this Magic Cream. I can definitely tell it hydrates my skin instantly. I like the light rose scent, it’s not strong or overwhelming. I also like that it is refillable, simply pop the container out and replace with a new one. I just feel like the refills should be a bit cheaper, they are $100 for the 1.7oz/50ml jar vs. $90 for the 1.7oz/50ml refill. I honestly feel like it should come with a little scoop for the price. I just don’t like digging my fingers into my products, luckily I already have a little scoop from a different product. It did come with a small sample of Charlotte’s Magic Serum Crystal Elixir, which is obviously the perfect pair, so now I need a full size!!I have been using every night for about a week and haven’t had any bad reactions so far. My skin feels softer and more plump. I haven’t used in the morning because it does have a bit of an oily feel when first applied, I guess that’s where the dewy glow comes from.. but I use it overnight so it has time to seep in and doesn’t feel so oily by morning. I think this is by far my new favorite moisturizer. I’d definitely recommend getting it if you’re debating whether or not it’s worth it. New Favorite Moisturizer
