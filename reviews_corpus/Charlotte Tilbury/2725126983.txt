I love this moisturizer but there’s several things that are kind of a dealbreaker for me. The moisturizer is thick without being greasy, hydrating without making my skin oily or breakout. It does have a fragrance but it is minimal and not overpowering. I wish that this moisturizer was not is a pot - that it was in a tube or some other container that did not allow air and germs to touch the product. Next this moisturizer is expensive - while I do like it I have found other products at that are as good or better and a fraction of the cost. It’s definitely a nice splurge product. Love the product but not the price
