The cream is absolutely delight to use! The texure is lovely and pairs well with my other skincare products. So far hasn’t caused any pilling and it doesn’t clog my pores. Works wonderfully well beneath the makeup and gives pretty much flawless finish! I do find the price a little on the higher side but it does come in 50ml and a little goes a long way! Lovely!
