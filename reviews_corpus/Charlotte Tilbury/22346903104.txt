This magic cream is literally magic. Love the way it sits under makeup and really helps keep my skin moisturized and glowy throughout the day. My only gripe is that it’s fragranced but it’s very mild and for what it’s worth I can look past that. It has beautiful light weight texture. I highly recommend it. Magic in a jar!
