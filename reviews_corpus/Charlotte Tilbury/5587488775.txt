So I’ve been using it for a week now, morning and evening before my moisturizer and I have to say I like it, I feel like my skin tone is a lot more even, no random redness on the skin. Also very happy it didn’t break me out, I was concerned about that after reading other reviews. Overall I’m happy with this serum and I will continue using it. nan
