I have the pleasure of sharing my experience using this award-winning cream. The packaging is glamorous, including the beautiful magic jar. When I opened the jar I smelled a subtle note ofcoconut. Their is a generous amount of magic cream and the consistency is thick with a silky texture. I followed the “Tilbury Tap“ technique, and instantly noticed glowing and plumper skin. This product is divine, I absolutely recommend.This review is part of an incentivized campaign. Thank you for reading. Magical Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid.
