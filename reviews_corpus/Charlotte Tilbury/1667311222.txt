(I received this product for free from Influenster, for my honest opinion.) I have used  Charlotte Tilbury Refillable Magic Eye Rescue Cream with Retinol for at least 3 weeks in the morning and night. I wanted to use it more for feeling energized, but unfortunately it did not. It highlighted my eye area to appear that I was more awake. Maybe, it will work better if I had wrinkles or dark circles. If it did work, having it refillable is great use. nan
