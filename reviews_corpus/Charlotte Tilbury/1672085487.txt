I received this product complimentary but was so excited when I did. The cream is thick and has a rose smell to make it seem luxurious. My dry skin felt decently hydrated. I would prefer a fragrance free version as I donâ€™t like fragrance in my skincare. Not sure I had the same experience as the others who rave about this product, but it was fine. For the price tag I want to see game changers though. Thick cream makes it seem luxurious
