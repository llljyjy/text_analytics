Well this was a disappointment for me. I liked the idea, the under chin section for lifting and the pressure point nubs. But the execution didn’t amount useful especially when looking at the price. The gel pouches only cover very small sections of the face (the cheeks just open and flapping like crazy jowls) and it doesn’t hold the cold well. The pouches feel nearly empty and once the cool feeling disappeared after a minute, it offered no benefit to my skin. Disappointment on my face
