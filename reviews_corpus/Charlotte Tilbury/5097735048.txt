Wow! This CT cream is worth buying. It has a luxurious silky feel that you notice immediately when you apply it to the skin. It’s really unlike any other cream that I have tried. You don’t need a lot to see results either. It quickly creates a smoothing effect that is extraordinary. My foundation or cc cream looks so much better. I was away at a business meeting this week and I kept getting compliments on how great I looked. I hadn’t seen people in 2.5 years so that was amazing. I like to smooth any extra cream on the backs of my hands and into my cuticles. I adore that this is refillable as well. What an innovative idea. I will definitely be refilling this when it’s time to buy. nan
