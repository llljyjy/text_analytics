I have spent so much money on different drug store, high end and dermatological creams and this one is the BEST by far to use under make up. It doesn’t leave my skin greasy/oily at all while it highly hydrates it. My make up lasts all day. I don’t even need to use primer before putting my foundation. However when I do use primer, I use Charlotte Tilbury’s Wonderglow which is absolutely fantastic! I am a big fan of all of Charlotte Tilbury’s products! Love Love Love!
