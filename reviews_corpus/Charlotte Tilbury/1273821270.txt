I bought this to secure sheet masks to my face, and hoped that the cryo therapy would make it feel a little more luxurious. I would not reccomend using this with ant product on your face especially a sheet mask. It made the mask stick to my face and close to unbearable cold. So obviously, you should follow the directions on the mask, which I did not. When I started using it on bare skin it was so much better. It is still as little tough to tolerate for the first minute its on but the results are fantastic. My face looks lifted and my skin is tight(in a good way). I would reccoment this product as part of your morning routine because it really just wakes up your face. Follow the directions. Don't be like me.
