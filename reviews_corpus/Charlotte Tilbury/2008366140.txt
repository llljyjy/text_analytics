I was so excited to try out the magic cream after hearing so many wonderful things! It is exactly as advertised, I don’t know how my skin feels so soft but it does! My makeup glides over it and it stopped it from settling into my wrinkles. It hadn’t irritated my sensitive skin nor does it have a strong scent. My skin is overly dry these days due to the changing weather and it finally feels nourished and is glowing again! nan
