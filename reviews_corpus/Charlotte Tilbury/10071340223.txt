I would like to start off by disclosing that I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. After using this product for over a month- I must say I really don’t notice any amazing difference in my skin. Thats not to say that it isn’t helping at a cellular level and I may need to give it more time. Overall, I’d have to say that I am not completely blown away- but I am also not dissatisfied, either. I think I will continue to use this product until I run out, then try to come back and give more feedback as time has passed. Neither impressed or unimpressed. Just Meh.
