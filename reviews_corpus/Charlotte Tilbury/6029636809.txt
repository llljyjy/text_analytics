I received this as a sample through Influenster over a month ago and have been using it day & night since then so I could write a valid review. Of course with a name like Charlotte Tilbury you expect a bit of luxury, and this eye cream delivers. It is so buttery and rich, absorbs great, and most importantly your skin STAYS hydrated. It looks great under makeup as well and no pilling, which was a huge priority for me. I am looking forward to seeing the long term benefits for my fine lines, and can safely say I will be purchasing this when I run out. Creamy, dreamy, hydrating!
