Charlotte Tilbury has a great reputation and for good reason. There is a lot of attention to detail in her products, packaging, and techniques. This cream is definitely moisturizing. It smooths onto the skin nicely and creates a nice canvas for makeup application. It gives a luminous glow and has a smoothing effect which I love. What shocked me the most about this cream is how light and airy it is… even the luxe packaging is lightweight. However, despite being light and airy, it still had a bit of a greasy feeling to it on the skin. Nothing terrible, just a little different that what I would expect. Overall, a really nice product if you’re planning to apply makeup after, but I don’t think it’s “the end all be all” when it comes to facial creams. Great for applying before makeup
