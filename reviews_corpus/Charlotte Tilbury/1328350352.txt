I’m only giving this product 3 stars because I just received this product and just started using it. I am currently on night 4 of using it (I use a different one in the am.) so far I’m really enjoying it. The texture is really nice. Creamy but not heavy or oily. It’s super lightweight. Absorbs super fast too. Despite it having retinol in it, it doesn’t irritate my super sensitive eyes nor does it bother my sensitive skin.  It doesn’t have a strong scent. What little scent there is is very pleasant. I’m looking forward to seeing if it does anything for my dark circles like it claims to do but so far, so good. Just started using
