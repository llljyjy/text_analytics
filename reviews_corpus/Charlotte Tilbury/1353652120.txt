I’m always excited to try new skincare! I received a free  full bottle through Influenster.  After using it a few days I can state that it absorbs quickly and is non greasy. Does it soften lines? I don’t know yet, its too soon to know. The packaging is better than the norm.  Although the product is not in a vacuum sealed bottle, there is a narrow interior opening to control the amount of air that goes in. Care was taken in designing the package and protecting the integrity of the serum. New Serum!
