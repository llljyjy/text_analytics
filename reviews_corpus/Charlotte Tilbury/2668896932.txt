I was gifted the Charlotte Tilbury Charlotte’s Magic Cream by Influenster and just after a few days I absolutely love it. First off the box it comes in is absolutely beautiful with its pink color and gold lettering. The jar itself is made of glass which I love, with a gold cat. It’s very stylish and looks beautiful on my skincare shelf. The cream is very thick, and heavy, but it absorbs into my skin almost instantly leaving my skin looking plump, youthful, and extremely well hydrated. After a few days I noticed that my fine lines seem less noticeable, the cream has a definite plumping effect, it really does have a bit of magic in here! I just love it! I can see what all the hype is about. I would definitely buy this for myself in the future. Usually in the mornings I would find my skin would be a bit dry even though I use heavy duty moisturizers every night before I go to bed. Not with the magic cream, my skin is not dry at all nor is it over oily like with some moisturizers. I absolutely love this I can’t recommend it enough and I think I will definitely be buying the serum for myself soon as well. It really is Magic!
