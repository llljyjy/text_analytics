This moisturizer is very thick and moisturizing. If you have dry skin this is the product for you. A very small amount goes a long way. The product does not have very much of a smell so is very good for scent-sensitive people. This could also make a great winter moisturizer for people with combo skin, but may not be good for people with oily skin Luxe moisturizer!
