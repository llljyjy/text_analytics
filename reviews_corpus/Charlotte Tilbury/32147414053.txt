I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I was so excited to try this product because I had read so many reviews. The packaging is pretty but I rather not have t lo stick my fingers into the jar to reside bacteria contamination I’ve just been using a little spatula that I received with another product. I don’t notice much scent with the product. It is very thick and Rich and I have only been using at night because I feel like it may make my skin look too greasy with my makeup. It recommends doing a 5 min facial massage when applying and honestly I’ve been doing 1-2 minutes but it does feel very luxurious going on. It is thick and my skin is super shiny after applying. I don’t have sensitive skin ar all but if you did I can see the potential for break outs. Think this would be best suited for someone with dry skin but my normal skin seems to really like it as well. I would recommend this product, especially to those with drier skin types. Is it really magic in a bottle?
