I received this Charlotte Tilbury Magic Rescue Eye Cream in Mt latest voxbox from Influenster to treat and review. I’m not a huge fan of eye creams because my under eye area is super sensitive. I have combination skin and my under eye area broke out where I applied the eye cream. It felt nice and definitely moisturized my under eye area but it’s just not for me.
