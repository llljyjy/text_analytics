I have to say I am really loving this moisturizer. The formula is so rich and hydrating. My skin looks so healthy when I use it. I love that it doesn’t have an added fragrance to it! It has a very light scent that just smells like skin care. However, even though I typically like to invest in a good moisturizer, I do think this is verrryyy expensive. As much as I love the formula, I think the consistent use of this won’t be feasible for me due to the price. If budget isn’t a concern for you, then I say go for it! It definitely is a luxurious feeling formula. The only other thing I don’t love about it is that the packaging is a bit deceiving. There is a layer of plastic that surrounds the actual product and it makes the packaging bulky when it wouldn’t otherwise need to be. Love the formula, but very pricey!
