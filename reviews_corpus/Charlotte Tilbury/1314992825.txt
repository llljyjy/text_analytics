I was so excited to try the famous  by Charlotte Tilbury Beauty Magic Cream because of its cult following and was not disappointed!  This moisturizer is best for normal to dry skin as it is a heavier cream. It’s worked perfectly on my dry parched winter skin. One of the magic ingredients is hyaluronic acid so it not only hydrates your skin it really plumps it up. My skin felt really soft, smooth and plump after application. I’ve heard this cream is a great base cream for makeup and it really is true. My makeup went on smoothly and the application was flawless thanks to this cream. It really is a magic cream! This is a magic cream!
