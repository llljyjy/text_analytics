I just want to start off with how luxe the packaging is very old Hollywood glam vibes. And it is refillable! I have combination skin with dark under eyes and this cream is very moisturizing. I only use it at night since it has retinol in it. My eye area feels much plumper in the morning. I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. nan
