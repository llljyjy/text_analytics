I am astounded by how effective and luxurious this eye cream is.  From the first use I was immediately impressed by how good the product feels sinking into my skin.  The cream just melts leaving my eye area feeling so soothed and comfortable.  Especially for a retinol product it is not irritating at all.  My under eyes have never looked so good as i suffer from dark circles and puffiness.  The magic eye cream is indeed magical.  Charlotte Tilbury must wave a wand over each batch because the results are everything promised on the package and more. Luxury that delivers !!
