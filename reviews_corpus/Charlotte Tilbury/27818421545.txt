I have used retinol serums before very sparingly, applying it once every week because I have sensitive skin. I was a little hesitant to use an eye cream with retinol in it, but after using this product ONCE I immediately noticed that my eyes looked brighter and the tonality around my eyes were a lot lighter. I did not feel any sensitivity around my eyes the morning after applying it. I continued using it every night for another two weeks and my eyes just got brighter. This cream is extremely moisturizing. I love the texture of the cream itself, itâ€™s gel-like but creamier. Great for people with sensitive skin. I absolutely LOVE this eye cream!This product was sent to me by Influenster. IMMEDIATE RESULTS
