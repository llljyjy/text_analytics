I was skeptical purchasing this at first due to its steep price and mixed reviews, so I purchased the mini one to be safe. I am absolutely in love and will be splurging on the regular size ones. I always try to use skincare products that are effective yet donâ€™t break the bank, but no other moisturizer compares to this. My skin is glowing and I have never gotten so many compliments on my skin in my life. Worth the Splurge
