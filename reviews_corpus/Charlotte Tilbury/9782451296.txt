This moisturizer really surprised me. It so velvety soft and creamy. At first I was using it before bed but soon realized that it would be a perfect primer for my makeup. Now I use this in the AM before applying my makeup and it sets well. It does not have a sticky residue nor does it make me feel greasy. Perfect makeup primer
