I had read and heard so many wonderful reviews about this cream I was dying to try it for myself. I see now why it is called the Magic Cream. It totally gave me a luminous lit from within glow. My makeup went on so smooth on top of this cream & the glow remained. Looks amazing on no makeup days also, it gives you a super fresh look. This product has a very light smell which I liked. Also the packaging is super girlie. I feel happy every time I see it on my vanity. I would highly recommend this product! Magic in a bottle
