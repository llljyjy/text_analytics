I’ve been using this product morning and night for weeks and don’t get it. My skin feels hydrated, but that’s it. It hasn’t been brightened, spots haven’t faded, fine lines are still very much there. This product claims to do it all and I just haven’t seen the benefits. I appreciate being able to try this product for free for my honest review, but I wouldn’t purchase with my own money. not impressed
