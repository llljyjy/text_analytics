I would avoid this product if you have sensitive skin. The texture is lovely when applied and it felt very hydrating however it left the skin around my eyes extremely irritated and almost felt like a burn. I wanted to love this but unfortunately it did not agree with my sensitive skin. Not for Sensitive Skin
