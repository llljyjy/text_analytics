I alternate using this and Summer Fridays moisturizer. Summer Fridays is a bit lighter but both products deliver great results. This product is a bit thicker consistency but my skin looks and feels so soft and plump after using. The only negative is the pricetag, I think the jar design and being Charlotte Tilbury is why it’s so pricey. It does have a slight fragrance smell to it but not too strong. On a cheaper end the Elf holy hydration hydro gel moisturizer is pretty close to this. But I do love this product and it does perform magic ✨ nan
