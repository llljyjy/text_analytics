This magic cream by Charlotte tilbury is just…magic! It feels ultra luxe and nourishing. Surprisingly, the fragrance is not as strong as I expected (I don’t know, for some reason I just assumed it would be perfumey but the scent is actually light and not bothersome). The harsh cold air has been drying out my skin and this is just what I needed! nan
