I received from #Influenster for review. I like that a little goes a long way. It makes my skin feel super hydrated and I love the hyalauronic acid added to the cream. I especially like how it makes my neck appear younger looking. The cream feels like my skin stays moisturized all day long. I noticed a slight smell when applied after using any serums or ore moisturizer products. It fades quickly though. Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream
