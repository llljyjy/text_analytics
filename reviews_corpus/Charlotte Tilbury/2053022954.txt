I received these products for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review.I was very  excited  to try this product because I have dry skin and the fact that it was so light and dried quickly  was a plus! I don’t really have a skincare routine besides clean and clear morning burst lol. I love how this product has so much  moisture. I wasn’t too crazy on the smell i feel like if anything is going to be applied on your face its should smell good. I did however love the dropper makes it easier to apply and not waste product. I would definitely recommend this serum. Great serum
