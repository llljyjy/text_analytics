Can I just start with how much I Love the packaging! The beautifully constructed box along with the very beautiful glass jar! Just that alone makes you feel you are using a high end cream! Iâ€™ve been applying in the mornings with a light foundation on top. Light scent and not too heavy on the skin. My makeup is easier to apply so it works great as a primer! On top of that skin feels great all day and even later. I would probably buy again to spoil myself! Definitely buying again.
