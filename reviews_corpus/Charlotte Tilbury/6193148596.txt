This serum works very well in my opinion. As someone who is very sensitive to fragrance, I actually don’t mind the smell of this. It isn’t overpowering and it smells very high-end and luxurious. It applies easily and leaves the skin slightly sticky but very glowy and hydrated. It wears well under makeup too. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a higher end serum. Luxurious serum
