Charlotte’s Magic Serum Crystal Elixir aims to help brighten skin, tighten pores, and hydrate. The product comes in a glass bottle with a dropper... the recommended amount of 4-6 drops per application is enough to cover one’s face. The formula is lightweight and has a soft, clean scent. Once applied, it dries quickly so you’re able to easily incorporate it into your routine. I have noticed my skin feels soft and hydrated. It is also visibly refreshed. This is a great serum overall... I highly recommend it! nan
