This cream is my go-to for these harsh winter days! My skin drinks up all the moisture it gets from this cream and has not broken out or reacted negatively due to this product. If I use this cream before I put on makeup, my foundation goes on smoothly, and if I put it on before I go to sleep, I wake up with very moisturized skin. This cream is on the thicker side, so definitely more dry-skin friendly. Love love love! Cannot rave about it enough. (The photo Iâ€™ve included is to demonstrate how smoothly my foundation and makeup goes on top of the moisturizer!) Great for dry skin!
