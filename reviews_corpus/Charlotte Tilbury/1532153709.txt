I’ve never tried a tilbury product before so didn’t have any expectations really but this cream was truly magic. I’m super picky with moisturizers because I’m combination and breakout easily but I’ve had no issues here at all. The scent has a slight rose tone to it which is really the only thing somewhat negative I can say about it (sensitive to rose) but it’s not even that much of a big or noticeable deal. Love this cream and wish there were bigger sizes! nan
