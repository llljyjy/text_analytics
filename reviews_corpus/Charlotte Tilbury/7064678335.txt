Received this for free from Influenster for my honest opinion. I love the packaging, its so luxe and elegant to have it on my vanity. The bottle is made of glass and can be reused. Not just the outer looks, the real beauty of this cream is inside . This cream has fresh smell to it(not childish or fruity) but very pleasant. When I looked at it I felt that the cream is super thick and felt it might feel too oily but I was wrong. Little goes a long way and my skin just drinks this in one swipe. The dewiness stays on. I tested & used it under makeup also and there’s no patchiness or lifting. My foundation goes lot smoother, even if I do no makeup makeup look with just concealer, brow tint and lip balm my skin would still look flawless. I am writing this review after using this Charlotte Tilbury magic cream for almost 10 days now. You can see the before and after in the photos. I used it every single day and night to test it out. I’d continue to use it and will definitely buy it and I’m planning to gift it to my best friend birthday this year in December. Worth every penny and I’m glad I finally got my hand on this moisturizer. I love anything CT and this moisturizer didn’t disappoint at all. Must try and little goes a long way. MySkin's new BFF!!
