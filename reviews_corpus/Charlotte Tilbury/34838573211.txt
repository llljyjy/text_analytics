I have been using this product for about a week now in my night skincare routine and I love it so far. It is very moisturizer and you can actually feel it. A little goes a long way! It is fragrance free and performs good under make up. First time using a product of this brand and Iâ€™m really happy. Super smooth and moisturizer
