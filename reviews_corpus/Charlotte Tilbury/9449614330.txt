This is a thick and luxurious cream that is reminiscent of the Creme de La Mer but at a cheaper price point. The fragrance is very strong on application but disappears once the product is absorbed. It doesnâ€™t irritate my dry, sensitive skin, but I still wish there were a fragrance free version because this is a perfect base for makeup! Amazing- just wish it were fragrance free!
