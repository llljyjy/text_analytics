I have been testing out the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream for a couple of weeks now. Overall, I have really enjoyed it. I have been using it in the mornings as a moisturizer/primer combination. It has a light floral scent that I quite enjoy. It soaks into my skin quickly makeup applies smoothly on top of this product. Overall, I would recommend it to others. I know itâ€™s pricey, but I love it!!
