I received this little gem in a #voxbox and have been using it for almost a week now. The packaging is very nice although it does make you think you are getting more product than you actually are. The formula is quiet nice. A very thick cream that does not go heavy on fragrance. Also a little bit goes a long way. I have been using this on and around my eye area and also on my smile lines because for some reason they get very dry. I look forward to seeing what 30 days of this product will do and may review it again later. nan
