Absolutely loving this Magic Cream! My face feels smooth and plump and my wrinkles not as prominent.  I’m also enjoying the fact that my dark spots are not as dark.  Whatever kind of voodoo Charlotte Tilbury is putting into this cream works well! It’s a bit pricey but a little goes a long way. Perfect moisturizer for under makeup too. All things considered this is one of my favorite moisturizers. nan
