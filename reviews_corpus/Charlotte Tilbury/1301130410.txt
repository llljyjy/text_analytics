Classic product and an overall great primer. I don’t and wouldn’t use this as a part of my skincare routine but it does help prime the skin for makeup once everything is on. It is great for dry skin and I would recommend. But it is fragranced so if you’re sensitive to that then this is a skip. Great primer
