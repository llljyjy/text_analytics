I received this gifted product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review and opinion. I liked this! I’m skeptical when it comes to under eye creams because I find that they’re over priced moisturizers. However, this cream kept my under eyes very plump and soft, even into the next day. I’m unsure about the validity of the claims on the box, but I think my eyes looked a little less crepe in the morning. This product can’t help to reverse aging, but it can help you maintain a little youthfulness. I did notice a difference after testing it for almost 3 months. Is it worth the high price tag? Not for me. While I was happy to use and test this product, I cannot justify the cost. However! A little bit of product does go a long way. It has a soufflé like texture, very soft and fluffy. As I said, I tested this for almost 3 months and I’m not even halfway through the little jar. I also encourage you to be a bit dubious of the products’ claims. Their people pool and time tested is very small. I don’t think they could’ve gotten the results they claim in that short amount of time. Helps to keep under eye area plump
