Well, I love this moisturizer. The packaging is beautiful. The moisturizer is thick and absorbs nicely into the skin. I notice a difference in the field and look of my skin after applying it. It really helps with those dry areas on the face and neck. I personally don’t find that it is too thick. Or two over scent. But I don’t quite know if it is worth the $100 price tag. I’ve had other incredible moisturizers that cost much less and give me the same results. But I can’t say that this doesn’t work, because it does. Great moisturizer but very pricey!
