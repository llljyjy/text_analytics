At first notice is the product’s packaging. It is in a very pretty jar. I love that it is refillable. This product It was gentle on my skin and “magical” as my eye area looked refreshed after a long day of work. I liked the light scent as well. I’ll definitely continue to use this product for added benefits. I’drecommend giving it a try if you’re looking for a pick me up for your eye area! nan
