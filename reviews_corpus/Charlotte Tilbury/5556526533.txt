I’ve used this product for quite sometime now and I love that the application process is easy, bottle is user friendly and packaging is very nice! I’ve used it on the back of my hands and my neck and it makes it very smooth and I have seen a positive difference- may need more months of application to see a major difference. I have not used it on my face as it has comedogenic ingredients which may cause acne. Love the mild fragrance! It’s good!
