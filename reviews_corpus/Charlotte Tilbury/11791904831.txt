I love everything about the texture of this serum. It has that cool moisturizing feeling as soon as it’s applied. The scent is a subtle fresh floral that’s not overpowering at all. No stickiness and pairs so well with a great moisturizer on top. I love that it has Vitamin C to even and brighten the appearance of my skin. The bottle is just too pretty, I love the glass applicator it makes for the BEST ASMR! TOP NOTCH!
