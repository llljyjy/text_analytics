I received this item from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. The Magic Eye Rescue Cream is a great lightweight hydrating eye cream that contains retinol - a wonderful ingredient for fighting signs of aging, although it takes a while to see results. It comes in a very luxe-feeling glass jar that is refillable which is a feature I always love to see. It felt very hydrating and I did notice that my fine lines seemed less noticeable after using. I also struggle with patches of flaky, dry skin on my eyelids which the eye cream helped too. It made my eyeshadow so much easier to blend and I didn’t feel like I was irritating my skin with the brushes. The only negative I noticed was that I experienced a very slight stinging sensation when I used the eye cream after washing my face. Looking at the ingredients it may be the citric acid but I’m not 100% sure. If you have sensitive skin it is something to be aware of! Nicely hydrating - maybe not for sensitive skin
