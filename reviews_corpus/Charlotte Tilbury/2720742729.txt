I don’t typically include eye creams in my regular skincare routine but the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Eye Rescue cream has now been added as one of my staple skincare products. I do not have many wrinkles under my eyes but sometimes I get dark circles after a few late nights and early mornings.  The cream is easy to apply and a little bit goes a long way. This is important because it is a bit pricey but it will last for a good length of time. The cream contains retinol which is your skin’s best friend. I like the natural glow it gives around the eyes to detract from signs of a late night. It also leaves my skin soft and refreshed around the area of application. I have a combination skin type and the cream does not make my skin extra oily or shiny in around my eyes.The cream has a slight scent but nothing that I would consider strong or one that lingers after application. I would recommend this cream if you a looking for a mid priced product that actually gives results. A new addition to my skincare routine
