Ill start out by saying I don’t generally write reviews but this product has me shook. I used it for the first time about a week and a half ago without knowing much about it as I got it as a sample. I do not have acne prone skin and OMG overnight I had breakouts all over. Didn’t think into much because I thought maybe I’m getting my period or something. I forgot about the magic serum in my drawer and after a week my pimples were disappearing. I saw the magic serum in my drawer last night and applied it again and this morning… POOF pimples again. Came on to look at reviews to see if it could be from this serum and notice lots of other people saying the same thing. This product is not it!! I do not recommend at all.
