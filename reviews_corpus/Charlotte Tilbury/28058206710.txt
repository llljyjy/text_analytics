I’ll start this review by saying that this product was sent to me for free by Influenster to try out in exchange for my HONEST review. I’ve got really sensitive and extremely dry skin, which can limit the products that I’m able to use on my skin. This one worked amazing even with my sensitive skin and my skin just drank it in. It was also so soft and I noticed a difference almost instantly. It does have a light fragrance but nothing overpowering. I’ll definitely buy this one. Lovely!
