I really enjoyed using this moisturizer as itâ€™s thick hydrating, and a great makeup primer. However, for moisturizers, the price point is very high, especially when many other brands create a great moisturizer for much less. If you are looking for a luxury moisturizer, I would suggest that this would be a good fit for you, with the caveat that if you have oily or blemish-prone skin, it might be a little bit too heavy for you. nan
