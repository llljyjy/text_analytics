I received Charlotte Tilbury Charlotte’s Magic Cream from Influenster for my honest review. The container is beautiful and made of glass so it looks luxe and elegant. I’ve been using it for a month and my combination skin really liked this cream! It absorbed right into my skin and did not feel sticky and I can see the difference in my skin within a short time. I love this product! I definitely have become a new customer of Charlotte Tilbury Cream with Hyaluronic Acid. I suggest you try it too. nan
