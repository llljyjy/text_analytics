I honestly have mixed feelings about this product. I was so exited when I received it because I’ve heard good things about this product. It does have a floral scent but it is mild, It’s a thick cream consistency, it leaves my skin with a matte finish, that might be good for oily skin. Unfortunately I’m not impressed overall, I’m not noticing any improvement on my skin. I did have a breakout issue  when I first start using the product, Iwas using it twice a day, then I took a break and restarted using it cause I wanted to give it a second chance. I’m currently using it only at night and it’s working out fine. That being said, I’m not blown away. Mixed feelings
