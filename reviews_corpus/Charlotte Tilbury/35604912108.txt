I received this product from Charlotte Tilbury and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I was very skeptical to try this “magic elixir“ as it’s claims are a little hard to believe. It claims that “93% agree skin looks younger, says that it’s clinically proven to reduce the appearance of wrinkles by 34%, firms the appearance of skin by 49%, and that 90% of users saw firmer skin, tighter/more refined pores, lifted facial contours, reduced lines and wrinkles, and intensely hydrated skin. Whoa! If it does all that I have no problem paying the (what I originally thought was pretty pricey) retail dollar amount! First - let’s discuss the packaging. Beautiful, luxe glass bottle. Almost looks “angelic“ or “heavenly“. This is a product that you can leave out on your vanity because it’s so pretty. The color reminds me of milk and it feels soft and hydrating, but not greasy, when you rub it into your hands and then onto your face. It instructs you to use it on “clean skin“ BEFORE your moisturizer in the morning AND the evening so that’s what I did. I did this for 2 weeks and I can honestly say my skin appears more rejuvenated, hydrated, and more than one person has asked me if I’ve started doing my makeup differently or recently lost some weight. They say my face looks thinner. I was absolutely elated! “Magic elixir“ is the perfect name for this product as in just a few weeks it has performed literal “magic“ on my face! Would 100% recommend to friends and family. You will not be disappointed! Luxurious bottle with a perfumey scent!
