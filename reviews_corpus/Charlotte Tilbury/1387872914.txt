This serum looks gorgeous on your vanity and it has some really fun ingredients (looking at you gem stones and gold!) but I need it to do more than that. For my oily, maturing (I’m 38) skin, it just didn’t work well. I used it consistently for a month before reviewing so I could be fair to the products and the people who would read the reviews and I have to say that yes it is moisturizing, but it broke me out. I am guessing it is the shea in it. I wanted to like it because it is such a lovely product but it just wasn’t right for me. If you have dry skin you should for sure try it out. Not so great for my oily skin
