Magic Serum Crystal Elixir is formulated with great ingredients-antioxidants, skin-brightening, soothing and anti-acne ingredients. However, it has an artificial fragrance that can irritate sensitive skin. The formula is lightweight, fast-absorbing, and has a subtle shimmer. The scent is extremely strong and I didn’t like it personally, but it also didn’t cause me any irritation. This serum provides an instant glow and layers well with my other skincare products.
