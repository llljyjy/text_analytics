I liked this Moisturizer, it did the job but is way overly priced in my opinion but I also looked at the ingredients and quartz,amethyst, and ruby powder was listed along with gold. that’s probably way price is high. for me, after the first use my skin felt tingly almost itchy. but it wasn’t greasy or have a oily feeling like some moisturizers can have. Nice Moisturizer
