Feels Dated. Strong floral scent. Oily and thick application. I felt like I was using my grandmotherâ€™s face lotion. After using for a week I had clogged pores and scattered whiteheads. Definitely not impressed and would not buy for the price. Much better products are out there in this price point. nan
