“I received this product by star and Charlotte Tilbury for free and exchange for my honest review.”  The outer packaging and the actual container for this moisturizer is well made and it shows it’s a luxury product. I have normal to dry skin. This moisturizer feels thick and rich but once put on the skin and absorbed it made my skin feel so soft. My face looked healthy and radiant. This moisturizer has many great ingredients for vitamin C, Rosehip oil, hyaluronic acid and much more. The ingredient added to this cream was the hyaluronic acid which is very important for my skin because this ingredient allows the skin to stay hydrated which in turn helps with fine lines and wrinkles.  I noticed that my skin didn’t look dull and I love how my face not only looks but feels so much softer. Due to how my skin looks and how much improvement I’ve noticed the magic cream became part of my daily routine. While I live this moisturizer and recommend for others to try, some may find that it’s price is a deal breaker. Yes, it may seem pricey at $100 for 1.7oz and this is the only con I could find with this product but CT does offer smaller sizes. I would recommend trying a smaller size and checking it out for yourself. If this had been a $65 price range it would be phenomenal. While I don’t mind spending on skincare as long as I see some difference like I see withy his product some may. In summary I must say that I love how well this moisturizer suits my skin. I also used it as a primer as it worked well too. Skin felt and looks amazing
