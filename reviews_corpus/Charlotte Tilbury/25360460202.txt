The Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream is my new moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and I feel like I’ve tried every product out there, this is the only cream I can use on my face that dosent break it out. I love the beautiful jar it comes in, I also love that there is no harsh smell from the cream. It is creamy and goes on so smooth, I have used this product for about 2 weeks and I can already feel and see a difference. My skin is much smoother, much more supple, and it has definitely made my brown spots and lines less noticeable. I knew the cream wouldn’t work overnight, but to see these results this soon, to say the least, I am a fan. I was so excited about the way it made my skin feel that I took it to work with me, I shared it with a few of my friends and just one use was enough for them. I’m excited to see the results of continued use. This cream is a game changer for me!
