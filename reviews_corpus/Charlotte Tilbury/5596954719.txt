The Charlotteâ€™s Magic Serum Crystal Elixir helps lighten up my dark spots and keep my skin looking radiant and soft. The serum has a runny consistency but is easily absorbed into the skin where it does not pill or break down. I love using this serum under my makeup which helps brighten my overall appearance. There is a perfume scent to this serum so the scent can be somewhat strong if you have a sensitivity to smell. I love the design of the bottle which has a elegant and luxury look to me.
