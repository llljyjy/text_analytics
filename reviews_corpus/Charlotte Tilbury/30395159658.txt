Just like the name, it is MAGIC, indeed! It is such luxurious feeling when applying it to my skin. The cream quickly smooths and blends into my poor, dry complexion! It’s just such a pleasure to finally have found a product that truly lives up to my high expectations! I honestly have never heard of this brand, but I started researching and it does have good reviews. I’ve recommended it to all my friends and I think it will also be a great gift idea for moms! You don’t ever have to reapply in the middle of the day or night- it lasts all day! Lives up to the name!
