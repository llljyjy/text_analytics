I so happy to finally be able to try this! I’ve heard so many rave reviews that I thought it had to be bull but thankfully it worked out well. Packaging is beautiful and something I would keep out on my vanity all the time. I’ve only tried it with 2 foundations so far and it leaves my skin dewy covering any dry patches. Highly recommend Worth the hype .. so far
