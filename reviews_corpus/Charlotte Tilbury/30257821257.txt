This is a very luxurious moisturizer. It works so good for dry and mature skin. It is very creamy, and has a nice smell that that goes away quickly. I could tell a difference in my skin not being dry the very first time I used it and that helped to smooth out my wrinkles and lines it does have a little tingling when you first apply. I would recommend this product. Rich and creamy
