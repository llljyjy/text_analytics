its a no for me, especially with the hefty price tag. 1 star because of hydration, thatâ€™s it. Even then hydration does not last long. Did not a darn thing with my dark spots or pores. The glow recipe dew drops is half the price and seen a difference in my skin with a couple of uses. 1 star for hydration, that's it.
