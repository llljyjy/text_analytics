I received a sample of this with my recent online order. First of all the sample size had a lot of product so my hands got luxury treatment as well. The cream is very creamy but hydrating, I noticed the vegetable oil in the ingredients right away, put on primer and makeup and I kid you not, my makeup has never blended so nicely. I’m assuming that’s what it was meant for. I love it. For oily areas, I use a puff for a little Charlotte Tilbury blurring powder. Lots of setting spray. Voila. blending magic
