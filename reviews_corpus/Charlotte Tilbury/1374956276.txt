This is a cream I really wanted to love because of my past experiences with this brand. It smells very faint of a clean refreshing odor that just makes you want to apply. I have combination skin and the normal areas loved it. The dry areas became drier and flaky. I alway use a product I review for at least 10 days and my dry areas suffered. Yet the normal areas flourished. I donâ€™t understand it but I would recommend this for people with normal skin. Definitely not dry. A great brand, just not for me
