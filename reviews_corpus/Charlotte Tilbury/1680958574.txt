CHARLOTTE TILBURY strikes gold! I was gifted this moisturizer from Influenster, Sephora and Charlotte Tilbury to try the product and give my honest review.The packaging is beautiful with all you need to know regarding the formula beautifully printed on the box. The jar contains the magic, the moisturizer does contain a fragrance, mild but noticable, I don’t mind it.  I have combination skin, I’m 56 years old. You don’t need a lot of product to notice a difference; I applied to my decollete area, and my neck first, they absorbed and my skin drank the hydration which left my skin softened and well hydrated. The fine lines on my face softened after the first couple of uses. My t-zone is oiler, and doesn’t need as much as the other areas. I love this moisturizer, and I can’t wait to see the results after using it for a couple of weeks.I highly recommend it.... CHARLOTTE TILBURY strikes Gold!
