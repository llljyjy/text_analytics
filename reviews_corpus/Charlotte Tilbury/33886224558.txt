This cream was my first Charlotte Tilbury product and it really impressed me and lived up to the brandâ€™s name. I loved this cream, it was so moisturizing for my dry skin and came in the cutest packaging. The jar itself was adorable and the cream smelled wondrous and was lightweight and refreshing on my skin, giving it the most natural glow. I definitely recommend trying out this cream to anyone looking for a new moisturizer!! nan
