This was my first time using this Magic Cream and I must say it definitely lives up to its name! It feels so luxurious and creamy as it melts into your skin. It’s not to heavy and after using it my skin feels very soft and hydrated! I truly enjoyed using it and can’t wait to see what this magic cream can do with long term use! Truly magic!
