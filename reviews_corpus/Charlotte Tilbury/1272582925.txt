Earlier this year, I tired it for several weeks.  It seemed to just sit in my face without absorbing.  It actually seemed a little worse than a typical facial cream.  Prior to throwing it away, I thought…well, the weather has changed, maybe I’ll like it more.  Nope.  I like it less than I did.  Very limited absorption.  It sits on my face (which is unusual).  After buying this, I bought some La Mer products.  Love!  I use the soft lotion, matte lotion (for under foundation), the concentrate and serums.  This CT brand makes some decent makeup, but the skin care is awful.  I have several of the CT products, including the serum (also awful).  I’m in my 50s and need a bit “more”… can’t imagine using this product on younger skin.  Maybe for super, super dry skin? Not great.
