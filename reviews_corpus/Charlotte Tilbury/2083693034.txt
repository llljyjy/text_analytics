Lightweight but sticky. You will definitely need to follow up with a moisturizer if you have dry skin, however, will be good as a single hydrating item for day use because I use a lot of sunscreen lotion. Didn’t see any new breakout but everyone’s skin is different so try it out if you want to splurge on something new, otherwise, I don’t think it’s worth the price for an item so basic. Sticky
