I like this eye cream, don’t get me wrong. But I’ve used a lot of different creams and this is no where near my favorite. It’s a little too thick for my liking and to be honest I don’t think it does the things it claims. Not for me, anyway. The main thing I was hoping it would help with was dark circles. It didn’t for me. Plus, I wear contacts and since it’s so thick it irritates my eyes a little. Nothing major but it does bother me. Okay but not great
