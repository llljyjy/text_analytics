I like this moisturizer, but I don’t love it.  It’s a little tricky to get the right amount, too little leaves me too dry and too much feels too heavy.  It had that brief, faint floral scent I’m not a fan of but it dissipates quickly.  Overall, good but not sure it beats my other products, especially for the price. Good
