I received this product compliments of Influenster for testing purposes. At first try, I really liked the texture of this cream. It applies smoothly and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I wouldn’t say that it worked as a miracle product for me, as my skin stays permanently dry,  but it definitely helped. I think I’ll continue to use this product as a part of my nightly skincare routine. Solid product
