The moisturizer itself is quite thick, but goes a long way! I’ll grab just a pinky amount to cover my face. Very hydrating in a way you’d think would leave you greasy but it absorbs well! The box has instructions on how to apply in a massage pattern that I will now be adopting for all of my skincare routine. I have combination skin and this product works perfectly to target and hydrate my drier areas morning and night. Ok love this
