I was excited to try the Magic Serum Crystal Elixir from Charlotte Tilbury for myself. Here are my thoughts! The product comes in a sturdy glass bottle with a beautiful design at the bottom and has a pipette dropper slightly curved which makes the dosing and application of this serum easy. A strong smell prevails when opening the bottle and applying the serum that dissipates over time, but to me unfortunately this smell was off-putting. It has a good list of ingredients - Niacinamide being the 2nd ingredient on the list, Quartz, Amethyst and Ruby Powder, Gold, Shea Oil, Antioxidants from fruit extracts, Lactic Acid among them.The serum has a lightweight creamy-colored texture that absorbs well into the skin. I must say I have a love-hate relationship with this product and here’s why. I was very excited when I received the product for testing as I love CT and her lipsticks. The product looked promising, but the first thing that got me was the smell. Then, when applied in the morning, the serum absorbs easily, giving me a slight glow, in the beginning it started to irritate me and pilled off (it did not go well with my Vitamin C skincare regimen). Used at my nighttime routine I was expecting this serum to help out keeping my skin hydrated based on the claims “skin feels intensely hydrated“, but I would wake up with a lot of dry patches. I didn’t give up and made it work somehow, pairing it with other products and now my skin is adjusting better. Regarding the claims of “firmer skin, tighter and more refined pores, fine lines and wrinkles appear reduced“ I saw a slight improvement. If I would have paid the $80 price point for this product, in all fair honesty, I would have returned it. Not what I expected ...
