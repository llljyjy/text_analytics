I honestly thought I won’t like this because of the rose fragrance but the fragrance is very mild and not overpowering. It is very hydrating and leaves a smooth and supple finish . It also gives a nice fresh glow to the skin . Love that it has niacinamide in it . I had a little irritation on the skin , because my skin is very sensitive. It could be because of the fragrance I’m not really sure . But this product is amazing for anyone who does not have sensitive skin . Other than the mild irritation I really liked this and it worked well on my oily skin . nan
