I started using this after beginning treatment for acne at a dermatology clinic so I wasn’t sure how this would work for my combination skin that tends to run on the oily side. For reference, I was using clindamycin gel and tretinoin. So I needed good moisturizer to help counter the drying retinoid. As soon as I apply this cream after patch testing to be sure I didn’t have any reactions, I was pleasantly surprised by how it just sank into my skin and felt so light. I’ve been using it for a month and my skin has just been so soft ever since starting.I continued using this product for about a month and it has been such a surprise because my skin has just been so soft ever since I started using it. Sometimes the tretinoin dries me out a bit but then this helps me get back to a more balanced skin. The hyaluronic acid and peptides are ingredients I look for and even though this moisturizer has oils and I sometimes avoid them, it’s just felt so light and I’ve had no issues.The moisturizer does have a floral scent, which I love, but if you’re not into florals you might want to get a sample first.On my skin this can also serves as my primer. I don’t feel like I need an extra primer before makeup application. Surprised me how it treated my combination skin.
