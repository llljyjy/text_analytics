Okay, I’ve been using this eye cream probably three times a week, once a day for like a few weeks now. I have to say I love how well it’s worked even though I’m not consistent with it. I study for many hours and there are three days a week I barely sleep. Usually I’d wake up with puffy and baggy eyes, but ever since I started using this cream, the puffiness has gone away! I only use a little bit (a little bit goes a long way!) so it should last for a long time. Also, no dark circles so far!!! The container is also very cute and looks expensive, so it’s like you’re treating yourself every time you use it! Definitely would recommend as it’s worked like it’s supposed to :) Sleepless nights and no dark circles!
