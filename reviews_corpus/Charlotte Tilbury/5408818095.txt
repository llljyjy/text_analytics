I’ve heard really good things about this cream and was very excited to try it. My skin is perpetually dry, but somehow oily at the same time, and often times I find myself frustrated trying to combat both issues at once. This cream really helps with both, for me. I love the way it makes my skin feel, I’ve used it before applying makeup and it also helps my makeup look smooth and just all around better because my skin looks healthy underneath. I am very satisfied, and will continue to use and recommend this cream to anyone! I’m in love!
