The Charlotte Tilbury Magic Eye Rescue Cream with Retinol is my new favorite eye cream! I have never seen results and felt such an amazing difference with any other eye cream. This formula is so smooth and creamy on the skin plus is feels cooling! My eyes felt hydrated, smoother, and brighter immediately after one use and definitely has reduced the look of wrinkles after use twice a day for one month. This is a must have and will be a permanent part of my skin care regimen moving forward. Pick this eye cream!
