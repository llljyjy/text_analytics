I really like this cream, but the price is very high. It does absorb into the skin very nicely and doesnâ€™t leave any oily or greasy feeling. I do find my skin to be softer, but only time will tell when it comes to fine lines and wrinkles. The jar is very luxurious looking and feeling. Very happy I got to try this for free Very luxurious
