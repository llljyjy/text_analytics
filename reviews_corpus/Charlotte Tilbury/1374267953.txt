This cream is pretty amazing. It’s is thick but absorbs wonderfully to leave your skin feeling silky smooth. It seems to definitely make my face plumper and helped minimize my fine lines on my forehead. I personally don’t care for the smell. It’s pretty “old lady“ smelling. The smell however disappears pretty quick once it’s on and absorbed into the skin. The smell really is the only down fall for me and that’s the only reason why I did not give it 5 stars. So far this is the best cream I have used on my face and will more than likely be a new staple for me despite the price tag. Awesome, but...
