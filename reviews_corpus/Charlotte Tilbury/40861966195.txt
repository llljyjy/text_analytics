This Charlotte Tilbury Magic Eye Repair is a wonder cream! I love the way it feels on my skin, rich and creamy. A little of the product goes a long way! With regular use, I have found my eyes to look brighter, creating a more youthful look around my eyes. Because it uses a retinol component, it did take a few days in the beginning for my skin to adjust, So I would recommend easing it into your routine. This is a winning eye cream! Rejuvenation in a jar!
