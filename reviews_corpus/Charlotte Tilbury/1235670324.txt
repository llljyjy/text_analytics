I received this magic cream moisturizer complementary in exchange for my honest review. It has a very thick, luxurious consistency. It smells nice… Not overpowering. I love the way it goes on my skin and it absorbs really well. It’s definitely more of a nighttime cream because it is very thick. I’ve noticed my skin feels very hydrated when I use this cream. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a new night cream with hyaluronic acid. Magical Cream - Yes please!
