This is 100% my favorite moisturizer of all time. I LOVE the light clean rose scent to it. The packaging is beautiful and it looks pretty on my bathroom sink with my other skincare. But most importantly, it feels so nice on your skin. Hydrating, thick but not too think, smooth and wears perfectly under makeup (both powder and liquid foundation). I truly have no complaints or suggestions to make it better. Itâ€™s perfect just the way it is. For reference I have normal to dry skin and it works well for me year round. If you have more oily skin I recommend the light version. nan
