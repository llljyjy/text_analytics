Though I did enjoy the product, I’m not sure it really did anything for my skin, and for the price I’m not sure it’s worth it. I did have a subtle glow, but it didn’t scream WOW to me. A plus is it didn’t break me out, which I was worried about, so that’s good. I’d definitely take a pass on this. Eh..just ok
