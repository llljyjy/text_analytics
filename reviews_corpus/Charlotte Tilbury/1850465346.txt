OH. MY. GLOW. This arrived at the right time, just when I started incorporating retinol in my skin care routine again. I was dealing with some dryness and flaking Skin which is expected. But when I got this Complimentary from Charlotte Tilbury and Influenster, in exchange for my honest review, I used it right away by replacing my current nighttime moisturizer from  dr jart. A little bit (dime size) was enough for my face. This is thick and my skin just soaked it all up. Love the glow I get when I use this! The scent is very mild and pleasant. I’ve had this in my Sephora wish list and Nordstrom wish list but could never quite push the add to cart then checkout buttons. I mean, she’s not exactly budget friendly, but wow, after this, I’m SOLD.  I haven’t seen any specific changes related to skin tone brightness but it has definitely helped keep My skin hydrated. This cream will be best for Dry skin, and for winter months. I have oily to normal skin, and I haven’t experienced any breakouts for the last two weeks I’ve been using it in my nighttime routine (only). This cream is a splurge but oh so worth it! nan
