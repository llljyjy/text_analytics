I do not use eye cream products regularly, but I added this into my skincare routine for about a week and I have been enjoying it so far. I have not noticed changes on my dark circle, however, my eyes area have been very moisturize and look less tired. I also love the texture, it is thick and smooth so a little bit goes a long way.I will keep using it for the next few weeks to see if thereâ€™s any other improvements. P/S: the package is so precious, it looks and feel so luxurious. Great first impression!
