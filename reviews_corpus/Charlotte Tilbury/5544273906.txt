I have been using it for a couple weeks now and I am loving it! It has a nice light weight formula and just a little goes a long way! Some people may find the scent a little strong but I honestly love it! It makes my skin very moisturized and glowy! It works very well under makeup too, so definitely a thumbs up! Love it!
