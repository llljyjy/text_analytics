I received their product for free form Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury.What I love: packaging, consistency and absorbency What is okay: results (doesn’t seem magic but my skin does feel a little smoother/softer)This is a fairly expensive cream, and I expected slightly better results for the piece tag. But a little goes a long way, and overall I like it. I’ll definitely keep using and potentially purchase a replacement in the future. nan
