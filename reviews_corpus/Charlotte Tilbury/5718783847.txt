I love how beautiful the bottle is and that it looks great displayed on my counter.  I have been wearing it under my moisturizer and I love the scent. It smells like a very expensive facial and my skin feels and looks instantly hydrated but not sticky like some serums can be. I would definitely recommend. I have only been using for a few weeks but my skin already looks more even. nan
