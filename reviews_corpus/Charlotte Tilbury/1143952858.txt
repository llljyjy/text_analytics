I was so excited to try this out. It has a lovely light rose scent in the bottle but not so heavy that you can smell it when applied. The texture is a little more tacky/sticky than other serums I’ve tried but my makeup when on over it perfectly fine. My skin looked glowy and great with this beneath my makeup. However, after a week of using it I noticed that my skin was a little bumpy along my jaw line and around my mouth. Sure enough after discontinuing use my skin cleared back up. So if you have sensitive skin or are prone to breakouts I’d avoid. I don’t have any skin sensitivities or allergies so I’m not sure what exactly in this product was causing the reaction. Lovely Product but Unfortunate Reaction
