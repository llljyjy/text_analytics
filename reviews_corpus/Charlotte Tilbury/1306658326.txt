I absolutely love this cream! It feels so luxurious on my skin. I’ve always wanted to try the magic cream so I was excited to try. The cream is pretty thick so a little goes a long way. I’m in my early 30s and I used to have oily combo skin but now I’m leaning more dry combo skin so this is perfect for balancing my skin. nan
