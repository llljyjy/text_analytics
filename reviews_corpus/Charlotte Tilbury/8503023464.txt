I originally started using this by itself so as to see results solely from the product. It is actually quite nourishing. I did not really see a huge difference in skin tone but enough, especially after I started using a good cream over it. The problem I had w this product is the smell. I donâ€™t know what it is but it is pungent. My boyfriend told me i smelled funny lol that being said, the smell doesnt linger for too long.  It did at times make my face feel hot though. Meh
