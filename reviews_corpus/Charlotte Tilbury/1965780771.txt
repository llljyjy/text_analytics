this serum is nice— it’s a gorgeous package, it has a nice subtle smell, and it absorbs into the skin well. i put it on in the morning under makeup and it is very hydrating. however i took off one star for the price— even though this bottle will last a while, the price is just so exorbitant for what it is nan
