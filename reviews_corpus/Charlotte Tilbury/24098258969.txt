I am really liking this product! It has a very rich and supple feeling to it. It soaks into the skin nicely, leaving it feeling soft and nourished. Iâ€™m noticing my lines lessening and my skin looks brighter. It is not greasy or sticky. The smell is faint and pleasant. It comes in a beautiful glass bottle with an easy to use dropper. nan
