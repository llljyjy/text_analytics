I think that this a great cream to integrate into your routine every so often! Its a very thick consistency and does have a very faint fragrance. I thought it looked beautiful under a natural/glowy face of makeup. For my skin type (combo/oily, sensitive) I do not think this cream is right for me to use on a daily basis. Hyaluronic acid is excellent for keeping moisture and giving that fresh face glow. That being said, it is a great product that will be put to good use! Gives that beautiful glow!
