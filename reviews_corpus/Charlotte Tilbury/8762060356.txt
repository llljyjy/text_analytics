I had high hopes for this product, because, c’mon…it’s CT!!!! Unfortunately every time I applied it before bed my eyes watered the entire next day. Essentially rendering this completely useless for me. I have to assume it’s the fragrance causing the issue because I’ve used many other eye creams that don’t have added fragrance without issue. Tsk tel CT! Why would you perfume a product designed for the most delicate part of a person’s face? It felt great on my skin, just a shame my eyes couldn’t agree. NOT FOR SENSITIVE EYES
