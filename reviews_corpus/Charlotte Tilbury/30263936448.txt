I normally don’t have high hopes for most under makeup. They normally make my face to oily and I have to really apple the face powder to look as matte as I can. I waited a few weeks to review this because I wanted to give it a chance. Whew! I was pleasantly surprised. First, this moisturizer absorbs in the skin really well. It doesn’t leave my skin oil and it makes my face look 10 times better before even applying my makeup. My skin looks hydrated and plump, the hyaluronic acid is doing its thing lol! After I applied my makeup, I still liked how my face looked. I wasn’t oily and it made my foundation glide on nice. My face also didn’t look dry! I know this is supposed to help wrinkles, but I don’t have many so I can’t comment on that, but I love the way that my skin looks and feels! A little goes a long way and ai feel that the jar will last 6 months or so. I use both day and night. I received this to try. It is pricey, but so would def pay the $100 for it and I can’t say that I would with other moisturizers. I love this stuff! My New Favorite Moisturizer!
