I usually don’t write reviews but I felt I needed to with this product. I spent 200 points and got two mini samples of this product so that I could try it out before dishing out 100$. I HATE IT. First of all, it goes on super super sticky and it feels awful to put the rest of my face care on afterwards. Secondly, it smells awful (think old lady and her perfume). Finally, the applicator sucks and I ended up ditching it and pouring the liquid directly out onto my hand. Also, I’m almost done the second bottle (as much as I hate it, I also wanted to be consistent with it to see if it had any effect on my face) and there is absolutely nothing “magic” about it. If anything, my face has broken out more. TLDR: bought the samples and will absolutely not be purchasing the big bottle. Happy I didn’t buy a full bottle because it’s awf
