I wondered if the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream was worth the money. It’s just moisturizer right? Um, nope. It really is Magic. The Airbrush Flawless Foundation is my holy grail foundation and I will not use it without the Magic Cream. It blends beautifully together to create a beautiful flawless finish. It’s also great on it’s own and works with most foundations (not super dewy). Yes, It Really Is Magic
