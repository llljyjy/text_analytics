The packaging for this product is gorgeous yet I was skeptical if it worked. Initially the cream seemed heavy so I only applied at night. Realizing it quickly absorbed, I started using morning and night. Much to my surprise, it actually started erasing my crows feet! I love this stuff! Erases crows feet!
