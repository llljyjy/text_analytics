This CT magic cream has been a nice hydrating moisturizer to top off my other skincare routine. I love the rose gold lid and shape of the tub. I do wish it was glass instead of plastic. I love how thick the cream is but also buttery, it glides nicely on my skin, and I feel very hydrated through day and night. It does have some fragrance to it, but itâ€™s not overpowering. nan
