Okay I’m obsessed with Charlotte Tilbury magic cream! This stuff is heavenly! It feels so moisturizing and smooth applying to my skin. So far I haven’t had any breakouts or irritation and I have pretty sensitive skin generally. My skin soaks this magic cream up! I love that it has Hyaluronic acid in it. Seriously you NEED this stuff! It’s so good! Heavenly moisturizer!
