I wouldn’t say this potion is magic. It does feel great on my Iowa winterized skin and has a very light scent that is pleasant. For the price you would hope using a tiny amount would go a long way. I felt I use similar if not more than my regular everyday lotion. All in all it’s a very good moisturizer and perked up my dull and dry skin! nan
