I really enjoyed this moisturizer, from it’s super glamorous and gorgeous packaging to it’s beautiful and thick texture. Its super hydrating and absorbs super fast leaving my skin rejuvenated and plump. Really like that it doesn’t have sulfates and that in contains hyaluronic acid! I really noticed my wrinkles getting less noticeable and I can’t wait for longterm use results. Incredible moisturizer
