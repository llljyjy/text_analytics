Honestly in love with this cream! I’ve heard a lot about it and finally got a chance to try. It does really work as a “Magic cream” on my skin and leaves it sooo soft, glowing and even textured. I have oily skin and a lot of moisturizers just don’t work for me and make my face look greasy/oily an hour later after applying, but this isn’t the case.  Perfect amount of moisture + works almost like a primer and evens the skin tone and texture. Love it!! nan
