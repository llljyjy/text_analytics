I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. The jar is gorgeous. The cream itself has a creamy texture with little to no smell. It absorbs quickly and seems to moisturize immediately. I look forward to continued use to see if it helps with under eye wrinkles. Easily Absorbs and Not Greasy
