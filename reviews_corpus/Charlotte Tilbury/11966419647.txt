Whatever I will write about this cream probably will not be enough to describe it. It’s really magical! First let’s start from the packaging- it’s screams luxurious, heavy, well designed, glass container. About the ingredients- I felt in love right away because my skin really loves vitamins C and E and peptides, they works perfectly for me and as a person with oily skin I really appreciate them. About the actual cream- the consistency it felt very thick but it’s so soft like a butter and the moment when it goes on my skin it melts right away and my skin sinks it like desert for a rain. After that my skin feels so soft, so plumping and juicy, very hydrated and it looks very smooth. I definitely recommend this with my both hands if you want to invest some more money because the price it’s a little more but it’s worth it. In love
