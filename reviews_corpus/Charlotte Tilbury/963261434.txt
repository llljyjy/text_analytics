I tried this as part of a mini set and am hooked on it now.  I have very dry skin use it mainly as a primer before liquid foundations.  It makes my foundation melt into my skin and I never get the polka dot look in my chin when I use this as a primer.  I was looking for a larger size today but it seems like the mini is a more economical value over the 1 and 1.7 ounce sizes which seems odd but worth mentioning. nan
