I don’t use it consistently every day (because she pricey, I want to savor it lol) but when I do use it my skin feels so soft and healthy. It gives my dry skin the hydration it needs without being too thick. It also definitely leaves my skin smooth which makes it a perfect primer for my makeup. My foundation goes on like a dream! Usually I have some type of issue with my foundation clinging to dry spots on my thirsty skin but there hasn’t been once that I used this Magic Cream where that has been the case. The price is a bit steep but I truly feel the luxury when I wear this. Cheaper creams honestly can get the job done but this Magic Cream has “instant and long-term effects”. It contains ingredients such as Rosehip oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamins C & E, Shea Butter and more to nourish your skin to get that dewy glow everyone is trying to achieve! The name definitely fits the product! Pricey but worth it
