I have to say I was rather skeptical in trying this. It has a lot of hype but for good reason! The packaging is adorable and isn’t cheap looking. After ONE use i felt a difference in how soft my skin was. It’s only getting better. It’s on the pricier side but well worth the money! I will definitely be buying more and I love that there is a refill to it makes it a little cheaper. This is a new MUST HAVE! I'm a believer
