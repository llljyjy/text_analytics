I wanted to love this product more. It’s super creamy, smells amazing, and does leave your skin glowy. Unfortunately it also has a bit of a greasy effect to my skin. I used it on and off for almost a month in order to really get a feel for it. I’d use it again, but there are other products that I love more. It's Okay
