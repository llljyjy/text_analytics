I was really excited to try this product and I have to say so far it hasn’t disappointing. I haven’t used long enough to review long term benefits but the little time I have used it has been great. It works well with my makeup and primer. My face and neck felt soft and a nice base for makeup. I will continue to use to see the long term benefits and post an update after I have used for 30+days. My only reason I gave it 4stars is because the price but compared to other creams I have used at same price range it’s pretty good. I would recommend for people in their 30s and up to give it a try. I was given this product free to test but I take my reviews seriously and only give my honest opinion. nan
