Wow, I am surprised at all the good reviews for this eye cream. It’s the worse eye cream I’ve ever purchased! It dries my eye area, makes the makeup application creepy and uneven, makes my fine lines obvious when I don’t have any visible lines-not a good look. I am 47 so maybe it works better on younger skin? I’ll be returning this product. Maybe not for aging skin?
