I received this product as part of my campaign. I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It is thick but blends into the skin like butter. I am a fan of thick moisturizers as they tend to hydrate my skin better. I can see visual improvement in my skin, and I am not having to reply throughout the day like I do with others. The scent is also very suttle and pleasant. Highly recommend. Love it
