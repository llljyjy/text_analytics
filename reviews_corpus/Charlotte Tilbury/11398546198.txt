i got a sample of this product and i do think it’s a nice formula; it smooths onto the skin really nice, and feels really high quality, my skin feels soft and velvety after use. however, i have to say the smell of this product is really mature and it kind of stinks. it’s like artificial rose mixed with plastic babydoll. i can smell it on my face after applying the rest of my skincare and the smell won’t get off my hands either. i don’t know if there is fragrance in the product or if some of the ingredients cause the smell, but it’s just really bad. my first impression of the formula is that it’s really good but i don’t know if i’d be able to purchase a full size bottle just due to the unpleasant scent of this product. if you can get past the fragrance though i do think it’s worth it! nice formula, really bad smell
