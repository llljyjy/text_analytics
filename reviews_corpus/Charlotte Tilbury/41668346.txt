I absolutely loved this serum! It brings hydration, smoothness and firmness to the skin. It smells amazing also! It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave my skin sticky or shiny. I’ve seen improvement in my dark spots, texture and skin firmness. This worked best after exfoliating. I used twice a day for over a month, and a little went a long way. I’d highly recommend! I received free from Influenster for my honest review, and trust me I used it to the last drop and absolutely love! Amazing results!
