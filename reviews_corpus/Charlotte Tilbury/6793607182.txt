I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest option.First of all I will definitely be purchasing this when my sample runs out, lol. I tried this as a moisturizer before bed as well as a morning moisturizer under my makeup. I was skeptical this cream would break me out because it was new and quite thick...but it honestly made my skin so soft and it felt so HYDRATED, I seriously couldn’t stop touching my face! I was happily surprised the next morning when I woke up to no breakouts and velvety skin. I washed my face and used it under my makeup that morning and my makeup looked FLAWLESS. I looked airbrushed and even though I’m a professional makeup artist I have textured skin so it can be a daunting task to ensure my makeup isn’t cakey looking in certain areas. This blurred everything out and keeps my skin so hydrated that getting that beautiful flawless finish with my foundation was effortless. I love how I can use this cream AM and PM and that it even performs like a primer. This is probably the best product I’ve tried so far in 2022! This stuff is LIFE CHANGING lol
