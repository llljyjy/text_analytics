This is iconic for a reason! Rich creamy buttery texture works like a magic on all skin types but mostly on normal dry and especially aging skin to smooth fine lines and prep the skin for makeup application. It makes my skin soft and smooth, and just creates the perfect canvas for my makeup to look flawless. Charlotte canâ€™t do no wrong! What soft skin dreams are made of!
