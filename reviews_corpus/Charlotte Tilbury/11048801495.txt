This Charlotte Tillbury Magic Serum unfortunately didn’t do the job for me :( I really actually loved the strong rose scent (its used in a lot of Indian products) but unfortunately it broke me out with angry red pimples and a lot of texture all over my face after using it for a week. After stopping, my skin has begun healing and now is clearing up (but I hadn’t gotten acne that bad in about 10 years now). It’s unfortunate because I do love Charlotte Tillbury and the brand overall Unfortunately broke me out!
