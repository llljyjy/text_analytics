When I am really tired and sleep deprived or when I have too much sodium, I get under eye bags. I am not sure if this pedicure actually helped when I experienced the puffiness issue. At times I thought it did but most of the time, I don’t think I saw much difference. It didn’t hurt however. Like the application process. Consistency of product is good. Worth a try. nan
