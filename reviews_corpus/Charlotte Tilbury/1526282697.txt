This is a really nice, light serum for my oily skin. I love that it combines a hydrator, vitamin C, and niacinamide. This combination plays well with my skin and can be worn under makeup. I find that the vitamin C helps with evening my skin tone and the niacinamide helps with my oily skin and pores. It is notable that it has a floral fragrance, which I always feel is unnecessary in skincare but it dissipates quickly and doesnâ€™t seem to irritate my skin. It leaves a nice glow but I do need to follow it up with moisturizer before applying makeup. The packaging matches the price tag and I appreciate the glass bottle and rose gold accents. I received this complimentary from Influenster for my honest review yet I would consider purchasing this on my own. I would like to try the Magic Cream as well. Nice, light serum
