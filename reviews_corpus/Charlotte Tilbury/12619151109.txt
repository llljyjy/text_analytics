I am a consumer who is a sucker for beautiful packaging and Charlotte really made this beautiful. Itâ€™s an item that elevates your vanity look. Besides that the product itself is really beautiful. It has a very light scent unlike the glow toner which is more heavily scented. I have been using this every morning during my skin care routine before make up. I am someone who tends to have dry under eyes and this has really been making a huge difference in the look of my make up ! I totally recommend for those who struggle with dry under eyes. Plus once you buy the product you can buy refills there after. super lovely eye cream w refill option
