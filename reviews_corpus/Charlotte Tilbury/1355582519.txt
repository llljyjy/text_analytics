Honestly, I found nothing magical about this serum. It did nothing for my skin.  I thought it would be moisturizing but I found it to be a very poor serum.  If anything, my skin felt less noursihed afterwards. This surprised me becuase CTâ€™s Magic Cream is such an amazing moisturizer!! So: note to self: skip the serum and just buy the cream! nan
