Beautifully presented moisturizer! Love the packaging, giving it a real elegant feel. The moisturizer has a light, pleasing scent. It is not overpowering. The cream goes on very well and isn’t heavy but does hydrate. My skin looks plumper, more radiant and feels more hydrated and softer after just one week. It’s a great product and the jar could easily last four months. Radiance in a Glass
