I received this product from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury for free for my honest review. Wow! I loved everything about this product! The packaging is beautiful and looks so nice, I wouldn’t put it away in my makeup drawer. It smells nice, like roses but not strong at all. It feels luxurious! I have combination skin but my dry areas are super dry. This kept me moisturized all day. I didn’t need to use a primer under my makeup because this product help my makeup go on beautifully and stay. It didn’t irritate my skin and I think this could be my go to moisturizer. It also came with a sample of their serum which was super nice! Wow!
