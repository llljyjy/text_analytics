I received a complimentary of this from influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. This was my first time trying a Charlotte Tilbury product so I was excited to try. I liked using this cream, I have  combination skin and this worked for my skin. It was hydrating and didn’t feel oily for me, I liked how it made my face look, it was glowing. This cream does have a scent, it has a powdery rose type of smell, I didn’t mind it, it sort of reminded me of La mer but I could see how the smell might bother some people. This stuff is definitely pricey, for the price I wish it would have cake with a scoop or spatula to apply the cream since it is in a jar. Magic Cream
