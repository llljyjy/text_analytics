Charlotte Tilbury Magic Eye Cream was sent to me as a sample to review from Influenster. I’m 53 and have used eye creams off and on. They were either too irritating or too fragrant. This cream goes on light, has no perfume and just feels good around my eyes. I’ve not seen any actual difference yet but I’m continuing to use morning and evening. I would love to purchase this again. nan
