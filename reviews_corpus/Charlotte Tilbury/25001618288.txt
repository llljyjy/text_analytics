I can tell you that cream is life for persons with dry skin.. Let’s start with the packaging, the shape of the jar & the appearance of the lip screams classy. I normally give myself 4-6 weeks before I can give a detailed review on a skincare product due to the fact that it may cause breakouts or just your skin getting used to a new product. I have been using this for a little over 3 weeks (I got very little/no breakout) & my results are evident. The cream has a scent but not overly harsh, does not leave a tacky layer when dried, very moisturizing, long lasting, can be worn underneath makeup, very easy to apply & helps to minimize hyperpigmentation. Hyaluronic Acid main aim is to moisturize but not all products that contains it last over 6 hours. I’m telling you guys not because I got it for free doesn’t mean I’m going to feed you all lies. I like to leave honest reviews/opinions especially on expensive products because people want to get what they pay for in a high priced product. I will attach a picture of me wearing it under my makeup.. I love it, highly recommended. Love it..
