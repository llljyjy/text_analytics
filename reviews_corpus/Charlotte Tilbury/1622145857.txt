in my opinion, just a glorified nice smelling moisturizer. I had high hopes for this but it didnâ€™t go on smoothly, the glow did not happen, the smell is strong. it was just too much to spend for me when I can get the same results out of any other moisturizer. still love the makeup products, just not skincare meh
