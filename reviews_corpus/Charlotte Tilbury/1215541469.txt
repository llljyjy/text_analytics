On the Sephora cosmetician advise I purchased this wonderful eye cream. I was concerned because my concealer was starting to crease and clump. After talking with me we tried this cream waited a few minutes then applied concealer. WOW! What a difference! I stayed in the store checked my eyes again and was sold. I am 67 and have tried them all. From very expensive eye creams to drug store brands. Yes this is pricey but a little goes a long way. My under eyes felt cool and looked visibly better after just the one application. I look forward to see what happens in the coming weeks. considering that there are products much more expensive this is cost effective and you buy refills so never need to buy the jar again. This makes product less money and helps environment. No pilling of product use a little and let it dry. I am very happy with this product and I thank Faiza for the recommendation! What a Difference The Right Product Makes!
