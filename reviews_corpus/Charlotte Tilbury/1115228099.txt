This is a great moisturizer for someone who wants a thicker, luxurious, sensory experience. The jar itself is gorgeous, although there is no spoon or spatula that comes with it and I hate sticking my fingers in skincare products! It truly feels like a dream going on, and absorbs to an almost velvety finish. My combo skin (oily t-zone and drier cheeks) was okay with it but as an overnight cream it did make me feel a little greasy. I don’t think i could use this under makeup during the day, but if you need more moisture for your skin it may work. It does have a floral scent (I identify it as rose) so if you are sensitive to fragrance this isn’t for you. It didn’t do much to calm my redness, but it isn’t marketed to do that so no big deal. I love that it has a refill, but my biggest complaint is the price. It is soooo expensive and it just didn’t wow me enough to actually purchase it. Overall, a great product that does moisturize and provide a glow, but too expensive and a little too heavy for my combo skin. Very good, not quite a favorite
