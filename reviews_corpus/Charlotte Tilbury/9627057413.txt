Although I wasn’t instantly impressed with this moisturizer the first couple times I used it, I decided to use this product everyday, morning and night for a month. I had high expectations since it’s from a luxury brand and has the word “magic” in the product’s name. After using it for an extended time (about a month), I fell in love with Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid. My skin is brighter, softer, and has reduced fine lines and wrinkles. I still used a primer with it but did not use a facial oil as I normally do under moisturizer since I tend to have oily skin. nan
