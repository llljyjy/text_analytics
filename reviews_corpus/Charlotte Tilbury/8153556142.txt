As you know I love to receive products for free in exchange for my honest review. This time @influenster and @charlottetilbury send me the Charlottes Magic Serum Cristal Elixir is an hydrating serum and this is exactly what Iâ€™m looking for. It is also fragrance free as I could notice. Packaging is luxury. I apply it before my magic cream moisturizer (also from Charlotte Tilbury). My face looks brighter, less dull and it absorbs very well and quickly, that makes it perfect to use before makeup. I will use it on my skin care routine Good serum
