You either love or hate the smell. I love roses so I think it’s super luxurious. It is very sticky as an overnight mask and I was going to write it off until I saw how nicely my makeup applied the next day. I had flakey dry skin around my mouth and nose and this hydrated my skin so well. I couldn’t believe it. I just have a trial size but I’ll keep using this for sure. nan
