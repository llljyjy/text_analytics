Magic Cream is one of the best priming moisturizers I have used. It is a beautiful moisturizer that works well for all skin types. Especially for my dry skin it’s truly a Magic Cream. It is such a beautiful makeup base! This is one of the first skincare products I tried from Charlotte Tilbury and I’ve been hooked for life. It’s such a wonderful moisturizer and worth every penny. A little bit goes a long way and lasts a long time . nan
