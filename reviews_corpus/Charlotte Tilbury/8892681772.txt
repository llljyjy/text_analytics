I love the way that this serum makes my skin look and feel! I’ve been using this twice a day and my skin has a fresh glow. I have noticed some minor breakouts but that may be attributed to the fact that I stopped using my regular pure Niacinamide serum because this has it in it and I didn’t want to overdo it!Overall, I love it! I’m not sure I would choose to purchase because of the insanely high price tag, though. Fresh, Glowy Skin!
