I’ve always heard great things about the Charlotte Tilbury brand but had never tried a single product, until now! Thanks to Influenster, I received this serum to test in exchange for a review! Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Serum Crystal Elixir comes in a stunning little bottle & the serum smells lovely as well. Infused with Quartz, Amethyst Ruby powder & gold so your face has a glowy finish! This serum pairs well with my cleanser, moisturizer, makeup & other serums without any reaction. The only downside is I do find my skin’s appearance to be a little too shiny after use, especially on my T zone. I used as directed; A few drops before my moisturizer. I played around with it & decreased the amount to one drop & did not notice a difference unfortunately.After using this Charlotte Tilbury Magic Serum Crystal Elixir for a little under a month I can not say with certainty that there is a noticeable difference in my skin. But I think it’s worth it for others to give it a try. nan
