I was given this to try in exchange for an ho eat review. I REALLY had high hopes for this based on the reviews, but when I delved into them more, I realized a lot are incentive based and probably didn’t give it a solid try. While my skin didn’t react poorly, no matter what I used over or under the cream, it pilled up ruining my makeup. I’d even try only using it and then waiting a couple minutes before makeup and nothing would make it work for me. I will use it at night, but for $100, there are better options with less fragrance. I really wanted to love it. Meh
