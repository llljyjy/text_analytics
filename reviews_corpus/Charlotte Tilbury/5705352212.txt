I was using Chanel Le lift eye cream prior and decided to switch it up and try this. I’ve been using for a month and am not super impressed. I am 30 with very few fine lines, this didn’t feel super hydrating, weirdly enough seems to enhance my very fine lines and doesn’t layer as well under makeup. Will be returning and switching back to my old trusty Chanel. just okay
