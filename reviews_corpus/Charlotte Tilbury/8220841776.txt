This moisturizer feels like a dream! It’s soft and honestly gives me rose petal vibes (without any scent). It’s not sticky & doesn’t leave a residue. It’s thick but almost melts when applying so you really don’t need to use a whole lot. Love that it has added hyaluronic acid (I can never get enough). Right off the bat my skin looked my hydrated and glowy (like that model skin look). I now use it all down my face, neck, chest, & my shoulders. This may have just replaced my regular moisturizer for all these reasons. nan
