Cream does an amazing job moisturizing my skin instantly! I loooooove the thick creamy texture a lot. It just glides on very smooth and perfect cream to use for mini massage. Although the cream instantly moisturizes my skin it didnâ€™t stay hydrated overnight for me. I have normal to dry skin , lives in Colorado! DRY weather! LOL... Rich creamy texture I LOVE!
