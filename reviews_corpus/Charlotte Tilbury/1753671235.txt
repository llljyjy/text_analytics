You can hardly ever go wrong with a Charlotte Tilbury product, the packaging itself is gorgeous! The cream is a bit on the thicker side which works great for my dry skin. I do advise to patch test if you have sensitive skin. This gave my skin a bit tingly sensation, I’m not quite sure why. Overall, a wonderful cream!! I wish her products weren’t so pricey!
