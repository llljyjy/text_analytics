I received this product complimentary from Influenster in return for my honest review.  First up this product is packaged beautifully.  The glass jar and gold lid looks expensive.  The cream itself is rich and smooth, spreads easily under the eyes and doesn’t pull on the skin.  I’ve worn this morning and night and find it pairs well with makeup.  Leaves my eye area feeling moisturized and glowing.  Hopefully with continued use I’ll see a change in dark circles and fine lines. nan
