I received the Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid as a gift from Charlotte Tilbury . This cream took me by surprise, it is one of those products that you automatically love. My skin is dry and I always look for products that moisturize it and this one has done a very good job. The skin is hydrated, luminous and beautiful. I also realized that this cream works great as a primer before makeup making it last longer. It is certainly a product that joins my list of favorites. nan
