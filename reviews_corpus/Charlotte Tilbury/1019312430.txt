5+++ stars. Amazing. Luxurious. And yes, absolute Magic. This is an amazing cream that is truly transforming! I cannot express enough how in love I am with this cream. I was skeptical at first, but it does live up to the hype, and then some. This cream is a light-medium texture (thicker than a gel, thinner than a standard cream), but it just glides onto and practically melts into your skin. Massage it in and around your face, and your skin will instantly look and feel moisturized and glowing. Best part is that the dewy glow makes your skin radiant, but it doesnâ€™t make it sticky or greasy. Matte makeup formulas work perfectly over this cream, applying with a smooth finish. I LOVE this cream, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. The ingredients all work together perfectly to support moisturized, supple skin that has an instant and noticeable difference. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review, but I can tell you that I am hooked and I will definitely be a repeat customer! 5+++ stars. Amazing, luxurious, magical cream.
