I am at a weird love hate relationship with this cream… leaning more on the love side of things.I love that you can just buy a refill pod! That is awesome. Less waste is what this world needs!But when it comes to the actual cream… I learned the Tilbury Tap, which is odd but a little more self love so why not? I have used a tiny bit up to “oh that was probably too much” when sampling through this product. My biggest complaint is no matter the amount you use, it feels greasy. Maybe this is just me? Maybe I need to use a little less and Tilbury Tap a bit more?So my takeaway after about 3 weeks is I do not mind it… but wish I did not feel like a plastered my face with sunscreen lotion. It is a really nice cream that does make your face feel a bit of extra moisture has been added. nan
