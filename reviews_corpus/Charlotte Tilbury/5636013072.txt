I didn’t love this product at first. In all honesty I have a facial serum from biossance that I adore but when I received this one for review it almost left my skin greasy. For months I’ve used the magic cream from CT as my moisturizer so when I started with this as my serum along with the magic cream it was an overload because my last serum absorbed a little better but I didn’t give up I kept using it over a couple of weeks and I’m glad I did because this serum is amazing. The serum and magic cream combo is a dream for dry skin but you have to be careful because a little goes a super long way with both products. The hydration you get from both is unreal. My skin is so fresh, soft, and a little dewy from the juicy hydration this product offers. The smell could be a little better but other than that the serum itself is so good especially for winter when dry skin is a real hassle. For dead of summer I think I want my biossance simply because it’s lighter on my skin but still I can’t recommend this enough if you have troublesome dry skin. I love that this formula is gentle and doesn’t sting like other serums I’ve tried. The only thing I don’t like is the price. My holy grail serum is cheaper and is as good if not better than this one. If the price was lower I might consider buying it myself because of how well it works in combination with the magic cream but for now this will be my winter go to and I’m happy that it’s in my skincare collection. Charlotte’s skincare never fails to amaze me!
