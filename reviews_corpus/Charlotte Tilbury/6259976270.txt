I would add this to my routine. I love how thick and creamy the texture of this product is. I also really like how it is unscented. Some things don’t bother me with being scented but eye cream is not one of those. It leaves a really healthy shimmer under your eyes when you apply the product and it looks so good. The only thing I don’t like is how slow it is to absorb into my skin. At night my under eye stays really greasy feeling for a long time. It gets on my pillowcase and in my hair. Would recommend
