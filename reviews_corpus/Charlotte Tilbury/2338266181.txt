This moisturizer feels luxurious! The packaging is beautiful, but it makes it look like there is more product than there really is. It has a slight “old lady” smell but it doesn’t last. My skin felt soft, not greasy or shiny. I do feel like I need to use more product to feel fully hydrated. Overall I would recommend for a light daily moisturizer! Soft and healthy skin!
