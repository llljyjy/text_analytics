I was looking forward to this because of Charlotte tilbury’s prestigious makeup line. The moisturizer is thick and does it’s job but I don’t know if I’d pay out of pocket for this. It’s good for this winter weather and as a base under really matte or drying makeup but I thought the jar would be bigger. Wish it was bigger
