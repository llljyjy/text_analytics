I understand why this is an award winning moisturizer! It is SO hydrating without being greasy and left me glowing. I have such trouble finding moisturizers for my dry winter skin that aren’t too heavy but also aren’t greasy/sticky and this one has been perfect so far. It’s smoothing and melts right into your skin and actually lasts all day! So amazing
