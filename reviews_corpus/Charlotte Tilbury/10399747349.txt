I’m so glad I got to try this for free in exchange for my honest review from Charlotte Tilbury and Influenster. This serum is absolutely magical! It left my face feeling moisturized and looking shiny and radiant. I definitely think this is a great thing to check out especially if you are looking for a product for anti-aging. I don’t know if I would recommend this to someone acne-prone, but otherwise this is a great product! Just apply this under your normal makeup routine or alone and you are ready to be the star that you are! Shiny star!!
