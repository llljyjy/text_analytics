This moisturizer feels thick coming out of the jar but it absorbs well and doesn’t feel heavy. It has a nice light fragrance and makes my skin feel smooth. I have sensitive skin so the ingredients in my skin care are important and I can use this product without without any problems. I like the ’Tilbury Tap’ Facial Technique (facial massage instructions) that’s written on the box for a great application. Overall I found this to be a great product and I would add it to my daily beauty routine. nan
