After giving Charlotte Tllbury Magic Eye Rescue a fair chance by using it for a month I can say it made little to no difference in my dark circles or puffiness under my eyes. The texture and scent were okay but I would not recommend this product based on my experience.  I received this item free from influenster. Not my favorite.
