I’ve been eyeing Charlotte Tilbury’s magic cream for so long, and this cream did not disappoint! Besides having stunning packaging that feels so luxurious, the cream also leaves my skin so hydrated and glowy. It works especially well under makeup too! Even though I have oily skin, I like it during the winter months because it makes my makeup look dewy and fresh. Luxurious and Refillable Packaging!
