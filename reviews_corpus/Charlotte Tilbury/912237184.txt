I wasn’t expecting much from this cream,.as insuually don’t have good experiences with “celebrity mua“ type skin products. But this is different. I finally cracked one night because my skin was irritated by my usual murad retinol... And I wanted something that looked soothing. I couldn’t believe the difference in my skin when I woke up. I now exclusively use this product and have also ordered the night cream and the eye cream. It’s totally changed my skin and I’ve only been using it for about 2 weeks. Pleasantly surprised!
