Unfortunately, after using this for 3 months, I have not really noticed any visible improvement in my dark under eye circles. I will say that you get your bang for your buck with regard to product amount. Have been using since January and still have a very good amount left. But it’s just not having the effect I hoped for. Sadly no results…
