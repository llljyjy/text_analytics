So let’s do pro’s and con’s and everything in between. The good things about this primer are that it is great at hydrating, absorbs quickly, and didn’t irritate my sensitive skin. But on the other hand I didn’t notice it do too much besides provide some temporary hydration. I used it consistently but didn’t really see much difference in my skin not to mention it sometimes pilled depending on what moisturizer I put on top. The in between would be that I seem to be greating a few breakouts recently, which normally doesn’t happen, however I don’t know if this serum is to blame or not so just beware. For the price I think there are better serums out there that’ll do more honestly. (I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion.) Eh…
