I have been using this moisturizer for a little over 2 weeks now and am absolutely in love with the results I am seeing. I take skincare very seriously and have a complex routine that I follow, so I am always a bit hesitant when trying out any new skincare product. The magic cream moisturizer truly lives up to its name. It includes 8 research powered oils and ingredients that create a more dewy and youthful appearance to the skin in a short period of time but for long term results. It is extremely hydrating and has made my skin feel truly refreshed and rejuvenated.I love the natural scent it carries, and the formula of the moisturizer is thick so a little goes a long way, it sets into the skin beautifully and is easy to apply makeup over knowing there is a layer of hydration resting underneath. One of the best parts of this product to me is the fact that you can get 20% off your next order when you shop the refillable option, I love any company that strives for more sustainable options. Overall, this product is giving a new life to my skin, and I am loving the results Iâ€™ve had in short period of time. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a moisturizer that also provides anti-aging results! Super hydrating!
