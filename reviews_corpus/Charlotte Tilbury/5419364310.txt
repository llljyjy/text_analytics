Obviously I am obsessed with any and all CT products cause who isn’t, but this magic cream seriously IS magic. It’s the perfect amount of thickness without being like gooey, it absorbs so well and feels velvety smooth when applying. I have super dry skin plus I’m aging (gross), and am constantly trying new moisturizers to find the best suited for me. I truly haven’t found anything better than the magic cream. It wears really well under makeup and I feel like it provides a very long wearing moisture if that makes sense. It has barely any fragrance and just feels really fresh. I love it, highly recommended. Why is this so amazing?!
