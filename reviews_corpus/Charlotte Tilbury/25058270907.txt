I received Charlotteâ€™s Magic cream for free in exchange for my honest review. Magic cream is a lovely moisturizer. It has niacinamide as a main ingredient which is amazing for improving pores, texture, fine lines and more. The cream is very thick so a little goes a long way. It has a mild rose scent that fades after about an hour. My sensitive acne prone skin loves this moisturizer. I have been using it as my exclusive moisturizer morning and at night for the last couple weeks so I could write an honest review. Definitely recommend and will buy again! nan
