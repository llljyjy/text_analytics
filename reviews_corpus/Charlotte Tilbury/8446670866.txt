***Disclaimer I received these products for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review.***The product is not too overwhelming for the skin even in hot Texas weather. I am so excited that I was able to try this product and really enjoy it!  I think this product will be best for those who have dry skin and donâ€™t really have a skincare routine yet.  This is a great product to add moisture to your skin and its easy to use.  I personally loved the way my makeup sits on top of this product. It helped everything just bond for a smoother finish.  I also enjoyed the scent on this its like a clean scent with a hint of soft florals. Furthermore, I loved that the bottle and dropper are both made of glass. Magic
