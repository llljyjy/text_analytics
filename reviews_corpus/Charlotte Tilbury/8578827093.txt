First off, the packaging of this product is absolutely beautiful. I really enjoy the dropper as it makes it easier to know how much product you’re getting out. I’ve been using this religiously twice a day before my moisturizer and it has definitely helped my skin look more flawless, softer, and brighter. 10/10 recommend! Love!!!
