This is a fine cream. I got a bunch of 100 point perks of this cream when Sephora had them. I just think for truly dry skin it isn’t enough. I always find my skin getting dry and tight after an hour or so of having this on. Maybe better for normal/combo skin that like a glow. Feels nice going on and isn’t heavy but I much prefer the JLO beauty Blockbuster cream over this. That cream is incredible and they share similarities but the JLO keeps my skin comfortable all day and I see more skin benefits from the Blockbuster cream. Not enough for dry skin
