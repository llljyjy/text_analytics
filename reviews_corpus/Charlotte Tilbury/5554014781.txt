I’ve been using this serum for a few days now, and I really like it! I noticed an immediate difference in the suppleness and moisture in my skin, and it doesn’t look greasy at all. The only thing I didn’t like is that it’s a little thicker than some other serums I use, and so it took a bit longer to soak into my skin. Overall, I’d purchase for myself! Noticeable difference!
