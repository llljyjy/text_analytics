I was very excited to try this Charlotte Tilbury Magic cream moisturizer because I have heard so many great things about it. I was skeptical because I’ve tried so many different kinds. However, I was so delighted when I used this magic moisturizer. It was cool and silky on my skin. A small amount goes a long way too. It felt so pleasant. It was not a heavy cream that weighed me down. It was light and my skin felt quenched after applying it. After using it for several days consecutively  I can honestly say I definitely see and feel a major difference in my skin. It’s noticeably firmer and brighter. I am in love with this stuff! Best moisturizer out there!
