One thing that really stands out about Magic Cream is the texture, it transforms upon application,  and usually when a cream feels this lux and hydrating, it leaves residue on my skin, but Magic Cream soaks right in.  My skin is sensitive and tends to run dry so I seek out products containing hyaluronic acid, and Magic Cream couples it with ingredients to brighten and smooth.  I mostly wear this on itâ€™s own, and as a new mom it is soooo helpful to have a moisturizer that makes my face look less exhausted than I feel! Great for sensitive skin
