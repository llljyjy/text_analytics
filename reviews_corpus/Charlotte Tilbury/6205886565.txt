I liked how hydrating it is, and how the packaging makeseverything feels and looks so expensive, which it is, but Ididn’t like how there wasn’t much of a difference whenapplying this eye cream on. It didn’t depuff my under eyes, didn’t brightened my under eyes, and it’s a bit heavy. I don’t think I’ll repurchase. nan
