I received this product for free as a sample and to give an honest review of the product.  Being I already use Charlotte Tilbury foundation and love it, I figured I would love this product as well.  I was NOT DISAPPOINTED at all, in fact I am beyond happy with this product.  There is an immediate difference to the feel of your skin after using this moisturizer.  It is not greasy and feels light on the skin.  My face felt so smooth and my makeup went on smoothly as well and lasted all day long.  After exfoliating my face and using the next day, it was even more amazing to feel my skin.  I really really like this product and am looking to purchase more products from the Charlotte Tilbury line! Amazing Product!
