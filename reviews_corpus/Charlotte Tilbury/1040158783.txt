Got a sample size of this, and really enjoy it, but not quite worth the $$$$ to me.  Light rose scent is lovely.  Texture is an almost paste-like cream (but not grainy at all), but it goes on so smoothly and absorbs gorgeously.  Feels fantastic on my skin.  Love it, and wish it were priced so I could make it my regular, but I’ll keep looking for that holy grail… V nice but pricey
