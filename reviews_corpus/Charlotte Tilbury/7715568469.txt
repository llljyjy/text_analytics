This product is way over-hyped imo. It’s not a bad product but the fragrance is almost unbearable. It would be more enjoyable to use if it wasn’t so heavily scented(like old woman’s perfume and baby powder). The cream itself is good, but it’s certainly not “magic”. $40 for this would be reasonable. $100 is a ridiculous price tag for a full size. Just okay
