I love! I repeat: I love magic cream! I have owned this before and am so excited that I have it back in my life. I personally have dry and sensitive skin and this cream helps with the dryness without breaking me out. It does have a subtle scent, which doesnâ€™t bother me though. It is definitely a more heavy weight cream so keep that in mind. But it works great underneath my makeup! Obsessed!!! Dry & sensitive skin!
