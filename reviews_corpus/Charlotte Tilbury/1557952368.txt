I received this item free for review and have been using it for a little over a month now pretty much every night. I have tried other Charlotte Tilbury products in the past and have always been a big fan. I love the benefits of vitamin c in this product and they combo perfectly with the retinol night cream that I use. The serum smells amazing and really helps the overall texture of my skin. Will definitely repurchase. Love this serum
