Beautiful serum! Leaves skin feeling well nourished, hydrated, and smooth. There’s absolutely no unusual or harsh smell to the product. The price is the only thing im not crazy about. The finish it has after rubbing it into the skin is stunning. The skin looks glowy and healthy. It sinks into the skin and leaves no weird residue or stickiness. It hydrates the skin no matter what texture you have. My sensitive skin absolutely loves it! After adding it into my skin care routine I’ve definitely noticed a difference in my fine lines and how non visible they are now. I recommend trying but wait for a sale :) nan
