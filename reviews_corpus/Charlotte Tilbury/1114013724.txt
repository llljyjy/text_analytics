This is my first time trying Charlotte Tilbury so I was excited to see if it was worth all the hype!  The packaging is quality, and the jar is so pretty on my vanity! It is lightly scented (smells like roses, which I love!), but the scent fades quickly if you’re sensitive to smells.  The cream is thick without feeling heavy, and melts in to your skin as you apply it. I normally have oily/combination skin, and was worried this may be too heavy for me, but it feels lightweight and not at all greasy once I’ve let it soak in.  So far, I haven’t noticed a dramatic change in the look and feel of my skin, but I love the packaging, smell, and texture, and look forward to seeing how it works with more time.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend who wants to try something new! nan
