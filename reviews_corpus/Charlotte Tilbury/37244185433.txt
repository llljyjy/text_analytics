I’ve received the Magic Eye Rescue Cream for my honest review. This cream has rich and smooth texture, gives instant hydration to my under eye area.My eyes area have been very moisturized and look less tired. I’d love to use it in the morning with thin layer 10 minutes before my make up application. Love it for helping my eyes look less tired
