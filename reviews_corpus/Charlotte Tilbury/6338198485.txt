This is definitely one of the fanciest moisturizers on my bathroom counter… but not sure if it’s worth the high price tag for what’s actually inside the jar. It is a very luxurious-feeling cream that feels great on my skin, but there are plenty of other products that perform similarly at a lower cost. This definitely gives a glowy appearance, but in a Zoom call world, looks very greasy on camera. nan
