Let me start my saying that I NEVER get breakouts. I’m not at all acne prone, and feel lucky to have such clear skin. I also rarely react to new products...however one use of this serum and I woke up the next day to two big pimples (one on my forehead and one in between my eyebrows). I didn’t notice any improvement to my makeup application either that day. Needless to say, any benefit is DEFINITELY not worth the pimples. Sample going in the trash! nan
