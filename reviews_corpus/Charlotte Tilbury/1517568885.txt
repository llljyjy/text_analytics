I wanted to like this serum, but unfortunately I started breaking out with some raised bumps after about 2 weeks. My skin cleared up shortly after I stopped using this product. I wanted to like it, as I really liked the texture of the product. And it sounded like something my skin needed, but it just didnâ€™t work for me. Not great for sensitive skin
