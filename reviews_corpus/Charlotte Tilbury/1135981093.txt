Charlotte’s Magic Cream is a beautiful product.  I love the packaging and the cream is luxurious.  It has a creamy consistency and it came with a packet of the Charlotte’s Magic Serum Crystal Elixir.  This moisturizer smooths and blends into my skin nicely.  It absorbs well without leaving my skin looking greasy.  I like that the packing includes detailed instructions for applying the product using the ‘Tilbury Tap’ Facial Technique facial massage.  I saw results after my first day using the cream with my day and night skincare routine.  My skin looked relaxed and plump.  Before using it my skin looked like it needed a me up and the magic cream did the trick.  A little goes a long way but I will be buying more when I run out.  I truly enjoy using this product.  I highly recommend giving it a try. Beautiful Results
