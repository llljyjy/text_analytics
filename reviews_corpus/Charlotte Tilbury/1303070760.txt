This moisturizer is very emollient to touch,  feels more luxurious.  It seems that is would be great for dryer skin, I have more combination. After applying for a few days and nights on dry and freshly cleansed skin, I felt no difference. My skin didnâ€™t look any smoother or hydrated. I have used less expensive products with better results . Overhyped
