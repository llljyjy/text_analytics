I feel compelled to write this review for the sole purpose of an utterly honest experience. However, I have dry to combination skin, I think the formula is just okay with combating dry skin. It didn’t give me a glow or anything when I apply it at night and wake up in the morning. That’s just my personal experience, tbh. And I cannot get over the smell, it reminds me of a chemical bug spray. This is not a cheap product. I kept using it only because of the good faith that a product takes time to work. Grant it, it’s lasted a good while but, I wouldn’t replenish this product in the future. I would give it a honest 6/10. It was okay, not the best.
