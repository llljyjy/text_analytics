I was looking for bridal makeup. A store associate told me to try this so, I got a sample. My skin gets very dry around my T zone. This has made my face so soft and hydrated. I tested it under makeup, leaves my skin super glowy and dewy. I ended getting the full size. The fragrance ppl are complaining about doesn’t bother me. It is not strong at all. Smells like skincare..it’s not like a super in your face scent. It’s not greasy, it’s thick, and it’s great under makeup or on top of a serum. I like it and I would recommend. Hydrating
