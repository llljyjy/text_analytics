I started using the Magic Eye Cream that I received for free from Influenster on July 6th, for my honest review, and instantly saw a difference in my dark circles. It took longer to notice a difference in the wrinkles but as I used this product more, the least noticeable my wrinkles have gotten, specially on the sides of my eyes. I wish it worked on puffiness, but atleast it is something that they did not advertise that it does. I highly recommend this product. Magical
