I received this complimentary for review. I’m 42 years old and my skin is very dry. This cream is thick, creamy and a little goes a long way. It’s important to allow the moisturizer to penetrate the skin before adding makeup, otherwise the product will dry up and ball under your makeup when applying. Overall happy with this. Skin so smooth
