This is a nice moisturizing cream! It has a pleasant scent and a mousse-y texture that sinks into the skin super fast. I think the packaging is very luxe-looking and pretty to look at. I think the price is more expensive than I would personally pay, but itâ€™s an enjoyable moisturizer that I use at night before bed. It leaves my skin feeling plump and soft. nan
