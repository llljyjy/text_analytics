I was so excited to receive this Charlotte Tilbury Charlotte’s Magic Cream! First off, the packaging is beautiful and I love that it’s refillable. The glass jar is beautiful on a vanity and just looks luxurious. The cream itself is very thick, but sinks in quickly and doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. I will warn that this product has an intense rose scent. The scent does fade (or my nose acclimates) fairly quickly, but upon initial application I find the scent to be really strong. As someone who is not a fan of rose scented products (or heavily scented items in general), this was a negative for me.While I liked the way the cream applied, and it did feel like a luxurious treat, I have to admit that I didn’t feel like it did anything special for my skin. My face did feel adequately moisturized, but I didn’t see or feel any “magic“. I truly wanted to love it, but overall was somewhat underwhelmed based on the claims and price. Good moisturizer in luxurious packaging
