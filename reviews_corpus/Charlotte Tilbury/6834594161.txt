From the packaging to the consistency of this cream, very high quality. The cream is nice and thick, definitely not watery or runny. Cream has a very faint, fresh fragrance. Hyaluronic acid has become a necessary component of any facial moisturizers I use, especially my night cream. Vitamin E and rose hip oil are welcome additions. At one time I was using a vitamin E serum, rose hip oil, and hyaluronic acid cream and this one cream has it all! Anti-aging properties (never too early to think about this) on top of all of this?! Really is magic! nan
