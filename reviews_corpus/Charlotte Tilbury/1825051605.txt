Smells like roses for those that like that smell. Not overwhelming for those that donâ€™t, like my self. I do appreciate the fact this cream isnt oily. It seems to absorb fairly quickly and doesnt take very much product. I have oily skin and was hesitant, but it has really seemed to keep the oils in my skin under control. Kudos to that! Ok, gurrlll
