I’ve been using this serum for a few weeks now and I definitely seen some improvement in my skin. My dark spots are noticeably lighter and my skin does look healthier and more radiant than it did before. I haven’t seen any difference in fine lines yet but my skin does look more supple. The biggest difference has been in my skin tone. This serum does go on nicely and sinks in pretty quickly. I use it under my moisturizer at night. Works
