I was gifted this eye cream in exchange of my honest review. Lately, I’ve been taking care of my skin way more than I used to, to the point that I’ve build an AM and PM routine. I used to wear retinol eye creams/ serums before, but I try to only use it during the evening since retinol can make your skin a bit more sensitive when exposed the sun (and in FL it’s always sunny!) When I received this eye cream I decided to incorporate it on my PM routine. The contianer is absolutely beautiful and classy. The product itself is very lightweight and has a subtle smell (pleasantly). When applied to the skin, it feels smooth, hydrating, and very soft to touch. You can see the difference in the eye area after applying it constantly. This cream has added a natural shine and diminished my dark circles a little bit in a matter of 6 days, so I’m optimistic that by the end of week 4, the difference will be more noticeable. I would definitely recommend this product for your PM routine is you are seeking for a product that will diminish your dark circles and will improve your skin appearance on that area. PERFECTION
