For starters, I’d actually never tried anything from Charlotte Tilbury before now. I’ve always been interested, but I had a hard time coughing up that kind of money on a brand I wasn’t familiar with. So, when I received the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Elixir, I was super stoked to get acquainted with the brand. The serum itself feels really nice on the skin. It’s not thick or tacky, and absorbs rather quickly. It also has a soft, delicate fragrance to it. Typically, I try to stay away from fragrances skincare as it’s just not necessary and has the potential to cause irritation, but the fragrance in this was non irritating and was also not overwhelmingly strong. If you’re familiar with the BareMinerals SkinLongevity Long Life Herb Serum, it is eerily similar. Like almost exact between the feel and scent. When using this serum, I just applied a few drops to my face before applying my moisturizer, and it seemed to play well with all of my other products in my skincare lineup. I used the entire bottle over the course of a month, and that was with conservatively sized amounts at each application, so it may not be a realistic product to add to your lineup if you’re budget conscious. Overall, I’m satisfied with the results this serum gave me. My skin did feel softer and less texturized. It also gave me a very healthy glow and did not irritate my skin whatsoever.
