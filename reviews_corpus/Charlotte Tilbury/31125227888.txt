I’ve been looking for a really good moisturizer lately because my skin gets so dry during the winter months. This Charlotte Tilbury is the best one I’ve tried so far! It’s creamy and dissolves nicely into the skin, and gives me a dewy/glowy look that’s perfect under my makeup! There’s no harsh fragrance and the packaging is is stunning (as is always the case with CT products!) Charlotte Does It Again!!!
