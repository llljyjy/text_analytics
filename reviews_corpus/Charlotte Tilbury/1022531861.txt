I am surprised how much I love this set, and how indulgent it feels  to use it. A tiny amount does your whole face, and when you get done, your face is really clean. Not only that, but my skin tone looks more even, my pores look smaller, and I feel like I’ve really done something good for myself. The muslin cloth is wonderful as an exfoliator and cleanser removal tool. When you consider how many uses you will get out of this set, I don’t really feel that it is overpriced. It’s a quality product. I feel like I will buy this over and over again. If you’ve been thinking about it, go for it! You'll feel like a Goddess!
