Really excited to receive this product from Influenster. I always like a rich creamy texture when it comes to eye creams. This Charlotte tilbury Magic Eye Rescue has the perfectly rich but not too heavy entire that moisturizes the under eye so well! It leaves a glow on the skin once massaged in. I use this eye cream at night and the Summer Friday eye cream in the morning for a lighter feeling. So far I really enjoy this product but probably need more use to see the results from retinol. Decent product for the price! Great moisturizing eye cream
