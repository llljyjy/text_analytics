As a professional makeup artist and skincare specialist, I am really impressed after using the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Serum Crystal Elixir. I was given this serum complimentary for my honest opinion. This serum includes Golden Vitamin C for a brighter-looking complexion, and hydration powerhouse Polyglutamic Acid – a supercharged skincare ingredient that’s over 4X more hydrating than Hyaluronic Acid. After using this serum my skin feels soft, radiant, plump and very hydrated. It is definitely the serum my skin needed and was perfect for my combination skin! Really impressed with the Crystal Elixir Serum!
