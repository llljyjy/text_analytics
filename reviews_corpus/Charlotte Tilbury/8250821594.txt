At first I thought I liked this serum but then I started to breakout and I am 99% sure it was this serum because I do not have sensitive skin and once I stopped using it, my face cleared up. Even without that, this serum felt just okay, skin looked a little tighter and brighter after using it but Iâ€™ve used better serums that cost less money and better serums that are in the same price bracket. All in all, I am grateful to Influenster and Charlotte Tilberry for the opportunity to try this product but unfortunately I would not purchase this product since it made me break out. Made me break out :(
