I was super excited when I found out that I was going to be receiving this elixir to test out. I have never tried Charlotte Tilbury products before, but have always heard great things. I have been using this elixir after my cleanser and before my moisturizer in the morning and evening. It goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel soft as soon as I apply it. It also gives me a nice glow. I love how the dropper is angled, as all of my other serums have the straight dropper. If I continue seeing the same results with extended use, I would definitely purchase this item in the future. Glowing skin serum
