So guess what magic is real, like unicorns, fairy godmothers and this amazing cream that have made my skin actually look gorgeous during/post New England winters. My skin is totally dry, itchy and absolutely not glowing after this season with just a touch of the magic cream it brings my skin back to life. My skin loves this stuff, literally drinks it in and looks phenomenal afterwords without any comedogenic issues. I am not sure how I’m going to live without it ever again. A must have y’all….you’re face will thank you over and over. I received this product for my honest review from Charlotte Tillbury and influester. Do you believe in unicorns? Or fairy godmothers?
