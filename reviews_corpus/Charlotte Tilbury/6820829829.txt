Oh no, I love this. It’s so expensive and I was hoping it wasn’t anything special.. 90% of eye creams give me me milia, this one does not!! It smoothed the under eye so nicely and works well underneath Make-up!! And I am also loving that it contains retinol! The texture is like soft butter ..so in conclusion, it’s soft, brightening, smoothing, amazing under concealer, it works! I received this one for free from Influenster but there is a high chance of me repurchasing it with my own money!! amazing
