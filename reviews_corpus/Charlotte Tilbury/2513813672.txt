First, the product looks beautiful upon opening. I like the dispenser. Easy to use. Nice heavy glass (I did accidentally drop it and, it didn’t break). Smells divine. It smells exactly like the Disney Cruise Line. Clean, not overpowering, and not migraine inducing.I’ve been using it for a few weeks and it does make it easier to apply make up. Skin looks great under it. It does seems to plump skin nicely. I didn’t notice much difference in fine lines, but will use it a bit longer. Might be a just a little higher than my typical price point, but I might consider purchasing again.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review by Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury. Smells good & Skin Plumps
