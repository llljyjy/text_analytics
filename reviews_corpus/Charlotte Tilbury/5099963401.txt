This is a must have product in your make up bag. I have never owned a Charlotte Tillberry product but this was a game changer. The added bonus of hyaluronic acid is amazing and really shows on your skin. I have a very problematic an acne prone skin so I am always nervous to use new products on my skin but this was amazing. Right from the first day and today which has been almost a month, it has shown me nothing but positive results. My skin is glowing! I have never posted a photo with no make up but now I do  and it says a lot about the product. It has completely changed my skin care game. First I used to load my skin with a lot of layers but now vitamin C and the magic cream during the day and retinal and the magic cream at night does the job great! Will highly recommend to all . Bonus points on how good it smells, almost like and I Ayurvedic product. Must have.. game changer!
