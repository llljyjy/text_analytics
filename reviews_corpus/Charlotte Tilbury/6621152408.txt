I received this serum in exchange for my honest opinion from Influenster. I was delighted to receive it because I love Charlotte Tilbury and skincare. The glass bottle is so elegant and luxe. I love the dropper because it makes for easy and mess free application. The size of the bottle is generous. The serum itself is lovely and applies onto the skin easily and absorbs quickly. It leaves a dewy, glowy sheen on the skin that is natural and radiant. I like to apply it before my makeup or wear it on its own both morning and evening for a no makeup glow. Glowing to the heavens!
