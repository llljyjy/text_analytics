I had a baby 2 months ago & I’m dealing with my skin changing. If you have dry skin this has helped me so much! I put this oil on before doing my makeup and wow what a difference it’s made. Since my skin is so dry my makeup would crack & I didn’t like how I felt or looked. This has changed how I feel going through my postpartum changes. Note: only apply very little (a little goes along way) Game changer!
