Bought the mini travel size to make sure my skin agreed with it and I’m obsessed !! I have acne prone skin so I was worried about it having a fragrance but I haven’t had a single break out. It leaves my skin looking so hydrated and healthy, and feels amazing! Absolutely give it a try ! Worth the hype
