This cream is a dream. I love the way it leaves my skin feeling. When they call this a magic cream, they aren’t lying to you. It’s a beautiful product and I like to use it as my day moisturizer with a couple drops of facial oil mixed in with it to leave me looking glowing and dewy. Loving this moisturizer
