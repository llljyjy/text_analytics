Since receiving it from Sephora, I’ve used this a few times, and I’m pretty happy with my purchase. I don’t use the Charlotte Tilbury skincare, and I don’t think that really matters. It promises tighter pores, revived, firmer and softer skin after a single use and honestly, I didn’t really see that difference. My skin was softer, and I think it’s because it presses your moisturizer into your skin and prevents it from evaporating as it absorbs. I recommend putting it in the freezer before using it, not the fridge, so it stays colder longer. I like the sensation, so I will continue to use it, but it’s not a miracle, just a fun gimmick. Nothing really special, but I do enjoy it
