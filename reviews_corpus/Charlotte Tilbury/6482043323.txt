Overpowering scent, left an oily film on my face and I would always look like a grease ball by the end of the day. I used it consistently for two weeks and I starting breaking out on my cheeks and my jawline, and when i stopped using it my face went back to normal. It has a couple of pore clogging ingredients like shea butter. sometimes i’ll use it as a primer for matte foundations, also been using it on my body and legs just to get my moneys worth out of it. but if you’re looking for an everyday face moisturizer i would look for something else. Overpriced and not worth the hype!
