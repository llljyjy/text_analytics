I received Charlotte’s Magic serum crystal elixer free from Influenster in exchange for my honest thoughts.  It comes in a beautiful glass bottle, with a nice lines design on the bottom. The applicator is unique as it’s slanted towards you. Six drops is all you need to cover your entire face, I noticed the moisture as soon as I put the first drop on my face. Once I massaged it around to cover the rest of my face I noticed the moisture feeling throughout my entire face. It dried quickly though which was nice. After just a little time I noticed my face felt like it was being slightly pulled, almost as if it had a little invisible glue feeling. I feel over time I will definitely notice firmer tighter reduced wrinkles. I look forward to this now being a part of my daily routine. Charlotte’s magic serum
