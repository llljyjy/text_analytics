I love the idea of refillable options. Saves on waste. I swear thereâ€™s more product in the refill tub compared to how much comes in the orginal jar. Only downside is that the refill tub WILL NOT FIT in orginal jar. I pried out the tub that came inside of the jar & everything & trust me the refill tub is larger. Just scoop the product from the refill tub in to the original jar w a clean spatula. The short empty plastic tub pictured below is what came out of my empty jar. Note how much taller the refill tub is thus making it impossible to place in glass jar & screw on the lid. Excellent just too big to fit in orginal jar.
