I received this cream for free to test out and I honestly fell in love with it. I’ve always had pretty bad dark circles (even in like middle school lol) and I always thought I was just  stuck with them because eye creams didn’t seem to lighten them at all. However, I’ve been using this for less than 2 weeks once a day at night time and my circles have started to lighten! They also look super glowy. This is expensive but it works so in my opinion it’s worth the splurge! (Especially with afterpay lol) also a little dot is all it takes for one eye so I feel like this will last me months if not a year. 10/10 shocked & obsessed
