First off, I’d like to talk about the packaging of this product: it is beautiful! Now about the product itself… I’m in awe. This moisturizer is so rich and creamy. I prefer to use it as a night cream so it soaks in my skin. My skin does not feel greasy, instead it feels dewy and plump. Keeping this as part of my skin routine. nan
