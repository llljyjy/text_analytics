This product does a great job to hydrate and brighten. I did get little blemishes the first week of use, but I believe those were impurities coming out. After the first week, my skin was flawless and glowing. It didn’t do anything to my pores however. It’s a very lightweight and smooth serum, and goes great under make up or alone. nan
