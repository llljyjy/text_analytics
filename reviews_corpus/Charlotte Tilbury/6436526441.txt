I have been wanting to try Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid for quite some time! I’ve heard great things, plus the packaging is just so beautiful! Not only does the elegant glass pot with gold top look lovely on my vanity, this moisturizer is wonderful! It’s very hydrating though it feels lightweight and absorbs quickly.  It doesn’t feel greasy or tacky and instantly gives you a glow! It plays well with makeup and smells lovely! Very luxe and hydrating
