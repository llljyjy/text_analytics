I was really hoping that I would be blown away by this cream that I could justify the expense. It is VERY expensive. This is a no for me. No matter how much I would use; it would leave a greasy layer on the top of my face. When I say greasy, I mean if you have a squeaky wheel that you need to oil. You could take a rag to my face and get a enough to make that squeaky wheel go away. It does nothing magical for my skin. This is definitely a purchase I regret. I highly do NOT recommend if you have a similar skin type to me. For reference, I have combo skin (Oily t-zone / dry cheeks). nan
