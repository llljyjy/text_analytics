A friend gave me her tub as it didn’t work for her skin. I’m almost finished the tub myself and it’s absolutely not doing anything for me. She felt it dried her out and I’ve tried it with different serums underneath and it just doesn’t do anything. And my skin loves hyaluronic acid but this is not helpful. Grateful I didn’t pay for it or else I would have returned it if I spent my own money for it Not magical at all
