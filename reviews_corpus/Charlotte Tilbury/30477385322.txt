I like the way this cream feels on my skin, and I like the process recommended for application. The packaging is pretty, but I didn’t like the box. There was so much text on it, and the way it opened was odd. I do wish the container was glass instead of plastic. While I do like this cream, I felt like I needed quite a bit relative to how much product is in the pot. Because of this, I don’t think it will last that long with my dry skin, which is disappointing, especially at this price point. I don’t think I really saw any wrinkle/fine line reduction either, so this cream is just kind of seems like a general face cream. Not really anything “magic” about it for me.
