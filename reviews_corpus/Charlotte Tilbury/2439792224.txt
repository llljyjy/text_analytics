I was kindly #gifted Charlotte’s Magic Cream by @charlottetilbury and @influenster in exchange for my honest review.Charlotte Tibury’s Magic Cream has a lovely texture that is silky and lightweight. The cream has a very faint pleasant scent that does fade quickly.My skin definitely absorbed the cream nicely. I have been seeing more improvements in my skin’s texture as I have started to apply this in the AM and PM. I have also noticed that my skin stays plump for longer with consistent use. I love that this cream contains ingredients like BioNymph Peptide, hyaluronic acid, rosehip oil, shea butter and vitamins C and E. It also contains camellia oil, aloe vera and frangipani flower extract.This oil-infused formula contains SPF15 as well. So you will need to use an SPF afterwards.Overall I am really happy with the cream itself and my results! I highly recommend you try this out soon Simply Magical
