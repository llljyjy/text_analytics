First time trying an oil as a step in my skin prep before applying makeup. I tend to have oily skin but I get dry patches around acne and on my forehead. This stuff is MAGICAL. Like so hydrating but didn’t make my skin feel gross or make my makeup slip off. My skin is pretty sensitive and I didn’t break out from this or react to it. Definitely a new favorite of mine!! amazing!!!
