Soooo luxurious! I am totally obsessed with this magic potion. I love that they call it a broth lol, so cute. The texture is amazingly smooth it’s really almost more like a serum, and it goes on perfectly silky and beautiful. Absorbs quickly and wears super well under makeup. I have dry very sensitive skin and this product felt incredible on. Not greasy at all. I love it so much I don’t want to waste a single drop. One thousand out of ten approve and recommend! Gorgeous hydrating silky smooth magic
