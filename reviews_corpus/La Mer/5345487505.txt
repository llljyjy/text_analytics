I’ve recently added in the LA Mer treatment lotion into my daytime skincare ritual after cleansing and toning in place of a serum. The consistency is more serum like rather than lotion to me so it made since to add in at thar point. So far, it’s been a lovely addition.  My skin has been looking and feeling great. nan
