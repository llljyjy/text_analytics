A little if this goes a LONG way! Use this as a primer for my other skincare steps and it feels like it helps my serums absorb better. I’m newish to essences so I can’t say 1000% this is necessary but I’m into it. Sleek packaging but the price is up there. If you want to splurge- go for it but there more affordable alternatives.
