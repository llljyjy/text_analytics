nice looking packaging but not practical. No Pump and I find it cumbersome to unscrew the cap and pour out onto a cotton pad. It works, takes off the makeup as any micellar water and honestly I would repurchase and give 4 stars if It wasn’t for the stinging, it STINGS. I don’t have sensitive skin or eyes but wow. Something that goes this close to the eyes shouldn’t sting. LOVE the cleansing oil from La mer just OK and stings
