I am in the fence with this product. This product was the first I’ve used from La Mer. The first thing that makes me have mixed feelings is the smell. It’s definitely a mature smell that reminds me of a perfume an older relative would wear. The second thing is that after application in the face, it gets quite sticky. That sticky feeling remains for a few minutes. When apply the rest of my skin care afterwards, the sticky news persists. Then there is the price. I am not sure with all these cons if the benefits are worth it. I’ll continue to use the product but I will not be repurchasing. nan
