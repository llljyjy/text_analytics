I love this moisturizer! After years of reading amazing reviews for this moisturizer, I finally took the plunge and shelled out for this duet set. At this price point, I was hoping for a miracle, and these little jars delivered! I live in Hawaii and have fair skin, so I have been struggling to find a moisturizer that works without being excessively heavy or greasy. This is it. I love how soft my skin feels after using it, there’s no greasy residue like with some moisturizers, and I have been getting nonstop compliments about my skin. All of my friends and colleagues are asking what I’m using to get such glowing, healthy skin, and the only thing I’ve done different is this moisturizer. I’m hooked. I’ll never go back to any other products. Just Buy It!
