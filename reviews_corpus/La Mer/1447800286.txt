This cream may be a miracle for some people, but it was definitely not for me. I used it for over 2 months. I have had the worst breakouts that I have had since I was a teenager. The “anti-aging” effects were minimal. It smells like a drugstore lotion (not awful just not amazing). On a positive note, the small jar did last a long time. I was only half way through it when I stopped  using it. Please save your money. nan
