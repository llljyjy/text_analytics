This treatment lotion is like an essence. After cleansing, I carefully pour a quarter size amount into my hands and gently pat onto my face and neck. The texture is a bit thick and not too watery which is nice. It allows me to apply the product without it slipping through my fingers. If you have ever tried the Fenty Fat Water Toner - the consistency is the same. Afterwards, I follow up with the rest of my skincare routine. I do feel that this helps my products penetrate better and allows my skin to not have that tight dry feeling after cleansing. It adds moisture back into the skin. Overnight and through the day, I do feel a difference in how soft and supple my skin feels. Feels like Fenty Fat Water but Hydrating!
