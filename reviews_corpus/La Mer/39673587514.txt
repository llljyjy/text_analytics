Lamer eye concentrate is definitely a game changer for me.I suffer from dark circles from a very young age and none of the products seem to be really helping a lot. This one really helps with dark circles. I’ve been noticing improvement in my wrinkles and fine lines as well. It’s a pricey product but I think it’s worth it for the results nan
