At first, I laughed at the reviews of people claiming this made their skin breakout. However, after ~45 days of use (while I loved the texture, smell, and feeling of the cream after applying) my skin quickly became more oily and I began noticing acne like I was a teenager again. In the week or so since switching this out of my routine, that acne has disappeared. I love La Mer, but this product just doesnâ€™t work with my skin. Love La Mer, but this caused oily skin and acne.
