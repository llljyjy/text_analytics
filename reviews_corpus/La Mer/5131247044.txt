I received a trial of the La Mer moisturizing cream. At first I was so excited to try this because a lot of reviews said it is great for dry skin and rosacea. Iâ€™m giving this one star due to the extremely strong bad smell and my face felt drier after I put it on. The moisturizer was thick, as described in the other reviews and I felt it was hard use. Just disappointing that it is not what I thought. The worst part I can not get past is the smell. Not what I thought - Disappointment
