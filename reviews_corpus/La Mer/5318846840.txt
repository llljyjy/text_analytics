This moisturizing gel cream is absolutely wonderful! The formula is very lightweight and slightly cooling when applied to the skin. A little goes a long way with this product and it keeps my skin feeling comfortable and hydrated all day! There is a light powdery fragrance to but it does disappear after just a few minutes of wear. After just one week of use my skin feels and looks amazing! The price point is a little high in comparison to other gel creams but I really do see a difference in my skin! Skin looks amazing!
