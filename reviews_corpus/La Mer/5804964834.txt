I received a small sample of the treatment lotion so it wasn’t enough use to say whether there were lasting benefits or not. But on the day to day use I have enjoyed the lightweight feel that isn’t too much for my oily skin, but feels supple and hydrating with just a small amount. I would recommend if you have the budget, but would never spend this much myself Feels Luxurious but Very Pricey
