Hands down the best moisturizer I have ever used! So silky smooth and hydrating. You only need a pea size amount and a little goes a long way. My skin is typically very dry and irritated by the end of the day and this moisturizer helps relieve my skin. It does have a small scent to it, but didnâ€™t seem overwhelming.This item is a splurge but will last you a while! nan
