It’s been a long time since I’ve used this amazing product. But I’m now 50, my skin has been looking a little fatigued and all the exfoliating and Tatcha products aren’t cutting it (love Tatcha!) i got a raise and thought, I’m doing this, lets see if it’s a reset. I just washed and applied a pea sized serving of this miracle to my face and neck and also my eyelids which have been flaky and irritated due to allergies. BOOM: irritation gone, hydrated and dewey, feeling amazing. It’s expensive, yes, but dayum…i missed yhis! love!!
