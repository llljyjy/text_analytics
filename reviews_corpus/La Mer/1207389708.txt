Perfect for my combination aging skin! I have tried so many luxury face cleansers and this has been the best cleanser by far. I would not use it if you have dry skin though! My skin is prone to hormonal acne and this has completely transformed the texture of my skin. A little goes a long way - it is highly concentrated so I use a pea sized amount on my PMD wand. Perfect for aging skin!
