This is so good!! Girl’s I have to say I’ve admired LaMer for quite a while, like over 10 years now. I’m overjoyed to be holding this beauty in my hand! This was my first experience compliments of LaMer and I couldn’t be happier! This is a lightweight serum and the 15ml beautiful dark glass jar houses this new generation of LaMer’s legendary serum. My skin drinks it up and after 10 days I still have a good amount of product left to use. A little goes a long way! I’d recommend this beauty to everyone! You deserve the best and you are an investment. Do it! You won’t be disappointed! XoxoMahalo,LaMer for the opportunity, I look forward to experiencing more of your legendary products! I’m in love! YES! It’s that good!
