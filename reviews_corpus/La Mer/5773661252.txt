La Mer does it again with another amazing product! This is a must-have when you want to treat your face with an extra bit of luxury. I love using this on my skin after cleansing! The best part is that it absorbs into the skin fairly quickly and a little thicker in texture, but still watery enough. I also adore the packaging it comes in. Treat Yourself with La Mer!
