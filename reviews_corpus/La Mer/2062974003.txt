Overall this seams like a good product for a very specific market, not mine. It wasn’t for me. It’s supposed to be a hydrating watery lotion, but it just feels like a serum and I still feel like I need to put a moisturizer on top of it. It’s not horrible, and I could probably skip the moisturizer on top, but it’s just feels weird. For the price and the claims, I expected a little more. nan
