La Mer is known for their luxurious presentation, quality, texture, and packaging, and this treatment lotion is no outlier. It has a light but beautiful scent that feels reminiscent of a summer day by the pool. This watery lotion isn’t the easiest to apply without wasting product in the 15ml version that I received. Since it is such a nice product I would love to have more control of using it. It’s definitely on the higher end of the price scale, and I don’t necessarily think that’s worth it, but it is absolutely the luxurious skincare experience delivered and matched by great results! Luxurious Lotion!
