This product is more of an oil than a lotion, which my skin loves. My skin feels so hydrated and luxurious every time I use this product, which I do right after cleansing. I have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin in just a few days. It looks more smooth and my makeup applies fantastic over this product. My skin literally feels brand new, and it looks amazing. This is a new holy grail for me! Worth the $$!!!!
