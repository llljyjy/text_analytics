The â€œlotion treatment is definitely more like an ampoule or essence. It is a thicker consistency, clear and lather on, non-sticky, feels very nice on the skin and immediately locked in moisture. Great to use nightly but also not too thick to use in the morning routine. Have yet to see long term effect but a little bottle goes a long way. Nice ampoule/essence to add to your routine
