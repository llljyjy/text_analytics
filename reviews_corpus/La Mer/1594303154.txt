If I could give zero star I would. It smells like old bad perfume, just gross. It came as a duet set special and I wonder why do a duet of the same product one small and one regular size, and not different duo products which would have been a better choice. I didnâ€™t touch the product so I will return it. Very disappointing when you think about the cost and the praise we here about La mer. DO NOT BUY SMELLS LIKE OLD PERFUME BOTTLE
