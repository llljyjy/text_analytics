This is by far one of the best lotions I have used. The soft delicate texture is so soothing to the skin and a little goes a long way. This is easy to wear underneath makeup and on its own. It doesnâ€™t feel overly greasy or uncomfortable on the skin. I love the way this has made my skin feel! A must have for combo skin
