Disclaimer : I received the product for free from a website, however all opinions are my own… the very first time I’ve tried this Lamer Treatment Lotion I was like “wow” it’s really a very it’s a watery lotion product that feels like a very thin fine oil so I love using it for under the makeup during the day..the foundation looks so smooth  I love it! It’s a bomb product! Lamer treatment lotion
