I was a little disappointed with this product. I use the moisturizing soft cream religiously and was hoping this product would be similar but unfortunately this one missed the mark. I wasn’t hydrating like the moisturizing soft cream at all and the smell was very weird—nothing like the signature La Mer scent I’m used to. I’ll stick with my soft cream. nan
