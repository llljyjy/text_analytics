I have combination skin that has both dry and oily areas on different parts of my face. I focused this product onto the drier areas of my skin to put it to the test! A little goes a long way with this thick moisturizing lotionâ€”which I love! This is definitely a product that you will buy once and have for a while. It has a very high quality and luxurious texture that transports you to a high end spa for the ultimate form of self care! Overall, it moisturized my skin very well and locked in moisture. I prefer to use this product as part of my PM skincare routine because for my skin type, it is a bit on the heavier side. Very Thick and Luxurious
