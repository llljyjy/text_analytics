This lotion is unlike any other lotion I have ever tried. It is not - cream but more like a watery texture the absorbs into your skin. I use it after cleansing at night before bed. It makes my skin feel super moisturizing and  I have a nice nature dewy glow afterwards Love it! Super unique type of lotion
