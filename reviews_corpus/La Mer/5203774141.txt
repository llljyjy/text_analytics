I enjoyed the way this product felt when apply it to my skin and how well my skin absorbed it. I don’t care too much for the scent- as it very strong. But it didn’t seem to irritate my skin which is a plus! I have dry skin and this definitely helps me feel hydrated, I use it after cleansing and before serums. I wouldn’t necessarily call it a necessity but if you’re skin is very dehydrated- it could be worth a try. nan
