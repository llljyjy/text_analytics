Thicker than a conventional toner (almost a runny serum consistency), but goes on without residue and absorbs quickly. Has been amazing with protecting my skin that’s been getting dry and irritated from all the  weather changes. Very hydrating and balancing, helps serums absorb better, helps skin regain protected feeling after cleansing (goes on after cleansing but before serum). I prefer putting it on with my fingers, it’s not so runny that it needs to be used with a cotton pad, but you can definitely use one if you want. nan
