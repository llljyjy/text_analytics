I love the La Mer Treatment Lotion!  I use it in the morning after I cleanse my face and it gives my skin an extra boost of hydration.  It absorbs quickly into the skin, so it will work well for any skin type.  It works very well with my other skincare products.  I believe it helps my skin look plump and youthful and I highly recommend it! So Hydrating!
