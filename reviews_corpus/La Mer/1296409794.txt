I must say this is holy grill status worthy. I have combination skin so it gets very dry and some areas and very oily in the others. And my moisturizer needs to be just so. Otherwise my face becomes a huge oil slick. After using this twice a day for several days I noticed that my dry patches were gone. And I also noticed it didnâ€™t make my skin look oily. Overall I was really happy with the overall hydration this product gave my skin. Great on combination skin
