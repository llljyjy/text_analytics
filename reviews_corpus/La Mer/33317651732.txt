This isn’t what I normally think of as a lotion- it’s closer to a serum or even a toner (that is to say, it’s pretty watery). That’s neither a good nor bad thing, it was just a surprise at exactly *how* watery it was the first time I used it. I’ve been incorporating it into my routine after cleansing for about a week and an happy with the results so far! nan
