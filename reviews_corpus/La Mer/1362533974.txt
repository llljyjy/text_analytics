This is absolutely the best lip balm out there.  I’ve tried them all cheap to expensive and nothing compares to La Mer’s. It lasts for hours on my lips and has no gooey or slick residue, it acts as a true long-lasting rich moisturizer for the lips. So expensive, but we’ll worth it. Long-lasting and worth the price
