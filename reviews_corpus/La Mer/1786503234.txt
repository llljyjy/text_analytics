I was worried it may clog my pones since I have oily/ acne-prone skin, but it doesnâ€™t!  I like the texture,  and it absorbs into my skin quickly.  My face feels very soft after applying it at night.  I pretty much just use it as an essence instead of toner. No need to apply another layer of serum after it. You can go straight to cream/lotion. nan
