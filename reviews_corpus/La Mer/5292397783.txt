This is the first time Iâ€™ve ever tried a watery lotion. It has a very gel like consistency. I like that it immediately soaks into your skin and hydrates. It definitely leaves a very nice glow and does the job in hydration. I find myself with a lot of dry patches and flaky areas after applying makeup. Using this has definitely lessened the flakiness. Pricey but amazing for the ultimate hydration. Amazing hydration
