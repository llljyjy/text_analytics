This is a good sunscreen. Texture is nice, absorbs easily. It’s a chemical sunscreen so it doesn’t leave a white cast. It does have a sunscreen-y smell and there is a sheen to the sunscreen so it is very dewy.That being said, I really don’t think it’s anything special to justify the crazy price tag. The sunscreen market now has a huge number of options with this type of texture, all for way less money. nice but nothing special
