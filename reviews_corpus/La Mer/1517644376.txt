Really enjoying this treatment lotion more than I thought I would! I’ve replaced my usual hyaluronic acid with this after cleansing, and it feels like a 2-in-1 essence and serum. The texture is a smooth liquid that glides on easily and leaves my skin instantly hydrated. A little goes a long way, which is nice considering the price point. It would personally be hard to justify the price, and I’m not crazy about the scent, which is why I’m knocking off a star. I think if you’re a lover of luxury products, and La Mer in general, this one will be a keeper in your collection. Like an essence & serum in one product
