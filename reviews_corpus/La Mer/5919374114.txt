I always wanna know if this lotion is worth the price and I finally get a chance to try it. The lotion came with a high-quality pouch bag which feels very luxurious. The scent is very light and reminds me of baby lotion. The texture is between thick and watery, when I apply it to my skin it’s a little cooling effect and it dries and absorbs very fast. After a couple of days of testing in the morning, my skin feels hydrated and looks smooth. It really helps to hydrate my skin the whole day and absorbs my serum better with no irritation. The most significant effect for me is the texture of my skin becoming more smooth. The only concern for me is it contains an alcohol dent at the end of the ingredients list so I hope it doesn’t dry only skin later. nan
