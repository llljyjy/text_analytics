This was first time trying the La Mer soothing Lotion and I must say, it’s been a great addition to my routine. I like to apply it right after I’ve washed my face and it really prep skin for the rest of my routine. The texture is watery but it has great slip and almost glides on like a serum or essence. It leaves my skin feel very refreshed and helps keep me hydrated all day. Love this stuff!
