I just finished a large-sized bottle of this, and I can’t go without it now. It’s very thin and watery, but when I apply it just like they show in the video my skin feels fresh, plump and hydrated. It feels so comfortable sometimes I go straight to my sunscreen and forget the moisturizer. It’s a very powerful, healing product.  And the scent is divine, smells like pure luxury haha. Honestly this is my favorite La Mer product, it plays well with any serum or moisturizer of any brand. It’s a fantastic addition to all skincare routines. My favorite La Mer product
