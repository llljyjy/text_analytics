Great alternative to the original. I love that this version is lightweight but still hydrating. I used it at the end of my PM routine and it absorbed so nicely! Plus, the scent isnâ€™t as strong, which I prefer. It left my skin looking smooth and moisturized in the morning. Love this more than the original
