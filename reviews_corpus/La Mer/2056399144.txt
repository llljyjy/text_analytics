I really enjoyed using the treatment lotion after cleansing.  I truly did see instant hydration and a glow.  The only complaint would be the application process. I wasnâ€™t sure how much to use and the liquid flows out of the bottle easily so sometimes I felt wasteful with the product. Great Product - It's a Watery Consistency just FYI
