It’s moisturizing and definitely feels very luxurious, but the texture is strange in that it sits on my dry skin in some areas and looks almost flaky? Its not bad but it definitely can look a little patchy, even when I rub it between my finger tips to “activate” the extracts. Overall It’s a nice cream and does make my skin glow but honestly if you want to try it but don’t want to spend the ridiculously overpriced amount for it, just get some German Nivea moisturizing cream and put a few drops of The Ordinary’s Marine Hyaluronics in it. The exact same thing, but actually better because the Marine Hyaluronics has a bigger variety of algae in it. Plus it sinks in the skin much better! Nice but ridiculously overhyped.
