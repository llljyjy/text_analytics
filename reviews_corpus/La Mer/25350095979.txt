I bought this probably back in April of last year, I got the large size and it lasted until January with twice daily use. I was apprehensive because of the price, but I knew how popular La Mer was and decided to give it a try. If you’ve used a softener, this is very similar. It’s thicker than toner, but still watery. Always made my skin feel moisturised, didn’t burn or sting, and gave me a nice glow during the day, even with moisturiser applied on top. Give it a try, you won’t be disappointed!
