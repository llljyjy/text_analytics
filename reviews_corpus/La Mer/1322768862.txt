I have tried other La Mer products in the past but this one so far it’s my favorite. It’s a watery but hydrating texture that sinks in the skin and leaves instantly plumped. I have combination skin and I find I can just use this in the morning and I feel hydrated till my evening routine. So for me it’s enough hydration that I have not used anything on top. Plus I wanted to test how my skin felt by just using this alone and so far I feel my skin feels soft and plumped.  I also have mild rosacea and I find that my skin is also less red from using this. So I highly recommend. Hydrating and plumping even by itself
