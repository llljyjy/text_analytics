I received two small samples of this to test out. I had always been curious about the brand and when I saw it pop up as an option to try it I was very excited. However I was quickly disappointed. The lotion felt a bit heavy despite being advertised as good for combo skin. It also has a heavy scent. For the price, I would expect this to make my skin feel and look noticeably different but I didnâ€™t see any results. Not worth the money, better options out there!
