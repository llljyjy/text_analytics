This treatment lotion is so hydrating! The texture is not heavy, more like a watery lotion, and is not sticky or greasy after applying. I use it like a serum after my cleansing & exfoliating and my skin feels & looks so healthy & glowy after usage and the smell is so nice & pleasant. I highly recommend adding it to your skincare routine! Skin Looks & Feels So Hydrated!
