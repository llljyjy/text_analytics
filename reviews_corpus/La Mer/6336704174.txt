After using this product for 2 weeks, I’m not overly impressed. I have president dark circles and frankly haven’t found any product that helps with them, so I went in not expecting much anyway. I noticed no change in dark circles, but slight improvement in puffiness and fine lines. I do like that this product is a little thinner than some creams, which allows it to spread smoothly without tugging the skin, and makes a little bit go a long way. It has a pleasant “green“ scent that’s very light, and it did not both my eyes or skin at all. Some eye creams run into my eyes and cause burning, singing, and watering - I had none of these issues with The Eye Concentrate. Overall it’s just ok. Nothing spectacular, performing about the same as many other products I’ve tried (and many more modestly process). Again this is granting that I don’t think ANY eye cream helps with finishing my dark circles. Nothing too special for me
