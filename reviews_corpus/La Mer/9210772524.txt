I’ve always wanted to try La Mer, and I’m so happy I was gifted this product! This treatment lotion is supposed to be used after cleansing and before serums and moisturizers, and I found myself comparing it to your typical toner. It’s called a lotion so I wasn’t sure what to expect, but the texture is light and like a watery gel. It’s slightly thicker than toners I’ve used before but also thinner than serums I’m used to. It has a fresh and light scent, and it made my skin feel super hydrated. I can’t wait to keep using this product! I have very dry skin, so I will take all the moisture I can get. Great moisturizing product
