the jar packaging gets a bit messy while opening it and applying it on my undereye area. thankfully, there is a little plastic cap that protects the spillage of the product but the eye concentrate gets on the cap as well. there is a bit of a scent which reminds me green/floral notes, but surprisingly the scent doesnt bother me, it can be noticed while applying it, but once applied I cannot notice the scent. the texture of the eye concentrate is like a lotion. it applied nicely , a little goes a long way. the finish that it gives is silky smooth matte which doesnt feel drying. i usually prefer applying my eye creams in PM rather than AM, but this one can be applied in AM because it doesnt feel heavy or it doesnt move around or smudge. lotion texture. silky finish
