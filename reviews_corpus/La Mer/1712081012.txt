This treatment lotion is made with La Mer’s special miracle broth. It’s supposed to help with anti-aging, plumping, and hydrating, among other benefits. I really love this treatment lotion! The texture is so lightweight! The texture is watery gel-like that absorbs into your skin like satin.. I use this treatment lotion after cleansing my face and then follow up with moisturizer. My face feels hydrated, soothed  and refreshed. Love the texture!
