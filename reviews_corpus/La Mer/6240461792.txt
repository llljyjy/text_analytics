I was surprised by how lightweight the texture of this lotion is but at the same time how hydrating it was! I used it after all my serums and before sunscreen and I could definitely feel and see a difference in plumpness! I think it’s great for these cold months but definitely on the pricier side! And it didn’t make me break out which is great :) Hydration galore
