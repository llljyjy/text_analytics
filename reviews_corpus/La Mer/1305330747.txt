I recently got to try La Mer’s moisturizing matte lotion. It was a small sample but you really don’t need much of it because it goes a long way. The moisturizer is a light, which was a plus. It also dried matte. It didn’t leave your face greasy. It does have a strong fragrance, which I’m not typically a fan of. The moisturizer was nice and but I typically like more moisturizing products. I would not purchase. nan
