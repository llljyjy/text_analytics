This treatment lotion has been in my stale routine for years and I don’t remember how many bottles I have been repurchasing.  It gives me soft and hydrated skin right after every use. I have combination skin and I used it as a toner in my routine. I love pouring 3 drops of it and combining it with a drop of face oil. It is a mini trick to give my skin moisture lock, especially in the winter weather.  Just don’t use it on a cotton pad, it is not necessary. the stable product in my routine
