La Mer Treatment Lotion needs no introduction. It is one of those luxury skincare products that almost every female  would at least once wish of giving it a try. La Mer Treatment Lotion claims to delivers all-day hydration. It’s suitable for all Skin types. It also claims to address Fine Lines and Wrinkles, Dryness, and Loss of Firmness and Elasticity. I have been using it both in the morning and at night on clean skin before my moisturizer. When using this I don’t feel the need of a toner. I have noticed that skin appears to be brighter, the pores seem to shrink and overall the texture does look smooth. Brighter looking skin in one step.
