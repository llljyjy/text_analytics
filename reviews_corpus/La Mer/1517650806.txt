I love the moisturizing, thick texture of this lotion - itâ€™s very much like a thin serum texture and a wonderful first step after cleansing my face. I applied this for a solid 3 weeks to my damp skin on my face and it provided a moisturizing first layer that I loved. The scent is very mellow and non-irritating. Enjoyed this treatment lotion a lot!!!!
