This treatment lotion left me with the most gorgeous hydrated skin. I applied a dime sized amount on freshly cleansed skin and patted it in. It added a layer of hydration underneath my serums that added a nice subtle radiance all day long. The texture is a slippery, watery feel so a little product goes a long way. Trust me, my butter hands knocked over the bottle and spilled half of it on the counter, so I hurriedly sopped it up and spread it all over my dry arms legs and legs. My skin has never felt better. The cost is too steep for it to be an everyday product for me, but if cost is no problem than I would highly recommend it being in your routine! Hydrated supple skin
