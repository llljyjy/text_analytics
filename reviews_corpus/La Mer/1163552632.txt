So I’ve always wondered about La Mer and whether the hype is real! I have friends who are devoted to the brand, so I was very excited to try The New Treatment Lotion. It’s an essence lotion powered by cell-recharging Miracle Broth™ and is used after cleansing. What I really enjoy about it is how light it is yet it deeply hydrated my skin so quickly! I actually really like the texture, it’s liquid but has a little bit of bounce almost like a very light liquid gel.  I’m enjoying it so far and would love to try more of La Mer! Deep hydration at your finger tips!
