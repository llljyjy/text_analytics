Just okay. I felt a burning sensation on my skin and I normally have hardy skin, it’s able to take a lot and I’m normally not sensitive at all. For the price per ml, I’ve used better toners at much better costs.  My skin did feel smooth and supple the next morning, but the application turned me off. I received this product for free for my honest review. Save your money
