I really like the texture of this product as it feels exactly like an essence that sinks into my skin. I use the product right after I put on my toner and before my moisturizer in my evening skin care routine. The liquid is an anti aging all in one with the broth that La Mer has in most of its products but also major hydration. I do not smell any fragrance which I appreciate. I received as a sample to test and I am going to purchase a full size when empty. Definitely recommend! An All In One Essence!
