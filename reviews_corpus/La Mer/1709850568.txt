The La Mer treatment lotion was complimentary and sonhappy I got to tey ot firstbdue to the high price tag.  However, This is a now apart of my skincare! I love using it after Iâ€™ve thoroughly cleansed my skin. It soaks right into my skin adding a refreshed and moisturized feel, leaving my skin glowing.  This treatment lotion has kept my skin hydrated and improved my skin texture. I love how a little goes a long way. I highly recommend this product! Worth the high price for Luxury!
