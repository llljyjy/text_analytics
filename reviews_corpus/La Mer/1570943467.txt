I love using this along side the exfoliator and the creme de la mer. it is so moisturizing for my dry and sensitive skin. I love it more than the Tatcha essence. the old Tatcha essence formula was amazing, The new one is just way too watery so even notice a difference. I see people saying the 100ml of the treatment lotion is too small but I find it to be the perfect size since it is such a concentrated formula. At least the new formula is. Never tried the old formula. Hydrated and Dewy
