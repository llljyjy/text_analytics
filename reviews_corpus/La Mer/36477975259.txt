I liked it. I have very dry skin. This worked very well for me. I use it in conjunction with oil. Oil first then La Mer cream. Both work best if you use it immediate after washing face, while it’s still damp. You only need a tiny bit, especially with the oil. It is dewy, isn’t that what us older women need? I got several months out of this tiny jar. Now I can not speak as to whether or not it’s better than another product of this price range. I figured at the price for a regular size jar, it must be good. I can say, no more dry flakes on my face. I am buying some PURE to see how it compares. I like it
