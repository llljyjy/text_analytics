This eye cream just melted onto my skin. I used the tiniest amount but it was enough to apply to both eyes. It helped tremendously with lightening up my eye bags. I know a small bottle would last me for a long time even after applying twice a day and am so happy I tried this cream! The scent doesnâ€™t smell like much and does not affect the quality of the cream- the smell also disappears after applying. A little goes a long way!!
