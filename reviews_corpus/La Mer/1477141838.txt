My first ever La Mer product. I use this after cleansing my skin and it absorbs into my skin immediately. Other than that I’m not sure I can justify spending so much on a full size for what it does. My skin hasn’t made that much of a drastic change but I’ll keep using to see if I feel different once I use one bottle. Its okay...
