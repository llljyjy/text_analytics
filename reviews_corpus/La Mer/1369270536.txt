I used the La Mer Treatment Lotion as part of my bedtime routine. My skin is on the dry side and  gets tight after cleansing. Treatment Lotion is a watery consistency, it but a little thicker than water. After patting the lotion on my face- wow, my skin instantly felt refreshed and hydrated. After a couple minutes my face had such a nice natural glow. Iâ€™m excited to try this lotion on my face in the morning before I start my makeup routine. Lastly, the scent of this lotion is divine. Glowing And hydrated skin
