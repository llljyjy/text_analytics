I love this gloss, a 5-star product but lost a star because of the price! I love this gloss, which to me, has been a gloss but turns into a liquid lip balm. I feel like it does some good to your lips! Even after the gloss has faded, my lips are left with softness, healthy looking and the mint flavour from the beginning changed into a slight sweetness. No tingly feeling nor burning. I have not seen any plumping either. I would really describe it as a glossy liquid lipbalm. Plus the packaging is so luxe! I would buy this again but during the VIB sales! I truly recommend! Hope this helps! A glossy liquid lipbalm. LOVE!
