My mom got this as a gift a year ago and ran out so I bought her a refill for Christmas...yes, my wallet hurt a bit but it’s nice to splurge on my mom. I’ve tried the Sephora sample before and liked it okay but didn’t think it was spectacular BUT!! The salesgirl helping me today told me I was USING IT WRONG and I was like, I don’t know how to apply face cream?? Apparently you’re never supposed to spread la mer products on your face! I got another sample and immediately tried it using the proper method of warming between fingers and then patting on face. Wowwwww so much nicer experience and yes, I came to write this review just to share what I learned today. Sticker shock remains unchanged but I read all the reviews online and sure enough, many of the 1-2 stars reviews are complaining about the “spreadability“ and even under instructions it says PRESS INTO FACE, DO NOT MASSAGE. I feel like it should be more prominently labeled but I guess it wouldn’t make for very aesthetic packaging. If you’re reading this, I hope this helps!! Today I learned to follow the instructions!!
