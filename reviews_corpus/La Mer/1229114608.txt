LA MER gifted me this product free to test, honest opinions are my own.LA MER comes through with another winning product!The Treatment Lotion is a wonderful addition to my skincare routine, leaving my face feeling hydrated all day long. Use this watery lotion, after cleansing your skin and before serum + moisturizer.I soak a thin cotton pad with The Treatment Lotion and dab all over my face (like an essence). It creates this amazing hydrating barrier and a healthy looking glow.Don’t fret if you find it to be super watery. It’s got a silky, non-greasy and non-tacky consistency that soaks right into your skin. A little goes a long ways. Try to find cotton face sheets as opposed to cotton balls from Asian Beauty retailers to stretch the product even longer! Only con is the price tag but that is to be expected with all LA MER products. THIS WAY TO THE HYDRATION STATION
