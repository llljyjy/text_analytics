This moisturizer feels really good on the skin and leaves your skin super soft and smooth. Itâ€™s a great priming moisturizer to use before makeup. My only issue is that the fragrance is so strong and it lingers for some time. It would be great to see a fragrance free version of this! Nice but the fragrance is strong
