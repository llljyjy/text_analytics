Wow! Is this treatment lotion moisturizing or what?! I am absolutely in aw of how soft my skin feels. It almost has a velvety feel. I have to say, I was very intrigued when I saw that the texture of this product is more liquid than we imagine most moisturizers to be. It immediately made my skin soft and smooth where I applied it. I did specifically use it after my nightly skincare and body care regimen. Wow! Moisturizing for Sure!
