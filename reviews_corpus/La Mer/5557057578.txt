I have heavy dark circles from working nights as a nurse and being a mom during the day. So eye creams are part of my daily routine. I have tried many and have only liked a few, this La Mer concentrate is one of them. It is silky smooth, dries down quickly, plays well with other skin care and makeup. I am excited to see this product work in the long run for my fine lines and dark circles! A top option for eye cream
