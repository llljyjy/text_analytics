Ok…I left a bad review for the moisturizing soft cream because I had an allergic reaction to it and I just assumed that this version would do the same, but…it didn’t! The original crème de la mer is sooo good. I have extremely dry skin during the winter time so this is exactly what I need. The only thing is, I wish it was fragrance free! nan
