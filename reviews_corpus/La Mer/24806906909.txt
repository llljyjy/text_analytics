La Mer Treatment lotion is  watery silky and it is not sticky. I love how it is to my skin.  I got a combination of  oily and dry and this has been so compatible with my skin.  I love how it cushions as it hydrates my skin, especially my cheeks and forehead. It is perfect for aging skin like what I have.  A perfect part of my me-time indeed. Another add on to my skin care routine
