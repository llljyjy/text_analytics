What a luxurious product this is. The texture is so nice, a hydrating watery consistency. I like to shake about 3-5 drops into my hand and press it into the skin after cleansing. After using it for 2 weeks I can see my skin is clearer, hydrated, and leaving my skin looking more radiant. Price wise, itâ€™s expensive but your skin is an investment! Would definitely suggest for my dry skin ladies! For my dry skin ladies
