Okay so I took a leap of faith and spent the money on the 1.7 fl oz and man, I’ve been impressed with this one. Honestly, I’ve not yet found a product quite like it—it is so unique in that it is like between a serum and a moisturizer, like a very light moisturizer. Perfect for the summer and has been working for the fall so far when i layer it with a hydrating sunscreen. Performs like a dream, smells like a spa, and is cosmetically elegant. Not a night time moisturizer though unless you use it as an emulsion before a moisturizer. Overall, I will probably save up to buy this again when I run out; I’m probably about halfway through mine. Lovely
