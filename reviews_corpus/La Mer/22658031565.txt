I have loved La. Mer’s top-of-the-line skincare products since I was a teenager, and their treatment lotion is no. exception. Its silky cream texture glides onto my skin and deeply hydrates my sensitive skin without irritating it. I apply this after cleansing, using a hydrating mist, and using my serums, which has helped my winter skin tremendously. If you’re looking for the perfect hydrating lotion, this is it. I especially love using this around my mouth and eyes to reduce the presence of fine lines. It truly is worth the investment to properly care for your skin. Perfect Post-Serum Hydrator
