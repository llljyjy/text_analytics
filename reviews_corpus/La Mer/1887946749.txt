I’m not sure what magical ingredients they put in this stuff, but it’s definitely a new holy grail product for me. I’ve added it into my skincare routine before moisturizing and I don’t think my skin has ever felt so soft… I literally can’t stop touching it. It’s super lightweight, so once it dries it feels like nothing is there, but after just a few days, you can tell a real difference. It also makes my pores appear much smaller, which is a great plus as well. I received this as a sample but will be purchasing the full size as soon as I’m done with it. Incredible. Baby soft skin
