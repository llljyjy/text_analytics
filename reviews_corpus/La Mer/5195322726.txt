First off the packaging is incredibly beautiful and luxurious. I felt like I was opening something on Christmas Day. It came with a beautiful duster/jewelry bag which is great for repurposing. The product sample itself was fairly small but a few drops onto the fingers goes a long way. It almost feels like a toner. I have incredibly sensitive skin and I had no break ours or adverse reactions when using this and it worked well with my other products. I did feel it was hydrating but I really did not notice much of a difference. Overall really love the packaging and the product is good but no visible difference and quite expensive. Excited to try their other products as Iâ€™ve heard great things especially about the lotion Luxurious packaging and good on sensitive skin
