Very light-weight, watery texture and cooling on the skin.  The texture of this product makes it easy to spread beautifully.  So, even the small size will last a fair amount of time.  Only a tiny amount is needed. I use this after cleansing in the AM and PM and I follow with the La Mer Light Cream moisturizer.  My skin is silky soft, clear, and even-toned.  It’s very hydrating and that was something I noticed instantly. I haven’t found a moisturizer and serum that worked so beautifully together.  My makeup applies flawlessly and my skin is noticeable more supple and refreshed after using the treatment lotion consistently for a few weeks.  I’m obsessed! Obsessed!  Super Hydrating
