I really don’t get the hype. I got a mini size of this in a Sephora favorites kit and it’s lasted me for over a month so far with about a week or so of use left. The cream is extremely rich and does not spread on the skin easily. Thankfully, it doesn’t leave a greasy feel. There’s nothing super wrong with it, but there’s also nothing that feels all that special. For the price, you’d expect to wake up with brand new looking skin and it just doesn’t do that for me. I have felt a significant difference even overnight from much more affordable moisturizers like the Tatcha dewy skin cream. Also, this smells exactly like Nivea cream, which is just ??? I would never spend any amount of money on this. Use a good retinol and a night cream with ceramides and peptides—it’ll do far more for your skin for FAR less money. Not worth the hype
