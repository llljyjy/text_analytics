The texture is watery but not too runny. I used it after dry brushing my skin, worked out perfectly. The next day my skin was very smooth and soft. I love using lotions but not all of them are as good as La Mer.  I have used La Mer a long time ago totally forgot why this is good.  Very smooth texture, high quality. Made my skin so smooth
