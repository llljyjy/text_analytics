I love the texture of this eye concentrate. The formula is very light weight and gentle. I took pictures to compare the difference between my eyes before I applied the concentrate vs how it looked 5 mins and 10+ minutes after and you can clearly see the improvement in the appearance of fine lines! By the pictures you can also notice a decrease in puffiness and smoother skin texture. I then applied to the second eye area and noticed the improvement as well. No lie, it works but take pics so you can compare. Definitely impressed as other products Iâ€™ve tried that target fine lines typically do not work for me. Definitely recommend this eye concentrate. Please note that I did not use it for dark circles therefore I cannot comment on its effectiveness on that. nan
