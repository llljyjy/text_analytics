This is a favorite moisturizer for my dry skin, and one of a rare few that leave my face feeling moisturized all day. Initially I didn’t love it because I thought it was thick and pasty. A couple of tips turned this cream into a silky, luxurious product for me, however.  One, it helps to warm up the cream in your hands first—this allows for greater spreadability. Second, applying on slightly damp skin (in addition to the above step) helps the cream melt into the skin even better. I personally like to use this as an overnight mask and the last step in my evening routine as it’s very occlusive. Do I see a reduction in fine lines or any other such drastic changes with the Crème de la Mer?  No, I do not, but it’s a fantastic moisturizer and when my skin is hydrated it looks more youthful. It’s not a must buy but it’s a lovely treat for me when my budget allows it. A favorite treat for my dry skin.
