This lotion is light to the touch and not too watery.  It has a fresh neutral scent and doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky after applying. It has some consistency to it and does a nice job of moisturizing my skin.  I haven’t noticed any dramatic changes to my skin as I’ve only used it for a short period of time after cleansing.  So far, so good. nan
