Definitely not worth the hype in my opinion. I’ve read about this moisturizer since I was a kid and never wanted to pony up the cash for it. I finally decided to and …. Was not impressed. It seems to be a sufficient thick moisturizer maybe for winter before bed…. But not life changing or even that impressive at all. It’s hard to get all over my face too, like so thick it’s hard to spread. It doesn’t smell particularly good either. Really unclear as to why this is such a cult fave. I get the price tag as for its manufacturing process but why the trouble for such an average lotion???? Not worth the hype. Not even a little.
