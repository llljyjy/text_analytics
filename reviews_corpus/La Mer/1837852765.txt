I’ve finished two bottles of the La Mer toner and I actually miss using it when I switched to another product. It’s a gentle toner that doesn’t strip the skin and leaves skin feeling supple and soft! I wouldn’t say it does wonders but overall just so so pleasant to use. The only toner I want to go back to!
