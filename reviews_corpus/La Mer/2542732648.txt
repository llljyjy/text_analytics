This eye cream has a thinner consistency than I initially thought it would have, but it is quite moisturizing. You also don’t need a lot either. It’s very lightweight and doesn’t feel heavy at all. I’ve only been using this for about a week now so I haven’t noticed too much difference in my dark circles, but I have noticed my under eyes don’t get as dry anymore. I’ll definitely have to use it more to see the long term effects. This eye cream is definitely a splurge item so I don’t see myself consistently purchasing this, but definitely a nice item if you’re willing to spoil yourself. nan
