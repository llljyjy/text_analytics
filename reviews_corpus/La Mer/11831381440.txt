I was on a hail - a bit manic and impulsive - and I bought this based on the advice from the Sephora employee. She said it was the only product she has found that faded her acne scars and made a huge difference in her skin - which was perfect,  When I got home I didn’t have to debate with myself about opening the bottle and possibly throwing away over $500 on some junk.I know La Mer, I trust La Mer. It is unbeatable. And they did it again with The Concentrate Serum. It’s been a week and a half and I’m already feeling changes in my skin - the redness around my nose and cheek bones is start to fade.I love La Mer. I truly do. They are my skincare dream come true. While I don’t own all of their products (should I win the lottery, the first thing I would do is go to Sephora and buy two or three of each product -- I would take them all, but that wouldn’t be fair ;) Ugh, yes, The Concrete Serum? I have not used it long enough to give a formal review, but as of now, it’s a 10/10.La Mer, Forever, La Mer Forever
