I am a huge fan of La Mer products and this product does not disappoint. I apply the product morning and night as it gives my much-needed skin hydration. It’s an extremely smooth product and I use it in the morning to prep my skin for the day. It’s super lightweight, but that doesn’t mean it’s not penetrating the skin. It absorbs quickly and my skin feels plump and refreshed at the same time. Works great on my combination/oil skin
