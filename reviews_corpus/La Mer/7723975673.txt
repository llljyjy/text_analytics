Wow, this product is better than I could have imagined. The texture is thicker than a normal moisturizer but I put it on after cleansing at night and I wake up with my skin feeling so soft. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a bit of a thicker product for nighttime moisture. Great Nighttime Moisturizer
