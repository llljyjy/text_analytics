Though it’s definitely an investment buy, taking care of my skin is top priority so this product is well worth it! It’s been over a week and I’m already seeing a difference in the hydration in my skin. The scent is what you would expect from a high-end product, it’s spa-like but not offensive. Will definitely continue to use and purchase the full product. A Luxury Indeed
