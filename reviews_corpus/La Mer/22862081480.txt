If I could give this product a 100 I will because 5 stars isn’t just enough. Yes I KNOW ITS EXPENSIVE AND EVERYTHING, but I never never had a product that works so good on my skin until I met this oil. My skin usually gets horrible during winter season, my face gets so dry and eventually my skin starts breaking down due to extreme dryness despite the moisturizing routine I do, I usually end up having problems on the side of my lips, it tends to get so dry and then starts to get really itchy and eventually breaking and then gets discolored for some reason idk why but it’s just gets dark the side of my lips which is very unpleasant to look at, I got a sample size of this product and I just decided to use it one night I love everything about it continued using it and then in as little as 3 days the darkness lightened up and the dryness of my skin especially side of my lips disappeared, DISAPPEARED. I’ve never been impressed in my life over a product I look it up online as to how much the product is and behold the 260$! I was shook. But I think it’s totally worth it!!!  I recently got the full size one after months of savings and I’m so happy I did!!! CHANGE MY SKINCARE ROUTINE Game for the better!!!
