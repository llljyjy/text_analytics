I was super excited to try this product, but sadly it didn’t live up to my expectations. It’s a super watery product and I had to use more then I would have thought. A little doesn’t go a long way. It left my skin feeling weird, kinda of rubbery, and I could feel it sitting on my skin, after it dried and I ran my hands over it. Something else is…. I have pretty oily skin and this dried it out and made it flaky. I used this along with my regular face wash and nothing else. I received this product complimentary for my honest review. nan
