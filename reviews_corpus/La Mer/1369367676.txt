I love this for right before my serums and treatments it really helps everything just absorb and work so much more. It has a watery yet thick texture I don’t know how else to explain it and it feels really nice on the skin. It absorbs quickly, and although the product has a mild scent it doesn’t linger. a great addition to a routine
