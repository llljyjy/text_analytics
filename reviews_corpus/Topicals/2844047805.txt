I’m sure this would be effective due to the cocktail of ingredients, but not sure why they would add pore clogging ingredients in something targeted towards post-acne marks. I made the mistake of knowing that and still wanting to try it bc of the hype/other ingredients and it broke me out BAD. If you’re acne-prone I wouldn’t risk it. There are other alternatives. Not for acne-prone skin
