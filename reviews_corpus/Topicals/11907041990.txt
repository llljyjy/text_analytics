I’ve used this on my underarms for about two weeks after getting chemical burns from a deodorant leaving me with dark pigmented underarms. Anyway this product has worked so well in helping lighten back my underarms I’m truly blown away how well it worked! I will say it does have a strong not so pleasant smell but I can get past it for how well it works! nan
