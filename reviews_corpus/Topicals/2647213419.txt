so when I got this long way back, I loved it ! used it every day and saw my hyperpigmenation reduced. I ended up moving to BC and used it there and broke out from it after each use. it was like tiny white lil pimples. I had to discontinue use. I moved back to my current city so I might try it again. But ladies, I found two good alternatives I’ve been using if this doesn’t work. 1. alpha arbutin +HA. Let me tell you this works soo good ! Also, use the TXA from Inky list which also helped reduce dark spots! nan
