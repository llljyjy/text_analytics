The smell. I canâ€™t get over it. So if you are considering this product be warned it really does smell awful. It smells like mechanical lubricant or something. I was not expecting it and it unfortunately ruined the whole vibe of my skin care routine. Will not be using again for that reason. :( wanted to like it. SMELLY
