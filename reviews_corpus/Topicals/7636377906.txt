Used it for months, no noticeable results. I didn’t use it everyday as my skin can be very sensitive. Used it a few times a week. I’m sure it works really well for some folks. I still love their other products (aha/bha roller ball and  Retinol body serum) but this is mid at best. You’ll get more use out of this on the body than on your face in my opinion, it may even break you out on your face. So so
