Used almost an entire tube with 0 improvements of dark spots. Stinks to the high heavens (yes it is that bad). Packaging is also not good because the serum often leaks out of the tip and my tube also has a hole in it after regular use so all the remaining serum leaked out! I really wanted to love this one but I definitely wonâ€™t be repurchasing. Total waste of money. :(( Immediately no.
