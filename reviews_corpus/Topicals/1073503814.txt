Yep, it smells a little gross. But it dissipates very quickly once applied, and I appreciate that they didn’t add any fragrance to cover the natural smell of the product. It’s worked wonders to fade random blemish spots as well as an unsightly scar on my leg. The regular size tube is massive and will last quite a long time. Great value, effective product. Works great and I don’t care about the smell
