I gave this product three months to work, using every other night, but didnâ€™t see noticeable results. I suffered through the smell, which was terrible for my sensitive nose, but found that if I put moisturizer on to then the smell went away pretty quickly (though not totally). I could only wear this at night because it pills underneath moisturizer and makeup, no matter how thinly I spread it on. I read that you should not use this with AHA, BHA or retinols, and I prefer the results from those products so Faded got tossed out.Glad that some people have great results, but this one was not for me. Perhaps some people have a stronger sense of smell
