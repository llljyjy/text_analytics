I love this product! I have extremely dry skin and eczema. This product does not make me break out or irritate my sensitive skin. The smell was off putting at first, but you get used to it and then it’s not really noticeable. I do feel like it’s making a difference and lightening my dark spots (in combination with sunscreen) def try out if you’re on the fence!
