I am still trying to get used to the smell. If you have ever smelled canned cat food or shiritaki noodles before, it’s a very similar scent and it’s very nauseating BUT this product does wonders for my skin. My skin feels amazing in the morning and I’m starting to see a difference in my skin tone and scars. The smell makes me want to throw-up first thing in the morning but the benefits are worth it. Great benefits/nauseating smell
