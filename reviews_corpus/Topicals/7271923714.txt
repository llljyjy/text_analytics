I wanted to like this product considering it’s catered to skin types for poc but it’s been 2 weeks and the only visible different I see is that my underdeveloped pimples turned into these blood filled spots on my skin that I haven’t seen since I had cystic acne a few months ago. This makes my dark spots even more prominent and I’m upset ab it bc it took a long time for my skin to heal from before. I know this might work on some skin types but I think mine might be too sensitive for this. I would continue trying the product but the smell makes me not want to use it . be careful if you have sensitive skin barrier
