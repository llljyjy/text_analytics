This stuff. Dude. So first you should know that it smells awful. So so bad. The first few times I used this I gagged while putting it on my face. It was actually pretty funny haha. Now I’m somewhat used to the smell. BUT WOW! TALK ABOUT RESULTS! My skin went through a purging phase in the beginning as per usual when I add a new product into my skincare routine, but now my skin is so clear from acne and my hyperpigmentation is fading so nicely! This is the first product I’ve found that has actually had any effect on my stubborn scars. I am very impressed. Just buy it already. Amazing Results, Terrible Smell
