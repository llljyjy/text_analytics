I love the product so far and my skin is clearing up but it’s too early to talk about that. I wanted to leave a review because I wanted to say that it doesn’t smell that bad. When I bought it I was mentally prepared for it to be the worst thing that I’ve ever smelled. All anyone ever talks about when referencing this product is how awful it smells. But truthfully, when I went to put it on my face for the first time it was a little anti-climactic. Meaning, I was prepared for something that smelled terrible and it just wasn’t that bad. And then when I used it for the second time I smelled it again because I thought “OK, maybe it was just at one time” but the second time it didn’t smell that bad either. Now, I’m not saying there isn’t a smell because there is but it’s just not as awful as everyone is making it out to be. And once you layer your other products on it you can’t even smell it. Don’t let the smell be the reason you don’t get this product. I really feel like people are making the smell out to be worse than it actually is. There’s a smell yes but it’s not that bad
