If you’re sensitive to coconut oil please do not buy! It did lighten old hyperpigmentation but gave me the gift of new pimples! The smell is bad but it’s not as bad as people are making it out to be, it disappears pretty quickly. Looks like I’m in the minority because it seems to work well for most however, just beware. nan
