I don’t usually write reviews but I am so happy with the results of this product in such short time of me using it. I recently gave myself a chemical burn using tea tree oil and of course it left a scar/ discoloration. I struggled with acne my teen years and finally as an adult was able to clear up my skin so to me this bothered me so much after struggling for years to be happy with my skin. I tried several different products to get rid of it but didn’t seem to work. But after being recommended this product only after one use i could already see the difference. The smell isn’t nice but it’s not unbearable, I also want to add that my skin is extremely sensitive and this product did a good job not irritating/ breaking out my skin. Great for chemical burn scars
