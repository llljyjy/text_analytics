I have tan skin tone and get terrible scarring from anything. There’s post-acne scarring, after my sebaceous filaments are gone it leaves scarring, if my cat barely scratches me it leaves the worst dark marks ever. So I wasn’t sure that this would work for me but tried it anyway. IT WORKS! Who cares about the scent? This cream has faded a few dark spots I’ve had on my cheek for maybe 8 months now. I’ve been using it every other day before bed for one month and there’s been a drastic improvement. Holy grail! Was skeptical at first...
