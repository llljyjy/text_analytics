Wish I had returned it but I kept giving it more time, I went over the return period by 6 days. It does nothing at all. Regret trusting this product and company with this “snake miracle serum”. It smells and the container is just like those cheap bleaching creams you can get from back in the days at the beauty supply store for a couple bucks. save your money wish I can get my money back
