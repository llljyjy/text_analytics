It’s been a month since I’ve started using Faded by Topicals and I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin. Initially, I used Faded once a week at night to assess my skin’s reaction, but I bumped up my usage to 3-4x weekly at night after seeing improvement within the first week. Not only have my acne scars started to fade, but my skin’s texture has improved dramatically. Now I will say, my acne scars have not faded completely, but with continued use and patience, I’m very sure my post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation will subside. This serum also cleared some pustules and whiteheads I was dealing with due to a chemical sunscreen I was using! I’m so happy I purchased and I will definitely check in next month when I see even more improvement. (P.S. Besides the use of mineral sunscreen and my cleanser that contains kojic and azaleic acid, Faded is the only other product I use for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. It really is the main character!) Consistency+patience=RESULTS!
