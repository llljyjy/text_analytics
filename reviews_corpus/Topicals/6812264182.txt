Bought a tube for myself and loved the results so much I bought my daughter one also. It works, my face has never been clearer with any other products. Breakouts are gone within a day. Bought this for a dark age spot on my temple, it has faded some, hoping for better results with longer use. The smell is a bit off putting, just use with a moisturizer & youâ€™ll barely notice. I love how clear and hydrated and smooth my face looks now. I will continue to use this product! softer, smoother & clearer face
