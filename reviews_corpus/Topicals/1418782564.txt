Overall Experience:I recently had a big cyst on my chin that left a dark red/purple dime-sized spot. I scar super easily and I’m prone to keloids. I bought this to try out and it is absolutely working. After three weeks, it’s about half the size it used to be and it’s continuing to fade! I truly think it’s going to go away completely. I’m applying it on old acne scars and even a burn scar but I’m not sure if it’s working yet.Smell:It smells horrible. It’s the worst smelling skin care product I’ve ever bought. I make sure to wash my hands after using it. The smell does fade after awhile. I definitely wait a few hours before getting in bed since I don’t want it on my sheets. Dealing with the smell is worth it though.How I’m Using It:I use it at night after washing my face with YTP Superfood Cleanser. I use Thayer’s Witch Hazel toner. (Before you discredit me for my toner choice, I know about the phenoxyethanol. I tried a bunch of other toners after they added it. My skin hated everything else and when I switched back my skin was happy again. I don’t know. I’m okay with it.) I rub it in and wait until it dries. I moisturize with YTP Superfood Air-Whip Cream then follow up with their Dream Oil once in awhile. I’ve never experienced any pilling.The instructions say to use it once a week and work up to daily. I’m no beginner to retinol, AHAs, BHAs, etc., so I just jumped right to using it every day and I was fine. No peeling, burning, or redness. Make sure to wear sunscreen every day.We all know that products like this are hit or miss. Everyone’s results are different. I think this is worth spending the $18 on the mini to try out because if you’re someone it works for, it really does help. If this doesn’t end up working for you, at least you tried. Works REALLY WELL for New Dark Spots
