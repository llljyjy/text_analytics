Y’all, this DOES work. You just have to be consistent. I’ve had hyperpigmentation since 2018. I’ve been using this since the summer w/ sunscreen and it has worked. It isn’t overnight but keep at it. I’m almost done with my first tube and going to start by second soon. It doesn’t work overnight but it does work. I worked my way up to 3 nights a week and that’s all you need. Try it and keep at it. Get it!!
