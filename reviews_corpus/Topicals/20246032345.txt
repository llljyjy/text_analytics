Ok, I wanted to love it...in theory I should love it. It has amazing ingredients. But the smell....I just can’t get past the smell. I’m embarrassed to have it on my face when I’m around others. I had read other reviews that mentioned the smell and thought “it can’t be that bad“...it’s that bad. It’s a shame because in theory this is great...but if you care about smelling weird for a while after applying, I’d look at a different product. The smell..it is that bad!
