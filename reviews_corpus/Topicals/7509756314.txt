I used it first time last year but as i was still new to retinol back then i though maybe my skin needs exfoliation for Faded to work better. This year I bought it several months ago and have been using it religiously. Sadly i donâ€™t see any difference in hyperpigmentation caused by sun and acne etc. I really wanted it to work but I guess I need to continue my search for a product that really works for this hyperpigmentation. So badly disappointed
