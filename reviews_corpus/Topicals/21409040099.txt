Look, I pick at my skin. Its my biggest flaw. Whenever I do facial extractions I’m always left with so much redness, some marks from shqueezin’ -you know the drill. Its disgusting, I know, and I have nobody to blame but myself.But let me tell you- this stuff? heaven sent.Redness and marks GONE OVERNIGHT.Not only that- it brightens. I put this on my hoohah too because I have slightly darker pigmentation down there and my god -that’s working too. Slowly down there for some reason, but I am seeing results. I’m currently doing laser hair removal down there and before I started using this cream the laser machine light didn’t reach all the way in certain areas that were darker. But after sticking with this stuff every night, the machine go ahead light has been going up a few notches.So - dark underarms or other areas of the face or body that are hyper-pigmented, try this but remember a little goes a long way!!TIP : I would HIGHLY recommend to use something fragrant over this because the smell is so unappealing. Glo Recipe watermelon or neutrogena hydroboost gel worked to mask the smell for me. But, if you don’t want to spend a fortune on fragranced moisturizer try Aveeno stress relief lotion on top of this product. worth the shtank
