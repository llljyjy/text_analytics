I bought this product to help with hyperpigmentation from old acne scars. However, when I started using it, I started having a lot more acne and the problem just got worse. I followed the instructions to start nice and slow until my skin gets used to it but that didn’t work and it’s been 2 months in and it’s still breaking me out and the hyperpigmentation is worse now. I’m going to stop using it unfortunately. Made things worse for me
