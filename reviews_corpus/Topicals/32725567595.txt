This product really helped fade my old acne scars. It also makes the fresh scars heal so much faster. I also noticed less breakouts since I started using this. I found it pretty gentle on the skin, and I can use it every day (I use it in the AM). It does smell pretty bad (like sulfur), but the smell doesnâ€™t stay for long. nan
