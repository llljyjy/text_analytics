I really had high hopes but I guess its not compatible with my skin. Used it and I started having breakouts even in places I’ve never had breakouts. I would have loved to keep trying but I’m currently fighting acne and hyperpigmentation and wouldn’t want my skin to get worse. Didn’t work well with my skin.
