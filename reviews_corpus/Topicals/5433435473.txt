After using this product for two weeks, twice a week I’m already seeing results! I had a frustrating bought of HFMD that left marks all over my jaw and cheeks. Once they were safely healed and I got the OK from the doc I started using this to help fade the marks. Rotated this in my nightly routine alternating with my retinol and didn’t feel like it irritated my skin. If you are a person whose used to actives I think you’ll be fine as long as you back off other actives in your routine. Yes it does have a strong smell, but I don’t particularly care if the product works well. Does what it says!
