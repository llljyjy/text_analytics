First off, it’s comprised of all the necessary ingredients that target dark spots and hyperpig. I always look for these specific ingredients and it’s hard to find one product that has them all in one. I know folks have mentioned a smell- yes there is one but realistically, the formula is straight up clean and effective and it doesn’t surprise me that there’s a smell. For me it’s tolerable and based on the impact I’m noticing it’s worth it. Discoloration needs chemical help (if you do peels or other in office treatments) none of that stuff smells good either. This stuff is legit. I personally get away with the smaller size. A little goes a LONG way so if you’re on the fence, try the smaller tube. I highly recommend this. I like this stuff
