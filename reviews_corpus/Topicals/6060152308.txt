Currently can’t smell due to COVID so I’m not sure on the smell. But this really works. It cleared my dark spots and acne I had stubborn black heads on my cheeks and chin that would just not go away. And I have tried almost every product from Sephora/ulta you name it I’ve tried it. So far all that works for me is dermelogica and Paula’s choice and now this ! Loved it 10/10 !! I find it works best when used on clean skin. I skip toner and apply before bed only ! In the morning I’ll wash my face with dermelogicas cleaner and apply sun screen from Elta md. cleared my skin ! 🫶🏼
