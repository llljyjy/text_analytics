Absolutely love this. Saw results after the first use on old acne scars & active acne. Size, darkness and bumpiness all progressively decreasing. It is now an absolute staple in my routine. Pairs beautifully with the Peace Out retinol stick, INKEY Niacinamide and the rest of my products. A little pricey but glad to see they have a mini-size. As for the smell - itâ€™s not THAT bad. You kinda get used to it. An incredibly small price to pay for the results you see. 10/10 Obsessed
