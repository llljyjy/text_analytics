I love this stuff.  I had some random acne scars and overall uneven skin tone from the winter and within a few weeks my skin was much more bright and even.  Smells like rotten eggs but effective.  The less you rub in the product the less the smell so just evenly distribute as best you can without rigorous rubbing. glowing skin with a side of smells
