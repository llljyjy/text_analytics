This product smells. I’d describe it as a weird cherry powder smell. Even after I layer my other products on top (including my sunscreen) I can still smell the cherry smell on my face hours later. I can’t speak to any efficacy towards fading anything on my skin nor skin brightening because I can’t stand using it. If you are ok with this smell then go for it, if not. Stay away. lingering candy cherry smell
