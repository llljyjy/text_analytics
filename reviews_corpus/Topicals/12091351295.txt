This product is great, if you have any kind of acne hyperpigmentation this stuff does a great job of getting rid of it, especially if it’s brand new, it really speeds up healing time. As some have mentioned the smell is not great but having used other products for pigmentation, like the Differin Hydroquinoine gel, it seems to be a trend with this kind of product. It’s not off-putting enough that it bothers me. Ultimately you’re looking at a choice between a product that really works, or a slightly unpleasant smell. I’ll take the product that works every time. Only complaint would be the packaging, it can be a bit wasteful as it sometimes dispenses too much which often happens with this type of metal tube packaging, something with a pump might be nice but isn’t a dealbreaker. Great for hyperpigmentation
