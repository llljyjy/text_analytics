This product works really good! I’ve been putting it on dark spots at night and in the morning they are less noticeable. This has helped with hyperpigmentation as well around my cheeks throughout the couple weeks I’ve been using it. The only thing is I have a really hard time getting the seal off, but other than that it works! Loveeee!!
