This is my before and after , after 14 days of use. Wasnâ€™t able to do a month before and after because my airline lost my baggage and so my serum got lost :(. Anyways , really recommend this product , the smell is kinda funky but I got used to it after 2-3 days of use. I used the serum every night and these are the results of 14 days of use from my experience. I took pictures to track my progress and I definitely saw a difference so 10/10 recommend will be repurchasing soon. GET IT!
