I’ve hade this for about 10 months now and about 2 weeks in the aluminum/foil tube packaging resulted in cuts at the bottom of the tube from basic folding. I used tape to close them off but there’s the occasional leak. I’ve seen noticeable results in the beginning but I think the effectiveness of the product deteriorated because of holes. Like the product and mission of topicals but wish I could of had a better experience. Bad Packaging
