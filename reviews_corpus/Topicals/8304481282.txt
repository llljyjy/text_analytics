I really love this product! I have noticed that my skin is more even and glowy since using it. I originally started using a pretty small amount to just my hyperpigmentation, but now I slather it on (ok maybe like 4 pea size dots) all over my face and that’s when I started noticing a difference. And I use it every night as the first thing to go on my face after washing.At first, the smell was kind of off putting, it does have a sulfury smell, but I found that the smell disappeared after applying my moisturizer and oil. And now I don’t even notice the smell when I use it.I haven’t had any break outs from using it, and I started using it everyday when I first bought it. I don’t think I have sensitive skin, there are some things my skin is more sensitive to, but faded serum is not one of them!I recommend! Love!
