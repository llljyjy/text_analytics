I will start off by saying that I think it’s too soon to leave a review, but I would otherwise forget to do so, so based on how long I’ve had this I will give it 3-stars: it’s solid. What I like: it does not irritate my skin & has a nice, smooth texture. What I don’t like: the SMELL! Reminds me of hydroquinone products. It does not fade on me, so I’ll usually pair it with moisturizers that have a slight fragrance to them. What I don’t know: whether it’s truly effective at fading hyperpigmentation. Scars fade naturally on their own, so i can’t say for sure whether the scars I’ve had faded because of this product, or because of the timing, or because of other products I use when I’m not using this (e.g. retinol or vitamin c). I like the ingredients in this product, so I’m going to continue using it until I feel it’s run its course. I use this on my body as well as my face. I’ve only been using this sparingly for about a month; we’ll see! I can’t yet recommend it because of this, especially since the smell might be  bit off-putting for some; however, it doesn’t hurt to try, especially to support a black-owned brand. I’ll Give it More Time to Work!
