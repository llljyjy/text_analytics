the first few times of trying this, I was a bit wowed, tbh. I would apply at night and in the morning I will find my face glowing. although the effect faded over time. I started using this once a week and worked my way up to everyday. I use it either night or morning. I am not seeing dramatic results yet though, I have dark eye circles and some freckles high on the cheeks, and some post pimples marks on my jaw. none of these discolourations have lightened so far after 2 months of almost daily use. but because the ingredients are so good and well researched, I just bought the full sized tube again. I am hoping I will see results in 4 months. Re the smell that some find offensive, is not overpowering. the smell. while medicinal is not headache triggering or nauseating like perfumed creams are. I am actually highly sensitive to artificial smells and get nauseous and dizzy around strong perfumes, but this cream is absolutely fine with me. If you use this cream as a treatment expecting medicinal smell, you will be fine. also, a small tube lasts quite a long time. glow at first, stalled thereafter
