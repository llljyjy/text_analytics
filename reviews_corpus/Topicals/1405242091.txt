i have mild rosacea and sometimes develop breakouts on my forehead (little white heads) was curious how this would work as a friend said it did wonders for her! $38 is amazing price for this. it’s smelly but doesn’t linger. i noticed after one use it reduced my redness and calmed my skin. doesnt irritate and is not drying. try oit! works! great price!
