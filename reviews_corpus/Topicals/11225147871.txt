This topical cream is amazing. I’ve been using it for almost a month now and my skin has already cleared up so much. I have some freckles around my eyes and forehead that have lightened up A LOT since I started using this. Mind you, I do use retinol as well but I’ve been using that for like 2 years now and the biggest change on my skin happened after I started using this. I use this at night (alternating nights w retinol). Cons: smell is pretty bad as everyone has said but you get used to it. The first time I used it I couldn’t handle it but now I am used to it. The smell does fade (gets milder; doesn’t go away) after a few minutes. Another con is that it is drying my skin. I notice the difference during the day time the following day as my skin feels very dry. Because of that I am not sure if I would be able to use it in the winter. So far, pretty great. 4.5 stars (-0.5 bc of bad smell and drying effect). Helps w freckles!
