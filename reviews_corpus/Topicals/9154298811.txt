Works, but I had to use it in moderation. The first 3 weeks I definitely noticed a difference in brightness. I had two bad scars from nose piercings; the oldest scar cleared up a lot faster than the newer one. However after seeing how quickly it started to clear my scarring up I began to apply it all over my face and broke out. It’s better to apply only on certain scars vs the entire face. Not sure if I will purchase again but it definitely does work, it’ll also break you out. Works but..
