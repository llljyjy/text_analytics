Yes, it smells bad. Like rotten egg o gravy. I’ve been using this for over a week and noticed a slight difference in my dark spots. I also started to break out in places I normally don’t and wake up the next day with small red bumps on the face. Wondering if this product has anything to do with that. I’m debating whether I should keep using it or not. Thank God I bought the mini version and didn’t spent $40 on this. nan
