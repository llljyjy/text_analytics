I was soooo excited to try this product after a BAD breakout last year (still have many PIEs). I have noticed that it improved my PIE. I do have to stop sometimes when my skin gets irritated. The experience isn’t great though.... The smell really isn’t that bad... people are exaggerating... but it leaks a lot which is frustrating because you end up waisting some of the product and I always have a crust of dried product... The product is good, the packaging not so much. Product good, packaging not.
