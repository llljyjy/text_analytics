After using it twice a week for about 2 or 3 weeks, then every other night for the last 3 weeks, I’ve noticed a massive improvement in my skin’s overall appearance! Skin now has very little texture, faded hyperpigmentation, and almost zero breakouts where I used to have many. The improvement really came when I began wearing sunscreen during the day. I wasn’t expecting it to help with the zits, but am very pleased. I will be purchasing the full size. Surprising break-out buster
