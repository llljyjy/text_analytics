Does this smell like burnt hair? Yes. Is it still a very nice product? Also yes. I have rosacea and sensitive skin that I’ve been slowly desensitizing over the years as much as I can. I especially love azelaic acid, which this has. I use this once a week at the moment with plans to bump it to twice a week soon — I skip my retinol and any other acids on the day(s) I use it, and just follow with a basic moisturizer and SPF. It’s great! And the smell doesn’t linger for more than a minute or so. nan
