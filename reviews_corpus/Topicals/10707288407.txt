Really effective product. I’ve been using for two-three weeks thus far and have been impressed with the dark spots fading on my cheeks so far. The smell isn’t great but not lasting and I definitely prefer it to be fragrance free. So far this is the best discoloration treatment I’ve used to date. Also powerful to use this in the AM and retinoids in the PM. nan
