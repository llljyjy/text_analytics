On Day 7 already seeing results! I’m afraid to say it because I don’t want to jinx it but this is probably the best my skin has looked in such a short amount of time I am extremely happy with this product I’m about to buy my second to just to make sure I have it so that I don’t run out. And trust me I know because I would use hydrocortisone for dark spots both 2% hydrocortisone and 4% hydrocortisone and this works better than both. My overall skin is extremely smooth which is blowing my mind. If you are a black woman with hyperpigmentation stubborn dark spots I would say 100% purchase this product ASAP! Oh and the smell is not bad at all I don’t know if they maybe change the smell but it has no smell. Black women purchase this product ASAP!!!
