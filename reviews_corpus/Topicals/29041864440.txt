I’ve had acne for a few years, and I’m prone to picking it and causing some scaring. This product didn’t take long before I noticed some change in my acne scaring, but the smell… PUTRID. It was so bad I almost gagged the first time I got a whiff of it. But for the good results, it might be a small price to pay. If you can get past the gnarly fumes it’s definitely worth a try :) nan
