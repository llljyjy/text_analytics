Yes, it smells like sulfur. That’s not the issue for me. It has fragrance (not listed here or the website, but on the box. Ethylene brassylate, look it up) AND the ingredients on the box are very different than the website and what’s listed here on Sephora. On their site and here on Sephora, it lists coconut oil; nowhere to be found on the box though. Also on the box, some of the things that are supposed to be helpful - azelaic acid, kojic acid, alpha arbutin - are listed AFTER shea butter and jojoba oil...This whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth for $46. The two stars were for the potential. Deceiving
