I never review anything but felt compelled because I almost returned this unopened because of all the bad reviews. The smell is not that bad. It doesn’t smell good, but it’s not nearly as bad as some reviews make it seem. It’s very tolerable and it also fades pretty quickly.Also, this stuff works. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks and I already see a difference. When I get a breakout the red marks linger for months sometimes a year or more. My first week I used it every other day and then I went to nightly. I had 2 new breakouts right before I started using this product and it has since faded the red marks to practically nothing. If you have skin that easily discolors from a breakout this stuff is for you. Ignore the reviews focused on the smell and at least give it a try. It actually works!
