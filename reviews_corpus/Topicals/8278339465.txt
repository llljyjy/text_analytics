My skin looks amazing! I have hormonal acne and this has helped so much! It definitely takes a while to see results and you have to use it consistently but 100% worth it. The only downside is that the smell is awful but after a week I didnâ€™t really notice it anymore. Overall will definitely repurchase. nan
