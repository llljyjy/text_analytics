I’ve used this serum for about a month and I am very impressed with the results. I do not normally get a lot of acne, but any pimple I get leaves a red mark for months. My skin is also pretty sensitive. I used Retin-A for anti-aging for 2 years but stopped 3 months ago because I think I did a number on my moisture barrier. I started out using Faded every 2-3 days for the first 2 weeks. I had no irritation or breakouts. I now use it 5-6 days a week and my skin looks the best it has in awhile. My PIE has faded (not totally gone, but enough that I stopped wearing foundation and now just use a bit of concealer); my skin is glowing; and my forehead lines seem to have softened (but that could be due, in part, to the fact that my moisture barrier is no longer compromised). I believe I have the reformulated version - it has a distinct smell - but it’s not bad at all. I’m really surprised at how effective Faded seems to be, while also being non-irritating. I’ve recently learned that my skin loves niacinamide - I use TO’s 10% serum in the morning and Faded at night. It’s been a great combo for me. Impressed! Effective and Non-Irritating!
