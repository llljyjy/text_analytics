After giving birth to my daughter, I had some melasma (hyperpigmentation) around my eyes. not only has this cleared it up in the 6 months since I had her, it’s also cleared up very old acne and sun hyperpigmentation that I thought I would never be able to get rid of! Yes, the smell is bad, but it’s worth it and not very expensive, definitely recommend! Great for melasma!
