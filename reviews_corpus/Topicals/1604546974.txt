I tried this product and it works! I have a dark spot on the cheek and on the chin and it’s slowly fading away. I would recommend this product. I made the mistake to order it directly to the company because I payed like 27$ more because its was in US. I should bought it on Sephora. I will know it for next time. I didn’t know it was available here until today. I should’ve done more research! It works!
