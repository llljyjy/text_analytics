I started using this 2 weeks ago. My skin had a bad breakout session after I took some medications which left lots of discolouration and hyperpigmentations. I definitely see a dramatic difference with my skin tone and the texture. But ladies know that this product will help maintain your skin concerns not necessarily fix. I professional done dermaplanning and a chemical peel 2 days prior to start using FADED. Obviously itâ€™s a combination of all those treatments which helped me achieve the best result from this Topicals serum! Overall I see a visible improvement with my skin and really happy to keep using FADED! Works for medium/ Indian skin
