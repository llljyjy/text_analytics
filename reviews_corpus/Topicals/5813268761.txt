The dark spots on my face have significantly lightened since using this product. The smell is a little weird at first but you get used to it. I’d rather have a product that doesn’t smell the best that actually works than one that smells good but doesn’t do what it says. I was scared it would break me out but to my surprise it has actually helped with breakouts. I’ve tried to use it on my elbows and knees but I think because the skin there is a bit thicker it will take longer to work. It works!
