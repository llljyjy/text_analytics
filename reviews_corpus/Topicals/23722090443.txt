i’ve been using this product on and off (about 2 weeks on, 1 week off) because i notice that while it does help with fading acne scars, using the product (for me personally) more than about 2 weeks irritates my skin and can lead to more break outs. my suggestion is to use this every other night as to not damage the skin. i have acne prone sensitive and dry skin, so i think my advice would be best suited for people with similar skin type as me. i don’t regret buying this product but i feel that there may be other products that dont irritate and smell the way this one does. works in moderation
