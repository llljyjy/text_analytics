this product smells absolutely awful. it smells so bad. horrendous and itâ€™s like very concerning bc you almost feel like you put something rotten / rotting on your face. BUT if I use toner + this + moisturizer/sunscreen it leaves me with a beautiful glow, and it does help to fade my dark spots! they are much less noticeable. this ish stinks but works
