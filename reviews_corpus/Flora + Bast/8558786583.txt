I loved this & used a whole bottle! I did notice it sits a little heavy. With the being said, I wouldn’t recommend it before make up or on a hot day. However during the cooler months it’s fantastic! Hydrating, effective, & feels/ smells great! I’ll most likely get another bottle in a month or so. nan
