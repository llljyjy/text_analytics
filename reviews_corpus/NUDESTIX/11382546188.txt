I have been trying this product for a few weeks now and I must say it is one of my absolute favourites. It leaves my skin so silky and shiny looking while also making it smooth to the touch. My skin has never looked better! The smell of it isn’t too strong but still is very nice. I have quite sensitive skin and this stuff doesn’t irritate it at all, which is awesome. It is very hard to find products suited towards sensitivity. I use it daily, and nightly. I also put it in the mini fridge I have which helps with my rosacea when I put it on. I would recommend this to anyone honestly! Not one bad thing to say about it. Healthy looking skin? Yes please.
