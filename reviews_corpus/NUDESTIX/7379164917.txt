I gave two stars because there is really no white cast!But there’s… a red cast? I have a medium deep skin tone with yellow undertones. This sunscreen has a very noticeable RED undertone. I look like I’ve been kinda sunburned. So it doesn’t work well under makeup as it changes my skin tone. And when wearing alone, you can see that its odd.If this fits yours skin tone, it’s an amazing sunscreen! The only mineral sunscreen with no white cast on black people! You have a yellow undertone? This is NOT for you
