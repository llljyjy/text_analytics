The palest colour doesn’t have any tinting in it so it really isn’t any different than any other zinc based sunscreen. It goes on nicely but still has that heavy/oily feeling of a sunscreen. I wouldn’t use this everyday, only when I’m going to spend time outside. I also don’t think it’s worth the price if you have light skin. But I’ll definitely use the bottle I got for free from Bzzagent. nan
