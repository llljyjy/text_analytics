I love that the box it comes in is biodegradable and the ingredients list is minimal. It applies well and doesn’t leave a white cast or have that heavy feeling so it doesn’t feel like I just applied sunscreen. Unfortunately that’s about where all the good ends for me. I’m quite fair skinned and need a lot more than an SPF 30 if I’m outdoors so this isn’t ideal for me to use daily if I’m spending any length of time outside. I wish for the price of the product that there was at least an option to get a higher SPF. I also found that this didn’t really allow my makeup to apply well over top. I don’t tend to wear much makeup daily, but I do apply concealer and that kept slipping and creasing when applied over this sunscreen. nan
