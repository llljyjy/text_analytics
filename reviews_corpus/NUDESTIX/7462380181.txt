The benefits of this product is it leaves the skin feeling smooth and brightens it producing a glowing effect. Compared to other products the instructions could be improved by indicating how long one should leave it on their face. It also doesn’t peal off, but is more like a scrub. It’s hard to apply and difficult to leave on the face without it falling off. I probably wouldn’t buy this product because it’s not easy to apply. I would recommend it to friends or family who want to brighten and smooth their skin and don’t mind creating a mess while applying the product. Difficult application
