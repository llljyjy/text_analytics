After reading other reviews on how dark the lightest tint available was I should have been forewarned. I self tan my body quite aggressively so I wanted a good amount of tint to add colour to my face but WOAH NELLY this is too much. Also the colour of the tint is like red?? Kinda sad cause the product itself was actually nice. Wouldnt recommend this shade unless you are a med/dark foundation. DARK
