I have very oily skin but I was trying this out while on Accutane when my skin was sooooo dry. I used it as a primer under my CC cream and it really hydrated my skin. I was never looking dry with this product which is a rare occurrence on Accutane. I wish the shade range was a bit wider. I received the medium colour and it’s pretty orange. It’s easy to cover the orangeness with some foundation and concealer but I find sometimes the orange peaked too much. Nice for dry skin!
