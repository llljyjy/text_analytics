I have been trying out alot more skincare and peels recently since I started noticing dark spots around my forehead and undereyes. I Have been through quite a few trial and errors with different peels, than I was introduced to the Nudestix Lemon-aid detox & glow micro peel.  This exfoliating detox peel is a game changer for me in skincare. Ingredents include niacinamide & hyaluronic acid as well as lemon and apple peel oils. Its a light weight formula with a creamy gel like texture and a clean fresh lemon/vitamin C scent thats not overpowering but quite nice. It cleans/exfoliates and detoxifys my skin while clearing out all the dirt and oil that has accumulated in my pores. Its so easy to use, but does flake off so you will want to be right over the sink or use just before you shower like I do.  I cleanse my skin first because I’m shocked at how much extra makeup is pulled out from my pores when I use the lemon-aid detox. Its really satisfying to see what was left over when I thought my skin was clean. It has a pilling effect while massageing it into my skin that removes the dead skin cells and dirt. Im shocked to see my foundation colour come out of my pores into the peel as I’m rubbing it over my skin after I’ve already cleansed my face. I use it 3-4 times a week and my skin feels so incredibly soft and smooth afterwards. Its absolutly a 10/10 win for me in skincare products. If your looking for brighter glowing skin thats clean and refreshed than definatly pick up this gem. Brighter and softer skin
