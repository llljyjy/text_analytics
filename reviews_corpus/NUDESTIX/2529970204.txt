I received the Nudescreen Daily Mineral Veil SPF 30 in Shade Warm by NudeStix from #BzzAgent and I love this awesome multi-use product! This lotion literally can be used as a hydrating moisturizer, skin-tint, makeup primer, and sunscreen (SPF 30). It is so moisturizing and adds such a natural glow to your skin. At first it comes out a little dark but it really is perfect - it just blends in with your skin tone adding a nice colour and shine. Perfect for days where you just want a light coverage tint, with sunscreen and all day hydration. I also really appreciated the pump-style tube!Highly Recommend #freesample #freeproduct #review #skincare #nudestix #nudescreen #SPF30 Awesome Multi-Use Product to Have with You!
