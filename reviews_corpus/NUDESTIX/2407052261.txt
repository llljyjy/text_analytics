I been using this product for the past 2 weeks and can say that my skin felt soft, refreshed, bright and evened out my skin tone. I use it twice a week and seen changes to my skin. I do however think the scent is a bit strong for my liking. I prefer my skincare products to be a bit lightly scented. I would recommend others to try, because it is a great product. Great product
