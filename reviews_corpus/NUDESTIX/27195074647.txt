I love this product not only does it smell like a lemon dessert but it makes your skin glow so much like your sitting out on the lake side in the summer time. This product is alot like the Peter Thomas Roth micro peel, but with a much better scent. I love the way that your dead skin start coming off immediately and bunching up on your skin like little pieces of lint. Your skin instantly feels refreshed and clean and ready for the day, I would definitely recommend this product it was a blast testing this out Smells so good!!
