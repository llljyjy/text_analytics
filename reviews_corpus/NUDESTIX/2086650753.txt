How does this product compare to other products you’ve tried?I dont think that I have used a three in one product before (moisturizer, primer, and sunscreen). I like that it is a high spf. I prefer to protect my face from the sun. Scent wise, it is neutral/plastic scented. Not a horrible scent and it fades after 15 or so minutes. However, I wear different foundations and not all foundations work well with the product. It does blend on the face well when applied without any other products. Lastly, there is minimal white cast - depends on how much is applied. I have not see much of a difference regarding acne or other skin concerns.What are some benefits of owning this product?A benefit is the multi purpose. It’s great not having to use multiple products in a routine. Usually there tends to be a waiting period to let everything dry and then some products don’t blend well. So, overall, having one product without application issue is great. Another benefit is that it is white/clear. I can still apply foundation, if I’d like. I am also tried to put it in my hair part because often the scalp gets burnt from the sun. It did not seem to leave the area grease but I am worried about getting oily hair sooner. I know the purpose of this product is not for the hairline/part but it could be an added benefit - rather than using a regular sunscreen there. Would you buy this product?I would buy the product. However, it is a bit expensive. Also, I am not sure how long the tube will last for. If I am using it daily, it may not last too long . Would you recommend this product to your friends or family?Yes, I would recommend the product to family and friends. I wonder how the white cast will appear on darker tones. I am quite pale so it is okay. It also makes me wonder Der about when I tan my face - what will happen. Also, some family and friends are scent sensitive - not sure if they would like the scent. New staple?
