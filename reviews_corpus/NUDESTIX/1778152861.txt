I really love the smell of this product, and it works pretty well for cleansing my skin, though i need to use an abrasive cloth and lots of moisturizer after using it, or my skin will get very dry and flaky.The formula is very messy, and a bit misleading — I can see from other reviews that people are under the impression that the balled-up gunk that forms is their skin coming off. This is not the case. My first guess is that it cellulose (AKA sawdust) was a main ingredient, and sure enough it’s the third ingredient on the list. The chunks make a big mess and will fall off your face while you wash, so you definitely need to do it over the sink. Overall I think the product is okay, but would probably be more useful in the summer when my skin isn’t as dry. Works okay, but a bit misleading
