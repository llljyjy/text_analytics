I’ve been a huge fan of Nudestix makeup for ~ 2years now. My skin is on the drier combination side, especially as I age. While I’m not trying to “solve“ for anything, I do find myself needing to reassess my skin care regime as I age & the seasons change. My nose/surrounding area is always the most clogged & the more traditional scrub I was using wasn’t as effective as I’d hoped in clearing my pores & brightening my skin. I remembered I had a few samples of Nudeskin Lemon-Aid Detox & Glow & so I used them over the course of a week (3x) & loved the results so much I not only bought the full size Lemon-Aid but the whole skin care line (minus the wipes, $30 is just too expensive for a face wipe!)! I LOVE this product - gentle, effective, brightening. 3x/week at night after I wash & dry my face. great product
