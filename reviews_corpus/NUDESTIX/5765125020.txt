I have never tried a tinted sunscreen before as my expectations  were that it would be sticky and heavy.  This daily mineral veil is perfect for the summer.  Not only is it SPF 30 but it is so smooth and bendable.  It is the prefect everyday application.  I love that it is also reef safe so it would be great on vacations or beach days.  This lotion is so easy to apply and can be used in so many ways.  I do have to say that while I am usually a warm color it is a little dark at the moment so i would definitely recommend going down a shade.  But because it is so bendable it works great otherwise.  I have been using this as an everyday moisturizer and will very likely be repurchasing! Suns out, Nudescreen on!
