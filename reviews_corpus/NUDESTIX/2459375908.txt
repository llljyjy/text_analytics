The application is easy and smooth on the skin, it leaves a deewy finish. I apply it sometimes alone as a moisturizer and sometimes over my moisturizer as a primer. Its real multitask product, i like the fact that sunscreen is included, most of the time when doing my makeup I dont want or have time to cake up 5 layers of products on my face, Serum, moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, foundation, powder etc its a lot with this product 3 layers are combined to 1. The product creates a nice base for makeup or can be worn alone as a sunscreen and moisturizer. Its important to always protect your skin from the sun especially your face its so delicate, you dont want premature wrinkles or skin damage. I got the tint: cool which is basically colourless. Its a nice touch that the box packaging is biodegradable.I love the fact that its reef safe.  I would recommend this product! nan
