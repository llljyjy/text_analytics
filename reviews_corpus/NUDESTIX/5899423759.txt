I am loving this!!! After removing my makeup I go in with this micro peel a few times a week. My skin is feeling so soft & looking so bright and smooth.  I definitely recommend trying this out! It has a great fresh sweet lemon scent and feels great on my skin. Itâ€™s gentle and not at all irritating. I love how hydrating it feels and my skin feels incredibly soft and smooth after. I love Lemon-Aid
