I really like the light and hydrating texture of this formula. I prefer using tinted primers or moisturizers rather than fuller coverage foundations because I hate looking cakey but like the little bit of added color. Bonus points that this product has SPF and is protecting my skin during the day! My only complaint is that I have a light-medium complexion normally, and admit that the tint “Hot“ is a bit dark for me. I am able to blend it in, but the medium tan color would have been better. Other than that, I think this product is fabulous and might be my next skin/makeup staple! Dreamy formula and the perfect tint!
