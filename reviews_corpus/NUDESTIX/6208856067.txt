I have been able to try this out a couple of times, and got the shade warm. I am fairly light so when I first pumped this out, I thought it would be too dark. However I was pleasantly surprised that it added a sheer warm glow to my skin. In all it seemed to protect from the sun, but I couldnâ€™t use as much as I normally would with sunscreen due to the tint, which is the reason why I removed 1 star. It was nice that there was no scent to it, which is nice for my sensitive skin. Lightweight & god for sensitive skin
