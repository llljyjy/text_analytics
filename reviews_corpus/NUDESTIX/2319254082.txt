I loved getting the chance to try out this daily moisturizer from bzzagent.  It’s been working wonders on my skin so far.  It has a light scent which I enjoy compared to other moisturizers I’ve used in the past.  I find it works very well for a night mask too.  I wake up looking and feeling moisturized and dewy.  It also never hurts to have vegan ingredients such as yuzu and tumeric.I’m going to have to repurchase when I run out of this tube and I definitely recommend it to all my friends. Awesome!
