Iâ€™ve been using the trio for about a week and I really enjoy the balm and micro-peel. The balm removes all of my makeup very effectively and the peel leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh. I especially love that the peel feels gentle enough for daily use. The moisturizer also does its job well and has kept my skin hydrated during the current dry winter climate. nan
