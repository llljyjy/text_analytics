I was given this product as a sample and i will definitely be repurchasing it. The first time I used the product it burned a little bit, but that hasnâ€™t happed since. Using it twice a week I have noticed my skin is softer, more even and has a glow to it during the day. The only thing I dislike about this product is the scent. It is a very strong lemon scent. Glowing skin but strong smell
