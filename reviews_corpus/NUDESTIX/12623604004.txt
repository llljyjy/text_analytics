Wow. So glad I decided to try the sample I had of this from a recent purchase. My skin had been feeling so dry & flakey from this Canadian winter weather, and as soon as I used this for the first time, it exfoliated away all of the dry patches and cleared out my pores. My skin was left looking so clear and glowing and has never felt softer. I usually stay far away from scented products, but this was such a light, fresh lemon scent that wasnâ€™t too overpowering. Had to buy the full size right away! Kiss Dry Skin Goodbye!!
