The product is also handy and lightweight.It is good for any combination acne-prone skin like me. It doesn’t irritate skin and I love how its not drying out my skin after use, just supplement some moisturizer or oil after using it. It makes my skin soft and reborn. It exfoliates within 2-3 minutes and removes possible dead skin, oils and dirt. It brightens the skin giving my skin a radiant glow after.
