I have been using this mask for one week now, every 2 days, as instructed. I really like this product! I honesty didn’t expect it to be such a great exfoliater but omg! It really does a wonderful job at removing all of the dead and dry skin and leaves your skin feeling so fresh and soft once you wash it off. I haven’t really noticed any major improvements in my skin during the one week but it may take some more time to see long lasting results. Still, I highly recommend this exfoliater mask. The smell is also amazing and fresh. Will definitely buy this in the future!! nan
