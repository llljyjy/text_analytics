Love this moisturizer. It is a lovely texture, and absorbs nicely into the skin without leaving a tacky residue. It has a very subtle scent, not too strong but really nice. I would buy the other products they make. I like that the ingredients are clean and how my face feels after using it for almost a month. Great clean moisturizer
