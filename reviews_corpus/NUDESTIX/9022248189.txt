This product is really nice! I’ve used it both as a cleanser and exfoliator. It feels good on my skin and leaves it feeling refreshed and clean afterwards. The only downside is it seems to strip my skin of moisture, so I’d recommend following it immediately with a good moisturizer. A nice cleanser/exfoliator!
