This product is pretty good! Smells nice and citrusy and feels good on the skin. It’s a bit thick so a little goes a long way. I find you need to wait a bit before applying makeup since it’s a tad greasy, but it does dry down. I prefer to use it as a mask or thicker moisturizer at night time, but it does work for both. It feels quite luxurious and I’ve been enjoying using it! Pretty good moisturizer!! Feels good on the skin!
