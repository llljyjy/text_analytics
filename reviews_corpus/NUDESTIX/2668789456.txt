Initially I received the wrong shade for the Nudestix Nudescreen Daily Mineral Veil SPF 30 in the Warm shade. I still decided to try it out because I was curious about this interesting new product. The coverage was pretty good, it blended in very well on my skin and covered many of my imperfections. The consistency of the product was light and didn’t leave my skin feeling sticky, oily or heavy. I liked the subtle scent of the product as well. The ingredients were unique and natural: containing green algae and polyphenol, among other things. I absolutely love that this product is 100% reef safe and biodegradable. This product is fitting for my skin color due to the built in SPF 30, so that’s another plus. I will definitely be trying out Nudescreen in the Cool shade for my super pale skin! Long lasting coverage
