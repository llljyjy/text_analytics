I love this product , applies nicely , blends and absorbs quickly with not greasy residue left behind and not peeling,  works well under make up .My only complains are that the shade warm is a bit orange still for me now , but Iâ€™m sure in summer will look a lot  better  on my tan skin and the second I wish we got more product for the price .
