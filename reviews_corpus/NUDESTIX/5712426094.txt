I the no tint one and it’s perfect to use daily. I go on long car rides for my business and the sun is always hitting my face. I can feel a layer of protection when using this. I apply it after my moisturizer and it’s applies easily. I had read bad reviews about the tinted ones but I would definitely recommend the no tint one to my family & friends. Would definitely purchase  it again as well. tint free nudescreen
