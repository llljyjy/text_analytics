Haven’t even removed the seals or tried the product yet . Probably going to return because it’s clearly a waste of money.  $30 and there is barely any product in the tube’s it’s all air. I’ve gotten free samples with more product then this. Like seriously just in this order alone my free samples are better then this. I knew these would be small but clearly looking at them in person and then the images online. It’s deceiving. It’s almost hard to tell but these bottles are shorter and maybe wider, with different caps and practical empty and filled with air. The price for what you get does not match up, this is not worth $30. I’m not even sure if it’s worth $10 because your paying for packing and air. I’m really bummed out because I would of liked to try the product, to see if I’d buy the full versions . Because I haven’t removed the seals on the tubes the images I’m sharing make the bottles look fuller then they are. In person you can tell what’s air and product and these bottles are practically empty. Maybe enough product for one use. That’s not worth $27 plus tax so $30. Save yourself the money and go into a sephora store and see if they have free samples of this. Im sure the samples they give you will have the same amount if not more product in them. Deceiving  and a waste of money!
