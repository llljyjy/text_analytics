As the title implies, I didn’t think there was anything special about this product. It left a bit of a white cast — I’m more tan, but might be better on someone with paler skin. It also had this slight metallic smell, maybe I’m overly sensitive. I applied it all over my face, and under/on my nose and it bothered me all day. There are much better facial sunscreens/primers out there for the same cost or less (ie. supergoop unseen) Just alright
