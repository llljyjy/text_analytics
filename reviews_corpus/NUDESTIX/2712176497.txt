Overall I feel as though these do a really good job when it comes to hydration. Very lightly scented which is nice. The moisturizer isn’t greasy so it can be used right before primer which is really nice. I love make up removing balms and this one doesn’t disappoint. My only negative comment is i felt as thought you don’t get a lot of product, once you open it and squeeze out the product, you realize half of it is air. Overall good quality product and would recommend, especially to have as a travel skin care kit. Great for travel!
