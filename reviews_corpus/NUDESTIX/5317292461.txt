This is the perfect travel kit. The make-up melt is great, it removed my waterproof mascara easily, did not irritate my eyes and felt silky smooth on my skin. It completely wiped off my layers of face makeup as well.  Only a dab was needed. For once, I did not have to double cleanse!The micro-peel is refreshing, it smells great and it gives the skin a great detox, I love this product.Lastly, the daily mosturizer is good, but it is the only product I am not as much of a fan of. It is VERY moisturizing, maybe a little too much for my skin, or perhaps I just need to use less product. It smells nice and really hydrates well.When travelling, this is a great kit to use! Practical packaging, fresh scents and great products. Definitely recommend these products
