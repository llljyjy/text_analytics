The clean balm and make up melt are okay. I found it a bit drying after rinsing it off, but I’d say a 4/5 for makeup removal. This product of the three has the strongest citrus smell. The micro-peel is really good. I felt a noticeable difference in my skin’s texture after removing the peel. It is messy so make sure you’re using it over the sink. It does say use 3-4 times a week, but I’d say more like 1-2 because of how efficient it is. The moisturizer is smoothening and great. Thicker than your average moisturizer — good for those with dry / combination skin. Overall, I really like the peel and moisturizer; I could go without the melt/balm. But as a package, it could be a great gift or something to try! nan
