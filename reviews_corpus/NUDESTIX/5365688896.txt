I like this set- I received it for free for testing purposes. There’s nothing wrong with it but also nothing too special about it. The peel and moisturizer smell decently good and although I personally dislike all makeup remover balms, I can’t deny it did the job taking everything off. Overall I’d use this as stuff on the go or for travel purposes but I don’t think I’d use it regularly nor would I repurchase. does the job
