I received a small size of each product to try out and I can say my skin didn’t have any reaction. It felt good on my skin but it does have a strong fragrance, which may turn some people way. I didn’t have much high hopes but it was pretty decent to try out. My favourite was the makeup melt balm - it had a really nice smell to it too! nudestix has skincare??
