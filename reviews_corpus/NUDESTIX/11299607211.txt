This sunscreen is awesome and so far, I have bee very impressed with itâ€™s performance! I will admit I am relatively new to using mineral sunscreen, but have tried several different brands so far, both high end and low end ones, and this Nudestix one blows them all out of the water. I received it in the shade cool, which is un-tinted, but even without the tint, it sinks in  so quickly and so nicely. Even right after applying, the white cast that often mineral sunscreens leave before sinking in was barely detectable with this one. I have quite a few layers of skin care that I wear on a daily basis and the sunscreen still melts into my skin really well and I have not seen any pilling. As well, I mainly wear it under makeup and have not had any issues applying that over top of it either.   Texture-wise, it does not even feel like a sunscreen either, it feels more like a moisturizer - there is no greasiness what-so-ever. I do have dry skin and so far my skin has really appreciated the added skincare ingredients too!  Overall, I have really enjoyed and appreciated the opportunity to try this sunscreen lotion, and I believe I would purchase it on my own too! This stuff is seriously amazing!
