I recieved this product for free to review and unfortunately ordered the wrong shade it seems for my skin tone. My intention was to use it as just a basic moisturizer with SPF - but once I put it on it was slightly too dark for my skin tone. I understand it is meant to be tinted but it was just maybe a shade too dark. The formula itself could benefit from a little bit of blending, felt thicker than previous SPF tinted moisturizers I have used before. I will give the product another attempt in the coming months as I get my tan on, have a feeling it will match my typical tan colour perfectly! If you can find your shade, I think it would be a great product for base coat in makeup or as a moisturizer on it’s own. However, it’s not as light weight feeling on the face as some others. First Impression - Meh. Will try again!
