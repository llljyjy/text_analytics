I have very dry skin so generally when I wear a sunscreen under my makeup, my foundation and concealer crack or pill and just don’t look very nice. The Nudescreen didn’t do anything like that, it went on/blended easy and felt very light on the skin and was moisturizing enough that my makeup didn’t flake. It helped make my skin look a little more glowy/dewy although, I did find that sometimes as the day went by, it progressively felt more and more oily/greasy on the skin and would get very shiny, so I would always have to wear it with a mattifying primer or a powder. As a whole, I think it’s a very convenient way to moisturize, prime and apply and spf which is perfect for a quick routine. If my skin weren’t as dry, I’d consider this an all-in-one for those days where I don’t feel like doing much with my skin prep. Because my skin is dry, I need a little extra help but I really love how it wears under makeup compared to other face sunscreens, so I’d probably buy it again (although the price is kind of high for the size). I’d recommend it more for normal, combo and dry skin but I’m not too sure how this would work on oily skin, I’m thinking it would make you very shiny so I’d maybe pass if you have oily skin. Good for dry skin and under makeup (no white cast)
