I received this product as a free sample and I tried for 2 weeks. I think the moisturizer is ok but not amazing. It has a very strong smell of orange that I like it, the cream is thick and it gives the skin a layer, like a mask. I don’t think the product is fully absorbed by the skin, and that’s why I didn’t like 100%. I prefer light products that I don’t feel after use there is something on top of my skin, and it’s not the case of this one.I didn’t notice any improvement in my skin. If you have acne or oily skin, I don’t recommended, but if you have a very dry skin, go for it!I don’t think I’ll buy this product after this one, because as a said, I’d rather light texture. But I’ll continue to use until the end and see if is going to do something better for my skin. Good for dry skin
