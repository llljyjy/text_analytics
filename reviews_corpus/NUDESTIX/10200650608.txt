This product is sheer with just enough colour if you’re looking for a natural look. I personally don’t like using super heavy/thick coverage face products especially in the Summer months so this is going to be great for the warm weather! The colour matched my skin perfectly and was really easy to apply. Can’t wait to see how well it protects my skin when the super sunny days roll around. I received this product for testing and reviewing purposes.* Sheer coverage + SPF!
