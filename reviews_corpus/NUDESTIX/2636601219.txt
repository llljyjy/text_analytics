I’m always looking to add more clean and vegan beauty skincare products in my own personal routine as well as in my kit for clients. I really love how this is perfect for busy on the go results to give you a smooth canvas to apply your skincare and makeup. In 2 mins or less (if you use it just as a scrub) you can remove all the dullness and be left with smooth skin to apply your skincare or even makeup. My skin had a natural glow to it, and I really loved the bursting smell of lemon. It was refreshing as it wasn’t perfume-y. I really love that this is a clean vegan product and found that it didn’t break out my sensitive skin. Definitely adding it both to my personal routine and to my kit for clients, for on the go, fast results. Clean, Vegan and delivers results!
