I really enjoyed this product! It looks like a cream but has a gel like consistency and really melts nicely into the skin. I love that it has tumeric in it which has both anti inflammatory and anti microbial properties because I have acne prone skin that has been going through it for the last few months. I found this did a great job of making my skin look brighter. The best part of this product to me is the multi functional use. I love when I can use a product as a moisturizer and a face mask in the evening for extra hydration. I definitely plan on repurchasing this product and would recommend it to anyone I know looking for a new moisturizer. love this clean skincare product!
