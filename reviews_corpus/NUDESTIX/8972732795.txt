I loved the finish of this sunscreen. It honestly did not feel like a sunscreen while applying and really sunk into my skin. At first, I was worried the colour was too dark however, after a few minutes, the colour oxidized and looked more like a natural healthy tan. I’m so glad that it did not irritate my sensitive skin as well which is a huge plus for me because I tend to have eczema in the presence of certain skin product with added fragrances. The added beneficial antioxidants was also a plus for me since most sunscreens with these kinds of benefits are not suitable for my sensitive skin. I take my skin health very seriously and religiously apply sunscreen every 2 hours outdoors. Reaplying this product a few times did not seem to be a problem especially since I wear foundation under my sunscreen as well. My face can still get red after some time under the sun even with sunscreen applied nevertheless, I was happy to see that this sunscreen gave me enough protection for several hours. I am very picky with my sunscreens and so the fact that it’s mineral based rather than chemical based is very important as mineral sunscreens offer better sun protection than the latter. Unlike most mineral sunscreens, its not a very thick formula and can easily blend into my skin without leaving streaks. I’d like to purchase the lighter version of the nudescreen to see how it would look on my skin without giving a tan look. Love the SPF protection with added tint
