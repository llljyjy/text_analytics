I’ve been using it for a few days and it applies very well. My skin did not react badly to it like it sometimes does. I’ve spent time in the sun without burning so it’s effective. The warm tint is a bit too dark at the moment, but i’m confident it will be okay later in the summer, and with makeup on top it, it corrects it all. Love this clean option
