This is now my daily go-to sunscreen; I have super sensitive skin and this doesn’t burn my eyes, break me out or dry me out! The “tint-free“ is still slightly tinted but it’s a perfect colour if you’re pale and this doesn’t leave a white cast! It feels super creamy and blends nicely on the skin, and actually leaves an incredible base for makeup. It does give a bit of a dewy finish, a bit more dewy than I’d like, but you can fix it with some setting powder no problem. Definitely one of the best mineral sunscreens on the market right now Favorite mineral spf!
