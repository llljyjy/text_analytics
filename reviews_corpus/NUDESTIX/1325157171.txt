I really loved this peel and will buy it for sure. This peel has a light lemon scent. The texture is really liquidy at first but then itâ€™s a little weird with the little gunk forming on the skin. But this works really well for my type of skin, which is oily. I find this peel helps clean my pores and exfoliates my skin quite well. My skin feels brighter and smoother. Bonus point for being vegan and the fact that the tube is recyclable and box is 100 percent biodegradable. I received this NUDESTIX NUDESKIN Lemon-Aid Detox & Glow Micro-Peel for free and exchange of my honest review. Gentle exfoliation for a brighter skin
