This product absorbed well and I loved the smell of it. Often I find face products to have overwhelming smells but this was summer to me so I loved it. It’s probably going to be my new “go to“ product as I really loved it that much. I also really loved how my skin felt after only a few days of using it. Definitely hydrated and softer feeling! I’ll definitely be sharing my experience with friends and family! Smells Like Summer
