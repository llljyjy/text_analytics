I have combination skin so Iâ€™m usually oily in the T-zone, while the other parts of my face are insanely dry. When I first applied this moisturizer, I loved the feel of it as it came out of the tube as it was very rich and thick yet absorbed immediately without leaving me looking greasy. My hands (which have been so dry and cracked due to using hand sanitizer so much) also benefitted from this moisturizer. I could see and feel that my hands were so much more hydrated and moisturized after just applying the cream to my face after the first time! I can see some people perhaps not being crazy about the Turmeric scent, but find the citrusy scent of the Yuzu generally overpowers the Turmeric and I rather enjoy the scent. This is a great moisturizer that I will continue to use and will recommend to friends! Very rich and luxurious moisturizer!
