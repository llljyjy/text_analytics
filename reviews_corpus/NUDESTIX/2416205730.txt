I got the product and I was a bit nervous when I saw the shade. I immediately thought this might be too dark but I wanted to try it because the description got me intrigued. When I put it on, it seemed to just sink right into my skin and almost camouflaged with my skin tone. I then put a very light layer of foundation and went out. My makeup stayed put for 8 hours! It didn’t budge at all and my oily skin was somehow controlled too. I don’t know what magic is in this veil but I am very pleased to receive it. I will try it again just on its own to see how it works throughout the day but as a base I love it!!!!! my new fav spf and primer!
