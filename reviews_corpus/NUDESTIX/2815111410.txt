I received this set free in exchange for a review. The micro peel was lovely and really left my skin feeling and looking fresh without being harsh. The moisturizer smelled wonderful but most importantly sunk in to my skin and left it soft without the greasy feel. The cleansing balm took off my makeup really well but stung my eyes so I wouldnâ€™t use that near that area at all. Great products for travel
