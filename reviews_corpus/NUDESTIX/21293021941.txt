Good size for trying out their products before buying the full sized ones, which I’m glad I did because the makeup balm was not for me--it smells like medicine and burned when it got into my eyes (which doesn’t happen with my other balm). I LOVE the moisturizer its perfect for really dry skin, it might feel heavy for those with oily skin...still don’t know if I like the peeling exfoliator yet, I like how gentle it feels and I think it pairs well with the moisturizer. Overall, I don’t think i need to buy the mini version again (it’d be good for travelling though), I’ll go with the full sized products now that I know what I like! nan
