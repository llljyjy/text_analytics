Love the cute bag that this 3-pc comes in, can definitely re-purpose it and use as a small makeup bag when travelling. My favourite of the 3 products would be the moisturizer. It left my skin soft and didn’t feel thick or greasy on application. The scent is a bit strong but I didn’t mind it too much. If you aren’t into heavy scents in your skin care products, definitely steer clear of this. The makeup remover worked well and I didn’t need to scrub very hard to remove anything. But again, the fragrance was a bit strong so may not be the best for those with sensitive skin. The micro peel was okay, didn’t find it was much different than other peels I’ve used in the past. Overall, I would recommend this product if you’re fine with scented products and have some money to spend. The price point for me is a bit high for the amount of product you get. Cute kit
