This is my first time using a micro-peel ever and I have to say I’m now addicted! My skin feels so much softer and smoother, I’ve actually noticed quite a difference in the texture of my skin and how much smaller my pores look. I am just starting to notice the effects of being over 40 and I really think adding the NudeStix Lemon-Aid and Glow Micro-Peel to my daily regime of skin care is going to be a game changer. I didn’t have any real expectation for how much this product would actually brighten and moisturize as well as lessen the appearance of my pores and just give my skin an overall refresher. I’m so glad I tried this product and the fact that’s it’s also vegan is amazing. Definitely try this product if you get a chance, especially you beautifully mature skinned ladies. Can't wait to try more!
