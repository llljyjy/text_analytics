Smells AMAZING and works well for my combo-acne prone skin. I use it twice a week and I can see a huge difference in my skin. It feels a lot smoother and my acne marks have been fading significantly. I am not a huge fan of peeling solutions but this is surprisingly gentle and I can feel skin peeling when I use this but I’m pretty sure that it’s all just the dead skin because it doesn’t hurt my sensitive skin. It’s my favourite exfoliation product and I’ll definitely be buying more of this to replace my old product! effective yet gentle
