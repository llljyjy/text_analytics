Super cute set!! I do like the fact that these come in an easy to travel with case & they are a good tester size!y favourite products out of the three are the exfoliater - I have sensitive skin so this super gentle exfoliater worked really well for my skin & left it feeling super soft! I also did kind of enjoy the moisturizer! It is quick thick but it definitely hydrates! Knocking off some stars for the cleansing balm & the really strong scent! The cleansing balm left a film which I felt like I couldnâ€™t get off no matter how hard I tried & I found that it did leave makeup residue. All in all would recommend 2/3 of the products - great tester set!! nan
