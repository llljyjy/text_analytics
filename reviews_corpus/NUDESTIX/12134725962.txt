I love sets, it takes a lot of my anxiety away from combining the right products together. The balm and the micro-peel are above average. The trio pack is the new addition to my skincare routine. - Citrus Clean Balm & Makeup Melt I do a lot of colourful makeup and the way the balm cleans the makeup away on the first try ! it didn’t leave a film-like feel to my skin. - Lemon-Aid Detox & Glow Micro-PeelThis peel is my favorite product out of the trio, it is gentle and gets the job done. It didn’t feel rough on my skin and I was left with smooth skin. - Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer: I tend to be wary of moisturizer because they usually burn, but this one didn’t burn, It has a great smell, and my skin didn’t feel greasy If you have sensitive skin like me, I definitely recommend it. The products are gentle and don’t irritate my skin. Even though I love the smells, I would love a fragrance-free version. glowing glowing glowing
