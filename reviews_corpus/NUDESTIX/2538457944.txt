I’ve thoroughly enjoyed testing this product out and will definitely repurchase! I have dry, sensitive skin so I tend to avoid scented products, though I didn’t have any breakouts or reactions to this moisturizer. It’s got a lovely, lightly herbal and citrusy scent that doesn’t linger. Consistency is somewhat thick, though it absorbs beautifully. I did notice a brightening effect after using this as an overnight masque for a couple of weeks as well as waking with a plump and hydrated complexion. Also, can we talk about the packaging being 100% biodegradable?! Love this! Lovely overnight mask!
