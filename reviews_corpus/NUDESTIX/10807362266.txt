This product has many beneficial features; itâ€™s 100% reef safe, has a clean formula, provides UVA, UVB, & blue light protection, and is made using vegan-powered extracts. While applying, I did find some pilling occurring at first but it was resolved as I continued to blend it into my skin. It leaves a beautiful glow that makes your skin look plump & healthy. It would work great as a primer or even on its own if you want a lightweight tint during the summer months. I would recommend this product to anyone that wants clean formulated SPF protection that leaves you with a natural glow. Natural Glowy Skin Tint
