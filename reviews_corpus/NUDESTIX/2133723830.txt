This product is moisturizing with a good mineral SPF and had absolutely no negative impact on my skin after use. I wish that there was a light tinted shade, as this one has no tint at all and if I am using just a sunscreen I prefer a higher SPF. Without makeup on top, it leaves a slightly dewy finish, which I do not mind. The product blends in and does not stay white or lighten my skin at all.Overall I think this is a nice product, and I really like the brand and the fact that it is reef safe. The pump packaging is great and will not leak in your purse or travel bag. nan
