After trying out this sunscreen for a couple of weeks, I can say that this is a good sunscreen. Not great, but definitely not bad. I’ve tried many face sunscreens and this one ranks closer to the top of the list, but it won’t replace my HG.This goes on a bit thick and greasy, but feels nice and weightless after it’s rubbed in. It takes awhile for the white cast to get fully blended in (COOL shade on light-medium skin tone). I absolutely hate the smell of the product. Due to the high zinc oxide concentration it just reminds me so much of zincofax. Luckily the scent only lasts during application and quickly dissipates. I really like the packaging: it’s a squeeze tube with a pump which makes it easy to take out exactly how much you need without causing a mess.Overall I’d say this is a solid everyday sunscreen that I can wear on no-makeup days or under a full face. nan
