This was really a great product for me. It left my skin smoother and softer. It is a micro peel, so you would notice some texture while using the product but that is completely normal. There is a lemon scent to this product, I really liked the scent. For me, it was refreshing and I like citrus based scents, so this was right up my alley. The packaging is also very cute and eye catching. I like that this entire product line from Nudestix has really great packaging and bold colours. It stands out in my vanity.However, if you have sensitive skin or donâ€™t like lemon, then I would not recommend this for you.Would purchase again. Effective cleanser with lemon scent
