Pleasantly surprised! As someone whose pores and melasma is bothered by chemical sunscreen I jump on every mineral SPF launch, and happy to report this is a winner. The Cool doesn’t leave a white cast and the Warm I use as a spf + skin tint in one. It is nourishing so I pair it with a light / oil free moisturizer. Come winter I think I’ll appreciate its texture/feeling even more so. nan
