I was very impressed with this eye cream. It’s a thick cream but it goes on so smoothly, doesn’t feel heavy on my eyes at all. A little bit goes a long way and I love that it doesn’t have any smell. I have been using it on my eyes and neck for about a week now. It keeps my eyes area hydrated throughout the day and night. I haven’t seen changes in my fine lines yet since I haven’t used it long enough. However, I do noticed that my neck has been firmer on day six. Will continue using it in hope to see more skin improvement. Hydrating Eye Cream
