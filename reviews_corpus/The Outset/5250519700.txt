Iâ€™m all about this night cream. The texture is nice and thick, yet not sticky. Absorbs easily. Absolutely perfect for this dry, colder weather. And there is no smell! My go to product for bed time now. Love waking up pretty with happy, hydrated skin. Also, little goes a long way. It will last. Love
