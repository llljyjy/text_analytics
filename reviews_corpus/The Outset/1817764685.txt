I received this complimentary from The Outset. I love the formulation of this product. Most eye creams are too thick for me but this one was light enough to not feel heavy. The only thing I would change is the dispenser puts out too much product at once, but I find this to be the case with most eye creams. Overall a good eye care product. nan
