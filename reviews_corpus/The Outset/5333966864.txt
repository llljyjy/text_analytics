If you’re wanting to try the products out without committing to full size, this set is perfect. Provides some good hydration and doesn’t leave the skin looking/feeling greasy or sticky. Even after 10 straight days of use I didn’t notice anything different, however, it worked well to help my combination oily skin. Overall I recommend. Good “Try Me” Set
