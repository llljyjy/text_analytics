The firming vegan collagen prep serum is a gel cream texture with a hint of earthy scent. It quickly absorbs onto my skin. The product feels very hydrating, nourishing and refreshing to the skin. It works well alone or layering with other serums. My new favorite serum. Complimentary from The Outset. nan
