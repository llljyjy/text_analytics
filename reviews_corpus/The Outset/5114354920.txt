Absolutely don’t buy. Based on the potency of ingredients, this will ultimately have no effect. This is definitely overpriced for what you get, and it has a terribly greasy feel. I would tell you all to never buy celebrity skincare, it’s upcharged and has zero benefits. There are so many alternatives that are far more effective, and if you like higher price points, I highly rec Skinceuticals and Josie Maran. Normally I like Asian skincare (lol), but this is terrible. Greasy and ineffective. Don’t buy celeb garb
