I had been wanting to try this brand since it was released. I’m happy to report it’s sensitive/dry skin approved. Both the serum and moisturizer are lightweight, but hydrating enough for my dry skin. The packaging is minimal, but elegant. I love these formulas, and I’m excited to see more launches from this brand. Simple and effective
