I have sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin. And I was recently struggling with dull skin that was getting oily by the afternoon. So I started looking for something hydrating but lightweight, with clean ingredients, and that wouldn’t break me out. Enter this serum. My skin looks and feels hydrated and smooth, I haven’t had any negative reaction, and it’s a reasonable price!! I noticed a difference after just one use, but it really gets better over time. I’ve already recommended this to at least 4 friends. Now it’s your turn to get it!! Already recommended to everyone I know
