I have been using this for two weeks, bought the kit directly from The Outset website myself. It feels like a nice thickness going on but after it “soaks” in, my under eyes feel dry. I will pass on a repurchase since I need to double up in eye cream to keep the hydration. Wouldn’t recommend when there are better options. Mature eyes beware
