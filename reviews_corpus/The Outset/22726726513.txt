I purchased this myself off the website as soon as it came out, I got the full sized set of 3. I have very acne prone, sensitive skin. I put this on under makeup and before my night skin care routine. It hasnâ€™t broken me out once. It soaks in very quickly and keeps my face moisturized. I really like this and already purchased the set again New stapls
