I’ve been enjoying this new 3-piece skincare set with The Outset! This is a great set for anyone looking for a low-key skincare routine or anyone who’s new to skincare. These aren’t really scented though they could just smell more ingredients based to me. Overall a nice set to try with these minis before committing to full size! nan
