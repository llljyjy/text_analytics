I have dry skin and had high hopes for this cleanser, but sadly it fell short.  It does a decent job at removing makeup, but it also strips my skin and leaves it really dry and tight.  Regular, drugstore micellar water performs better for me.  For the price, itâ€™s about on par with a drugstore cleanser. Not for dry skin
