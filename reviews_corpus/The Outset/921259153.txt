This was my first time trying this brand. I loved that it was clean, vegan, cruelty-free, and free of fragrance. The serum glided nicely and absorbed quickly into my skin. I could immediately feel how nourishing and hydrating it was, and I did not have any irritations. My skin felt soft, smooth, and soothed. I also enjoyed rubbing any excess on my hands. What I appreciated the most was that it did not leave any sticky residue. I was able to apply other products on easily. Overall, itâ€™s a great clean and hydrating serum. Hydrating
