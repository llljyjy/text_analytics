I think that this is such a wonderful hydrating serum however am concerned about the collagen claims since collagen is actually too large of a molecule to be absorbed into the skin and must be ingested. Aside from that I use this primarily for the botanical hyaluronic acid alternative as that helps to keep my skin hydrated the entire day. nan
