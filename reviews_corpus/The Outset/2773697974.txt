I was gifted this product by The Outset in exchange for a review. While I think discovery sets are really nice, I think the price point on this is really STEEP. It would be more worth it to purchase a full sized product instead of a mini product since the set retails for $50. The products are all very gentle and versatile/work for multiple skin types. I like each product a lot, but wouldnâ€™t recommend because of the price point. Expensive for a 10 day trial kit
