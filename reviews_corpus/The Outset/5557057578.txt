This starter set is fantastic! A great way to try out The Outset to make sure the products work for you and your skin type. I am combo/oily and found these those be perfect for my AM routine. The cleanser helped prep my skin and remove any build up and oils from the night before. The serum and the moisturizer work beautifully together and are absolutely made to go hand in hand. The serum just soaks into my skin, two pumps is plenty. And the moisturizer leaves me looking lit from within. Absolutely recommend and I can’t wait to get the full sized versions when I’m done with these. Fab routine for mid 30s combo skin!
