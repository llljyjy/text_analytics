After over two weeks of use of this alone and or with tretinoin, I feel this cream definitely evened out my skin, as was complimented to me. PROS….skin evening, less noticeable wrinkles from bakuchiol/ niacinamide, didn’t cause acne, helped a little with redness, helped with dry skin/ texture…soothing and rich. Didn’t cause a reaction when also using with retinoin (although I would make sure with a dermatologist).CONS.  Pricey  (is it worth the cost based on the benefits?). Cost is the reason I was close to giving 4 stars. I still don’t know if the value is worth the price I paid. Overall I may repurchase. My main hesitancy is the cost versus benefits. I do believe of course it could have more benefits and “good for the skin” ingredients. The only other more “expensive” cream I’ve tried is Kiels squalene and The Outset niacinimde cream is much better on my skin with many more benefits. If I compare it Cerave PM cream, in my opinion this product works better for dry skin and Works much better to even the skin tone noticeably while lessening appearance of wrinkles and possibly toning down a little redness. From my experience  that’s basically what I’m paying extra for here compared to Cerave pm cream. Cost versus benefits
