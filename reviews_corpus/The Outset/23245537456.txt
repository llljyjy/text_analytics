I was sent this by the brand in exchange for my honest review. They said they wanted this to be considered the white tee of skincare. Universal, classic, and simple. I think they pulled it off, no shade. The cleanser is a really neat texture, like jellyfish almost. It’s gelatinous. Super simple, doesn’t lather, or have a scent. It took off my excess mascara & didn’t strip me. The Serum is super plumping. I really enjoyed it. It was hydrating, plumping, and also didn’t have a scent. It absorbed quickly, not leaving it on top of the skin. Super smooth and I love it! The moisturizer, I honestly forgot about. I don’t remember how it was. Not bad or good. Would recommend. This is like a luxury Cerave or a Sephora LRP
