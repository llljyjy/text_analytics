My skin has been extra reactive and sensitive these past few months, with redness and extra dryness around my nose and mouth, and this serum is definitely helping to calm my skin down. I’ve been using this all over my face and neck and I really like how this soothes, hydrates, and brightens my skin. Also, this layers very well with other skincare products and under makeup, and I love that it has no scent. Definitely recommend trying out, I’ve just ordered my second bottle. Great serum for reactive skin
