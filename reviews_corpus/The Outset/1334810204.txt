The Outset (by Scarlett Johannson) gifted me The Prep Serum in exchange for my honest review.   It is a firming vegan collagen prep serum.  It is Allureâ€™s Best of Beauty Winner for 2022.  It helps to fortify the skin and prepares it for hydration leaving it firmer, smoother and plumper.  I use it after cleansing and before moisturizing in the morning and evening.  I use a few pumps and gently spread it on my face with my fingertips.  I really love that it is fragrance free.  It is a safe, clean, gentle formula free from harsh ingredients.  It absorbs well and does not leave any residue. After 10 days of usage my skin feels soft and smooth and has a nice glowy look. This is a wonderful serum. nan
