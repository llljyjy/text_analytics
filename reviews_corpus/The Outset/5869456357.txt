I have such dark circles and am always on the hunt for an eye product, and I do really like this one. While it doesn’t do a TON to my dark dark circles it feels great under concealer and on my skin. This product hasn’t made me irritated in the slightest which is great because my skin is so sensitive. I would get this again, definitely wish it made my undereyes just a tiny bit brighter but I haven’t found any product for my dark circles that truly does the trick. This was gifted by the outset. nan
