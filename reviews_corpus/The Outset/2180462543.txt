First of all I really like the clean minimalist packaging, second of all I love the texture so much! It looks very thick when I first opened it. But It’s actually not oily thick. It’s like whipped cream that just melts into the skin without any residue or stickiness. I truly enjoyed using this cream and it felt very nourishing to my skin Love the whipped texture!
