I think we all can agree that celebrity skincare lines are omnipotent and leave little to be desired. With that in mind, my skepticism for any product from The Outset is incredibly high. They proved me wrong.It’s too soon to tell lasting results, but I can tell you the past few uses of this serum have really helped to hydrate and plump my skin during my tretinoin journey. The texture is incredibly smooth and lightweight, which is great for someone who doesn’t like the feeling of product on the skin.I definitely plan on finishing the bottle and picking up another.
