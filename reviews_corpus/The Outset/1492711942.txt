My favorite thing about this moisturizer is the soft & fluffy texture, it’s so lightweight and feels like a cloud. My least favorite is that it’s one of those creams that requires a minute or two to rub in which I prefer not to do. It’s gentle and doesn’t cause any irritation and my skin feels very soft in the morning after. Love the texture!
