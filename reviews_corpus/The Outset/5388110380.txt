Excited to try this face cream from the new line brand launch. Packaging is beautiful, would prefer a pump dispenser for sanitary reasons though. I really like the ingredients, especially the niacinamide and bakuchiol. It has the texture of heavy butter so I probably will transition this out of my routine when summer hits. complimentary from The Outset nan
