This is the first product I’ve tried from the brand and so far I’ve been loving it. I ha se sensitive reactive skin and the vitamin c didn’t make my skin react. The formula it’s very hydrating and makes me look awake. A huge bonus is the glass container it comes in. This product was gifted by The Outset. Great for sensitive skin
