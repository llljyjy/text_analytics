I had high hopes for The Outset line after reading about Scarlett Johanssons struggles with acne and how this simplified skincare routine saved her skin. Unfortunately I did not find that to be the case for myself. Iâ€™ve tried a lot of sensitive skin products like cetaphil and clean products like drunk elephant and full force acne products like proactiv... but they do not seem to deliver what is advertised. I do not recommend the outset line for the price. I ended up going with CeraVe instead. Not for acne prone skin
