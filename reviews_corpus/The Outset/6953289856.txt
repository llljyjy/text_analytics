This is a very lightweight serum that soaks in quickly. This has the outsets Hylauroset which is supposed to be a botanical alternative to hyaluronic acid. This is really exciting for me because if I use too much HA in my routine I get breakouts. HA has been THE ingredient for a couple years now and in everything making it hard to avoid it. So Iâ€™m hoping that this continues to work for me. So far so good! Gifted by The Outset. Lightweight & Hydrating
