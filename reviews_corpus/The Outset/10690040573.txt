I received this serum as part of the set complimentary from The Outset. This is a perfect set for an everyday skincare routine and to get the skin into balance and a healthy complexion. This set has easy to use products that do not take up much time and can be used in the morning and in the evening. The Prep Serum locks in healthy vitamin and vegan collagen to prepare my skin for hydration. The serum has a nice silky, smooth texture and absorbs fast into the skin leaving my skin smooth, firm and looking plump with a healthy glow. Overall, this is a beautiful serum and together with the other products in the set it provides an easy-to-follow daily routine that makes my skin feel soft, smooth, nourished and looking plump and radiant with a healthy glow. Makes my skin soft and smooth
