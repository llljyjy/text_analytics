I tried this because I heard good things about the brand, and this cream contains my favorite ingredient, niacinamide. And? . . . I’m glad I did! I love a thick, luxurious night cream, and that’s what this is, and at a pretty affordable price. Also, a little goes a long way, so it should last awhile. A new staple in my skincare routine
