Gifted by The Offset: I was excited to try this eye cream as it does claim to help soften expression lines as well. I don’t notice much immediate effect, but hopefully I will see a difference over time. As far as eye cream goes, it really is lovely. It is hydrating and Wears nicely under makeup. If you are looking for a targeted line treatment with instant tightening , this probably isn’t the one, but if you need a nice everyday eye cream I recommend this one! Great for the undereye area!
