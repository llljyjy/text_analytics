I’ve always wanted to try this brand, so this set was a great opportunity for me to try their best products: cleanser, prep serum and moisturizer . I’ve being using this set for 10 days and I can see that my skin looks more plumper , hydrated and the texture is more even. I’m definitely gonna get all 3 of those in the regular size. Great skincare set
