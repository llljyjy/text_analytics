Love love love this night cream. It doesn’t have any fragrance that I could tell which is great for my sensitive skin and it definitely isn’t too heavy/thick or too thin. It felt really good going on my freshly clean skin and when I woke up in the morning I definitely felt like my skin was more hydrated, plump, less red, and more youthful. Gifted by The Outset. Great for sensitive mature skin
