I really liked using the product at night before bed.  it went onto the skin so smoothly and felt like it absorbed quickly. I loved how it felt on the skin too, slightly cooling and moisturizing. I use this with the eye cream for a great result. I have sensitive skin so Iâ€™m always hesitate about new products but this worked well with my skin.  I was gifted by the outset. refreshing on the skin
