The Outset gifted me their Restorative Niacinamide Night Cream to try it out.. This product is thick, rich and creamy.. It is butter like that melts on skin.. The color is white and the smell kinda reminds me of sunscreen or spf.. This product feels good on skin.. Kinda feels luxurious.. It makes my skin softer, smoother and plumper.. A little goes a long way and it goes on smoothly.. Im using this cream every night after my retinol and this cream makes my skin hydrated.. It doesnâ€™t feel heavy, greasy or tacky.. My dry and sensitive skin loving this cream.. No irritation at all while using this product.. Love this cream!
