This serum from The Outset is super nice. Absorbs very fast, leaves a slight tacky feeling which is great for your foundation to stay longer. Packaging is nice and it has a pump which I love. Your skin feels super soft, nice and looks visibly brighter while using it. I highly recommend this one to you Itâ€™s super nice!
