This serum was very hydrating and moisturizing. I have sensitive skin and it did not feel irritating or create any redness. My experience using this serum is positive, and I have not noticed any clogged pores or patchy spots. I will continue to use this as it feel it helps me with moisture and with a good amount of glowing skin. nan
