After 10 days, my skin seems to have balanced itself out and my redness has calmed down. The whole routine feels very gentle on my skin and as you can see in the before and immediately after application photo, my skin looks a bit more awake after this skincare routine. Love it. Great gift idea! Gentle routine, calmed my redness!
