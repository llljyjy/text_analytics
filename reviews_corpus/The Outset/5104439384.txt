This serum feels really nice on the skin, it’s lightweight which I love, especially during warmer weather as I have oily skin, yet still hydrating. However, I personally haven’t noticed a change in the firmness of my skin, I also haven’t noticed a change in my dark spots. For reference, I have been using this product close to 3 weeks. While it feels lovely on the skin, I haven’t seen results regarding some of its biggest claims which is what attracted my to the serum in the first place. This product was gifted by the outset. nan
