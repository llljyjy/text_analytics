I’d been on the hunt for a new cleanser routine for a while when I came across this set. My requirements were 1. cruelty free, 2. good for sensitive, acne-prone skin, and 3. a bit less expensive than my old routine. This set checked all those boxes, and after a couple of weeks with the products, I’m happily into full-sized bottles of all three. No more hunting for me! I’m really enjoying the new routine, and the cleanser works great with my Foreo Luna 2. One word of warning: the cleanser slips around very easily on wet skin; if you pump it onto a wet hand, be careful that the product makes it to your face and doesn’t slide off your hand and onto the floor. nan
