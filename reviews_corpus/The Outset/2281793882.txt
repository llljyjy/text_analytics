This product was gifted by the Outset for review purposes. I’ve been incorporating a hydrating serum into my skincare routine at least once a day for a while now. This one has been such a nice addition! It has such a lightweight texture that it sinks into the skin beautifully. My skin does feel more plump and hydrated. I’m excited to keep using it to see the long-term benefits nan
