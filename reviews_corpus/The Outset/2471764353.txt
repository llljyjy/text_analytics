It takes quite a few pumps to get the cream out of the bottle and I accidentally made a mess when the product finally came out- so be careful! A LOT of cream squirts out in a pump. It’s been easy to get the right amount after that first initial crazy pump though. I find the cream easy to apply and love that it can be used for more than just your eyes. It seems to be helpful with my puffy eyes. It’s hydrating and can’t wait to see more results. Gifted by The Outset. nan
