Ive been using the Outset for exactly 3 weeks and I’m happy to say I’m very satisfied! The size put me off a bit but a little goes a long way. I have very sensitive skin, and this didn’t irritate my skin at all, and my skin has made a huge improvement! I wouldn’t buy the full size moisturizer, but the cleanser and serum will definitely be a repurchase! nan
