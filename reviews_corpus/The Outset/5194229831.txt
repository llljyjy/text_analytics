Gifted by The Outset Skincare. I can see why this Collagen Prep Serum won Allure best in beauty award. Itâ€™s a beautiful lite weight vegan face serum that boost my other skincare product. I recently incorporated it into my skincare routine and so far it seems to be a good decision to do so. My skin feels and looks more firmer and plumped. I apply right after cleansing for better absorption of my moisturizer and facial oil. Firmer, Plumped Skin
