I used this Fresh face mask for the first time this week and it’s simply chefs kiss! The current state of my skin has been pretty irritated as I’ve messed up my skin barrier with my heavy use of acids in my routine. This mask made my skin feel calm and moisturized. It goes on white but my skin absorbed the product pretty quickly. One note, the floral scent is a bit strong (I like the way it smells but something about my skin products having any type of fragrance makes me feel weird). Overall I really like this mask and will use it 1-2x a week. nan
