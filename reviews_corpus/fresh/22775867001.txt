I wanted to give 1 star if I could but ended up giving 2, anyways, the reviews are so high, so I decided to give it a shot because my lips are super dry during winter. It’s so dry that I started looking for a bit more expensive products, but this one ended up making my lips dry even more. I thought it just didn’t work for me but the same happened to my sister, she was like, “this lip mask dried my lips,“ I never had any issue with lip masks before, either they worked or just did nothing on my lips but this one just, sigh, I ended up getting a lip mask from more pacific dry, just dry
