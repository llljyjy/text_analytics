Iâ€™m so excited to have received this product complimentary from Fresh.  I began using this serum right away and my initial impressions is that it smells and feels great.  It has a pleasant scent and has a nice creamy texture without feeling sticky.  With my fingertips I simply rubbed a drop of the serum into my face.  It quickly absorbed into my skin and  from the first week of use, I noticed amazing hydrating results.  This serum has great benefits and I do recommend it to anyone looking improve skin hydration, glow, and resilience. Amazing Serum!
