The second I saw via email from Fresh, I bought it right away! I’ve used it for two weeks now and am loving it just like I do with all Fresh items. This is a nice light weight but semi thick moisturizer. It smells great, it’s not over powering. I have a lot of redness on my face and when I wake up every morning, I no longer have redness. Honestly, my face has been clear and even ever since I started using this, it only has been two weeks but so far I’m loving it! It’s a big jar and a good price for it. A little goes a long way, I use this from face to neck and it covers everything. I hope they make a mini version soon so I can throw it in my gym bag to use after showering from exercising! nan
