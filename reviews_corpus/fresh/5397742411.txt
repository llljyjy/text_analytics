Freshâ€™s Floral Recovery Calming Mask is so soothing and calming on my skin, and I love using this after a long work day. It helps with uneven skin tone and rough texture, both of which are problems that my combination, acne prone skin tend to struggle with year round. This overnight face mask is infused with peony, cherry blossom, passionflower, cornflower, vitamin c, and squalane. The combination of all these ingredients really does wonders for your skin! nan
