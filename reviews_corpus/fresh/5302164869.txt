I was gifted by Fresh their Sugar Lip Treatment in Rose and my lips have never looked and felt so good! I am a loyal Fresh Lip Treatment user and I have used their original and mint rush lip treatments as well but I have to say the rose one might be my new favorite because not only does it hydrate my lips all day long but it give the perfect subtle hint of pink to the lips that doesnâ€™t transfer! I love it! Perfect subtle pink glow!
