This product was gifted by Fresh .I use this cream for few days but so far it became one of my favorite winter skincare products. The texture is very nourishing, creamy and moisturizing, but still not too heavy or oily. It absorbs very nice and leaves my skin soft, silky smooth and radiant. I also noticed how well my skin is moisturized and how plump it looks. Great winter moisturizer
