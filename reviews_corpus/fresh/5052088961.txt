The ingredients that excited me the most from this mask were vit C, squalene and the floral extracts! I typically have redness on my cheeks especially after a long day a double cleanse. I used this in the PM on clean skin and enjoyed every second of it! The scent is refreshing but not overpowering and left my skin nice and plump. I personally like it as an overnight mask since itâ€™s not too heavy or thick. REFRESHING but heavy price tag!
