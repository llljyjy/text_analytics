This is one of the best cleansers I’ve used. I have combination skin and get dry patches around my mouth, but also get breakouts (sometimes cystic) and super oily skin especially before my period. I was previously using the tatcha exfoliating face wash, which was helping the oily spots but drying the areas around my mouth and nose. This cleanser has been a game changer. My skin is hydrated, but not oily and I haven’t had any cystic zits or even small ones since I started using this cleanser. Highly recommend this cleanser. It is also gentle and I have sensitive skin. Love love love!
