This is the first time Iâ€™ve ever used a serum like this and it was NOT A LET DOWN. When I applied it to my skin, it looked like a glazed donut and felt super smooth. It almost felt like applying aloe vera gel but less sticky feeling which I preferred. A little goes a long way so the bottle will last me a while, which is definitely an incentive for me to rebuy. My skin has been glowing all day, even through makeup. 10/10. 10/10
