I received two samples from two orders I’ve made. The smell is super light, you can only smell it if you put your nose real close, it feels like a moisturizer and absorb fast you can see how it looks like in the picture. I loved the texture, you don’t need too much product honestly, so full size will last for a good while. I have combo skin, I had some irritated skin lately and the first time I used it over night I woke up and, wow! I couldn’t believe it, the redness was gone! I loved it so much that I gave my mother the other sample so she can try it and she loved  it feels like a moisturizer and absorb fast  too!! I decided to get the full size, it’s worth every single penny! I really recommend this, didn’t affect my pores or my oily T zone. 100/10I haven’t received the full size yet but I still have product in my little sample, when I say it last, I mean it! I wish I have a pic before using, sorry :( Best mask!
