i’ve been loving the hydration i’ve been getting from this serum, it’s water based so it works amazing with my makeup and it doesn’t rub off, it’s also very lightweight and gentle with the skin. My skin has been feeling softer and more hydrated throughout the days. I use it during the day and at night and only 1-2 drops is enough. AMAZING for dry skin!
