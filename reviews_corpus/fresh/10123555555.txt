This is a light but creamy/hydrating lip product. It has a hint of scent that I always enjoy and feel all of the fresh lip products have. It can be as sheer and barely there or built up for a decent color. Itâ€™s extremely comfortable and I wear if pretty much daily. I always keep the fresh lippies in my purse. Gifted by Fresh. Beautiful, hydrating.
