While I’m not sure that this mask gives any “long term“ results or benefits, plus it’s pretty pricey (hence the one star off) it is a great mask to use before an event or night out. It gives my skin a nice smooth texture perfect for then applying makeup. It also feels cool and refreshing. I either use this or Tata Harper’s Resurfacing Mask when I want my skin to look smooth and even before a special event. Definitely recommend. Great before a special event
