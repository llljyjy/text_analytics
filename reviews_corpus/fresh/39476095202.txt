I absolutely loved this tea elixir! It made my skin feel super hydrated and plumped. The packaging is super high quality, it comes in a gorgeous, heavy glass bottle (in my favorite stunning emerald color!). The serum itself is milky colored and has a soft, silky texture that is easy to apply without collecting or feeling too thick. The scent is so nice, it doesn’t have a chemically or overly synthetic fruity or food-like smell. It smells herb-y and earthy, which makes sense since it’s a tea elixir and has clean ingredients. So happy it was gifted to me so I could try! I would for sure recommend to others. Amazing Serum
