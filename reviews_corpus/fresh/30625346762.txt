I’m a really big lip balm fan and I love tinted balms. I was so excited to try a new color. This is a really creamy consistency like you would expect if you’ve used Fresh before. The color is really buildable without looking too much like lipstick. It feels lightweight and leaves my lips hydrated like a normal balm but with just the right hint of color. This was gifted by Fresh. nan
