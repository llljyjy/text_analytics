This serum is SO nice!! i love the packaging in general but something about the dropper makes me love it even more. its not a dropper where the product will drip out but it squeezes the serum out in such a nice way its really satisfying to me. The serum itself is really moisturizing and absorbs fast, overall so good! Yes yes yes
