I had bought the 150 mL tube (limited edition) for $24.50, so got it at a pretty good deal. Not super impressed with it though. I like the texture, just like a gel face wash that lathers up nicely. It’s got the franchise lotus youth preserve moisturizer scent that lingers on even after washing. However, I find this is very drying on my skin, and that is what matters to me most, so will be returning. I have better options from Sephora (Purity cleanser, Fulvic acid cleanser) that seem to work better on my skin, so I’ll stick to those. Close, but no cigar
