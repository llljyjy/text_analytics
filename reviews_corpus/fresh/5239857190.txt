[I recieved this complimentary from Fresh, but all opinions are my own.]This is such a beautiful lip product- it’s hydrating and feels buttery on the lips, has a really pretty, buildable pink tint, and smells incredible! It’s easy to apply and the packaging is really nice too! I love that the top screws on so it doesn’t come off easily in my makeup bag (or when my toddler daughter gets ahold of it lol) Beautiful product
