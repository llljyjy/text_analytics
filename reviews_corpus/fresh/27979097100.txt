I recently picked this product up and absolutelyLOVE it. Price point wise, it is expensive,especially for the given amount but definitelyworth it in my opinion. It acts as a moisturizerand primer, and hasn’t disappointed me yet! Ihave dry skin and feel as though it’s lightweight enough to work well on all skin types. Itdoesn’t feel oily or greasy but also didn’timmediately absorb into my skin. 8.7/10. Best antioxidant serum
