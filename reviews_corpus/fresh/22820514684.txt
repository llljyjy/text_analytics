I mean it when i saw that this masks delivers on its promises! It is extremely calming and perfect to use right before bed. When i woke up my face was extremely hydrated and glowing. As a girl who is notorious for wanting to do a face mask right before bed, this is it! Itâ€™s consistency is similar to that of a moisturizer. I left a thin, even layer on my skin for 10 minutes and any excess after that time I just rubbed into my face, no need to rinse! Overall this is a wonderful face mask and I will be implementing it into my permanent skincare rotation. Delivers on its promises
