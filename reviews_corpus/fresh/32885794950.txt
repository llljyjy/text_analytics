Had me at 24hr hydration! I love a good lip balm but I’ve come to love this one even more because of the ingredients, the sugar cane and beet root compliment each other so well in that the balm smells amazing and in the words of my 2year who also loves this lip balm “it tastes so yummy” lol. In addition, it’s round the clock hyradtion and personally for me, it just makes getting ready so easy with the buildable color, all I need to add is a little liner and I’m out. You can tell how hydrating and good the pigment is, you can add color by applying more. This is a must have! Complimentary from Fresh Beautifully Buildable
