I love this serum so much! I’ve always been a fan of this brand and so I am not surprised by how much I love this! I don’t really have problematic skin so I don’t have DRASTIC changes. However, I do feel like my skin is overall brighter and it looks smoother as well. The formula is very hydrating and it absorbs well into the skin and locking in moisture. Worth it!
