This is a rich sleeping mask, perfect for winter months in cold climates.  I was surprised that it didn’t have much of a fragrance considering all of the botanical essences in the ingredients.  I have combination skin, and it didn’t make me too oily or break me out.  I woke up the next morning with smooth, even toned skin. nan
