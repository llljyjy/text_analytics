This serum is great for someone struggling with dullness (like me!). I applied this serum at night to give my skin the opportunity to absorb this serum properly with the best sealants. Additionally, I woke up the next morning and my skin was GLOWING while looking so much brighter; this was after one use. I absolutely love this serum already and canâ€™t wait to see results after weeks of use. For My Dull Skin Girlies!
