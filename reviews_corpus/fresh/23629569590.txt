This winter season is super drying for my skin and this cream is a savior. I absolutely love how rich and hydrating it is for my super parched skin. I applied two layers and my skin soaked it in and love how plump my skin feels and the makeup went on super smooth on top of it.I will be using this cream ALL winter long! This was gifted by Fresh, but the opinion is my own. Winter skin must must have!
