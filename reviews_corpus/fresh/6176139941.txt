I was already obsessed with the black tea line so I was super excited to try this cream! I love the texture it’s creamy but not sticky sinks into my skin and a little goes a long way. I enjoy the scent it’s not too overpowering similar to the soy face wash. My skin feel moisturized and glowy when I apply it . I’ve been using at night and loving it so far! I’ve already noticed a difference in my skin a can’t wait to keep using it to see the longer term results! This was gifted by fresh beauty Amazing cream
