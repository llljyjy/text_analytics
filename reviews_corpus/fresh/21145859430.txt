I got this complimentary from fresh and it is the perfect product for the clean girl makeup aesthetic because it gives a cute little tint, is hydrating, but also looks natural. I’m really impressed with this and find myself reaching for it way more than I though I would. I’ve always been more of a lipgloss person but lately i’ve been obsessed with this tinted balm especially for a sun kissed summer vibe! Perfect for a natural look
