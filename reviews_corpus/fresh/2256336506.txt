This is my go to moisturizer, it always leaves me skin feeling hydrated and fresh.  I’ve been using it for about 6 years now and it never fails to plump up my skin and leave it feeling quenched.  I love the subtle rose smell when I put it on and it’s a rich creme texture.  For winters in Canada I use it day and night and for the spring and summer I use it just at night. nan
