I appreciate how this application is in a dropper form, it seems to give me the best control on how much I want to apply to my face. I really love a hyaluronic acid serum in my routine and this one fit in great. Kept my skin super hydrated. There is an earthy scent which doesnâ€™t affect my skin but it could affect others with extremely sensitive skin to fragrances nan
