I really wanted to love this moisturizer, but I had to return it because it made me break out. I have sensitive skin with a bit of rosacea, and unfortunately the fragrance was too strong for my skin. It smells amazing though, and it should probably be fine for other skin types that donâ€™t get irritated easily. nan
