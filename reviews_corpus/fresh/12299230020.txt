it is very rare that i make reviews on here, but ahh! this lip balm is gorgeous. i’ve been very loyal to my glossier balm dot coms these past three years, but i decided to step out of my comfort zone and i’m glad i did! when i took my tube out of its box (which the box is very gorgeous btw i don’t want to throw it out!) the first thing i noticed how heavy the packaging felt, very heavy in the most luxurious way possible, i was not expecting that but i’m glad that’s the way it is because no one wants something at this price point in a flimsy tube. the tiny is so pretty, it’s very rare that we see browny-nude colors in tinted lip balms, usually it’s berries and pinks. when i put it on my lips it felt like butter, the scent smelled like a nearly cakey lemon buttercream not too overbearingly sweet but slightly fresh as well, which i personally love! it reminds me of something i had in my childhood. this stuff SOFTENS my lips. i’ve tried dior, glossier, clinique, burt’s bees, cover girl, you name it. this tinted lip balm is a WINNER! tied for first place along with my birthday balm dot com from glossier. this stuff is so moisturizing, soften, slightly plumping and smells delicious. it’s a cult favourite for many reasons i now understand. i’m completely blown away by this, it has surpassed my expectations to the point where i’m considering getting another shade. get it now! STOP WASTING TIME AND BUY IT NOW!!
