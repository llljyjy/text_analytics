This heavenly moisturizer became my end-all-be-all holy grail moisturizer. Why the celestial adjectives you ask? Well, firstly I finally found the one moisturizer that doesn’t make you feel like a glazed cake after applying. It’s perfectly whipped and gives you a sensation of gently nourishment without laying on too thick or too little. Honestly,  I think I’m addicted. Might need therapy to detach. Ten outa ten, recommend (the moisturizer, not therapy. Although, maybe that too)! Nourishing and Addictive
