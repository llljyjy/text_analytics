I stopped using this moisturizer for several years due to the cost while I was a student, now that I’ve come back it doesn’t work as well as it once did; apparently they’ve changed to a new, “clean“ (cheaper?) formula. Definitely disappointed, the old version was a holy grail product. Now it just feels like it’s sitting on top of my skin and not sinking in. Formula changed for the worse
