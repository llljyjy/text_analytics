Got a sample of this product in 2016 and have been rebuying it ever since. It’s a classic, simple cleanser that works super well, minimal scent, and is really gently on the eyes and skin. I love it for washing my face if I’m wearing minimal make up, and use it as a second cleanse for big makeup days. Have tried other products and always go back to this as my second/primary cleanse :) 6 years strong, great simple product
