Love this! I have combination skin that tends to be drier in the cold Canadian winter. I’ve tried a number of products and this is the only product I use at night that helps keep my skin moisturizer overnight and soothes the dry patches that occur on my cheeks. The first layer does smell a bit like cucumber but it’s nice and refreshing. the second layer smells more like rose. great for dry skin in the winter
