I’m on an acne medication that dries out my skin. Fresh’s serum is one of the only products I have found that soothes and does not irritate my super-sensitive skin. This stuff is fantastic. I’m surprised it only has a 4.8 review because Fresh’s serum is over a 5! Love it! I introduced the Tea Elixir Serum in my routine after cleansing and after a toner, and placed before the moisturizer step. If skin is a little damp before application, serums are said to absorb better into the skin. Thank you Fresh <3 LOVE! Soothed my painful dry skin!
