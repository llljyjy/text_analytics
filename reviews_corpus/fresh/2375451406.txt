I’ve never tried a lip product from fresh before but I love products from fresh. This one is no exception. It is nice with gentle ingredients. It does have a tint so I wouldn’t use it at night. It keeps the lips moist throughout the day. I think it does transfer though… so the color fades throughout the day. Nice pigmented lip treatment
