This serum has a beautiful silky texture and is very refreshing, nourishing and soothing. It also leaves my skin ultra soft and it is working wonders on my fine lines and blemishes. It is light and absorbs ultra fast, so my skin inmediately enjoys the benefits fromit’s luxurious formula. I use it daily before my moisturizer to replenish my skin and restore it’s luminosity. I only need a few drops of product daily so I know the bottle will last quite a while, which is also great! It is excellent for my sensitive skin. My skin loved it since day one (no problems, like itchiness or breakouts). I am so happy I am incorporating such a quality product into my skincare routine! So refreshing and luxurious!
