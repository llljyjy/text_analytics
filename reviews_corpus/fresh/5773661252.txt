I love the Fresh lip treatment! I’ve tried many of Their products so I was so excited when Fresh gifted me with this. This is my first time trying to peony color and it’s absolutely amazing. I like it because it is natural enough but still has a slight tint to my lips. This is a great moisturizing product that also leaves your lips looking Beautiful, I would definitely get it again. nan
