What can I say about these lip treatments that haven’t already been said? Their packaging is  perfect to throw in any bag, the scent is delightful, the formula is soft without being goopy, and the slight tint is the perfect “no makeup” makeup product for the faintest wash of color. Do I think it’s a must have? Probably not, but it is a nice to have and I’m always a bit sad when I finish one of these. nan
