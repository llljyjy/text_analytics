I’ve always been a big fan of Fresh products and the new tea elixir serum did NOT drop the ball. I absolutely love the silky texture it leaves on my skin and the beachy scent of the sea kelp. I appreciate the fresh, light, and not overpowering scent and clean ingredients. I have extremely sensitive skin and it is nerve wracking to try new products in fear of breaking out in reaction but I had absolutely no issues with this product. I genuinely feel like this product has made my skin happier and healthier overall! My pores are noticeably smaller (my husband even said something about it), and I have had fewer breaks outs since I started using this in my daily routine. Overall my skin is the glowiest and smoothest it has ever been. I have not worn foundation once since adding this to my daily routine, I have truly never felt more confident in my own skin! happy • healthy • glowing
