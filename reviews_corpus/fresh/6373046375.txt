Love fresh masks so much! This one did not disappoint. It’s creamy and nourishing. Love that it’s an overnight mask or you can use it as a 10 minute mask as well. Helps with redness, calms irritated skin, gives a healthy glow what’s not to love? It’s not heavy and makes my skin feel amazing in the morning. Love it so much!
