I received this Peony shade complimentary from Fresh. If ever there was a lippie for summer this would be it! It smells so good, the color is gorgeous, and with one swipe it’s a nice daytime shade, but if you apply two it’s such a cute darker shade for a nighttime outing! Plus this lip balm gives some awesome long lasting hydration - not sure if that’s from grapeseed oil but I’m digging it! I’m going to need one in every shade! Shade Peony
