Beautiful product and even a beautiful bottle! The product was given to me #complimentarybyfresh for my honest review. The serum is a thin, milky consistency and is meant to help plump and hydrate the skin as well as ease fine lines. I did find after ten days of use that my skin felt hydrated. I donâ€™t like that it has linalool, limonene, and a couple other things that can be sensitizing though it did not cause me any trouble. It does seem pricey for what it is, but I enjoyed using it. Lovely
