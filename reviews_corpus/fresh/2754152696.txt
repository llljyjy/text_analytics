I bought this at another store and I was really happy to see they brought back plum. This and rose were my favorite shades and I was sad when they discontinued plum. The new formula is thicker and shows up much darker and less sheer than the original plum. The formula felt nice at first but really dried out my lips eventually and felt irritating. The color was pretty but just too dark and gathered in dry parts of my lips. New formula not as nice
