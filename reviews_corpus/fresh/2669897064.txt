I wavered on this purchase for quite a while thinking that OTC/drugstore would be fine for my dry, cracking lips.  I received a sample of the Laneige Sleep Mask and wasnâ€™t impressed at all.  I thought that was my sign that expensive lip masks were not worth it.  Then I gave in and bit the bullet on this.  So worth it.  One use I could feel the difference.  After using it almost every night for a week, my lips look younger, smoother, and feel soft.  My lipstick goes on smoother. I think the amount of product will last me a year, but I will repurchase it. Worth every penny.
