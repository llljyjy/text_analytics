I’ve tried so many lip balms but always catch myself coming back to this one or the OG ones. They’re super hydrating & have helped my chapped lips. I hate waxy lips balms - these are definitely not like that. They’re smooth and glide on your lips like a dream. They are 100% pricey for what they are but if you’re looking to splurge on yourself, I say go for it or wait until the VIB sale to get some sort of discount. I normally wear the original ones during the day because they have SPF in them and use this one at night or if I know I won’t be in sunlight. I’m not a heavy tinted lip balm type of girl, so this one or the one in the brown packaging is great for a clear finish! I do like the rose one as well! All the other colors are not my cup of tea. I definitely recommend! My go to lip balm
