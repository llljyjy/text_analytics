I love how nice it feels when applied to my face and neck.  My skin feels nice and hydrated after using.  It has a subtle rose scent that’s not irritating even for someone sensitive to smells like me.  Super cute bottle too.I’ve used 1/5 of the bottle in a month so I’d guess that the bottle would last 5-6 months when used twice a day. Refreshing!
