I love this lip Balm so much, I literally carry it everywhere wherever I go. Itâ€™s a staple in my routine and the only thing that keeps my lips hydrated and moisturized in dry CT winters. Also this lip sugar treatment gives a very natural flush of color to my lips and instantly adds some life into it. It also has a light rose fragrance which is absolutely beautiful and it has no taste at all which is a huge plus for me as I do not like the lip balms that leaves a taste in your mouth.
