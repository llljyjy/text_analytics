I was very excited to test this product out. During the summer my skin goes from being dry to oily and itâ€™s to find a balance between the two. What I love about this serum is that it gives my the hydration that I need and helps reduce the oils on my face. It also gives off such a gorgeous glow to the skin. It really helps with the dullness and the dryness which I personal enjoy. Amazing serum
