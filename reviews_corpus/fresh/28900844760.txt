I have normal skin with sort of combo in places. This stuff goes on thick so you only need a little to go a long way. But it is a great mask that when I wash off in the am leaves my skin very subtle n soft. Not a heavy fragrance either. I have times my skin can be sensitive and have used this already for a week and no problems. This will last awhile too! N almost forgot, my redness is already starting to relax some on my cheeks! good overnight mask
