I was gifted this product complimentary from Fresh. I tried the shade Peony, and I love how natural this looks! It can provide a little sheer color to your lips or be built up if you apply more of it. It also has a pretty scent that is not overpowering. It did feel very moisturizing and itâ€™s a product that I would bring in a purse and reapply throughout the day! So natural and beautiful!
