I love this lip balm! It has a light sweet scent, goes on so buttery and smoothly on the lips and feels super hydrating. The Rose balm gives the lips a light wash of color, very sheer but just enough to add a light pink tint and a glossy shine that makes the lips look plump and healthy. I love wearing it on its own during no makeup makeup days or as a hydrating first step before applying lipstick or lip tint. I included a before and after shot, and you can see the pretty shine it gives the lips. This product was gifted by Fresh. nan
