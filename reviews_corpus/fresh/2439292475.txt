I have a love-hate relationship with this product, it’s kind of like greenwashing in my opinion, I took a look at all the ingredients, and they just don’t sit right with me as I can’t even pronounce half of them, I used it once, and it gave me a little bumps in a mini rash and mind you, I don’t have sensitive skin whatsoever, I will not continue using this product and I would just steer clear from this brand as there’s so many other clean, non-toxic brands out there they won’t disrupt your endocrine system.Gifted by fresh Mmmm…
