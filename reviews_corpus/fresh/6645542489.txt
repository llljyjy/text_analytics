I got a small size of this to try and out, and I will say it puts loads of moisture back into my skin and makes it very dewy and soft. However, it smells like pickles. I don’t know if it’s just the mini size or if it’s the full size as well. The daily rose moisturizer I got smells like roses, so I know it’s not my sense of smell being weird. It’s not a super big deal since the smell fades away after a few minutes, but just thought I’d put it out there. Still a great product. nan
