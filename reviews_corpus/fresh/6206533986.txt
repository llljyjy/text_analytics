Love this scrub so much! I’ve been using it for almost two years now and refuse to switch to any other scrub product. I find it works so well on my skin and gives that exfoliating feel without being too rough. Not sure what others are talking about in regards to the smell - it has a light strawberry smell but isn’t overly sweet (like other heavily perfumed products), it smells like it should for a pretty clean product. I’m glad it doesn’t smell strongly of fake strawberry, otherwise I’d be worried about what they put it in to get it to smell that way.This leaves my face feeling clean and smooth and clears up any imperfections I may have had prior to exfoliating. Love this scrub so much!
