gifted by Fresh.  This cream is my new favorite and I don’t say that lightly. Feels like a luxurious experience, the scent is light and gorgeous, smells like a million bucks. The texture is super lightweight which I personally love. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave an oily feeling perfect for using before makeup application. I’m using it i combination with the tea elixir serum and my skin looks RADIANT. New favorite
