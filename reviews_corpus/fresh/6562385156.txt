I can see why this mask is getting glowing reviews, for dry skin folks like me, this mask is a boon. It has a rich buttery texture and the scent is really calming. Helps hydrate and protect the skin overnight. Personally, I dont have any redness so I cannot confirm if this reduces and calms the skin but as an overnight occlusive, this works well. Love this!
