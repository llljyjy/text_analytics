I have been using this for 6 years and it is so gentle and great for sensitive skin. It’s not drying and it works great for my oily/combination skin. It removes my makeup although if I’ve done full face of makeup I normally wash my face twice just to make sure. as someone with super irritable skin I would recommend this to anyone with acne prone/ redness prone/ reaction prone skin. I also love that its a clean product and doesn’t contain sulphates or parabens which usually make me breakout. tried and true
