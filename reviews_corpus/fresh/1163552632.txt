I was really excited to try Fresh Beauty’s latest launch, the new Tea Elixir Skin Resilience and Activating Serum. It’s supposed to boost skin’s visible resilience to everyday life stressors for smoother texture, visible glow, restored bounce, and reduced look of wrinkles. The ingredient list also looked promising with Adaptive Phytocompound Tea Technology, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid and ceramide III.  It has a cream gel-like texture and goes on smooth and silky. It doesn’t peel under other layers of skincare which I really appreciate. It also smells amazing - almost like an earl grey which I totally adore as it’s one of my favorite teas! I also enjoy how light it is. I feel it helps with hydration and makes the skin skin seem more even, with less visible pores. My skin seems smoother as well, which is nice!
