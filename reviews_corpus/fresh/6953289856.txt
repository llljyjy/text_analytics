I really enjoy fresh sugar lip balms because they’re so soft and comfortable! This new papaya one has a lovely tint. It’s my first tinted lip balm from fresh as I usually opt for the clear ones. This goes on just as smooth and initially the color is beautiful, however long term it’s really not all that hydrating and when the color fades I’m left with dry patches on my lips that the color has stuck to. You definitely need to exfoliate and I wish the color lasted a bit longer. I’m going to stick to clear. Gifted by Fresh. Looks Cute
