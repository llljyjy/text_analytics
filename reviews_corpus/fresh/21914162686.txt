The Fresh black tea mask is one of my all time favorite masks, so I had to try this cream.I love creams which do not contain Dimethicone! This one contains camellia sinensis leaf extract and squalane which moisturize my skin without making it feel oily or clogging my pores. It soaks right into my skin.It contains antioxidant black tea and rambutan leaf extract, which I feel make my skin feel smooth and refreshed. It feels firmer as well, with tiny lines under my eyes diminished! I highly recommend giving it a try.Complimentary from Fresh. Smooth, firm skin!
