I like this a lot, it has a good tint and it feel hydrating. my favorite part is that its a nice shade that is enough to make a difference for natural look but not too much that I feel too dressed up when I’m out. I like that its not too thick or sticky but relatively light so it doesn’t bother me when wearing. complimentary from fresh works great
