I received this Black Tea Age Renewal Cream complimentary from Fresh  to try and review.  The first thing I noticed was the light fresh natural scent.  The cream itself is extremely lightweight even though it looks like it wouldnâ€™t be. I honestly thought this was going to have to be a night cream only for me. I was very pleasantly surprised at how quickly this absorbed into my skin.  As an oily girl, the weight and absorption are extremely important to me. Another great product from Fresh! Light and fresh
