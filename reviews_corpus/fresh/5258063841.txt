This product was gifted to me by fresh. Overall the texture of this serum is nice. It has a light creamy texture that plays well with other skincare. But it is very fragranced like most fresh products, which I could do without.  Nice but havenâ€™t noticed any insane results yet for the high price tag. Could do without fragrance
