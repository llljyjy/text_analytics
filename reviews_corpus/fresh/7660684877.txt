This has such a beautiful scent and texture. I absolutely love and strive for soft dewy skin and this gives me exactly that, with quick results. I prefer to put it on an hour or two before bed and pressing in the excess before I lay down. I appreciate that this gives me the hydration I need and actually soaks into my skin without being heavy or causing pilling. I have seen the biggest improvement with my texture. Glow in a jar
