I received this product complementary from Fresh Beauty to review. I’ve only used this mask a few times but I’ve loved it so far! I have dry skin and this is a great hydrating and calming mask that is not greasy or too heavy on the skin. It gives a soothing feeling and has a beautiful scent. It’s overall a very luxurious product!Though I’m not a huge fan of jar packaging for hygiene purposes, the color and material of this packaging is hard not to like. It’s a bit expensive but I think worth the splurge. Pricey But Luxurious
