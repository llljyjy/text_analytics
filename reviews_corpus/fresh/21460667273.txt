I’m really glad I didn’t bother spending money on this, because it’s one of the least effective lip balms I have used. I have multiple other options, for far cheaper. yah, this goes on with a nice slip, but it is not really repairing or nourishing - and after trying to wear it for 24 hours, my lips started to peel all over again - a problem I fixed years ago when I started using petroleum based lip products. honestly, I’m not even sure I would try again even if they reformulate or something. got a sample of this in a grab bag
