I tried this out as a sample, and then as a rewards pick, and fell in love. At 49, my concerns are dryness, dark circles and occasional puffiness. I feel this eye concentrate moisturizes the dry skin around my eyes effectively, making lines look less noticeable and reducing puffiness. And it absorbs completely so I’m not left with a greasy sheen. I ended up purchasing a full-size product, so I’m committed! My new favorite eye cream!
