This new moisturizer does wonders at hydrating my bone-dry, sensitive skin. It has a slight fragrance to it that smells kind of like a sweet yet earthy/botanical tea - I enjoy it, however would like it more if the fragrance was omitted. It does not negatively impact the user experience, although for me it does not enhance it either. I live in a humid environment (south Florida), and still do not find this product to feel heavy after applying. It goes on thick, but thins out once it starts to absorb and feels ultra hydrating. All in all I am really enjoying it, although I can say I have notice much of a physical difference in the appearance of my skin that would justify (at least in my mind) the $95 price point. At that price, I would really like to see more clinically-effective actives. If you have money to spend, Iâ€™d say this is an excellent every day moisturizer for individuals with very dry skin like mine.Gifted By Fresh * An Excellent Moisturizer For Dry Skin
