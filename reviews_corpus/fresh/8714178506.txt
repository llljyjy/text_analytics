This is a really lovely serum - it blends into the skin immediately and leaves it plump and hydrated. It has the same spa-like scent as the Black Tea mask, which is a long time favorite of mine. It doesnâ€™t leave the skin feeling sticky or tacky (a pet peeve for some hyaluronic serums). Beautiful hydrating serum
