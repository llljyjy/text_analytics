I have had issues with Fresh skincare in the past, primarily because the fragrance is generally too heavy for my sensitive skin and nose. That is not the case with this product! I really enjoyed to fragrance it does have, and it didn’t irritate my skin or allergies. That said, I wish it weren’t there in the first place, as usual. My skin is noticeably plumper and smoother than before I started using it.  It has a light texture, as serums usually do, and absorbs quickly. There can be some pilling depending on your SPF if you use it during the day, so just be on the look out for that, as I did have to change up my SPF. The price point is a bit too much for what it is, but I generally feel that way about most luxury skincare. All in all a solid offering. A solid choice, but $$
