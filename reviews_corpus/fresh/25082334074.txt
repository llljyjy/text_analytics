I have always been a big fan of Fresh skincare, and this mask is my new favorite from the brand! The texture is very creamy and feels very comfortable on the skin - not greasy, sticky or too thick. It’s an overnight mask, and the next morning I wake up with smooth, soft and calmed skin. I would say it gives a noticeable difference with just one night of use. It’s a perfect evening skincare staple for the winter time - personally my skin gets dry and sensitive. I have combo skin, but I think this mask will work well for many skin types. noticeable improvement in my skin
