This serum is really lovely! After several weeks of use, my skin feels really bouncy and hydrated, as well as a bit smoother and brighter. When I first started using this, I was breaking out and I feel like it’s helped my acne marks fade more quickly than usual, too. It’s also nice starting the day by using a product that feels like I’m protecting it against free radicals and pollution. I’m excited to see how prolonged use with this continues to benefit my skin! So fresh and bouncy
