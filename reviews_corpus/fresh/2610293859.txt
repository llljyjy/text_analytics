Okay firstly this smells AMAZING! It smells like, no pun intended, fresh and like the ocean. It’s such a pleasure to apply for that alone. I’ve been using this for only a few weeks now but have seen such a difference in the elasticity of my skin. It looks more plump and bouncy if that makes sense? I’ve been really enjoying using it. And the packaging feels really luxe and looks pretty on my bathroom counter too! nan
