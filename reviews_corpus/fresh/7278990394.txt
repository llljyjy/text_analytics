Super hydrating, pairs really well with the fresh Rose Deep Hydration Moisturizer! I am in love with how together, this serum and the moisturizer, so easily hydrate my unbelievably parched skin! I highly recommend this item if you have dry skin, in fact, the dryer your skin, the better, this stuff will definitely take care of that for you! Now, itâ€™s true, there can be a somewhat unpleasant scent, however it is only temporary. Initially you get the scent of rose, but then it can sometimes give way to a little bit of a vinegary scent, somewhat reminiscent of a pickle. Fortunately, the scent is very short-lived, and the astonishing results make it well worth the temporary scent. Part of a dream team duo! Dry skin? Not anymore!
