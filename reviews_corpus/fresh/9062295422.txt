This lip product was gifted to me by Fresh in exchange for my authentic opinion. Even though this was gifted to me my opinion is still my own and I genuinely liked this lip balm! I was surprised to how comfortable it was to wear. I love how the lip balm wasn’t sticky but yet still moisturizing. It’s a beautiful wash of color with a dusty rose, purple tint. It’s subtle enough for everyday use. It gives you that beautiful your lips but better vibes. I know I will be reaching for this all the time! Shade Peony
