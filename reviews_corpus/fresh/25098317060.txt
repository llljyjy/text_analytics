Was skeptical at first, after having tried 3 moisturizers before this I got kind of frustrated. I found it too thick at first as well. But after using this for 2 weeks, my husband now randomly and frequently touches my bare face to say itâ€™s super soft. I noticed as well my skin isnt as oily now, I dont know if this corrected my skin but it definitely hydrated it. Will buy again. Was skeptical at first, but now a believer
