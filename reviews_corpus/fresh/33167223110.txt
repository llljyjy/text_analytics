Gifted by Fresh - I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion. This is a great moisturizing cream. It goes smoothly and my skin feels smooth, nice and hydrated. It feels slightly sticky at first which goes away fast after getting absorbed into the skin. This cream is very nourishing and works great for my dry skin. So nourishing
