I’m obsessed with this cleanser. I have purchased it 4 times already and will continue to do so as long as they keep the same formula. It smells amazing, removes ALL my makeup (even mascara), and is very gentle and softening. I haven’t had any breakouts since using this. Love it so much! I also love how there’s no added fragrance, so the lovely smell must be from the natural ingredients. My only complaint is the price, but I still stock up when it’s on sale. Give it a try! My FAVORITE cleanser! THE BEST
