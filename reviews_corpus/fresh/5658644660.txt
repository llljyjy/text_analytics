This product is my new holy grail serum. Iâ€™m a sucker for packaging, but more so, love the formula as it does not irritate my sensitive skin. I have also noticed an improvement in my skin texture after a week of using this daily am/pm. The scent is natural and green/herby - I love it!  This product also sits well under makeup and under all of the moisturizers I have tried. Green and natural
