The consistency of the serum is light weight, milky, and refreshing. It absorbs super quick — virtually no dry time between this step and following with additional products in my routine, so this helped me work ceramides back into my routine without a lot of down time.This serum claims to help with the look of fine lines and wrinkles, minimize the appearance of visible pores and texture, and help your skin feel and look plump and hydrated with a healthy glow. From the week I’ve been using it, my barrier looks and feels healthier and more hydrated than it did when I wasn’t adding ceramides into my routine.The key ingredients:- Niacinamide - 5kDA hyaluronic acid- Ceramide IIII will continue to use this consistently throughout the next few months and cannot wait to see the improvement in my skin.The only downside to this product is the price, running at $80 and $110 for the larger size. If that fits into your budget, go for it! nan
