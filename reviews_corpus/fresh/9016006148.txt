I’m in my mid 20s and have combination skin. I love this cream because it keeps me hydrated without being too heavy or too oily. It feels watery but doesn’t immediately sink in and leave you dry. It keeps me hydrated all night and I wake up with a plump face. It also smells so nice like cucumbery. Hydration without oiliness
