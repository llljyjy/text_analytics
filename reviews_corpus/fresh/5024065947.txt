First off, this smells amazing. It’s so sweet and fresh; the scent reminds me of pink lemonade. The formula is smooth and creamy and leaves my lips feeling soft and hydrated. I feel safe using this product near my mouth because I know the ingredients are clean. The shade I have is Peony and it’s a beautiful brownish rose shade. One swipe looks like my lips but better, but I love building the color up with multiple coats. I can’t stop wearing it! This product was gifted by Fresh, but all opinions are my own! Smells amazing!
