Acne sufferer and retinol user here. I love this texture. It feels rich enough to moisturize well, but doesnâ€™t clog pores or trigger breakouts. In fact, it really does bring down the redness I get from breakouts (and just life). I have noticed some subtle changes in dark spots as well. So good. Also, if you use a tiny bit more product, you can use it for facial massage. Safe for Acne-Prone Skin
