A few years ago I started using a fresh brand mask that I have repurchase several times. Totally loved it and wanted to try this eye cream, however a Sephora employee said it was not worth the money. Fast forward to a month ago I receive this as a free sample with a recent purchase. I noticed a different after two days of use!!! I since have ordered the cream and baffled to why itâ€™s not rated higher. It works my fine lines are 100% gone! Please note I do not have under eye bags just fine lines. 27 and my fine lines around my eyes are gone!
