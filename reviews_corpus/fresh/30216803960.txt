I love this lip balm! At first the shocking coral pink color (very bright) scared me but it looks surprisingly really good on my lips. The color is definitely buildable too. Thereâ€™s a nice subtle scent and sweetness to this balm as well. This product was gifted by fresh and I definitely want to get more varieties of this after trying this one. Great colored lip balm
