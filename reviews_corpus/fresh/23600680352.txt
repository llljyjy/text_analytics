This serum is honestly so great! Packed full of ceramides, hyaluronic acid and niacinamide, this serum allows you to cut some of the steps in your skincare routine down to one product! If you have damaged, sensitive, acne-prone skin, the formulation will definitely help with that. I used this when I was battling my hormonal acne and it definitely helped to stop the acne from getting worse. It is a little expensive for what it is and if you are sensitive to scents, I would pass on this serum, but other than that, this is genuinely a great serum! MAX HYDRATION!
