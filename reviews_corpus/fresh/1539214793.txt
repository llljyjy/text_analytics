In addition to run-of-the-mill dryness in the winter, I have a history of skin reactions to environmental allergens on my eyes and face. This is one of the two products (the other being Dermalogica’s Ultracalming Serum) that I can rely on to calm my skin down when it’s painfully irritated. Once, I had an allergic reaction to my foundation so severe that there was literally a raw spot on my temple... this was so soothing and helped get my face back to feeling normal within a few days. I now use this about once or twice a week when my skin is dry or itchy, especially in the winter or when I have a flare-up (like the mask rash I’m rocking right now). It’s instantly cooling and soothing, and my skin looks calmer and more hydrated as soon as I wash it off. I’ve even used it (carefully!) around my orbitals and eyelids, where my allergy freak-outs are the most frequent and persistent. It makes a huge difference! I travel with a mini jar of this stuff and rave about it to all my friends with sensitive skin. It’s a bit pricey, but I only have to buy it once or twice a year and it’s worth every penny!
