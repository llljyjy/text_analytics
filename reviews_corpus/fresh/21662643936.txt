I LOVE their Advanced Therapy Lip Treatment, I keep this one in my car because the tube kind melts. I like this because it doesn’t irritate my already very dry lips and it won’t melt all over my car, but for actual lip protection I will continue to use the other product. Just Okay, Their other products are better
