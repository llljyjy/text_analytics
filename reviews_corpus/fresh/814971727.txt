First of all, the color of the bottle is so soothing and I’m enjoying it on my vanity. The serum is very lightweight and plush and absorbs quickly. My skin is immediately hydrated and feels velvety soft. The more you use it, the better your skin becomes and my skin has never been healthier or plumper. I love that it also improves my skin barrier overtime. Love the innovative adaptive phytocompound tea (APT) technology, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid. It does have strong tea scent that lingers but eventually fades so doesn’t bother me. Healthier, Stronger & Plumper Skin!
