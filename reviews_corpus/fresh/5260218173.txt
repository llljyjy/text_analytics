I’m really loving Fresh’s Tea Elixir Skin Resilience Activating Serum! I’ve had my eye on this for some time, and the hype was real! All of the amazing things you’ve heard are all factual! I have Sensitive Skin and get cystic acne from time to time. I’m 41, so I’m totally over it! That’s why I’m so happy to finally get my hands on this gem! My Experience: I used morning and nightly, and I love the light weight feeling, the Calming scent and texture and how it just made my skin brighter and healthier! The ingredients are top notch, as expected! Ocean Kelp (refines skin’s texture) ,5kDAHyaluronic Acid (Hydrates and minimizes the appearance of Lines), Niacinamide (refines the look of pores!) and Ceramide III (helps strengthen our precious skin barrier!) Totally give this 5 STARS! I will be restocking! You Won't Be Dissapointed!
