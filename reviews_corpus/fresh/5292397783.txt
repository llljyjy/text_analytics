I like that this mask does not feel too thick and heavy. It’s a very fresh and calming moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin at all. During this time, my skin is extremely dry and flaky especially around my nose and chin areas, applying this overnight really helped my skin feeling refreshed. I noticed that my makeup doesn’t look to dry during the day when I use this. Amazing for my dry skin!
