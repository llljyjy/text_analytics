I have used skincare from fresh beauty and never been disappointed.  I have been using the Floral Recovery Calming mask for about 2 weeks now.  I can say I have seen a noticeable difference in my skin texture and how it’s calm down my redness. The creamy texture is lightweight and soaks into your skin very nicely without leaving any greasy residue. It doesn’t have any scent and I was so happy that was sensitive skin it didn’t cause any irritations. I’m very pleased with the results. Very soothing
