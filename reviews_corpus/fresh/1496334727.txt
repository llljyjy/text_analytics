I’ve been using this cleanser forever. It has a similar consistency to Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser but leaves no residue - my super sensitive skin loves it. It doesn’t strip my skin, it doesn’t irritate or strip my skin, yet it rinses clean and leaves my skin feeling soft. Not strong enough to remove heavy makeup on its own, I recommend double cleansing with something like Ordinary’s Squalane Cleanser or Farmacy’s Green Clean balm. Simple, gentle, effective, and the value size lasts FOREVER. I like that it doesn’t have a strong fragrance. Simple. Gentle.
