I really like this product and use it every morning and night incorporated with my skincare routine. The tea scent doesn’t bother me but it is pretty strong so if you don’t like anything scented I would suggest to stay away. Definitely helps me with my dry skin , makes my skin feel plump if that makes sense. nan
