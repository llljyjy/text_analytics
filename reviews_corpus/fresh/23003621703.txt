Really wanted to love this moisturizer. Unfortunately for me it created a film on my face and was pilling off, not moisturizing at all. And yes all my ingredients for other skin care products should should have worked with this moisturizer. Should have listened to the other reviews. Not worth the money! ITS A NO FROM ME
