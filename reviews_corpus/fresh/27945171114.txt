This product feels great on my lips, it does two things: it gently exfoliates, removing dead cells from my lips, and at the same time hydrates them, leaving them very soft and delicious. It smells very good I use it 3 times a week. with changes in weather my lips tend to get very dry and this helps me keep them soft and hydrated nan
