Fresh gifted me their Sugar Lip Balm in Rose and the formula is stunning! I love the texture and how it makes my lips feel hydrated but not sticky. I have chronically dry lips and this helps them feel  comfortable and adds the perfect hint of color. The only downside is that Iâ€™m not a huge fan of the scent/flavor but I do like it otherwise as a good daily lip balm. nan
