This serum produced excessive oils on my face and broke out my skin within 24 hours of using the product. My skin type is normal and not sensitive at all. However, something in this formulation disrupted my skin barrier. Love this brand but would prefer a gel based product over this oil infused product for sure. This line used to carry a rose gel serum that worked wonders. Strongly believe it would be beneficial to bring that product back for normal to oily skin types. Way too oily
