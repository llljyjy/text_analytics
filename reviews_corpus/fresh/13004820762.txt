I honestly didn’t think that Eye creams really did anything. I mainly used this eye cream for moisturize my skin around my eye gets really dry but did notice over time my dark eye circles were decreasing which I thought were perhaps to my better sleep or vitamin intake.When I ran out I didn’t buy another one and within a month or so I noticed that my eye circles had returned. So gonna go back and keep it up. I’m a fair complexion and East Indian heritage actually works on me
