performance | .85 star | personally didn’t experience smoother texture, granted I didn’t have a ton of texture to begin with. Does hydrate, leave a glow and make skin appear bouncy though! texture | full star | love a hydrating serum that’s a bit more milky! No sticky, foamy, or watery texture so winnnnscent | .75 star | the scent isn’t strong, but there is added fragrance packaging | .95 star | looove the look and feel on the gorgeous teal green glass bottle. Only complaint is the dropper itself doesn’t pick up quite enough product for the face and neck ingredients | .9 star | fairly clean ingredients. Love all the hydrating ingredients like glycerin and the oils. However not a fan of the added synthetic fragrances value | .6 star | $80 for a hydrating serum is a lot. Plus there’s many other hydrating serums I prefer over this one Total 5.05 out of 6 stars nan
