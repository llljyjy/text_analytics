I am in love with this serum! It is so hydrating, not sticky at all, leaves the skin plump and smooth. It has helped my skin’s moisture barrier and overall tone. It is non-irritating, even with the mild fragrance. I actually enjoy the tea fragrance very much! It’s an enjoyable and sensorial experience every time I use it. Lovely Serum, Great Results
