I have combo skin (oily, but with some dry patches that are also oily, sensitive, and thicker, porous skin) that doesn’t like most products. This cream has been an absolute delight!! It leaves me with zero tightness, and absorbs beautifully (yes- actually). My makeup applies nicely over it as well. For someone who’s looking for more than just a hydrating lotion, but your skin doesn’t like most heavy creams, I highly recommend trying this! My combo skin LOVES this!
