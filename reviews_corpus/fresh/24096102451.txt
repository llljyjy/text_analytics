It’s an okay everyday cleanser. I have oily and dehydrated skin and even though it is labelled as a “gentle“ cleanser and my skin is not sensitive, I still found that it is stripping and burns my face (when barrier is compromised). On normal days, it does a fine job, but I would not recommend if you are just starting retinoids (might be too harsh/stripping). It does have a weird “natural“ smell that took some time to get used to. Okay cleanser but not for compromised skin
