So I tested out this product just by itself with no toners or serums underneath because I wanted to see how it would soak into my skin and woo when I tell you I took a big glop and I pressed it into my skin it literally disappeared almost right away and it love the smell itâ€™s not too much and I woke up with more even skin tone I stg although I did put the Mara oil on top I think the combo was fire.
