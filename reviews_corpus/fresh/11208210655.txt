This is really nice luxury hydrating serum, but I’m afraid that’s all it really is. Some of the callout ingredients are tea, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide, which all can be incorporated into a skincare routine for less than $80. The serum absorbs quickly, plumps the skin, and has a pretty green herbal scent, but the price point is too high for me. This serum was sent to me for free, and I know I currently would not spend this much money on a hydrating serum. Pretty Serum But Not Worth It For Me
