I really like this cream! First of all, it smells like freshly brewed black tea, which is such a soothing and yummy herbal scent. It is thick yet spreadable and hydrating without being greasy. In fact, it absorbs so fully that I feel like I need something sitting on my skin (bc I am so used to product that is a lot oilier) but it’s just psychological/habit because this stuff packs a hydrating punch.  I have dry skin. I like to slug on product at night for the results but this is just so nice bc it doesn’t sit on my skin or make me stick to my silk pillow.  On nights  when I feel like I need that slugged on sensation, it layers on top of this just fine with no pilling. Gifted by fresh. nan
