Iâ€™m in love! First off, when you receive your package it is so nicely wrapped. The product itself is in a glass bottle (always a plus), and has a milky look to it. The product smells amazing, but is not a strong concerning smell. The product goes on the skin so nicely. I have used this product for only 2 days and my skin still looks and feels amazing! If you are in search for a new serum, or are debating on this one. BUY IT! It is 100000% worth it! LOVE!
