This is a nice serum! It sinks into my skin easily and doesnâ€™t leave a film on my skin like some serums do. I have noticed an immediate difference in some inflammation in my skin since starting to use this product. I think overtime it will really help to reduce my skins texture. The biggest turn off for me with this product is the smell. It really smells like tea tree oil and if that bothers you I would avoid this. nan
