First off, I have very dry skin, so when a cleanser says “hydrating“, it should be really hydrating. I did not feel that to be the case with this one. The Ordinary Squalane cleanser is far better imo.However, it has a nice gel like consistency and does a good job of cleansing. But I believe that’s not enough to trump the bad smell for me. it doesn’t smell herbal either- it’s a bad smell that’s off putting. So I wouldn’t buy this.Honest review :) Okay cleanser
