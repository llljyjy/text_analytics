Not a big fan of the light tea tree scent but it’s calming/relaxing. This serum makes my skin glow and gives it a nice bounce and plumpness. My skin looks more even toned. My skin soaks it up so quickly too. It did not cause any break out, irritation, nor dryness. It has a dropper dispenser which is great to keep everything hygienic and the product lasting longer since there’s no contamination. nan
