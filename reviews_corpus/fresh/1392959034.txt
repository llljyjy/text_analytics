This serum is the perfect addition to my daytime skin care routine. It’s lightweight and sinks into the skin without pilling when layered. I found that my skin was less red & more resilient when using this serum. Also, the dropper seems like it’s not getting a lot of product, but it’s actually the perfect amount for a full face application. nan
