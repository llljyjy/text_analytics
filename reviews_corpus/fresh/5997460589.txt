Did not like this product, the reviews were mostly positive so thought I would try this. The smell is very strong with this product and I do not like it, I also do not like putting strongly perfume-y moisturizers on my face. Also did not notice it helping my skin at all, where I can tell a difference from other products. To perfume-y of a smell!
