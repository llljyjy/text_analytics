My conscious and wallet are crying, but this eye cream is worth the splurge. I don’t have dark under eye circles so I can’t speak on that, but I do get swollen in the morning from my lack of/poor sleep. Applying this at night helps alleviate some of that swelling and best of all, it hydrates my skin without causing congestion and milia. The product is fragranced like most fresh products but I don’t find it offensive. Note that I don’t find this product to be useful for fine lines. I hate that I love it
