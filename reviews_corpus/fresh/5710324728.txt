I was so pleasantly surprised with this fresh serum! This is a very gentle formula and after using for a week I noticed smoother and hydrated skin. It has a lovely herbal smell. The dropper is a little finicky and takes a couple tries to get out a full serving. This is a great option for people like me who want to improve skin texture without using a bunch of aha/bhas.  Iâ€™m enjoying this so much! Gentle and effective
