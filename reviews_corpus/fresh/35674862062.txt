I was having some breakouts and this light serum was perfect to sooth my skin while providing it with the moisture that it needs. I didn’t use any moisturizer while my skin was healing and would just use this with a sunscreen over it. There is a scent to this product. I can’t quite figure out what scent it is but it’s not unpleasant and it didn’t irritate my skin. Milky serum!
