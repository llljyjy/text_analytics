Gifted by Freah for review. This is really nice! Fresh lip products are always good quality, but their lip treatments are the best they have imo. This hydrates and smooths, but also leave a very light tint to the lips, which is nice when you donâ€™t really want to put anything else on. Not worth the price imo, but a great luxury product! nan
