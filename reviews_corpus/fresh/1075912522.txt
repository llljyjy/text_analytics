I found this to be a great mask for my dry winter skin. It felt cooling and refreshing, and has a light, pleasant floral scent. It absorbs into the skin well, without leaving a sticky or greasy feeling. It can be used overnight for more hydration, or be washed off during the day for a little less. Overall, I think itâ€™s a great option for soothing dry and irritated skin. Great for dry skin
