I’ve been using this for a few weeks now and I’m a fan! Such a great clean, lightweight formula. Works wonderfully for day and night, but I especially love it as it’s perfect skincare before my daily makeup. Goes in smooth and soaks nicely into your skin. Super hydrating, and leaves your skin really glowy! My texture and fine lines have improved greatly over the last could of weeks. Also smells amazing. Love it! Texture Improved!!
