Love all the scent. Just replenishing as Iâ€™m almost done with the blood orange. I apply the balm more often than I prefer but it does help hydrate my lips. When I go hours without, my lips get chapped so it takes frequent applications to revive my lips. I still like the product and its packaging for easy use. nan
