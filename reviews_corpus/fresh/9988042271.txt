I have been using this serum every day for a month and I truly love it. I wasn’t sure at first what this was going to do for my skin but it works. Without the use of retinol or an anti aging cream, this serum has reduced my fine lines. Point blank. I wouldn’t recommend it as a full replacement for retinol and anti aging creams but I’m still a fan. The texture on my skin had changed visibly in my forehead and around my mouth, which you can see in my before photo (me in white). My most recent photo, my skin looks so smooth (me in purple). This is a new staple for me. Fresh Never Disappoints
