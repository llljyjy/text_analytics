I had tried other repairing or moisturizing night masks but they were very thick and heavy and I didnâ€™t like them. I loved the texture of this fresh mask, it is slightly heavy but with the massage it absorbs very well.I have used it at night 3 times a week on my dry areas and my skin looks very nice, soft and smoother. Definitely I like it. Soft and smooth skin
