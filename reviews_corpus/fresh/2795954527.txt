I bought this thinking it would be hydrating. Well itâ€™s not. I have a few issues with this product. 1 I really dislike the delivery system. The packaging sucks for lack of a better work. I wish this came in a tube. I mean a tube seems like it would be the smarter choice. 2. No hydration at all. I mean none. Go grab a chapstick or some carmex and have better hydrated lips than I did.What do I like about this product?1. The slight color tint. 2. The smell I love the smell of all these lip balms. But would I ever purchase another one.... Absolutely not. Would I recommend this yes to an enemy so they can have chapped lips too. Smells amazing but does little else
