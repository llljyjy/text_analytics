I received this complimentary from Fresh.  This smells so good and feels very hydrating.  It says Sugar in the title so I thought it might be like a sugar scrub but there are no granular items in it.  This gives a pink color to your lips so you can even wear this alone.  I like that the container is metal and has a screw on cap. This assures me the cap wonâ€™t come loss in my purse.  The smell is there when you unscrew the cap and a little when you apply but it is not overpowering. So hydrating
