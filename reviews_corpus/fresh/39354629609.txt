This might be one of my favorite serums yet. I’ve been using this for weeks now and my skin has never been smoother and plumper. It’s really helped diminish the fine lines and wrinkles around and under my eyes. I also wake up with a glow. I love that it’s an effective serum you can use morning and night. It’s also a unique milky texture which im in love with.  I highly recommend this serum for any skin type. It really brought my full irritated skin back to a glowy goddess. Such a good serum!
