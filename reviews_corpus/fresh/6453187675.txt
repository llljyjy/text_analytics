I’ve had the opportunity to try out this serum for about 4 weeks daily, and while I haven’t seen any major differences in my skin’s hydration or aging, I think it has helped in lightening some minor sun damage and discoloration. I even applied this serum on areas that were a bit tender due to sunburn from vacation and they healed beautifully. The texture is mildly viscous and milky, and it absorbs well into the skin. Note to those with very sensitive skin: it has a pretty strong tea fragrance. Helps with mild discoloration
