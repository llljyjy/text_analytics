I love it. Usually I am a Burts Bees kinda girl, but this gives just enough mint and tingle to be higher on the scale. It is a tad too waxy when you first put it on, but that goes away after a couple seconds. I usually never finish a chapstick and Iâ€™m definitely going to with this!!!! love it & worth it.
