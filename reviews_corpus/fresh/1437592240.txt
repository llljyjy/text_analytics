Fresh gifted me this lip treatment. It’s so nourishing and hydrating on the lips. I really enjoy the formula and love that it has sugar and fruit oils in it. I got the shade Icon, which is red. With it being in a format of a lip balm, it’s hard to apply such a bold color neatly. I would recommend sticking with more neutral colors that won’t be as messy to apply. So nourishing!
