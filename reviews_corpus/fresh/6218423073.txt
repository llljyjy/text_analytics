I received this product as a sample from Sephora. I am usually not a fan of Fresh Products but I am a fan of this product tho. I have dry/ combo skin, and under my eyes, I like to give extra hydration so my makeup can glide on easily. It was a thick formula and really absorbs into your skin and does not leave you feeling greasy or that it clogs the pores! But the price of this product is a little on the pricey side. But I will be buying it in the future. nan
