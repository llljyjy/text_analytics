I have been a long time fan of a fresh skin care products and the serum feels so nice and light weight on my skin. I have a few fine lines around my eye area that look visibly more plump after application. I found this worked really well underneath my other serums in moisturizer. It’s pricey for the amount you’re getting which is why I give 4 stars. nan
