Really love this serum and canâ€™t wait to use it every morning - it has an HA base which is perfect before my moisturizer, and i love that it has niacinamide in the formula. The scent is subtle and smells lux. My skin has been soaking it up and feeling extra moisturized! Great serum to add to the morning routine
