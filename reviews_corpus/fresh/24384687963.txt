Fresh Beauty gifted me the new Sugar Peony Tinted Lip Balm. Finally, a lip balm that provides a pigmented color. I love the hydrating ingredients on it. Lips instantly look glowy and plump. Make dryness go away while enjoying a beautiful and subtle color. Softness is long-lasting but I gave to reapply a few times to revive the color intensity. I recommend this product if you want a color infusion. If you are looking for a deep dryness repair, it will be better to stay with the basics. Hydration+Color is Amazing!
