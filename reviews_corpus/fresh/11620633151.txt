Gifted by Fresh. After two weeks of continued use I feel like I have a pretty good idea about the product and have been able to use AM/PM, under makeup, and tested with different skincare products.  I didn’t have any negative experiences or reactions and I do have somewhat sensitive skin. The serum is hydrating, plumping, and smoothed over texture. It provides a healthy glow and makes my skin look more youthful. It’s not sticky, is lightweight, and absorbs quickly into the skin. Even though I can use this in the morning and have worn it under makeup I do prefer to use this at night. Hydrating serum
