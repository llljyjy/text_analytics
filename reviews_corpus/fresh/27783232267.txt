I love the new Fresh floral recovery calming mask! I was a bit hesitant at first because I thought the smell would be too powerful but I ended up loving it! I have a lot of coloring to my skin and this mask really helped reduce and calm the redness! Check this out if youâ€™re looking for a new night mask! Redness GONE!
