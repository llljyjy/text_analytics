I’m absolutely in love with this product!! It was in a lip set that I purchased from Sephora. Always trying to rotate my lip balms around so I don’t have the exact same product on my lip 24/7. I’m allergic to SPF and it is getting really hard to find QUALITY balms without SPFs. This was a great find and I’m looking forward to ordering the tinted balms for some sheer color. Also, I love that the tube is a screw cap!! Saves my handbags from potential messes. Amazingly simplistic goodness.
