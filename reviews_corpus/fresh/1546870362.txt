This lip balm is so luxurious. It has a wonderful light yet nourishing formula. It glides over the lips and leaves a thin veil of color and hydration on the lips. The rose color is incredibly natural and fresh on the lips. It really enhances my natural lip color and I truly believe this will look good on everyone! I love being able to get color and hydration from one lip product. If there’s one lip product I have to carry in my bag with me, it this one. You don’t even need a mirror to apply it. It’s so perfect for everyday wear. I have gifted multiple tubes to my friends and family. I don’t know anyone who’s doesn’t love this balm! Gifted by Fresh. Beautiful Hydrating Color
