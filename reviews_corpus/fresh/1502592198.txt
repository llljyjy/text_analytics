Complimentary from fresh for an honest review. I am in love with this moisturizer. It smells divine and feels so luxurious. It is super hydrating and it doesnâ€™t irritate. It actually soothed my skin that was feeling a bit irritated due to retinol. I will definitely recommend and this has become a staple in my routine. This also layers easily and hydrating enough to use on its own. Must have in any skincare routine
