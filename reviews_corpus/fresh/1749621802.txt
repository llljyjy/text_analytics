I was gifted by Fresh the Rose Sugar Lip Treatment in exchange for my honest thoughts on the product….here goes! I was hoping to get a bit more color pay off from the product but unfortunately didn’t get much…HOWEVER the fragrance and long lasting moisture pay off more than made up for it!! I would definitely recommend this product….top quality and left my lips feeling baby soft…all day! Baby soft lips all day!
