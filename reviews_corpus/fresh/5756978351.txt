This is truly a treat of a serum! It provides a spa-like sensorial experience with its tea/citrusy scent. However it is not overwhelming and does not sensitize my skin. The consistency is medium, so it’s not too watery and not too thick. It absorbs quickly and makes my skin appear quite plump and ready for the next steps in my routine. However, I don’t think I would spend my own money to purchase this serum given the steep price. I think this would be a great treat every once in awhile, but as a student with a tight budget, I believe I can get just as effective results with other products. nan
