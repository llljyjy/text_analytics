complimentary from Fresh the texture of the cream is thick rich and buttery. I assume the cream will last a long way because of its nourishing texture you actually dont need a lot. I believe this cream is best to use during winter or transitioning into spring.  i did a simple skincare routine by cleansing my face, then follow up with a toner and then applied fresh ceramide black tea cream. i liked that my skin looked very balanced and with a natural glow, but without grease or extra shine to a touch. my skin felt bouncy smooth and soft. bouncy skin, so rich texture, but not oily
