absolutely love this product ! The beauty advisor in Sephora recommended me this product as I was looking for a cleanser around the store, and im ever so thankful she did show me this! it is not harsh on the skin whatsoever, it’s hydrating, and effortlessly takes my makeup off. although, it does have the strong soy smell, which I don’t very much like but I can work with! definitely going to repurchase :-) effortlessly takes makeup off !
