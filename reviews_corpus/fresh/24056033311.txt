I love Fresh products, so I’m not surprised that I fell in love with this one as well. It has a milky texture and sinks into the skin nicely, leaving my skin feeling very soft. I’ve been using it for a couple weeks now, and it’s given me a nice glow! While it’s not the most important thing, I also really love the bottle it comes in. Would definitely recommend! nan
