I was gifted by Fresh and these are my real honest opinions.I can’t believe how much I love this serum because I never thought I could enjoy a serum over $50 to rave about. This serum does everything you want: soothes, hydrated, plumps and even give a radiant finish. It’s absorbs right into the skin leaving a bounce and radiant finish that preps your skin perfectly for the next step. This has ATP a technology/ technique that extracts the most concentration of the ingredients to be as powerful as it’s benefits (natural ing). When applying, the serum sinks into your skin plumping and hydrating while reducing skin texture. First day of using it I woke up with skin that was soft and plump and still hydrated throughout the day and night. If you’re looking for a nice $$ serum that will fit all season to reduce skin texture, give your skin a bounce and hydrate the skin the whole entire day this is it. nan
