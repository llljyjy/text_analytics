My dehydrated, acne prone skin loves this serum. Itâ€™s lightweight, sinks in quickly and makes my skin feel more hydrated and healthy. The niacinamide is great for brightening and reducing the hyperpigmentation I have from old acne scars. The bottle is really luxe and beautiful on my vanity as well. Lovely serum for my dehydrated skin
