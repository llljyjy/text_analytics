This balm was gifted by Fresh, but is exactly what I have been looking for! This balm is not only the perfect pink that still has a natural feel, but looks like you have a little something on, but it’s also actually hydrating! I always find that colored balms tend to by dry and don’t hydrate my lips but this balm is perfect, plus the color comes from beetroot which I love, and it doesn’t have Phthalates! This color is great because you can build it up or down as much as you want, and it stays on for a decent amount of time without getting on my cups and straws like some other colored balms do! Rose
