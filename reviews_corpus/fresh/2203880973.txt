I’m a years long fan of Fresh lip balms, and the classic Rosé shade is my favorite. This is extremely similar to the original formula that I love, which is a creamy, buttery balm that’s non sticky. It’s worth nothing it doesn’t last long but reapplying is a pleasure. This has a very light lemon sugar scent, but I prefer the original scent more. As much as I love this lip balm, the fact that they removed the SPF 15 is a huge drawback for me; it’s one of the best reasons I’ve liked them. I used to wear this all the time during the day but I’ll need to switch now, which is a bummer. The formula and packaging of this lip balm can’t be beat, but the lack of SPF is truly a big deal for me. I won’t repurchase when this is done. Fresh Sugar Lip Balm
