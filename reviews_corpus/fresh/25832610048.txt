I really enjoyed using the new Fresh black tea age renewal cream. It smells just like the new tea serum and is an enjoyable, calming, herbal smell. I have sensitive skin and did not have any problems using this product. However, I havenâ€™t seen much of a difference in my skin from using it yet. I think I will have to use it for weeks to notice any difference.  -Gifted by Fresh Calming herbal smell, hydrating cream
