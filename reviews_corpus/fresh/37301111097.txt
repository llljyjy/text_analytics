Love this product gifted by Fresh. The packaging itself is very sleek and cute. The product goes on smoothly with sugar and fruit based oils to bring that color, smoothness and hydration it just feels really good and hydrating. However my favorite part is the buildable color. You can use it as an everyday lip balm and have a subtle sheer color or you can build the color up to as much as u want! The photos I show are just the difference between two layers. love
