This mask worked AMAZING from the first use! I actually used this mask while my skin was very irritated and sensitive to even touch and the next morning my skin woke up feeling normal and calm. It really healed my skin overnight and I’m looking forward to using it a few times a week. It’s very creamy and absorbs well without any greasy feeling. So it’s a perfect night treatment that works! Healed my skin overnight!
