This is a really beautiful red lip if that you can apply sheer or build up to be more bold. It isn’t quite as hydrating as I had hoped for, but it doesn’t cling to dry patches or tug on my lips. I find that it works best if I use a normal lip balm underneath and then layer this one, and the color does last a long time. I received this product complimentary from Fresh in exchange for my honest review. Beautiful subtle red lip
