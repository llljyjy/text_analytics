After 3 months of using a night cream I thought was working for me, I realized I was still getting these little white heads on my face. I decided to try something new. After researching creams I found Lotus and it had great reviews. I was a little Leary in the reviews that said they noticed a change after 1 use. Well…I’m now one of those people! After one use I had no little white head zits and my skin looked fresh and bright!!! After one week my skin looked more healthy and more vibrant than it has in the last 10 years!!! WOW WOW WOW!!!
