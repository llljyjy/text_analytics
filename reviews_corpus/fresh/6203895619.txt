I just turned 30 guys I was not ready! But anyway, this is where this serum comes through with its anti-aging claims! I LOVE a serum that targets wrinkles and texture. At this point I just want my natural skin to look healthy and glowy and I want to embrace it. I am not interested in heavy makeup anymore. I want to feel Fresh and free. This serum is a favorite paired with my facial firming device. I apply this then use my device and finish my routine with a moisturizer. I feel so pampered. This serum simply feels luxurious. It is a thin milky consistency that absorbs so nicely into the skin. My complexion looks supple and dewy. I have combination skin and, yes my nose does get oily throughout the day with this serum, but I would not stop using it because of that. Just some blotting and itâ€™s all good. I love its benefits and definitely see it working on my skin. Beautiful serum for pampered skin
