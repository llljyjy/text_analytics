The texture is pretty creamy and reminds of a medium weight moisturizer. Being that it’s labeled as an overnight treatment, I as expecting it to be a heavier consistency but it was not. I tried using it alone and over moisturizers. I found using it alone didn’t do much for my moisture levels. The next morning my face didn’t feel like it retained any extra moisture. This is why I prefer to use in conjunction with my regular night creams. For someone with combo to oily skin, I think I would prefer to use this in the summer when my skin doesn’t need as much moisture. Scent wise it has a very light floral scent that I like. Light weight & did not wow me
