I received this lip treatment complimentary from Fresh. I like that this is a lip treatment. I does give my lips a lot of moisture thatâ€™s last through the day. The buildable coverage is a nice touch, you can really personalize the color you want. Not a huge fan of the scent. It smells like a lip smackers chapstick from the 90s. Good Lip Treatment Weird Scent
