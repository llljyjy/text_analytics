I have never tried a serum  like this one before and I must say that I really like it! I noticed the scent immediately…It is very relaxing & calming! Which sets a nice vibe when doing my skincare routine! I personally don’t think it is to overpowering. Also it has a creamy yet light and silky texture that absorbs nicely. Feels very luxurious! I noticed my skin was more hydrated right away and after using for about 2 weeks I am starting to notice even more results…smoother and brighter skin. Which makes me happy. Can’t wait to see what the results are after using it all!  A nan
