Before using this serum, my skin was more normal/dry and I had breakouts around my nose, chin & forehead. I have always struggles with breakouts on and off in those areas as well as also having some fine lines around my smile and eyes even though I am only in my 20s. I have been using this serum for a month now and I can honestly say I saw results after a week and a half of use. My skin was definitely more firm around the fine line areas making them less noticeable while keeping my skin supple. This serum has helped with redness and fading of the breakout spots literally overnight. I do use this product 2x a day in the morning and at night and I just cannot get enough. I will definitely have to have a back up of this before my current runs out because this will never be leaving my skincare routine as long as its on the market because my skin has never looked this good! My new favorite product!!
