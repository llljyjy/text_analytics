(Gifted by Fresh for honest review)Love the touch of color in this particular tint, & it’s definitely buildable. I would say this balm feels nourishing, but overall hydrating not so much. It kind of just sits on top & I felt like I needed to reapply it often to keep my lips happy. I do work directly under a vent in an air conditioned office however, so my lips tend to be extra dry & needy these days. I like this more for an at-home balm or to grab it I need some immediate comfort for my lips. Wouldn’t say I would rely on it to hydrate or recover my lips however. 3/5 for these dry lips! Cute, but…
