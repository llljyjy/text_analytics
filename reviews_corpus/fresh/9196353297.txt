Is this supposed to come with a safety sticker on the side of the jar? I ordered the same size of the Lotus Youth Preserve eye cream and when I opened the box the jar had a safety sticker on the side but the moisturizer did not. I want to make sure I’m not getting a product that was previously opened/used. When I opened the jar, there was a large space or pocket where there wasn’t any cream and I could not tell of it was from an air bubble or actual missing product. Thank you. Product Seal
