Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment wears well, it lasts several hours before I need to reapply.  I have larger lips that tend to become dry very easily. The Lip Treatment keeps my lips moisturized and the color infused in the Treatment means there is no need to apply a lipstick over it. Sometimes I put on a lipliner underneath to make the color last longer. I also like that the cap is a twist off, I haven’t had any problems with it coming off in my bag. This product was complimentary from Fresh in exchange for an honest review. (not sure why Peony wasn’t an option in the dropdown) great tinted lip balm
