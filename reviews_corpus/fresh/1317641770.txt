Like many others here I’m also a loyal, long-time user of this tinted balm. I loved the creaminess, color payoff, shine and SPF of the original product. I even stuck with it after my fave shades would get discontinued (RIP Passion!). This new formula is a total bummer-- very waxy, low pigmentation, and not moisturizing at all. Also it WILL NOT stick to my full lips, only the outermost parts that are never moistened from the inside of my mouth, if that makes sense. This is now a “tinted balm“ that doesn’t provide color or moisture, all yours for $24!  Here’s a tip for using the new formula if you’re stuck with it because you missed the window for returns like I did: Rub the stick on your fingertip first to warm it up, then apply the melted balm on your finger to your lips. Rubbing the stick directly on your lips will only result in pulled skin and disappointment. Not the same product anymore...
