This serum has a heavenly smell and texture. It has the faintest white tea scent - not overwhelming at all and doesn’t linger - and is milky and absorbs quickly. I have been using it morning and night for two weeks and while I don’t know that I’ve noticed a large difference in my skin, it certainly feels hydrated and I love the way this serum feels on my skin. I need to continue using to see if there are any long term findings! Smells and feels wonderful
