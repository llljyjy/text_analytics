This might be my favorite serum ever! Not only are the ingredients amazing, this has a light, fresh scent that I love! The milky, lightweight consistency is absorbed quickly and clear without any residue. Iâ€™m a sucker for nice packaging and this green glass is lovely, plus the dropper makes it easy to get the right amount every time. The best part is that this leaves my face feeling soft, supple, and hydrated! Love this serum!
