I was gifted by Fresh. I’ve always been a fan of the Fresh Sugar balms and have several shades but this one is my favorite. It’s the perfect “just bitten” pink that compliments anyones lip color. It’s buildable which is really nice and the formula keeps my lips hydrated for hours! I always get compliments when I wear this. The packaging is beautiful, luxe and looks expensive. This is my go to balm! I also really love that I can feel good about the ingredients list. I’m a big fan of clean beauty and only buy products that are paraben and phthalate free.
