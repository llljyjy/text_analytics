The application and wear of this product is so lovely. The packaging is sturdy and elegant, I love that the screw on lid keeps it from coming apart in a purse or pocket! The color is nice, but it’s a little too pigmented to slather on like a lip balm, I have to be a bit carefully applying it or I look like a small child applying her mom’s lipstick. It does look really nice as a sheer, balmy  lipstick though. Gifted by Fresh Really nice!
