I received this product complimentary from Fresh. I knowww this is such a cult-classic, staple product for so many people, but I don’t think I like it. It gives a nice little tint of color but it doesn’t last but like 10 mins on my lips at the most, and I actually find my lips feel dryer after I use it. I do have chronically dry lips, so maybe if you don’t, you’d like this. But for me, it’s overpriced and overrated. Meh
