I was gifted by fresh to try out and give my honest review. I love fresh lip balms! This is  hydrating lip balm which has sugar from beet root and sugar cane! I love that it has such as amazing ingredients that is hydrates, softens and smoothens lips! The texture is so buttery and smooth! the colour payoff is sheer to buildable! I love the tint it provides, perfect for summer and all year round. Keeping lips healthy, supple and smooth! smooth as butter
