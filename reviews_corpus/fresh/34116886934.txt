This recovery mask is def my fav Fresh product now. My skin is very sensitive and dry so it’s hard for to find something that keeps my skin hydrated during the cold season. This mask is so hydrating and it’s not heavy or oily at all. I apply this at the night and wake up with plump and smooth make up ready skin. Skin looks and feels soft/plump in the morning:)
