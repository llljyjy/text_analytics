Every time I use this mask it feels like it’s taking me out on a spa date. It’s cooling and hydrating, which makes it feel like a luxurious experience. Since it’s an overnight mask, it’s super easy to use. I love that I don’t have to wash it off! So far I’ve noted a decrease in how dry my skin is and a slight decrease in my usual redness. I’m excited to see what long term benefits this provides me with! Feels luxurious!
