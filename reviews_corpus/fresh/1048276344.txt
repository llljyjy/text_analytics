This mask over-exceeded my expectations! It not only evens skin tone but it leaves it brighter, too. I leave it on overnight and use it as a sleeping mask. I love how fresh and healthy my skin looks the next day, like I got a good nightâ€™s sleep or came back from a hike. It absorbs quickly and I do not find myself having to massage in excess or wipe off remaining product after the 10 minute application process. I have combo skin with some breakouts and sensitivity, but I believe all skin types will benefit from this product. FRESH SKIN
