Bought this with the night version when I ran out of my Estée Lauder stuff.  Had been using DayWear for 9 years and thought it was time to switch it up.  It’s okay.  Fragrance is strong for being “clean” and it also doesn’t have an SPF.  It absorbs well so I don’t mind topping it with sunscreen.  Will probably be seeking something new after I run out. pretty basic
