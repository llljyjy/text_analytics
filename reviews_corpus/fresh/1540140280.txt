What a lovely product! This fresh milky serum packs a punch. Skin becomes replenished, moisturized, calmed and looks and feels visibly tighter after use of this product. I love that it absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a greasy residue. One potential drawback is a string tea scent. I personally find it revitalizing but I can se me how someone might be sensitized to it. It’s a great product for my skin, and it combines effects of multiple targeted products, which saves money. Love this serum
