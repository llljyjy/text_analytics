I have combination oily skin that changes throughout the year. Because of this I tend to use one or two serums instead of layering on too many products followed by a moisturizer. This serum so light weight on my skin and it hydrated really well. I havenâ€™t been using it long enough to see if it makes a huge difference is in terms of anti-aging but I like using it for now. nan
