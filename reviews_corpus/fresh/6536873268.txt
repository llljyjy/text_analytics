Let me first say, I’m a huge fan of Fresh. I have been using the Soy Face wash for years now. And I love the Lotus Antioxidant Night Cream, and the sugar scrub mask. All that to say, this mask was horrible for my skin. It’s very thick, and it caused me to break out each time I’ve tried it. Sadly I will be returning this product. Break out city
