Loved this product! I got the color Peony but that wasn’t an option in the choices on the review. The tone looks great on my skin and it’s very hydrating. It is buildable, but I’m not sure if it’s just the color I have but i wish it showed up a bit more. It gives me a slight just kissed look, but I wish I could build it up more! Gifted by Fresh :) Natural color!
