I apply the product right before I go to bed since it’s an overnight mask that helps with uneven skin tone. It’s a fairly thick cream, but it does not feel heavy at all. The scent is very mild and my skin feels soft the next morning. My skin feels hydrated and am happy that I did not get any breakouts from it. My skin feels so hydrated in the morning.
