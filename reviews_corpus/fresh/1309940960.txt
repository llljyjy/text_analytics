I am big fan of Fresh! I love how it just glides on your lips & feels buttery soft. My lips felt nourished & soft all day. My lips felt hydrated & I love the color Peony- thatâ€™s the color I was gifted by Fresh and I want to snag more shades. The color is this warm berry color and is buildable. I love the clean formula too. If you are looking for a balm that is soft and nourishing that gives you a tint of color then this lip product is for you. Buttery soft & smooth lip balm!
