First, the packaging is beautiful. Second, the product is great. It’s light and refreshing on your skin, and it doesn’t leave you feeling oily or sticky. I also feel like my skin has been glowing more because of the product (which is saying something because I’ve been super busy and tired right now). I recommend this. nan
