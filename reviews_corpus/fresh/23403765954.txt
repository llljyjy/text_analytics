I tried this product with the Rose Hyaluronic Acid Deep Hydration Moisturizer. Together my dry flaky skin cleared up after the first use! This toner hydrates while leaving face feeling fresh and it smells really good! I bought this in a mini size over a month ago and although I already ran out of the moisturizer I still have half a bottle of this toner left. Hydrating with great smell
