First off, I really love the texture and scent of this serum! The scent is really fresh and the serum is lightweight and sinks into the skin quickly. I have been really stressed with work lately and have noticed that this brought my dull skin a nice glow and bounce. It looks very healthy! I havenâ€™t seen much of a difference in my fine lines yet but I am excited to keep testing! nan
