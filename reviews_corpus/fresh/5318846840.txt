This serum is absolutely amazing! I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and have seen a huge difference in my skin. My skin looks so smooth a glowy within just a week of using it. The serum itself is very gel-like and lightweight and it absorbs into my skin very quickly. The scent is very pleasant and herbal and not overpowering. Overall I give it a 10/10 and it’s become a staple product in my skincare regimen! It's a 10/10 for me!
