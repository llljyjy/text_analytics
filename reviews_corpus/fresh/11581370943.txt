I haven’t tried any skincare products from Fresh and this was my first one so I was excited. The packaging was so beautiful detailed. The texture of the product was milky and did not sit on top of the skin. However, it should be noted that the scent is on the stronger side. My skin did become irritated after using it which was disappointing. It does include great ingredients and the price point is not as affordable which is a downside. However, this product did not work for me. high price tag; didn’t work for me
