I was gifted this product for my honest review. I had dull/dry combination with my skin . Using the serum for the past 5 days . My fine lines have faded a away. My face feels more softer and hydrated to the touch . Really my skin feels young I applied day and night after cleansing and put on my face and neck. Itâ€™s a amazing and so glad I got to try this . Will buy when I run out or probably just stock up. Had no allergic reactions and no sensitivity alarms . 100% recommended Amazing Serum !!!
