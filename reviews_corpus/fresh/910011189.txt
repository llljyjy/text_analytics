I got this last year during the Fresh sale, and the bottle lasted about four months! During that time, my skin took on a softer, bouncier texture and feel. I also had some various Fresh samples that I used with this, and I loved them all! This product, though, I feel is the base for all the other wonderful creams and products from Fresh, and is my absolute favorite. I’ve used this bottle all through this winter so far, and I have not had any rashes from allergic reactions, and I believe it even protected my face from winter skin and windburn during a recent weeklong trip to Chicago that saw single digit temps! I pat it onto my face, neck, and décolletage after a shower, then follow with with Fresh’s Lotus Youth Preserve Night Recovery Cream, and Black Tea Age-Delay Eye Concentrate. I almost feel like I could skip makeup some days! Onto my second bottle now, and I will keep this as part of my regular skin care routine! Just too darn good!!
