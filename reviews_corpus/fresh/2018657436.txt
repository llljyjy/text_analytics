My skin type is dry and my concern is aging as I am a mom of 3 and 31 years old with lack sleep and stress being a mom. This product instantly made my skin feel refreshed and looked brighter. I love products that have hyaluronic acid because of the hydration your skin gets! And I hardly get to wear makeup but this product gives me the glow I need. nan
