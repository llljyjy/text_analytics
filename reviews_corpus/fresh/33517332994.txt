I received the product complimentary from Fresh, the option is my own. I’ve tried lots of different Fresh products over the years and it’s my first time trying this Black Tea facial moisturizer. This is my type of face cream - it’s just the right consistency, lightweight but not serum-like lightweight, not too heavy and spreads nicely on my skin. It doesn’t have lots of fragrance in it, just a gentle smell of black tea. Overall it’s a great all-year moisturizer. Great year-round moisturizer
