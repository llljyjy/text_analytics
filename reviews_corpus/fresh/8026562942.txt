I have been using products from the brand for a long time and it was great to add a mask to my collection. I have been applying this product everyday since 2 weeks in my PM routine after cleansing and using an essence. It does not take a lot of time to absorb into the skin after the initial massage. My morning skin feels so calm and rejevenated with an extra dose of softness. I definitely recommend this product for those fans of the brand. nan
