This is an incredible, hydrating lip product that I use most nights before bed. It’s a little thick, so I don’t like to wear it during the day. It keeps my lips soft and balanced. If you have the money to spend $26 on a lip balm, go for it; however, I bought this with a gift card and simply cannot justify re-buying it with my own money. Great Product, Steep Price
