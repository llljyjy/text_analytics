WOW! My skin needed this! Especially my neck. I don’t know who needs to hear this, but use firming cream on your neck BEFORE you think you need neck cream. I regret not doing that sooner. This isn’t labeled as a neck cream, but I use it on both my face and neck and I’ve seen such a large improvement in the elasticity of my skin. Gifted by Fresh; my favorite skincare company. Although I’ve been gifted this, I definitely would buy this with my own money. Love love love!!
