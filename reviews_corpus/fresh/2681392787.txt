It is a nice face wash. I want to love it so bad because it is the right balance of moisture, but it makes me break out badly! My face has never been this bumpy before in my life…. Like worse than the Rudolph zit I got in the 6th grade. My father asked me if there was something wrong with my face. I love their facial moisturizers, but I’m going to have to pass on this face wash. Also, I do not wear make up, so I don’t know how bad it is at removing makeup, but my guess is it’s not good. nan
