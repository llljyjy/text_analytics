My skin has been horrible during my pregnancy (full-blown acne) and I have been using this face wash for the past week. My skin looks better than it has looked in months and I have barely had any new breakouts. I also love that it takes off eye makeup as well. I will definitely repurchase Has been the best during pregnancy!
