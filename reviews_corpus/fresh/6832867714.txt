Bought a trial size of this a few months back and it worked well so I bought the full size. I have combination skin (Caucasian) in my late forties and the formula doesn’t cause acne but still provides moisture. I live in a subtropical state so I’m exposed to high humidity and daily exposure to sunlight. It’s lightweight enough to blend well with makeup, sunscreen and any other serums I use without pilling or causing build-up. I use a little more than a pea sized amount on my face and neck. The lotion has a very light scent which is from the ingredients but after a few hours it disappears. It smells a little like their Soy Face Cleanser that I use. Since I’m not looking for anti-aging moisturizer this does what I need which is a moisturizer that doesn’t cause acne. I would definitely recommend this for anyone with combination skin and to purchase the trial size to test it out. Definitely For Combination Skin
