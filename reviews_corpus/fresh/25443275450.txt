This mask is filled with vitamin c and extracts of cornflower, cherry blossom, & peony. Love its texture and pleasant fragrance. I like to apply it for 20 minutes. It literally relax down my face and makes my face smooth and brightens. It also helps to control redness of my face which I usually get in this season. nan
