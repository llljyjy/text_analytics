This moisturizer has a very rich texture to it. It’s lightweight on the skin yet very affective. So far this has done great with my sensitive acne prone skin. I haven’t has any issues with it causing any breakouts or irritation. The weather has really dried our my skin and this moisturizer has improved my skin barrier and helped get rid of any flakey dry spots. My skin overall looks more radiant and alot more firm. (Gifted by fresh) All claims are true
