I love hyaluronic acid face serums and they’re a crucial part of my skin routine! I have dry skin so I was very excited to try this. The scent is fresh and nice, and the serum is white and milky. It feels old on my face, and my skin feels so soft and hydrated right after I use it. I can tell my skin is more hydrated after using it. I’ve been using it morning and night for the last couple days, and it’s been working great. I can tell a difference in my skin. My only small complaint is that the dropper on the pipe tote for the serum is a bit tough, and you have to squeeze really hard to pick up product. Other than that, it’s great! Great hydrating face serum
