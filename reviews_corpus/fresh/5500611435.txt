The lip balm itself is a really nice balm. If you’re looking for good quality, this brand has some really nice ones. I’ve used other flavors in the past and liked them. However, this one did not taste anything like mint. It tasted almost citrusy.  I’m not sure if that’s the actual flavor or it was a mix up in packaging. Confused about the flavor.
