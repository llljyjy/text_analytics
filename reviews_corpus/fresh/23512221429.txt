Never thought a really hydrating product can feel so lightweight on your skin. That’s really amazing fact for me who hates a heavy layer of moisturizers. It gets fully absorbed into my skin after 10 minutes of applying it and leaves my skin so soft and bouncy. Love ❤️ everything about it. I can’t smell anything from this overnight mask which is great. I am pregnant and it’s safe to use. 😘 No thick feeling on face
