My primary focus with skincare is anti-aging, primarily targeting fine lines around my eyes and elasticity and firmness, as well as soothing redness and helping uneven texture. My skin type is combination but I prefer hydrating skincare. I apply this Fresh Beauty mask twice a week overnight, and it leaves my skin hydrated and moisturized all day. The formula feels light and absorbs quickly without any mess, and my skin has a more even tone without any redness. nan
