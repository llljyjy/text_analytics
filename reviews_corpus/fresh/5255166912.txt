I love fresh products and this renewal cream is up there on my favorites list. The texture is gorgeous, creamy, and luxurious. Exactly what you would expect from Fresh. My skin feels soft, and is starting to look more youthful and firm after each application. The scent is light and fresh, and reminds me of something you’d smell at a high end spa. It sinks right into the skin and doesn’t feel sticky, or too thick - it’s the perfect consistency for year round hydration. I look forward to this step in my skincare routine morning and night, it’s such a beautiful cream.  Kindly gifted by fresh but all opinions are my own. A must have anti-aging cream
