I have been using this for 2 consecutive weeks and I have noticed my skin glow improvement which in fact, I have complimented with how glowy my skin is! Love the milky texture and not feeling sticky afterwards without leaving greasy even after adding the moisturizer. My skin is hydrated all through out the day and that is what I am looking for a serum product. Not to mention the APT technology is also an antioxidant protection and will improve skin structure, reduce the look of lines and build a stronger barrier on skin. Love this serum! Definitely a must try! MUST try!!
