This serum was so nice to use. It felt luxurious and made my skin feel plump and super hydrated. The texture feels nice and it sinked into the skin almost immediately. I saw improvements in overall hydration but as far as skin texture I would need to use longer. The only thing I didn’t like it’s the fragrance, it took me a bit to get used to. Nice texture, would need to use longer for results
