I went to sephora looking for something that would hydrate my super dry skin (I live in High Elevation 6,000ft+) and the beautician recommended this amsk. Although I am not a fan of how this smells it does leave my skin feeling soft and fresh and ready for skincare/makeup application. Like a few other reviews, I can leave this mask on for more than the directed time even though I have very sensitive skin.  The quality of the mask seems to meet the price point. I am surprised by the benefits and will use it until its done, but I might look into another mask before purchasing this one again. I really like it, but I do not love it. Like, not Love
