I would not recommend this it you are going through acne breakout and it hasn’t been resolved.  Otherwise this is great to smooth the skin and give it a glow. I only use it at night with thick moisturizer (I have dry skin). Also I do not use this everyday probably 2-3 times a week. If I used it everyday I feel like my skin would no longer get the benefits of it. It does have fragrance which I’m not a fan of but it is not strong. cool to try
