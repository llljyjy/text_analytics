Nice rich but non greasy cream with great moisturizing ingredients. It’s only lightly scented compared to other Fresh products which I like, although IMO a “calming“ mask should be fragrance free.     I’m also not so sure about the anti redness/texture claims, I guess time will tell but I’d suggest an active ingredient like retinol if that’s a serious concern for you. This is definitely effective to hydrate and soften though, no question. Great option as a night mask or even daily moisturizer if you have dry skin. nan
