That doesn’t change myHonest opinion about the product.I love the packaging, doesn’t feel cheap . This product is perfect for aging skin , my skin feels very moisturized after using and feed very soft to the touch . It does have a light scent but nothing too overpowering or that breaks my skin out. My skin doesn’t feel heavy with this . I noticed more moisture and lightening of dark spots slightly as well. I will be purchasing another as soon as this runs out. nan
