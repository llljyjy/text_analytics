So far I absolutely love this product! I have been using it for a few days now and have already noticed my skin being smoother overall and looking brighter. I’m excited to continue to use this product and get results. I also love how lightweight this product is and how it wasn’t tacky at all, making it easy to apply my makeup over it in the mornings. Overall my skin feels much more hydrated when I use this serum. Great, Hydrating Serum
