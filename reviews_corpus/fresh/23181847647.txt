I got a trial size of this from Sephora as an add on for spending $25! I’ve been using the smallest amount for two weeks now and have seen some good results. My ‘11’ lines look plump and less noticeable since I opened this. I use it as my antioxidant serum in the morning and find my makeup stays on a bit better. My skin also looks brighter, so I’m a fan. It gets three stars for all of that, but it doesn’t do much for my oil or acne marks. I really do like this, and it didn’t break me out, but it’s expensive for what it is. So far so good
