I’m 50/50 on this one. I think it works ok and it’s gentle on my face which is nice. I don’t like the smell at all though. I was expecting a subtle/natural smell, but it has a weird strong plastic smell? And although it does feel gentle, I don’t feel like it’s really working to get everything off my face. It just feels like it glides around my skin like a gel. Might finish the bottle but probably won’t buy again... OK cleanser,  bad strong smell
