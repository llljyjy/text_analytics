This is my new favorite moisturizer! My first impression was that the bottle was beautiful and made of heavy glass. The cream itself is thick but feels weightless, super hydrating, and with an incredible smell. I’m not a tea drinker so I assume it smells like black tea! Even though it’s winter this moisturizer left my skin feeling super hydrated for hours, and I even saw fine line reduction since my skin was finally not dry as a bone. Highly recommend this - it feels super high end. Gifted by Fresh but this is my honest review! Gorgeous bottle and amazing smell!
