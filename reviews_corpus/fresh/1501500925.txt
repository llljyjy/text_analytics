I’ve used this product consistently for 14 years, but really disappointed with the tube I bought yesterday in Sephora. Feels like a different product. Not moisturizing or silky smooth like it used to be. I still have a bit of my last tube and it’s clear they feel very different. It’s a shame I’ll have to switch to something else. nan
