I have numerous positive reviews on this moisturizer and I was excited to try it.  It’s really beautiful under makeup.  Not greasy, not oily, and doesn’t have any overwhelming perfume scent.  I like that it leaves my skin feeling soft and looking lifted and even-toned. I also use this under my eyes and have been really happy with the performance.  I’ve actually loved all Fresh Beauty products and use their masks regularly too.  A wonderful brand of skincare!  This was gifted by Fresh. Absolutely Yes!
