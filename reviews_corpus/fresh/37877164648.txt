I love this lip balm, I received it complimentary from Fresh. It’s very hydrating and pigmented while still feeling light.

It’s also a sheer color so I can do one application for a subtle change or I can layer it for a deeper color. It’s also made from natural ingredients, which is always a plus. Hydrating
