I have been using Vaseline for 40+ years- seriously, for dry cracked lips. I started really questioning the competency of the product even if it’s a good price. I bought this for my husband for a special  luxurious gift & one day I just thought, I’ve got to try this for my lips! Nothing else had worked!! I put it on & wow! It worked like magic. So healing. it’s overpriced but it works, I think it’s a miracle. I am honestly shocked that it can help my lips Outstanding product; a little pricey!
