Shade - peony. Love the buttery finish plus the pigment is buildable so you can even wear it as a lipstick. After a while it feels matte and dry on lips but it holds on the moisture well. It does not feel like their other creamy sugar lip balms as the texture is waxy and smooth, does not spread easily. Gifted by fresh. Smooth like butter
