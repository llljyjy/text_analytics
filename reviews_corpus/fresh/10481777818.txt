I got this as a point perk because I’ve been searching for anything that would help the awful state of my lips because nothing seemed to work, until this. This is exactly what I needed. My lips were dry, cracked, peely, the texture was super uneven from the peeling and where they were healing from cracks and picking (oops) but after one night’s use it smoothed out the texture and hydrated them so much. They’re nice and smooth now. This is perfect for cold seasons but also nightly regardless of weather to restore what my daily matte lipstick does. I’ll be buying the full size.
