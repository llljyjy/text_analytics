This product is not bad it’s just not my favorite. I was really excited to use it because the packaging looks really nice and luxurious. When using it, the product feels very smooth and hydrating on my skin. It does have a little slight scent but nothing too intense, it’s actually quite nice. However, I have dry skin and feels like the serum dried me out a little more I’m not sure why. Maybe don’t use too many other products with the serum when doing your skincare routine. Hydrating
