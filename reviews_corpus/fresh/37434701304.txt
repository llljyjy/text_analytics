I’ve used the Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment before and it’s always a treat. Normally I’m not a fan of rose scented lippies but this one isn’t too strong nor too floral. Always feels hydrating and I am enjoying the bit of color that the Rose shade leaves. It’s not too much but it definitely builds if you want something a bit bolder. Gifted by Fresh Always a staple
