I have been using this product since 2011, and I freaked out when it diapered. Now itâ€™s back but the new formula is not as amazing. Not nearly as hydrating and balmy/cushiony as previously. I am very sad as this used to be one of VERY few products that actually worked for my lips to stay hydrated. And they removed the SPF as well.... So disappointed
