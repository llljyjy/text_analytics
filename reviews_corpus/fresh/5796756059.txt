This balm glides so nicely on my lips even when they’re super chapped. It’s not strongly fragranced and is just so soft....but maybe it’s too soft. The product has broken and mushed into the metal tube on both my large and mini sized. And this is in the winter so it’s not an issue of heat. Hopefully they figure the packaging out because I’m not inclined to buy another Amazing hydration, bad packaging
