I’ve given this brand a few chances but it never does it for me. It wasn’t hydrating enough, it left my skin feeling sticky and too much fragrance. Am I the only one that feels like moisturizers at Sephora are way too over priced and don’t hydrate as well as cetaphil, cerave, and other brands that can be found at target or Walmart? Not hydrating. Sticky feeling
