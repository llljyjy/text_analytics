I love this hydrating serum from Fresh! It has a similar scent to their classic Black Tea Perfecting Mask and is subtle but pleasant. I really enjoy using this morning and night as the first step of my skincare routine. It instantly plumps and hydrates my skin, doesn’t make me feel sticky, and creates a smooth appearance on the skin. I’ve tried this for a week straight now and feel like my skin has felt less dry during the day! nan
