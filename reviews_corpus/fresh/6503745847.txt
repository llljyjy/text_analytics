If you love tea, you’re going to love using this product. The serum literally smells exactly like fresh black tea. The whole experience of applying it feels very refreshing. I don’t think the serum is very hydrating. My skin recently got really sunburnt after a day at the beach despite reapplying spf. I used this serum hoping it will help soothe but it stung a little instead. I think I would really love this serum once my skin is completely healed but right now, I need to stick to more ceramides and hyaluronic acid. I still like the serum from the few times I tried it before the sunburn and I look forward to using it some more! Smells like tea but could be more hydrating
