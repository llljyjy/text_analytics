Iâ€™m a huge fan of Fresh so it was no surprise that I loved this serum! First off, the bottle is gorgeous! The ingredients are clean and it has a lovely natural floral scent. It is a little sticky when applied but no big deal if using a moisturizer afterwards. It was a great product for my breakouts. This helped clean my skin quickly! nan
