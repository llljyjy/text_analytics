Fresh tea elixir skin resilience serum is a milky liquid texture with a slight tea scent. It’s a non sticky serum that gives a cooling sensation upon application. Quickly absorbs onto my skin leaving a silky finish. My skin is refreshed, radiant, hydrated and nourished. A nice add on to my current skincare regimen. Like that it’s a droplet applicator. nan
