Oh what a lovely new addition to the fresh line! I have combo oily skin, but my skin is very finicky during the wintertime and has needed a bit of moisture and TLC. This has a subtle floral scent and felt very moisturizing. I tried it as a last step after my skincare, but felt that it can pill on my face when its drying with certain skincare products but with the right mix of products it feels beautiful and my skin feels refreshed and hydrated in the morning. Nice product!
