This is such an amazing overnight mask. I have used it for the whole week already and have seen a difference in my skin tone and moisture. The mask is not too thin and not to thick and a little bit goes a long way. I also love the smell and it helps me sleep at night too. I highly recommend it to my friends and family. Amazing moisturizer
