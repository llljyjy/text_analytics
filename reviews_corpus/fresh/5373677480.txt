This is my second balm. I had caramel when it used to come in a small container and it was a lip saver. I keep messing with my lips all day, licking and picking on them with my fingers..and they are constantly chapped. But this balm has kept them from looking dehydrated. I was worried that all these new flavors/colors would effect the formula but good news! it did not. Lemon has a very light lemony zesty sweet taste and aroma. The butteriness is the same and the new container lets it easier to sue with long nails. I think I like the caramel scent better because itâ€™s a bit stronger than lemon and I want that deliciousness hitting me during the day. Happy with it. Lemon lemon good.
