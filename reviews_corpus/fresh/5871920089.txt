I was super excited to try this product & it did not disappoint! I got the shade Peony, the texture is SO smooth & it feels incredible on the lips. The color is sheer, buildable & very flattering. The smell is delicious! Like a lemon tart. *drool* I love the metal packaging as well. This is clean beauty at its finest. Highly recommend! So lovely! :D
