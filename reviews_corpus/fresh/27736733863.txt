Something changed in the formula because I used to LOVE this product. It went perfectly into my skin, was deeply moisturizing, and left me feeling hydrated the next day. Now, it pills off my skin minutes after application and stings ever so slightly, no matter what combo of products I use (and even when I use it by itself). Wonâ€™t be buying again. Formula changed for the worse
