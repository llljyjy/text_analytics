This product was gifted by Fresh in exchange for my honest review. I’m no stranger to Fresh Sugar lip products. I’ve purchased so many in the past and have loved them all! This particular Fresh Sugar lip treatment feels more moisturizing and hydrating than other lip products. I love how easily it glides on the lips. I also love that the color looks very natural. It goes on sheer with a slight tint. You can also swipe a few more times to build more color, but it will still look very natural. Since the color is sheer, the shade is very flattering. Flattering and moisturizing
