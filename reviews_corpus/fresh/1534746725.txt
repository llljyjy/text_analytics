I love it. I have oily skin that is also sensitive and prone to dehydration and blemishes... great combo i know. I already knew that rose, rose oils, etc worked well on my skin. If you have never used a rose based product on your skin, this would be a good beginner product. This is not equivalent to rosewater you may find at drugstores, as iâ€™ve seen in other reviews. Those products often contain drying elements, or astringents like witch hazel, making it a completely different type of product. This is definitely a superior hydrating toner.This does not add to my oil production- which almost everything does. It also keeps my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. Tt is a great first step in my skin care routine, it helps maximize the effects of my other products nan
