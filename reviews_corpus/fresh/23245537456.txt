I received this product complimentary from Fresh in exchange for my honest opinion on the product. I have been using the moisturizer for about 4 days so far, and I can definitely see more radiance, barely and wrinkles or fine lines, and it just feels more tight/firmer.It has a beautiful smooth texture, that is packed with hydration and keeps your moisture barrier jam packed with moisture. It does leave a slight grease feel after using, but the longer you hang on, the more it dissipates. I am obsessed with the radiance it leaves. I would recommend this to anyone who has mature skin, and combo, normal, or dry. Also, itâ€™s super expensive. I could probably pay about $50, but $95 is a lot. This is great!!
