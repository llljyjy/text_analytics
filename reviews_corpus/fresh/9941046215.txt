I like adding this on as my last nighttime routine moisturizer, it’s not overpowering and it doesn’t feel gooey on my skin. It does feel a little bit tightening, so I could understand how that could be confused with the drying but in the morning my skin looks amazing and glowing. perfect way to end the day
