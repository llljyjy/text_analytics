I was recommended this cleanser by a Spehora employee for sensitive skin and I’m so glad it didn’t disappoint! While the strong scent takes some getting used to, it does its job wonderfully. I’ve used it at night the last 2 weeks to get makeup off and follow it up with a foam cleanser before applying my regular products, all without any allergic reactions or weird interactions between them (both of which I’m prone to!). I’ve struggled a lot over the years trying to find a good cleanser/makeup remover that agrees with me so I’m definitely making this one a permanent part of my routine. Perfect for my sensitive skin
