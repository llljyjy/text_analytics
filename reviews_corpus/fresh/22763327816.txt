- Lifestyle line freshbeauty I consider both Indulgent & beautiful. .This winter (with the heater & cold wind) my skin has been very temperamental. Honestly, this has been so fabulous in the evening; I apply it right before bedtime. It’s a must- have for dry sensitive skin. .Why I love? So moisturizing. calming. goes over my regular moisturizer. a little guess a long way. I don’t feel dry & tight when I wake up in the morning Has been amazing for this winter night routine!
