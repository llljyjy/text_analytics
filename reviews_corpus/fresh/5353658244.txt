This is a new lightweight serum from fresh that is good for all skin types.  It comes in a beautiful jade colored glass container and has a mild tea scent which I really enjoy. It spreads out easily on the skin without leaving a tacky feeling. The brand states that it can smooth out texture. I have not used it long enough to see that but with the niacinamide in the formula I expect to see that pretty soon. I have bought several fresh products in the last few years and think this is one of the more exciting releases they have done. I can use this twice a day even though I do have some sensitive areas on my my face. A new lightweight serum for all skin types
