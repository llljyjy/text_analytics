Gifted by Fresh. Let’s chat about Fresh Beauty and their newly launched Black Tea Advanced Age Renewal Cream. This cutting edge cream features a natural retinol alternative known as the BT Matrix. A lot of people are very sensitive to traditional retinol products and the lengthy amount of time it takes for your skin to get used to them has some people giving up even before they see results. So what’s inside? Antioxidant black tea, rambutan leaf extracts, and squalene which work together to visibly reduce wrinkles, improve firmness and boost collagen production. This cream is perfect for those with sensitive skin and I am looking forward to continuing my journey with another amazing product by Fresh Beauty. nan
