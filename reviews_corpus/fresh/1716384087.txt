strong color for what’s supposed to be a tint.  i was looking for a more subtle tint.i have a love/hate for the packaging.     love the screw cap.  hate the fact it’s lipstick style -  i left this in my purse and it softened to the point when I applied it the top portion of it came off.    i won’t buy it again. more a balm lipstick than a tint
