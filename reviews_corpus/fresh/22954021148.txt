I was really impressed by this product. I have combination skin that is very sensitive on my cheeks. This serum does not irritate my skin and makes it soft, refreshed and return its even tone. The pores on a T-zone are less visible. I also like a smoother texture of my skin. I don’t like products that make my face glow (I mean greasy glow) but this one definitely doesn’t. Just a natural healthy skin and a younger look. Impressed!
