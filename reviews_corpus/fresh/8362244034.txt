I got the chance to try out the Tea Elixir Skin Resilience Activating Serum. I love the ingredients in it; Hyaluronic Acid and Niacinamide which made my skin texture way better than it was and also made my skin feel plump. I also love the smell of it - it is not super strong and has a very light fresh smell. nan
