I used to love this balm, specifically the petal one, but they were out so I got original. What happened? This one is so much less creamy. Is it because itâ€™s original or because they changed the formula? It leaves my lips feeling drier and it used to be my holy grail. Also it looked like it had been used already when I got it out of the box :((( Something is up
