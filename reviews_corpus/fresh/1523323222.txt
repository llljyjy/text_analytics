The first thing about this mask is that it smells like a fresh floral dream. The texture is light but the mask is very moisturizing. Itâ€™s the best feeling coming home and washing your dash and putting this mask on my skin instantly feels soothed and refreshed. Afterwards my skin feels hydrated and bouncy. I have semi oily skin but has been kinda dry with winter and this is an amazing mask for me right now! Relaxing & soothing!
