This product was gifted by Fresh in exchange for my honest review. I’m not much of a lipstick girl but I love wearing a gloss or a tinted balm when I want a bit more color so this product is right up my alley. It’s got all the benefits of a balm but you get that added bonus of sheer to buildable color without the mess of high pigment lipstick. With one swipe I get a nice gentle flush of pink that just brings my lips to life and then when I build it up with a few layers it gets more intense while still letting my lips show through so it looks more effortless. The shade rose is perfect for when you want a flushed but still natural look. I love that the ingredients are clean and that the formula is hydrating and smoothing. It makes my lips look juicy and feel nourished. If I haven’t been eating one application can last me a few hours without needing to reapply. The fact that the cap screws on is a big bonus as well (no more mess in your pockets or bags!). Soft & Pretty
