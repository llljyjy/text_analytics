I’ve been using this product for the past couple of weeks, and I believe its really helped my skin look super healthy and glowy and I love how it makes my skin look and feel- however, the only downside is as soon as I started using it I noticed it smelled like pickles which was super weird- it doesn’t leave my skin smelling like pickles, and it works really well on my skin (I have combination skin and get the occasional breakout fiesta), so I’m definitely going to keep using it- however if you are sensitive to smell I wouldn’t recommend this product. Smells like pickles but works well
