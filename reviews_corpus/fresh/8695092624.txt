This product was the one that made my entire skincare routine fall in line. Iâ€™ve struggled with cystic hormonal acne for 12 years, seeing various dermatologists and trying so SO many products. I was finally at a point where my acne was mostly better thanks to my routine, but I would still get a buildup of whiteheads under my skin and during my cycle they would erupt into painful cysts without fail.I tried this cleanser as a sample about a month ago and since starting with it, my whiteheads have greatly reduced. While I did still have a few spots during my cycle, they were little surface level pimples that cleared up in a day or two instead of painful lumps that take weeks to heal. I will say that I experienced a bit of redness at first that cleared up in a day or two and that I have to work a bit harder to keep my skin hydrated, but it is also winter. Also, I could definitely see how the smell might not be for everyone. It has a VERY strong cucumber extract smell. But all in all, the reduction in my acne makes those minor complaints well worth it. Greatly reduced my hormonal acne
