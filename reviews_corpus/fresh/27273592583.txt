This was gifted by fresh. I absolutely love this lip balm! It is super moisturizing for my insanely chapped lips but doesn’t feel too greasy or sticky. It has a sheer red tint that is very buildable and adds a nice swash of color to the lips. The packaging is premium and has a twist lock cap so you don’t have to worry about the cap coming loose. nan
