I am so excited to be trying out this overnight mask. I love everything fresh but this has to top off all of the products I have ever used. I have weird combination skin that is dry during the winter, I get a lot of redness as well this helps with that and its soothing, hydrating, non oily and easily absorbed by the skin. nan
