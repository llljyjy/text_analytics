This serum has a milky color/texture and isn’t oily at all - like some of my other serums. It absorbs quickly and has a light, fresh scent. My skin is super dry and I had a few flaky patches around my temples and the corners of my mouth. After a light exfoliation, I patted a few drops of this into my skin before bed. I woke up with smooth and plump skin - no dry patches reappeared! I’m totally on board with this serum. Super Moisturizing
