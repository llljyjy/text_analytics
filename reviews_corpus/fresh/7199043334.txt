I got a sample, which I used on a trip over the holidays. The packaging is nice/simple. The texture of the cleanser feels nice, but that’s it. It’s too gentle even for my sensitive/combo skin. It didn’t lift or cleanse anything. Felt like I needed a scrubbing mask afterwards to get all the dead skin and dirt out. I wouldn’t purchase or recommend this. Too gentle.
