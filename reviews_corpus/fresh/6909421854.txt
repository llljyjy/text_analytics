This is my all time favorite lip balm!  I’m not really sure why people think it doesn’t hydrate - if the different scents do different things.  But the lemon is my favorite.  Smells like a lemon iced cookie and leaves my lips hydrated during winter months.  I might even love it more than the Laneige lip mask! MY FAVORITE!
