I absolutely love this product.  I got the lip treatment in the shade Rosé and it was gifted by Fresh. I was a little skeptical at first sight because it’s a rich red color and I’m not a fan of red on me. But once applied I realized it’s a very sheer color payoff. The color is so beautiful and very hydrating. The color doesn’t get too intense but it is buildable. This balm also has vitamins C and E to aid in hydration. I tend to have very dry lips and after applying this my lips felt so soft and supple pretty much for the rest of the day. I didn’t feel like I had to reapply constantly which I love. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a hydrating balm with a tint. nan
