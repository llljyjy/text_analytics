Honestly, i love the consistency and texture of this product! it’s very smooth and leaves. my skin feeling soft and hydrated. unlike most serums that give a sticky feeling afterwords. i used this product for a week and could see a visible difference in my skin. i have naturally oily skin so i’m not sure how it would work on other skin textures!! Good but pricey!
