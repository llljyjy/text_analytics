I never take the time to write reviews for products but this blew me away. The past 2 years i have fought intense hormonal acne in my mid 20s. Once i cleared it up using products from the dermatologist, i had scarring to worry about. i am scared of trying new skincare products bc usually my skin freaks out and i didnâ€™t want to go back to square 1 with my acne. THIS PRODUCT IS SO GOOD. it faded all my scarring and is rich. This product has done wonders for my skin i even use it during the day. it works as a great base for makeup, especially since most primers break me out too. love this product. expensive but worth every penny. amazing product for acne prone skin
