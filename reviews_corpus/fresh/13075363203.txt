YES! YES!  YES! YES!  YES! YES!  This is the BEST calming mask I’ve ever used.  I noticed results the very first time I used it.  I woke up and my reactive skin was glowing like it did when I was in my 20’s.  There was much less redness, and my skin tone was more even.  I love that it actually absorbs into my skin- unlike a lot of calming masks that sit on your skin all night.  I’m so happy- this is the mask I’ve been searching for, and I’ve finally found it. YES!
