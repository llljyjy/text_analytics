I have oily skin and this serum helps control the shine. I pair it with my favorite vitamin c moisturizer and Iâ€™ve noticed that my skin has a nice glow without excess shine. I no longer have a sebaceous filament issue,  and my acne has reduced. I can barely see my pores. Also, I can use it without a moisturizer if I want to go light. This will definitely be my go-to serum. nan
