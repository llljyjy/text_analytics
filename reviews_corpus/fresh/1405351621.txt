I received a travel size of this. I would recommend this mask for sensitized or dry skin types. The formula is a light-weight cream and absorbs very easily. It’s very gentle and is basically an overnight face cream. With regular use, skin became softer and more even in appearance. Texture definitely improved. It has a light, subtle scent but I still can’t put my finger on what the fragrance is. It’s not a floral smell. The price is steep so I probably wouldn’t purchase the full size but if you have reactive skin or a damaged barrier it would be worth it to purchase! nan
