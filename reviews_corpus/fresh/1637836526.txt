I received this complimentary from Fresh. It is very nice, lightweight but feels very nourishing. I havenâ€™t used it long enough to notice any difference in my skin tone/texture in terms of wrinkles and such, but it is first and foremost a moisturizer and I think it does its job beautifully. Hoping after longer use I notice more of a difference in my fine lines. Very nice
