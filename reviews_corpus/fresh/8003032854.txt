I’ve been using this about every day for roughly 5 months now. I have super dry sensitive skin and I NEED my skincare products to be geared towards that. I know it’s expensive, but this is THE ONLY toner I’ve ever tried that hydrates, soothes, and refreshes my skin without ANY irritation what so ever. I mainly use this toner in the morning to cleanse my skin instead of washing my face and it makes my skin clean and hydrated and the rest of my skincare apply beautifully. I bought the medium size and I’ve just about used 1/4 of it since I got it, so a little goes a long way. 1000000% will be repurchasing. The best in the game
