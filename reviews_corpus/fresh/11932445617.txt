I used this twice a day every day and it did NOT make my lips noticeably softer. I wanted so bad for this lip balm to work because I didn’t want to feel like I had wasted $26 for nothing. I went through a whole stick of this lip balm and nothing, no improvement. I switched to Aquaphor which is way cheaper and immediately noticed a difference. Don’t waste your money on this “therapy treatment” or you’ll get finessed like me. Not worth it
