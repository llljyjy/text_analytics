This mask isn’t heavy if thats what you’re looking for. It’s more in between. It feels cool and refreshing on my skin. It smells nice but isn’t too overwhelming. I didn’t leave on for too long because my skin is a bit sensitive and I was afraid it’d break me out. I washed my face and applied and left for a few hours but then washed off and my skin felt nice and soft. nan
