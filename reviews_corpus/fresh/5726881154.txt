I really enjoy this serum. It has a silky texture that doesnâ€™t dry down sticky.  It has not irritated my skin at all and is nice to use both in the morning and at night.  I honestly cannot tell a difference with the texture of my face yet since I have only used to product for 2 weeks and the studies were done in 8 weeks. Nice so Far
