I tried the toner version of this and hated it. I ended up using it on my body after a shower. THIS was completely different from the toner! Wonderful smell, great consistency, not overly oily, deff makes me feel hydrated! I did buy this on sale for $30 and at that amt it’s deff worth it. I’m not sure I will repurchase at full price as it is expensive for what you’re getting but I have deff enjoyed it! Would most definitely repurchase for $30 again! lovely
