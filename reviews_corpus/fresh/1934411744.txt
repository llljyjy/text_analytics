This was a great light weight yet hydrating cream, it absorbs quickly into my skin so would recommend using in the morning prior to makeup as it left my skin smooth and plump even during the frigid cold days.This was gifted by Fresh but my opinions are my own and I would not leave a positive review if I did not like the product. Great under makeup
