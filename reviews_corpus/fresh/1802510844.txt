LOVE LOVE LOVE this!! I love the smell of roses and cucumber, and I really just decided to try it based on scent. I’ve always had good luck w Fresh products, since thought I’d try it.. Well, it quickly became my go-to moisturizer morning and night, leaving the VERY expensive French oil & moisturizer on the shelf. Makes my skin smell, look and feel great! Moistens 51yr old winter in New England skin, so it looks fresh and youthful. Scent-sational
