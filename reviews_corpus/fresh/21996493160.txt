I started incorporating this serum into my nighttime routine and am already loving how light and moisturizing this is. It has a slight earthy scent (nothing overwhelming), and quickly absorbs into the skin. I apply a few drops for my face and neck, and am noticing how glowy it makes me! Will need to continue using this to see more results. nan
