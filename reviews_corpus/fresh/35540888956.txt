First impression, Heavy container I love that. When I try it on I wash and removed my makeup and cleansed my face then I applied it by rubbing the sugars.I then left it on my skin for 10 mins. Then I washed it off It’s amazing!! It left my face really soft. This is only amazing for Very dry skin face “flaking” “dehydrated” Amazing!! for Dry skins face “Flaking”
