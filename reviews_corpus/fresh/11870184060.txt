Great serum! I had already been a big fan of niacinamide and hyaluronic acid so having those and additional actives in one serum is perfect for me. Itâ€™s a thick milky texture that soaks in super fast and feels amazing. The scent is very natural and high-end. The bottle itself also feels very high quality. A little pricey but for a good quality serum with lots of actives, it may be worth it nan
