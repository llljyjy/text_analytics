I never write reviews but was so disappointed by the new product formulation I don’t want anyone else to waste their money. I loved the feel & pigment of the old formula.

This new formula is so dense I can’t even get it on my lips, it seriously dried them out so I had to go put vaseline on, and almost no pigment (although maybe that’s just due to the poor product transfer). drying and no pigment
