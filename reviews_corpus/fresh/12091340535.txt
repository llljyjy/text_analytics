I have sensitive, acne prone skin, with an oily t-zone and I tend to be more dry around the mouth. I use a handful of prescribed acne medications that can be very drying. That being said, this product keeps my face happily moisturized every night, and I wake up with a pretty glow! I have two fine lines on my forehead, and I’ve seen improvement since starting this product. (I’m on my third repurchase, and I only ever get the “mini” as it lasts for a few months!) Tbh I always worry when starting a new product in fear that my face will breakout, but this one successfully did not cause any breakouts! It’s kept my face moisturized and glowy… and it also has a pleasantly light scent! I would be sure to use it at night time, as it can look a bit shiny on your skin. I love it!
