I love Fresh products and this lip treatment really reinforced my love of this brand. The shade Plum is a deep brown-purple color that makes my lips pop. It applies evenly and the texture is divine. I do feel like my lips are hydrated although I would say this formula doesn’t last quite as long as I hoped, and I needed to reapply a few times throughout the day. However my lips still felt soft after the color faded so that’s something. I’m definitely going to try other colors!Complimentary from Fresh. nan
