From the packaging, to the feel of the glass bottle, to the design of the dropper, to how the serum feels on my skin - overall I really enjoy this product! There is a slight tingly sensation after applying which I really enjoy. There is also a light scent which is very nice! Must have in your skin care routine! Love the Tingle
