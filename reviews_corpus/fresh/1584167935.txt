My skin has been drier this year than others and most night creams have not been hydrating enough. I tried this cream as an overnight mask and zero dry patches in the morning. I also tried the mask as a makeup primer and it worked perfect! The texture looks very rich but it is lightweight and doesn’t look or feel greasy. I didn’t notice a scent which is a plus as I am tired of heavy fragrance in my skin care. Fresh’s products work and I am very pleased with this cream. No Scent and Very Hydrating!
