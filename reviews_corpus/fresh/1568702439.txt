I’ve bought this lip balm many, many times but not in recent years after discovering the original Bite Agave Mask (which I LOVED until the formula was changed). Sephora was out of Laniege Sleeping Mask which I LOVE because it’s the quality of Dior’s lip balm but costs 40% less. I decided to buy this as a safe bet because I used to love it and because I really dislike lip balm pots for reapplication on the go. Extremely disappointed!!! It goes on buttery smooth as I remember from previous purchases but is very drying. I found myself reapplying over and over again with no improvements. I also bought Patrick Ta’s glowing lip balm and that’s way better but I don’t like that it comes in a square box without spatula to use, especially given the design. Compared to Patrick Ta, this lip balm is virtually useless in Canadian winters. I’ll be buying Laniege’s original sleep mask again and recommend you try that brand before purchasing any of the Fresh lip balms if you have dry lips and/or live in a harsh winter climate like Toronto. Did Fresh change the formula?
