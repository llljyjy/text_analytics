fresh’s new Floral Recovery Calming Mask is a god-send! This winter is wreaking havoc on my skin and this buttery mask has really helped to not only infuse moisture but calm redness and make my skin look brighter! I love waking up to a softer, more radiant complexion! While it seems pricey, the cost is well worth it! The pot is pretty substantial so you can get plenty of uses out of it! I definitely recommend this and will be repurchasing! Don’t Sleep on this Overnight Mask!
