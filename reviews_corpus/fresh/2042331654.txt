The texture of this cream is rich and creamy, feels hydrating and absorbs nicely. The packaging is luxurious, smells lovely, not too strong and I love that it has such great blend of anti-aging ingredients. It makes my skin feel smooth and nourished. Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles with continued use in my nighttime routine. Fresh Beauty gifted me this moisturizer in exchange for my honest review.
