What’s great product for lip hydration! I especially like that the color is buildable, with one layer it starts with a sheer tint and up to 3 layers you have a subtle color! Definitely makes my lips feel more hydrated and is easy to carry around with you. I especially like the twist on cap, I know it is a random thing to mention but that way I don’t have to worry about it opening while in my purse or traveling with it! I received this complimentary from Fresh! If you don’t want any color I would definitely recommend the clear option for the lip treatment benefits! Great buildable, subtle color!
