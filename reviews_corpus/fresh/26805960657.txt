I had heard about this going through a formula change, but always like to give a product a try myself, especially as I didn’t really ever faithfully use this product. I had probably gone through two tubes of this over the past few years. Well.... unfortunately, the formula change is VERY noticeable, even to me.What’s different:  - The packaging is less heavy/less luxe feeling; it’s immediately noticeable- This formula feels far more drying than it used to (my lips actually got more chapped, it seemed, after using this all day, and even BLED a little from the dryness!)- This isn’t nearly as creamy as it once was- I have to apply significantly more product for a color payoff (whereas when I used this exact shade before, it didn’t take more than one light swipe)This used to be a product that I could justify spending the $20+ dollars on every once in a while for a tube of fancy lip product, but now, it is definitely not worth the hefty price tag. Somehow Fresh made this product feel cheaper and overall much worse, while continuing to charge excessively for it.It’s unfortunate that because of its previous hype and previous genuinely great formula, people may not realize it is not nearly what it used to be.Overall, 2 stars for the eventual color payoff of the Honey shade (it’s pretty), and the same “classic smell“ of this product that I love seeming to stay intact. But I feel like even 2 stars is a bit generous, due to the price tag of this.Overall, try it for yourself if you must - for me, it ended up in a “yep, everyone complaining about the new formula is absolutely correct“ and a quick return. There are way better options in this category, now. New formula genuinely affects this product
