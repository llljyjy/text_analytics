Okay so let’s get real. I have very dry acne prone skin, and have hormonal acne as well. This product did not make a difference in my acne. It was no better or worse than it usually is. It lasted me 4 and a half months. I did not see a change in fine lines or wrinkles, I have 1 forehead line and crows feet and they look just as they did the day I bought the product. I’m giving it 4 stars because the scent is fantastic (it’s a cucumber & lemon scent) so it’s very fresh and very moisturizing. It really helped get me through the winter. However since it did nothing for my wrinkles I used it in my elbows and knees twice in that 4 months period. It’s great if you have extremely dry skin. Other than the purpose of moisturizing, it doesn’t work for the anti-aging claim. So I think they should sell it as a regular moisturizer…. It’s a bit pricey to not follow through with the claim. great to quench dry skin, not for wrinkles at all.
