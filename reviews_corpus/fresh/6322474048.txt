oh. my. god. this stuff is amazing. i have extremely dry skin and it feels like no matter what i do, no matter how many hydrating/glowy/whatever products i use, my skin is always parched and i always get flaky and irritated skin, and my foundation cracks at my creases. i can’t emphasize enough how my ENTIRE skincare and makeup routine is completely centered around hydration, but it always felt like not enough. feeling dejected and frustrated i walked into sephora prepared to buy some overpriced and probably not very helpful serum or oil, and lo and behold the girl working the skincare section told me she had the exact same issue as me and handed me this product, saying it rocked her world. the nearby esthetician employee overheard us and said it’s absolutely game changing. am i too susceptible to people raving about a product? yeah, probably. but i figured it’s worth a shot. and ohhhhh my god i can’t sing this product’s praises enough. i can’t shut up about it to anyone who will listen. i was skeptical about a product with oil in it to handle well under my moisturizer, but it sank in super quickly even with my LIBERAL 5 shakes pressed in all over my face and down my neck, and my moisturizer still sinks in as well. my skin has been noticeably softer and glowier, and while i still don’t have the glass skin of my dreams i look and feel way less dull and more confident in my skin. take a chance on this unique product and you’ll be seriously amazed! nan
