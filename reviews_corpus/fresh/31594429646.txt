This serum is wonderful for hydrating and smoothing the skin! I have sensitive combination skin and I found it to be very helpful. My skin feels more plump, less textured, and much softer! The serum worked harmoniously with my other skincare products, including my acne medication. Great for hydration, smoothing, and sensitive skin
