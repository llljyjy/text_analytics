I have pretty sensitive lips and am not able to use many products, so I’m thankful that I found this and that it uses ingredients that I can trust and do not irritate. This Sugar Lip Balm from Fresh is definitely my new go to lip balm with color! I love that it can be subtle or you can build the color if you want. It’s also nourishing, so it leaves my lips hydrated. Color, moisturizes, plumps, smoothes, softens, and soothes. Absolutely amazing. Complimentary from Fresh Love this color
