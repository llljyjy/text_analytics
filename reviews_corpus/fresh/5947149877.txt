I have been using this new serum for over a week. I will either use it in the AM or PM as my skincare routine. The packaging is absolutely beautiful and I love the dropper it comes out of. There is a scent but itâ€™s not strong and overwhelming. I have noticed that my skin looks amazing when I wake up in the morning. Redness has gone down and I was breaking out before using this product. Now my skin is clearer and brighter. Love this product, I feel like it will last a while since a little goes a long way. Fresh serum for the win!
