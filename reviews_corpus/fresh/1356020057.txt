No matter what I have had on, just taken off, etc, this is always soothing to my skin and really gets the last bits off (though I use it after an oil cleanse bc I am an SPF queen). It doesn’t irritate my eyes at all, even though I am a contacts-wearer. The fragrance is very, very subtle, but it’s just a perfect, fresh cucumber scent. I’ve tried a thousand cleaners and just decided to stop trying and go with the one true thing from here on out. :) All-time second cleanse
