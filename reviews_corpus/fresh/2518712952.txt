Fresh once again has surprised me with their new fabulous overnight Floral Recovery Calming Mask. The mask addresses uneven skin tone, calms redness, and smooths out rough texture by enhancing the complexion. Floral Recovery Calming Mask has quickly become a new favorite to my skincare routine. It has a soft buttery rich texture with a very subtle calming smell. The mask applies on your face smoothly leaving the skin feeling super nourished and hydrated. This recovery mask has few of my favorite ingredients including squalane  and vitamin C. I have been using this mask for the past two weeks mainly during my night time routine. It provided me with an extra layer of hydration and suppleness which has helped in the colder months. You need this!
