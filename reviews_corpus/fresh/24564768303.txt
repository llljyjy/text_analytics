I have a bad habit of licking/biting my lips especially when I am anxious to the point where they would start bleeding because of which i always have chapped lips no matter what I did. I thought maybe if i drank more water it would become soft but that didnâ€™t happen. And then I thought i would try this, i had low expectations despite the reviews. But it works so greAt! I am also extra conscious about using licking or biting my lips now which is awesome nan
