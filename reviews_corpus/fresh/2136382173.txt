I liked the amount of moisture this gave and it was easy to use. I didn’t have to paste layers on for the effect. The scent is floral but not good—imo it smells off. It reminds me of a Dior product gone bad. It feels very calming at first like a heavy duty moisture cream. After it settles it says you can blot the rest dry or blend in? It feels too greasy like I put Vaseline body lotion on my face. I suppose that means it’s moisturized, but I don’t think you should rub the rest in and wear it like it says. This completely CLOGGED my pores to the point I had to do a full T-zone extraction immediately! And I never need to do that whatsoever. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Every single pore in my T-zone had a thick white head on it! It was totally the mask because it resembled the same white color. I tried cleansing and using a scrub but they were still very noticeable. Makeup could not hide them. This didn’t work for me, but at first it seemed like a nice floral mask because I like all the Fresh masks. Sure there was some redness reduction…because the WHITE chalky ingredients suffocated my pores to funky whiteheads. Maybe this could work for someone in their 20s with dry skin. Huge NOPE
