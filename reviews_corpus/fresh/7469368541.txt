I love this product! I keep it on my bedside table and have been consistently using every morning and night. I’ve noticed a change in the texture of my skin. It’s not as bumpy and textured as it normally is. I love the way it smells and the consistency is thin and lightweight which I love because some serums are so heavy and having oily skin makes my skin feel weird layering on other products. This has blended into my skincare routine seamlessly and continues to make a huge difference in the overall texture and appearance in my skin. really beautiful product
