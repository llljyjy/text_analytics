This is my first time trying a lip product from fresh and I am not disappointed at all! It feels so hydrating and smoothing on my lips and it’s the perfect color for me. I also love that the color is buildable so you can do a little for every day wear or more for a night out! This product was gifted by Fresh in exchange for an honest review. The shade I got was actually peony but I don’t see an option here for that. nan
