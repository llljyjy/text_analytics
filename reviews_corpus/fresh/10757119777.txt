I like this moisturizer. It soaks in quickly and doesn’t dry tacky, and it does not irritate my sensitive skin. The scent leaves something to be desired, it smells like pickles, but it doesn’t bother me much. It is pricey, and I’m sure there are better moisturizers for the price but overall I don’t regret the purchase. nan
