I’ve been using this for my AM moisturizer for a few weeks now and am loving it so far. I haven’t noticed any huge differences, but my skin does feel very soft during the day now. It’s very hydrating but is light and doesn’t feel oily. It absorbs well into the skin and sits well under makeup. Will continue to use in the future! nan
