I wanted so badly to love this mask. I’d been trying Laneige masks for a while and liked them okay but found them sticky and not very hydrating. (Over hyped imo). I used this a Fresh mask couple of times and initially LOVED the feel on application as well as smell- lightly sweet and thick but not sticky. However after a week of straight use, it began to give me breakouts right on my lip line. Never in my 35 years have I ever broken out around my mouth. It was bizarre and gross. I stopped using for a few days, let them clear up and tried it again- 3 more zits right on the fine line where my face meets delicate lip area… so I know this is unfortunately the culprit. Sadly I will be returning because it irritated my mouth line. Otherwise it was a fantastic product. nan
