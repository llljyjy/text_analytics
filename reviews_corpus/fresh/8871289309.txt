Gifted by Fresh. At first, I wasn’t sure about it being mostly hylauronic acid since I struggle with acne, especially clogged pores. However, after trying this on my face it made it look and feel significantly better. Not sure about it’s effect long term and pricing is a little on the expensive side but if you’re wanting to try out something new go for it! nan
