I really enjoyed this product and it came as a lifesaver after using too much retinoid. However, this had way too many dark petals inside. It’s hard to take out liquid when there’s so much things clogging the hole to disperse. It gets worse as you continue to use the product. However, it really does provide amazing hydration. Great hydration. Too many petals.
