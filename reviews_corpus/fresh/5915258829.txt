I’m a big fan of the Fresh Brand but I’m still on the fence about the lip products. The ones I’ve tried always feel lightweight with a good amount of color payoff but a little waxy in texture when applying. I think I prefer my other lip treatment products I have. The color is beautiful, though! complimentary from Fresh Beautiful color
