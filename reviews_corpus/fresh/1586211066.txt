I thought this would be great like the Fresh Rose Mask which I love. However this is very very slippery, has tons of silicones, sits on top in a kind of sticky way. It never penetrates or feels like it nourished the skin. I love deeply hydrating moisturizers and this is not at all. It never gets absorbed and my skin felt dry but with a weird silicone sticky shiny layer on top. I ended up using it as a neck cream which was ok, but also not great. Great if you love slipper silicone creams
