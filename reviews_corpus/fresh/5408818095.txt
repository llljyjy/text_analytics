I have aging skin and still get acne from time to time. I feel like this serum really helped speed up the healing time of my acne for sure and I noticed my skin felt a lot more hydrated and plump after use. Over time, I did see a really nice reduction in chronically dry areas and felt like my skin just felt nicer in general. I feel like this works as a preventative pretty well, my acne has stayed pretty under control, but most of all my dryness (I have combination skin resulting in dry patches) has been eliminated altogether. I would recommend for anyones daily routine! Love it!
