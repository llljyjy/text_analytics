I have dry normal skin with some dullness. As much as I love anything hydrating, this tea elixir takes it up a notch. I love using it under makeup because it leaves my skin supple and hydrated. And while the formula is rhicker than most serums, my skin absorbs it quick wnough in time for makeup application.I havenâ€™t seen any significant difference unless I use it morning and night. I love this and will definitely keep it in my everyday skincare routine. Great for dull skin
