Fresh always delivers something good, so I was excited to try this tea elixir serum with a really nice fresh tea scent that I love.  It’s a milky serum texture that feels really soothing on the skin  and sinks into the skin nicely.  I love the antioxidant protection and niacinamide and ceramides - this is really a great serum for overall health of the skin.   It’s too soon for me to see real changes in resilience of my skin but I’m sure they are coming!  I’ll keep using it for sure and I really love it especially in my morning routine. Love it for overall healthy skin!
