My lips actually got drier when I tried this. Being the winter time I really wanted something moisturizing and by the evening my lips were peeling.  Fortunately my dermatologist gave me samples of Dr. Dan’s Cortibalm and my lips healed pretty quickly (try it out if you can, esp. in the winter!) Won’t use again. Not for winter at least
