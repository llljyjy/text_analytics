Really like this spray. Iâ€™ve tried the claudalie elixir and felt it was irritating or too much alcohol. This spray is gentle and hydrating and I actually notice a difference in my pore size. This is my 2nd bottle and I still really like it. I bring with my sometimes to spray and feel more hydrated without applying face lotion. Good face spray. Does what it says and gentle
