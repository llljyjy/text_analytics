I actually really like the new formula! I tried this product years ago with the old formula and didn’t like it and felt it wasn’t that moisturizing and not worth the price. This one on the other hand feels so light and moisturizing. I personally don’t need my lip balms to be super pigmented like I’ve noticed others complaining about so I don’t mind that it’s a relatively sheer color. I bought papaya and you still get a really beautiful and natural color out of it. Definitely want to try some more shades! Love the New Formula
