I absolutely love fresh beauty and I’ve tried products from their line for so many years because they’re so high quality but a good price point! I was so excited to get to try this cream because I’ve been in the market for something super thick since I live on the east coast and it is so cold and dry in the winter.  This was complimentary from Fresh but for real This is AMAZING as d gives me such a good glow while hydrating and not breaking me out at all which is so great because I am acne prone. I’d honestly buy this again! love for winter skin!
