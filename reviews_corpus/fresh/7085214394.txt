Got a sample of this and fell in love. Definitely worth the money in my opinion. I have combination skin and it makes my skin feel super hydrated without making me oily or greasy. Reduces redness and soothes my skin. You also donâ€™t need a ton of this product, so even though it is a bit pricey, it lasts a long time! nan
