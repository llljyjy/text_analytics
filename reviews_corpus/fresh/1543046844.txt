Hands-down, this product does exactly what it says is going to do. It’s hydrating, smells great, and is gentle on the skin.  Consistently one of the best masks that I’ve been using for about 10 years. So very pleased with this product, and I purchased it many times. I give it to others as gifts also. Very emollient and if you love the smell of roses, you’ll love this mask! nan
