This is such an impressive serum, especially for dry skin. I use prescription Tretinoin nightly, and as a result my moisturize barrier is very fragile.  This new Fresh serum has been absolutely amazing at restoring strength and hydration, allowing my skin to look fresh and healthy all day.  It is well worth the price! Barrier Support!
