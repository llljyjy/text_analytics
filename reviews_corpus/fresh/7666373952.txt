So far I am really loving this serum. I struggle like CRAZY with dry skin (I’ve lived in the desert all my life) and feel like this is one product that actually seems to lock in moisture. I love the packaging and it usually only takes a couple of drops to cover my face and neck. I’ve used it both in the morning and at night under moisturizer. It’s given my skin a more dewy look which I used to only be able to achieve with makeup. Love it. So far so good
