This serum! Oh my goodness. Let’s start with just the actual presentation of the product. Visually stunning. The color of the bottle is absolutely beautiful and the shape of the bottle is beautiful as well. The elixir is absolutely beautiful. It’s a white milky color. I can see the product on my skin, for sure. It seems extremely hydrating and seems to lock in any moisture the face already has. It has a very pleasant smell. I look forward to the long term effects of this product! Fresh! YES!
