I used to use this product faithfully for years. It was my favourite lip balm and always delivered on keeping my lips soft and moisturized. I recently bought it again now that the weather is getting cooler and my lips are getting dryer. The new formula is not nearly as good as it used to be. It doesn’t melt into your lips like it used to and I’m constantly having to reapply it to feel any difference. I’ve used it for a week and my lips are worse than they were before. Very disappointed as this was one of the best balms I’ve ever tried which justified the $30+ price tag, but now it’s no better than a $4 balm from the drugstore. Save your money. Bring back the old formula!
