Hands-down a must try! It has a nice scent to it but canâ€™t exactly put my finger on what it sounds like. I use this every other day sometimes I would use it for 5 to 10 minutes and other times I would use it overnight. I noticed that my skin was feeling really soft and less dry texture so that was a win. nan
