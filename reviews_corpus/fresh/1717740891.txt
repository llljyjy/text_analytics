Itâ€™s a good night moisturizer but nothing exciting. Good to use during the day. Nice soft scent and a very light texture. Maybe too light for a night cream for me. Will not purchase it again, need something better from a night cream. I feel like this could be advertised as a good day cream. No frills moisturizer
