I absolutely love Fresh as a brand. Most of their products are hits rather than misses. Their SPF lip balms were one of the first Fresh products I ever bought and I’m glad that they’re still going strong. This one, I was gifted by Fresh. Not only do I love the creamy texture (be careful on hot days because it might melt) but I also love the subtle coloring and hydration. It just feels luxurious on my lips Wish it had SPF like the old ones
