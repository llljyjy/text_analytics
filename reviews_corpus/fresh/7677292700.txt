I’ve been purchasing the Fresh Sugar lip balms for a few years—I used to LOVE them. I purchased 4 colors directly from the Fresh website after they launched the new formula (Sephora still had barely any in stock and I thought they weren’t going to come back). The new formula isn’t as smooth and creamy, it’s less moisturizing, and the color has less staying power. I find myself reapplying several times an hour, which was never the case before. If you loved the formula with SPF as much as I did, you might want to think twice about restocking. nan
