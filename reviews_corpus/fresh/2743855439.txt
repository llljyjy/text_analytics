I have been using this serum since couple of days and here is my experience so far:It’s very lightweight and milky in texture. Super easy to spread across the face and neck. It gets absorbed quickly and has a very soothing scent to it. I have not faced any breakouts yet due to this serum. It’s hydrating and I have been seeing my skin looking firm and feeling soft. I feel it is in an expensive side though. nan
