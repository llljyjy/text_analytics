Very nourishing and hydrating, makes your lips very silky. The rose tint is very subtle but pretty. The color is buildable but only after a LOT of swipes (I had to rub on my lips 8-10 times to get deeper pigment - you can see from my photo: the top is one application and bottom is 10). Only thing is the fragrance is way too  strong to have directly under your nose! Gifted by Fresh. nan
