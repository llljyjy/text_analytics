Very lovely lip balm! It has excellent nourishing qualities, and a very subtle color that is buildable. Looks very beautiful in the sunlight. It’s perfect to apply or reapply on the go. The packaging is very cute and the top part clicks on safely, so that I don’t have to worry if it’s going to open up in my purse. nan
