I reallllllly wanted to like this product. I like the smell, I like the texture, I even felt like my skin was glowier after using it. However, I can’t continue to use it bc it made my skin break out with a few little pimples every day in spots that I never get acne. My skin is on the dryer side, so it surprised me to break out. I’m sure it’s a great product for some, but not for me. nan
