I was hesitant to spend so much on a small container of moisturizer, but this product has breathed new life into my skin! My face looks more vibrant, the fine lines have faded, and it’s deeply moisturizing without being overpowering or oily. My skin is sensitive and acne-prone but is taking to this moisturizer so well. It smells great - but not for those who don’t like the smell of rose. Rose essence is known for its astringent, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties which are clearly working in my favor. So happy I purchased - and it seems like it’s going to last a long time… the size of the container is deceiving. Highly recommend for those looking for a clean, winter moisturizer. obsessed!
