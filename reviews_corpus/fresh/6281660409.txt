I’ve always loved the fresh lip balms and this one is no exception! I’ve never used the tinted options before so I wanted to try it and I love the sheer, buildable color this gives. I used the shade Peony. My lips feel soft and hydrated and the color is so natural. I have naturally pale lips so I like a bit of color without looking like I’m wearing lipstick and this is the perfect product! Gifted by Fresh. nan
