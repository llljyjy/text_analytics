This lip balm is so hydrating, it makes my lips so soft and healthy looking. I always look for a tint on balms. The papaya one gives you more of a orangey color. I like to do one swipe on each lip and that’s the perfect tint for my lips.You can definitely build the color up. Great for a summer color. Overall love the hydration this give me the tint doesn’t last to long if you eat or drink you have to reapply. Definitely a replacement for a simple chapstick. Gifted by Fresh So hydrating
