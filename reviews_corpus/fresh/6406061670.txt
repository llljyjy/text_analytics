I love Fresh products and was so excited when I got to try the new Fresh Tea Elixir Skin Resilience Activating Serum! This serum is a very lightweight formula that absorbs quickly into my skin. I am trying to prevent further aging in my skin so this serum is just perfect! My skin feels smoother and has more bounce to it too. This serum is also really hydrating so it’s perfect for diminishing fine lines and wrinkles which I’m all here for! Perfect Serum for fine lines and wrinkles!
