This product definitely does smell like tea! It doesn’t bother me at all. The serum absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a greasy feeling which is great for my combo/oily skin.  My skin feels plump and revitalizing after using it. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and I can tell my skin is brighter and more even. nan
