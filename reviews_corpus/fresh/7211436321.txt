I never go wrong with Fresh products and this was no exception. My skin is very uncomfortably tight and dry after years of using the wrong products for my acne. One week of using this as a sleeping mask has made my face look much more hydrated and supple. Great for sensitive skin and daily/maintenance use! Not cheap, but a little goes a long way so one container will last you a while. Gifted by fresh A reliable refresh
