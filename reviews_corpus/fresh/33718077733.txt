I got the “Plum” shade of the Sugar Lip Treatment and really like it. The packaging is super sturdy to stand up to any purse it’s in. But the product itselfIs so hydrating on the lips, definitely one a need to purchase more of! The plum’s balm stick is dark and rich color of a plump, but in the lips it’s much lighter. On my lips it was almost my lips but better shade. I like it sheer so I only do a few swipes, but it’s supposed to be buildable. It does have a light fragrance but nothing overpowering. I had to purposefully try to smell the scent to catch it.  I love all Fresh’s lip products. The formulas keep your lips so hydrating and looking smooth! LOVE these Lip Balms!!
