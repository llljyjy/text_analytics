I currently have a sample size of this product and I will definitely be buying it.  Some Fresh products work better for me than others, for example, I love the Fresh Sugar Scrub.  First, I want to say that I use this slightly differently than suggested.  I do not sleep in it overnight, rather, I first spray on the Fresh Vitamin Nectar mist, then I apply a thin layer of this onto my face, neck and decolletage and I leave this on for about 30 minutes.  After that I add some water based gel right on top of it & do some regular facials with my devices (such as Nuface & an LED red light).  After all that I rinse off everything in the shower & apply my daily routine.  I have seen an immediate difference in the calming of red marks on my face.  I have recently been doing a lot of lymphatic drainage facial massage after my morning facial reflexology and I have seen some red marks surface, which I assume is a release of toxins.  (I do not usually get many red marks so I am thinking that I can attribute it to that).  But I can honestly say, that this product, used the way I have found works for me, has been fantastic.  Also, a little goes a VERY long way for me the way that I have been using it.  I would not personally sleep in a thick layer of this overnight, but it has worked wonders for a shorter facial when applied in a thinner layer.  Samples are such great ways to find seasonal treasures! A definite YES!
