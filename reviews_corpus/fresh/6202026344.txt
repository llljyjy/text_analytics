I have been loving this overnight mask! Usually at night, my skin is very red from the day of cold, harsh weather. I will often wake up with my skin feeling super dry because my nighttime moisturizer just doesn’t last all night. This mask helps with the redness and the dryness! It’s a bit expensive, but you also get a ton of product and the packaging is very sturdy and pretty. I would recommend! nan
