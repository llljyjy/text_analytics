I’m not sure if I can tell a difference in my skin yet, but these are my before and after photos from 4 solid weeks of use. I love the texture, it absorbs into my skin quickly, feels great. I hate the smell however. It’s extremely familiar and herby and I do continue to smell it for some time after it’s on my skin. If you like that natural type scent you may love it, I am not a fan however. Works I think but the smell!
