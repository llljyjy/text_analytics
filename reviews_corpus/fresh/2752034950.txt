This serum was a great addition to my daytime skin care routine.  It’s lightweight, the scent is not overwhelming and it absorbs easily. i’ve been using this serum everyday for a few weeks and my skin feels more hydrated — likely due to the hyaluronic acid and niacinamide in this formula. Lightweight serum -great daytime routine addition
