I started using this after about a week of resting my skin after drying out my face with a particular other brand toner for about a week before realizing my face was starting to feel like construction paper. After about day 3 of using this FRESH toner I could already feel my face coming back to life. Iâ€™m impressed and a fan for sure. Brought my skin back from the Sahara.
