I love these lip balms!  They keep my lips nice and hydrated, don’t dry my lips out, and have a nice hint of color.  I also love the scent of them as well.  It’s very subtle and pleasant.  I have repurchased these balms over the years and will continue to do so because they are so good!  Thank you Fresh for sending me this lip balm!  Although it was gifted by Fresh, I will continue to purchase them indefinitely! Love These!
