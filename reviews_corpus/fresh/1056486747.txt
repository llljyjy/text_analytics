I love Fresh original lip balm and when I saw this I was very intrigued. I’m not a big fan of flower/rose scent normally but I love this. It’s just a tiny bit of rose scent blends with sweet sugar, the rose scent dissipates and a bit of pink tint. Keep my lips nourished and comfy. Packaging is lux and phenomenal. Gifted by fresh LOVE
