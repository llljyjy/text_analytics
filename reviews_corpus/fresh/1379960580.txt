I’ve used this specific face cleanser before. It lathered. It cleansed. I have no idea what happened to it, because if it had been like it is now, I wouldn’t have repurchased it. (NOT a fan of tissue removal cleansers, and it behaves like one.) Which means—little to NO lather. Zilch. And I have soft water, which means things lather more. Additionally, it didn’t even make my waterproof mascara budge, and I’m a one-coat mascara girl. (I don’t wear much makeup at all.) I’m hoping I can return it—I should have stayed with with another brand Sephora carries, which I can’t mention here. :) I don’t know where this large list of fans comes from. It’s like washing with water…
