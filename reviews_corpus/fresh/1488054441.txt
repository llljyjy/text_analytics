The serum has a milky consistency that feels lightweight and absorbs quickly with no tackiness. The formula is gentle so I donâ€™t have to worry about layering or mixing it with other active serums in the morning and evening.

This layers beautifully, and leaves my skin feeling plump and hydrated. Lightweight Hydration
