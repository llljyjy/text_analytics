I received this complimentary from Fresh, but all opinions are my own. This fresh lip balm is my new favorite, I’ll definitely be picking up more flavors/shades..They’re must haves for sure! The packaging is beautiful and feels very high end, I love the weight to it! The tint is so gorgeous, very subtle to where it can be worn anytime but still provides a beautiful wash of color.  It delivers long lasting deep hydration and leaves the lips feeling soft and supple, I’m so impressed! nan
