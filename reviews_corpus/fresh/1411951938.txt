Fresh lip balms have been a favorite for as long as I remember. Sugar Lip Treatments are the same, but infused with beet sugar, and along with hydration provide a hint of buildable color. The peony shade perfectly matches my natural lip tone, making them look fuller and juicer. I wear it in the summer as a hydrating lip stain. The product was gifted to me by Fresh. So good
