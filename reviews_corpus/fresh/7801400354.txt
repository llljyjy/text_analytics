I bought this product cuz the sample smelled quite nice, though when I got the product the smell was less intense than I remember. I apply it with my palm so I don’t lose out on any product and don’t have to feel scared of being sprayed in the face. It feels really good on the skin, absorbs quickly and has instant hydrating feel. Not too different as toners go, but would probably try the other floral toner with rose pedals in it to see how they compare. Not bad
