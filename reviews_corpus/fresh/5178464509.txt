I am trying this as my night time moisturizer because it’s a thicker consistency and is anti-aging which is a plus. It feels very nice and soothing on my skin. My skin feels plump and moisturized after and not greasy at all.  I’m excited to continue using it and see how my skin likes it. Gifted by Fresh nan
