I consistently have dry lips that never seem to be hydrated enough. This lip treatment truly helped with that so much! Since it’s tinted, I don’t use it as much as I’d typically use a lip balm… I got the ‘rose’ shade gifted by Fresh  in exchange for my review. I love that they have such a wide shade range but I think next time I’ll try clear! It’s the best lip balm/treatment I’ve tried in a long time. If you’re into tints, this gives a nice flush to the lips. Super comfortable on, and the packaging feels luxurious. Super hydrating w/ a nice tint
