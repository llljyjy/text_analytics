This is the only chapstick I use and that works for super cracked lips. It works almost instantly and I don’t have to keep applying it like other chapsticks. I got my husband to use it one day and now he gets me to buy it for him. When my daughter has dry burning knuckles from the winter I will put this on her hands at night time and the next day she doesn’t even noticed they were chapped. This is a staple to have, worth the money. Best chapstick, worth the money
