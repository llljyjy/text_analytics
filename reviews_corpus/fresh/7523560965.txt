I am very impressed with this newly released serum.  It totally lives up to its claims and my skin is definitely thanking me everyday.  As you can see in my before picture,  I have large pores, fine lines and blemishes.  On top of that, my skin looked dull and dry too.  I started using this serum 2x daily and around day 6,  I looked in the mirror and could definitely see an improvement of all my skin problems.  This serum seems to balance out my skin while also adding moisturization.  I have barely started to see an improvement of my fine lines but I am seeing it. That itself is impressive for the amount of time I’ve been using it.  My pores are also smaller which makes my skin texture much more smooth.  I love how this milky serum is lightweight and soaks in fast.  It also has a light fragrance that I cannot get enough of.  I definitely recommend this serum to anybody that has similar skin concerns or just wanting to get a head start on skin aging prevention.  It is a little pricey but it’s totally worth it and I’ve been able to replace three other products with just this one serum. Results Speak For Themselves
