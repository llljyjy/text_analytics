I have been using Fresh lip products for many years. I love their lip balms because they keep my lips super hydrated, even in the winter months. My lips usually get so dry that they crack, but they havenâ€™t done that since I discovered the Fresh Sugar Lip Treatment line. This tinted lip balm is perfect for summer. It is a beautiful plum shade that can be worn sheer or built up to a deeper purple. It is very flattering and I have been wearing it with no other makeup for the last few weeks. I highly recommend this one! Fresh gifted me this lip balm, all opinions are my own. Hydrating and beautiful color
