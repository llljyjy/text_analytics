I didn’t like this product, but I know a lot of people like this product so it might just not have agreed with my skin. I have acne-prone skin, which is currently dehydrated (oily T-zone but otherwise normal). After using this, my skin was RED, which I find unusual because most cleansers don’t do that to me. I thought this was a gentle cleanser too, which is why I tried it. I prefer the Inkey List’s fulvic acid cleanser (doesn’t irritate my skin). Made my skin red after use
