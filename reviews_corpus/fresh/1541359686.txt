I absolutely love this product. It has brought fullness to my skin that I was lacking and helps a little with wrinkles. The smell is light and fresh, I donâ€™t feel like this is heavily perfumed. Not sure what these other users are smelling. I have used this for at least 4 months and I just love it in my routine. I can see a difference in my skin if I miss a day. I use this day and night but would really love to try the night cream soon. nan
