I have used this product before and I’m not sure if the formula has changed but I love it even more now. The size is perfect, it’s larger than a normal size chapstick. The formula is silky, creamy, and hydrating. The color is light and buildable, very natural and subtle. The packaging itself feels luxe. The twist closure makes it perfect to throw in your bag and not worry about it opening or getting dirty. I have severely dry lips and this product does not dry them out but keeps them hydrated even after the color has worn away. Always love Fresh products and this one definitely is another great one! 100% recommend * gifted by Fresh Ideal everyday lip product
