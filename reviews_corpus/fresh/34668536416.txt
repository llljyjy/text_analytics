I was gifted by Fresh, their newest shade of their Sugar Lip treatment. The shade they gifted me with is named,Peony. I recieved this complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I love the shade it’s in because it’s just a tad darker than my natural lip color & is buildable. It’s incredibly hydrating and leaves my lips so soft. Would love to get this in the other shades too! Love it!
