Fresh gifted me their tinted lip bal exchange for my honest opinion. This lip balm comes in a metal tube casing that twists in instead of just capping over. This is a great feature because my toddler loves to get it to all my lip products and this makes it just a little bit harder for her to open up. The lip balm itself works great. It leaves your lips with a slight tint which is just what I need when Iâ€™m on the go and want to revive my lips and not make them look so dry Light tint
