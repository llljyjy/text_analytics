This product was gifted by Fresh in exchange for my honest review. The color of this lip balm is very sheer and somewhat buildable, I love it because I don’t wear much makeup so a traditional lipstick can deposit too much color for me. I haven’t noticed much change in the hydration of my lips if I’m being honest as this lip balm doesn’t last very long, but the sheer color is a very pretty your lips but better look that I am enjoying. Nice sheer color
