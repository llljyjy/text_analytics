First off, I want to note that this serum comes in one of the most luxurious and well made bottles! It’s a beautiful green glass that is so stunning. Besides the packaging, the product is absolutely wonderful! It has so many great ingredients for hydration, and I love using it before my moisturizer. I’ve been experiencing drier skin lately, and it really has helped even out my texture and hydrate, while giving it a beautiful glow. I love all fresh products, but I highly recommend this serum! nan
