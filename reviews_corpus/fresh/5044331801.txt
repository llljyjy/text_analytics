I actually thought this was a rose product at first, but it’s RosÉ - even better! The scent is sweet and lovely without being too strong like a lot of rose-scented things so this made me love the product even more. The packaging is beautiful quality, heavy and nice feeling in the hand. As for the color, it’s so sheer and buildable which I really appreciate as someone who likes a more subtle lip. It has a soft pinky red “popsicle stained” look and feels more smooth and hydrating the more you apply. I would definitely try this in other shades! This product was gifted to me by Fresh. Really beautiful subtle color
