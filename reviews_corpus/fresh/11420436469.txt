Spent the 4th of July weekend at a lake in Utah while it was 100 degrees both days I was there. After being at the lake all day the first day my face was sunburnt so bad I applied this in the evening after sun exposure and slathered it before bed and all throughout the second day limiting more sun exposure and it saved me! It felt so soothing and refreshing. I am very acne prone and most moisturizers makes my face burn but not this! Itâ€™s amazing for people with acne prone and sensitive skin like me! If it worked amazing on cracked, itchy, red sunburnt skin with out an issue JUST BUY IT. SAVED MY SUNBURNT FACE
