This is one of the best serums I’ve ever tried. It has a pleasant, very faint tea leaf scent and goes on skin smoothly. It’s so nourishing that just a few drops are enough for using on my face and getting results. I’ve used it for about a week now and I see the difference in my skin, it’s more supple and even-toned. It doesn’t cause breakouts or irritation for my sensitive skin. I’ve been using it in place of regular moisturizer. Quick results!
