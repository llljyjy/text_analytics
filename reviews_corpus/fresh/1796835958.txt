This face serum is really nice and absorbs quickly. It has a milky texture and applies nicely. A little goes a long way. It leaves a visible glow after use. My face and neck feel moisturized and and more supple after use. It has a nice tea-like aroma. Overall Iâ€™m happy with this product! Great Face and Neck Serum
