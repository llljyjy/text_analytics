This sugar lip treatment gifted to me by Fresh is probably one of my new favorites. The packaging is very pretty and sleek, and I love how it is a twist top.

It makes my lips feel soft, but I would prefer it to feel a bit more hydrating. I do like how the product contains several vitamins and fruit oils. Nourishing
