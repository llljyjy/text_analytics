I really like this product. The color was def buildable, subtle at first which I appreciate. I found it very hydrating, and didn’t leave any sort of waxy or heavy feel. I will say that it didn’t last as long as some other products I’ve tried. I stopped noticing the color after a few hours. Gifted by Fresh nan
