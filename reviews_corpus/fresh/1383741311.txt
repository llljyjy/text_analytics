I received this complimentary from Fresh. At first, I didn’t think that this shade would be up my alley, but boy was I wrong. It’s actually really flattering and not as intimidating as I thought it would. The formula is sheer and feels moisturizing on the lips. It was has a citrus scent, which isn’t overpowering but something to note. If you like Clinique black honey shade, this shade is similar but more flattering in my opinion. nan
