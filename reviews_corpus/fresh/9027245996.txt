This Fresh serum is the new it serum.  It’s lightweight and there’s little to no fragrance. When I wake up in the morning after using this the night before, my redness is visibly lessened and my skin is just so smooth and calm.  This is just one of those inoffensive serums that work for every skin type and routine. It doesn’t react negatively with other products I use in my routine and having it in my routine has been a huge gamechanger. A Staple Serum
