I was a little skeptical as I have tried some other celebrity skin care products and wasn’t super excited about those. However, this eye cream surpassed me. I love that it is moisturizing without being greasy. I can apply make up right after and don’t feel like the make up is sitting on my eyes. I also appreciate that it isn’t super scented not does it burn my eyes.  I did not notice a difference in fine lines, but I always think you need more time that just a month to really see a difference. All in all, I would totally recommend this. Better than expected!!
