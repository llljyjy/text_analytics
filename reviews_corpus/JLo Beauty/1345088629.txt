It’s great on its own but not so hot under makeup. My makeup completely broke up and looked terrible, my skin felt hydrated but that’s about it. It is comparable to vanicream and cereve… really nothing ground breaking. It is nice and hydrating but why would I pay this amount if I can get extremely similar results and textures with other brands for a fraction of the cost. Not good under makeup
