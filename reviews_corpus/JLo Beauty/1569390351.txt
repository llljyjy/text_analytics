[I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.] The good: texture! It’s light without disappearing immediately. Moisturizing to an extent. No notable or fake fragrance. The ok: don’t feel any noticeable difference in my under eye fine lines, which usually plump up/ fill in nicely with moisture. Packaging. I feel like the packaging is passé. Like these products would’ve been considered gorgeous ten years ago. I know that’s a silly thing to critique but it’s an expensive adornment to your countertop/ beauty fridge. nan
