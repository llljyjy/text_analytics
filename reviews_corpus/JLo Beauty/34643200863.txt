I have been using JLoglow face serum since the beginning of 2022 & 11 months later, it is still working great on my face. I have always had sensitive skin that was mainly oily in my younger years. Now that I am over 50, it has become more dry, although still sensitive. This serum works great for me & I will continue using it in my daily face-cleaning/ moisturizing regimen. I would definitely recommend it! A Great addition to my daily facial-care routine.
