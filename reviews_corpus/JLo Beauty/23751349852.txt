This product is comparable with other top notch eye creams that I used in the past, I would definitely consider switching to it as a staple in my routine. It’s a light and absorbent formula. It’s scentless and I imagine it would be great for sensitive skin. Over time, I noticed a more youthful under eye appearance. I would definitely recommend this product! Top notch eye cream
