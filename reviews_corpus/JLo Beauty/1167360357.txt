The products themselves seem fine so far. I do like the blockbuster cream. Smells like roses and flowers seems to hydrate. BUT, the packaging MUST be changed. I just cut my thumb finger opening up the cream. Very sharp edges around square lids of creams. No acceptable. And of all the brands I have every tried, packaging has been the least of issues. Plus as many have mentioned, very eco unfriendly and waste of plastic. Plus injuries?! Câ€™mon. CHANGE CONTAINERS
