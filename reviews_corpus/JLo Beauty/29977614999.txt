First off, the packaging on this is gorgeous! I honestly didn’t know what to expect Bing this is from J Lo and wasn’t sure if it would be gimmicky. Turns out, I really love this cream. I recently turned 50 and have been noticing fine lines around the corners of my eyes. I use this once daily not twice as suggested. I take just a dab and pat it on the outside corners until it’s absorbed. And I did notice a tightening in that area. Luxurious!
