I was recently given the opportunity to try this product and I don’t really have anything bad to say about it. The packaging alone is great. You’d be happy to leave it out on your counter, etc. There is no smell so there’s no concern there. The texture is great and super light weight. As someone who generally has sensitive skin with this kinda thing I will say that I had done my morning routine and then went out and did yardwork with it being 103°. That being said...at the end of the day, as dirty and sweaty as I was, this didn’t irritate my skin at all. I’ll continue to recommend but would I ever run to buy it? Probably not only because of the price. Olay works great for me at a more budget friendly value. Thanks anyway though. nan
