I was skeptical at first. I have oily/combination and acne prone skin. I can’t use serums, have sensitive skin and I’m allergic to benzoyl peroxide. I also use a lot of makeup and make sure to fully remove it at night but I still get breakouts and clogged pores, and red spots. I’ve only been using it for 3 weeks (received for free to review) and while the serum in jlos line is NOT for me, this has absolutely changed my skin. It feels hydrated and not patchy and almost like it is relaxed and fresh after a night sleeping with this on. Honestly can’t believe it really. I’ll definitely buy this when I run out - a little goes a long way. This is still mind blowing for me. I have no breakouts the week before my period when my face is usually a disaster still at 30. Try it! Can’t believe how it changed my skin!
