First things first, I’m overall a fan of JLo’s packaging. I wouldn’t expect anything less from her.I appreciate there’s no noticeable scent to this product and that it’s gentle enough for daily use. It absorbs fast (which is normal), so just work fast so you don’t grab more and end up using too much.Happy to say I got no irritation from using this. My texture did improvise and stayed consistent. My skin tone is stubborn, so no noticeable difference there, but I really wasn’t expecting much in that department.I’m sure the ingredients are sourced from top-notch locations and I can see for myself the packaging is great, but I don’t like feeling like people are paying more for packaging and a name. That’s why I’m giving this four stars and not five. It works, but there are cheaper options that also work. Does the job
