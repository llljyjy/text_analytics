The packaging is more luxurious than the cream. (Rec’d as a promo) I didn’t find the cream to be exceptional. It’s pricey for an ordinary cream. Didn’t notice any wow factor. Thick, which I don’t mind, however doesn’t spread easily like other thick rich creams.Would not purchase, even if I liked it, as I do not support celebrities with skin care lines. Had the opportunity to try it for free. Nothing Special
