I’m a really big fan of this set! The moisturizer melts into my skin and has a really pleasant scent. The eye cream is really light and smells great as well! The serum is really nice too and isn’t too greasy or oily. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked these products and think it’s a great deal for the price! I also love the packaging!*I received these items complimentary from Influenster to review, but all thoughts and opinions are my own* Really nice!
