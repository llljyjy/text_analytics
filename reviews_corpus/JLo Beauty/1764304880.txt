[I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.] Normally I pass on celebrity makeup or skincare brands as they usually are a vanity project. However, I am impressed with J.Lo’s eye cream. I loved the packaging - the colors, the ease of getting to the product (I don’t have to dig it out) and how durable it feels. The eye cream is very lightweight, non-greasy, hardly any scent and did NOT make me breakout! I do believe it gave the skin under my eyes more of a plumping effect. I really can’t think of anything negative to say about this product! A Celebrity Product I Actually Liked
