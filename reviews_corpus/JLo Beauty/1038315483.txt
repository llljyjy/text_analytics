For the most part, I enjoyed this eye cream. I have been using it before I go to bed for some time now. The consistency is perfect. It is not too thick, but it feels very hydrating. It does not feel greasy nor does it pill up as dries. My issue with this eye cream, however, is the price point. In my opinion, this eye cream does not seem special enough for me to repurchase at this price. While I do enjoy using it, I feel as though I have other cheaper eye creams that perform the same. I also have not noticed any difference in the appearance of my eyes, i.e. fine lines. Still a great product and the packaging looks very luxurious. nan
