This serum works great and adds a nice full look to your skin when you wake up in the morning. It works well with her other products too. It doesnâ€™t have a strong smell and the texture is silky so a little goes a long way. It feels refreshing on the skin after a long day. The packaging looks nice on display and is easy to use. I highly recommend this product and brand. Refreshing
