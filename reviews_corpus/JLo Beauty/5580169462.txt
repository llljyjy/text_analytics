The packaging immediately caught my eye (a showstoppper and glamorous like J Lo) and the cream is very thick. I haven’t noticed a huge difference in my underage area, but will continue including it as a part of my nighttime skincare routine since I enjoy how it absorbs quickly and doesn’t have a strong scent! nan
