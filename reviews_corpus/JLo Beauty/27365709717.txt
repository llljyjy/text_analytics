I received this for free in exchange for my honest opinion from Influenster and Sephora. This face cream is great! It doesn’t have any overpowering smell, and doesn’t leave your face greasy at all. The only negative I had, was it burnt on any zits, or abrasions. Otherwise a great face cream! Smooth and silky
