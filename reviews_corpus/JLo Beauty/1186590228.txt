I received this product complimentary from Influenster to try and give my honest opinion. I don’t love it, but I don’t hate it. It’s creamy, which I love, and a little goes a long way. It doesn’t have a strong smell. That is also a plus. A negative is a didn’t see much of a difference in my under eye area. If you are looking for moisturizing eye cream this will work. If you are looking for something to treat fine lines or wrinkles, I suggest finding another eye cream. nan
