I didn’t have high expectations for this line, and wow was I wrong. I’ve tried ALL the eye creams, and have never ever been impressed, rather stuck with the “good enough” knowing promises were never true with purchase. This eye cream goes on so smooth and leaves my under eye area actually looking moisturized for a change! Concealer goes on better, doesn’t disappear an hour later, I’m in love and will keep this as my “go to” Sooo impressed
