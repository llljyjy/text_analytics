I received a free container of JLo Beauty’s Fresh Take Eye Cream with Peptides from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. When I first received my VoxBox, I was excited to see JLo Beauty inside.. but my excitement didn’t last long when I realized how cheap the packaging was! The plastic container cracked the first time I tried to use it and now the lid doesn’t fit on properly! For being JLo Beauty, you’d expect something with higher quality! Other than that, the cream itself is non scented, thinner cream that seemed to dry fast on my maturing skin. I’ve only been using this cream for about 2 weeks and haven’t really noticed any difference with my fine lines. I’m just not that impressed. Nothing Special..
