I really wanted to love this but first off, the packaging is way too bulky and excessive.   You seem to be paying more for the packaging than the actual product which is high average in terms of performance.   My skin looked and felt noticeably smoother but I can get similar results for far less money. Scent is mild, not overwhelming and it absorbs seamlessly. I’m glad I got a chance to try this but I’m not sure I would purchase it. nan
