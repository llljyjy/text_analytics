Amazinggggg product!!! My skin used to breakout around my t zone. I changed my face care routine and it didn’t do much. I decided to give the sample of this a try not expecting much honestly, and WOWWW. My face stopped breaking out and the dark spots around my face started to even out!! My mind is BLOWN. I right away bought the full size and I hope this product line never disappears!! I’ve gotten so many compliments on my skin and I have to credit this serum! It applies so nicely (it dries very quickly and if you “rub it” it on your face long it almost feels like a peel and it feels weird). I quickly distribute to my face, it dries nicely and my skin is left smooth and hydrated. I have oily to combination skin and this serum does not make my skin feel oily whatsoever. Love LOVE. I have a pic of my face now (wish I had a before) nan
