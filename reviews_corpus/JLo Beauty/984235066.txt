The packaging is great for this - it’s heavy and obviously a thick, high-quality packaging. After applying it for about two weeks, I really started to notice the difference. The eye cream is definitely thick and moisturizing. The only thing I didn’t like about it is that it doesn’t have a very good smell. Good for under eyes!
