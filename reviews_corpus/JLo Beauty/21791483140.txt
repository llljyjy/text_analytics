I received this for free from Influenster & JLo Beauty in exchange for my honest review. It’s a nice eye cream. It feels soft, creamy, & kind of silky. I have no complaints about it at all, but I’ve also used cheaper products that seem almost identical. I would however 1,000,000% buy this over the Avon Anew eye cream (regardless of any sales) because of a combo of some of their newer business practices & some completely awful things they said to me when I simply asked politely why prices went up so much & why certain top-selling items were discontinued. Great Eye Cream, But Not Unique
