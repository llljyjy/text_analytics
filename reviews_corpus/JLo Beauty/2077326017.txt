I have normal to combination skin. This doesn’t have a strong scent and is very thick, which I like. Although this product looks very luxurious, it doesn’t do much. I used this for a couple of weeks and did not notice any difference in my dark circles. I also noticed that my eyes would get irritated after using this and I am not the the sensitive skin type. Save your money and don’t buy this. Not worth the money
