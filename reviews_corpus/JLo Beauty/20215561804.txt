My new skin prep holy grail! Absolutely love this spf+moisturizer itâ€™s so rich and creamy and a little goes a long way. It leaves 0 white cast and melts into the skin like whipped butter. Absolute home run! I suggest if you have dry or combo skin apply after a serum because if your skin is dry the product will pill but if you use a serum before you will fall in love. The packaging is the cherry on top because it looks beautiful on my vanity. Skin Prep MUST-HAVE
