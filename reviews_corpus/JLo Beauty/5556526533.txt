I was very excited to try this new product from JLo beauty! The packaging is luxurious and makes my bathroom counter look so fancy! I tried this for 4 days and each time I used it I got slight hives (please note my skin is very sensitive and because it’s comedogenic ingredient) It definitely moisturized my under eye but it didn’t make my tired eyes look bright. Also wish this product was non-comedogenic so a wider range of consumers could use it. It hydrates well
