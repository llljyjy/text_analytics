I purchased the serum and blockbuster moisturizer and returned it because I didn’t quite like the smell and it didn’t seem to do much. Reordered both again and have gotten used to the smell, especially because now that I’ve used it for a month, I can see my skin improving. I still wish the smell was better but it’s only apparent when first applied and it’s fine after. The serum spreads easily so you don’t need much. The moisturizer feels a bit heavy when first applied. It has a very different and unique texture than regular moisturizers. It’s like a solid texture (I want to say like crisco?) and then melts nicely when you rub it in. I finally have people complimenting me on my skin! It feels great. Get used to the smell
