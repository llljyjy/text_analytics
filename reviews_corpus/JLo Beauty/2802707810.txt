I was pleasantly surprised by this. I have oily, combo, somewhat sensitive, acny-prone  skin, and this doesn’t irritate it at all. It feels nice, not too oily or sticky. It absorbs well and doesn’t cause any breakouts. It doesn’t irritate my eyes, like most eye creams do.The smell isn’t the best, but I’d prefer that to heavily scented skincare, so it’s fine. The packaging is just ok, I’d rather it be some kind of pump. nan
