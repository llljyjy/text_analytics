The product itself has a few quirks that took me a while to figure out, but once I did, it’s a miracle product (which should be the expectation for most JLo Beauty products at this point). First of all, the product has a quite strange texture that doesn’t blend well with any of my toner underneath, but that doesn’t matter much because I’m not using it in daytime. It surprisingly doesn’t blend well with the JLo Beauty moisturizer too, but I find that it blends very well with any gel moisturizer on top. It’s fragrance-free so it doesn’t have the signature JLo beauty scent, but the smell is okay. The biggest thing I find that it’s kinda stingy when I first apply it on my face - but that makes sense considering it’s BHA + AHA, and I know it actually contains the ingredients because of the stings. The sensation doesn’t last long luckily, and after a good night sleep, my skin is refreshed, soft, and glowing. I can literally feel the new skin coming. The name doesn’t lie, it’s an overnight resurfacer, and an amazing one at that! It may sting you but it works wonders!
