I feel this should be sold as a night eye cream, not for day and night. It doesn’t fully absorb and pilled up under any make up I tried using with it. There isn’t a strong scent at all, which is nice for those who prefer unscented skincare.  I have continued using it in my night routine to really give it a chance, but I haven’t seen any results that they claim in their marketing at all. It hasn’t helped with dark circles, I see no improvement with my fine lines and overall it honestly seems like a basic drug store under eye cream. For the price they are charging I expected to see better and higher quality ingredients. I find most celebrity skin care lines are over priced and underwhelming, and this one is no different. Also, the packaging. When I first seen it I thought it looked so pretty and luxe… but then I picked it up. It’s cheap plastic, very cheap plastic. For this price range I expected glass or at least higher quality material than cheap clear plastic. All in all, I wouldn’t recommend - you can get better ingredients in cheaper eye creams that will actually give you results and that you can wear under your make up. Always look at the ingredients, not the celebrity name on the package. Can’t Use Under Make Up!
