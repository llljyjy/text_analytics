I picked this as one of my samples. I’ve been on the fence about trying it. I’m so glad I did. literally,  one use. HUGE difference. My skin glowed all day, I’m Native American Indian,  so the tone of my skin just brought out it’s natural tone even more. It does not smell bad. Just to be sure I put on a bit more under my nose. Now your probably thinking. No way , one time. That’s right. one time. That’s because I started with the inside first. I’ve been treating my skin only for years. But I started with the problem. I needed more help. Then I found it. ISAGENIX collagen elixir. comes in a bottle. 2xs a day. Drinking it gets into your system better. results are amazing! You’ll see these beautiful products working for you at Sephora so much better. I get everything from Sephora and love this company. Only one extra step and your products works so much better!
