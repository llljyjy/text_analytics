The packaging for That Fresh Take Eye Cream with Peptides is so pretty. As for the product itself, it was a bit underwhelming. When I apply the eye cream my under eye area does look smooth and bright but it doesn’t feel moisturizing enough. My skin type is combination so my under eyes do need some hydration and the Jlo Beauty just wasn’t enough. Also, I had to switch to only using it in the PM because it would cause my concealer under my eyes to go on patchy and I noticed a bit of pilling. Since I’m only able to use it at night I won’t be recommending this product. nan
