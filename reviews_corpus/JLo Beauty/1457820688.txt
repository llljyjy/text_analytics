I received this product to sample in exchange for my honest review. First, I must say I anticipated this product to have a heavy scent like many of its competitors, but I was pleasantly surprised it was nearly scent free! Definitely a huge plus. However, while quite moisturizing I do not need the benefit as an eye cream. I didnâ€™t find it to be super long lasting nor effective. Not something I would purchase on my own. nan
