I received this product from Influenster.  I have combo sensitive skin. This product did nothing other than semi-moisturize my skin.  It did not feel super hydrating or remove dark circles.  Save your money and try something else. The packaging is cute, but plastic.  When you open it you get this lovely plastic on plastic sound that makes the product feel cheap. Or my fav.
