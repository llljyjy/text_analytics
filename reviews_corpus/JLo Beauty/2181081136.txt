I received this product from influenster in return for my review and honest opinion! I’ve only been using it for two weeks now I don’t really notice any difference but I love the way it feels when I’m putting it on it doesn’t feel like it’s clogging my poors.it doesn’t leave my face sticky feeling.there just a subtle smell and it isn’t overwhelming. I’m giving it 4 stars because it has been one of my favorite overnight serums used by far! Waiting for a result!
