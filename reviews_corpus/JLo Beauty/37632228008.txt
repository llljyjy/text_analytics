I received this product from Jay Lo beauty and Influenster in return for my honest review. That overnight hustle AHA plus BHHA is a superior product that I have been using for a few weeks. I put it on nightly before I go to bed and wake up in the morning with my face feeling refreshed, my pores seem smaller, and my wrinkles are finer. I was honestly astonished by the results of this product and went online and researched it some more. I am seeing multiple people saying that theyâ€™ve already re-ordered this product and it is sold out online. That says a lot for a product. I truly do love this! There is a very gentle smell that is pretty unique. I love that the texture is very silky smooth and not oily in the bottle is one that can be packed quickly into a to go bag for an overnight stay. Superior! Goodbye full skin!
