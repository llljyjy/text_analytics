I bought the JLo Beauty Starter Kit directly from their website. It comes with the gel cleanser, glow serum, eye cream, moisturizer and this spf. The directions say to apply in that order. The spf is bad. Like, really really bad. It pills on my face terribly. I’ve never had that happen before. The instructions say to apply the moisturizer and the spf but since the spf is also a moisturizer, maybe I’ll try just using that and see how it sits. But I’m so turned off by the pilling, I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone. Terrible - Pills so bad
