Packaging is beautiful. My skin type is normal. I have dark circles under my eyes. The texture of the cream was nice. Not too thick. Felt nice going on. I didn’t notice a visual difference using the product, not right away or after using for a couple of weeks. I’ll continue to use it, but probably won’t purchase after I finish it. I can’t say that I’d recommend considering I didn’t see a difference. nan
