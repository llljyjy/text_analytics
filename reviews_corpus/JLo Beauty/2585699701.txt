The packaging is ridiculous, with absolutely zero environmental consciousness. I was hoping to be impressed since JLo has the funds to put together a great product, but all this is is “BLING“ - the containers are heavy and ’luxurious’ and ’golden’ - if you plan to display them to pretend you can waste resources, then you might like this.  The box is heavy glossy cardboard and there’s more un-recyclable plastic inside to hold the heavy containers - heavy bc of the plastic, not product.  I find it disconcerting that many of the reviews talk about the packaging like its a good thing... its about whats on the inside that counts, no?  The serum and creams are just ok... Will go with another brand that’s not just about flash. Stars are for the product - would give negative if I could for the disrespect to the planet. Packaging is an Environmental Nightmare!
