I added this sample in my last Sephora order and just forgot it,two days ago I was desperate looking for any serum for my dry skin,irritated I donâ€™t know what is wrong with my skin lately,and I founded the sample and applied in my face at night and in the morning my skin was smooth,a lil glowy,I immediately searched in Sephora and when I saw the price omg,but my skin love it. I wish it was cheaper
