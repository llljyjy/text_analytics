This product was just okay. I used it in conjunction with the 3pc kit, but used this at nights & that at mornings.. it went on nicely- not too much of a scent, it tingled a bit.. however, it made my face extremely dry in the mornings. After a few days, I discontinued use for now. In the future, I might just do every other day or use different products in the morning. nan
