I really wanted to love this because the packaging is gorgeous and JLo always looks amazing. Alas, this just made me break out and wasn’t kind to my skin at all. I have dry skin and am somewhat acne-prone but don’t have sensitive skin. It might be a nice serum for someone whose skin doesn’t break out ever and has normal skin, not particularly dry or oily. skip
