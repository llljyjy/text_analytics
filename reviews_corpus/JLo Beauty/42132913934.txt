I have been using this product for about 3 months now and I love it. I use to use specific beauty for the past 5 plus years but due to an availability issue I was looking for a new beauty regiments. I am happy to say I love JLO beauty products.  I also love the flexibility of being able to pick the items I love at Sephora.  Thank you for providing such amazing products  and the ease of picking it up at your stores. I have tried the JLO glow starter kit and I have since purchased the face Moisturizer and the eye cream.  I’m glad I picked up the starter kit at Sephora.  I’m a highly satisfied customer. I love the JLO beauty product line.
