I didn’t expect to like this so much, but after liking the serum, I gave it a shot. And like the serum it exceeded my expectations. This is a comfortable gel-cream that does not irritate my sensitive under eye area. It provides good moisture and plumps the under eye area enough to ease fine lines a bit. Concealer applies well over this, no pilling. Not as spectacular as La Prairie, but as good as many other eye creams I’ve tried that are double the price or more. Very good value. Great, affordable eye cream
