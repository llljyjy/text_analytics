The first thing I noticed about this eye cream is that it is really moisturizing. Sometimes eye cream will give me pimples or styes but I did not have that problem with this product. Over time I have noticed the wrinkles around my eyes are a bit softer but I havenâ€™t noticed much of a change with the dark circles under my eyes. I like that this product is cruelty free and unscented. I do wish that it came in a pump form, because I worry about transferring bacteria from my hands into the pot. Moisturizing Eye Cream
