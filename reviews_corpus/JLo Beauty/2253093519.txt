I received this complimentary from Influenster for review. This is a great product for my skincare rotation (for those who enjoy the “feeling” of a product working, it definitely tingles a bit). It’s consmetically elegant, from the package to the pumping method, and texture. You don’t need a lot which is a good thing but I certainly wish it was more accessible price wise. Definitely enjoyed it ! nan
