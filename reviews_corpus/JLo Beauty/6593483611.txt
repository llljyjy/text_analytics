Packaging is so pretty! Feels luxurious. The cream is thicker than other eye creams, which makes a little go a long way. I like to apply before bed. It moisturizes the area and I love that there isn’t a scent but I don’t see a difference in my undereye after weeks of use (but that’s true of every eye cream I’ve ever used). It’s cheaper than most luxe brand eye creams. I’d definitely use again! Just buy it already!
