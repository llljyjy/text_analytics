Really nice item. True to name it has a creamy gel texture that feels silky. Does exactly what it is suppose to do and doesnâ€™t leave me dry, rinses off well. I could possibly do with a little less scent but all her other items have little to no scent. It seems to brighten a bit too Love the line- cleanser is no exception
