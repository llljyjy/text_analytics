I have used this few times already  and totally loving it . I used while using primer . Have also used it just as a base for daily light make up . It is slightly tinted . Goes on smoothly. Definitely gives a slight glow and dewy look . Received complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project Excellent for dewy make up
