I wasn’t sure I’d like it but I tried it anyways. The texture is pretty lightweight and smooth as a comfortable serum but definitely not a standalone moisturizer for dry skin. I found applying too much like 4-6 pumps can cause my pores clogged but 2 pumps are good enough to get all the benefits it claimed. My skin is clear and even after 2 days with 2 pumps a time and 2 times a day. The price is reasonable and convenient, overall so worth it! Good but don’t over apply
