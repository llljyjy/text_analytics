This is a great option for a retinol. It doesnâ€™t have  much of a smell and rubs in easily.  It has been great for my hyperpigmentation and has really decreased redness. Make sure you use moisturizer morning and night with this product to avoid dry skin. Overall I enjoy it :) gifted by INNBEAUTY Project Great for hyperpigmentation
