This eye cream has a beautiful sheet beige tint with very fine luminous pearl in it. It really instantly brightens and lifts the look of the under eyes. The texture is a super light gel-cream that melts into the skin like water, providing a ton of refreshing hydration and depuffing the under eye area. After a couple minutes the eye cream really helps reduce dark circles. This is the perfect eye cream alone or under makeup. I find that I need less concealer when I use this product. You really need just the smallest amount for both under eyes and it makes such a difference! After continuously wearing the eye cream, I noticed an improvement in my fine lines! Iâ€™m very impressed with this formula and I highly recommend it! Brighter, tighter, and luminous under eyes
