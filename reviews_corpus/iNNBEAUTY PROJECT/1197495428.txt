Recommend by a wonderful associate at my local Sephora (I wish I could remember his name I want to rave how right he was!). I was currently using another brand that was really good ,but just was pricey and I wasn’t thrilled with the ingredients so I wanted something less.  I also tend to use different am and pm moistureizers sometimes depending on where I am in my week. (exfoliating so on) THIS IS GREAT and the price how can you go wrong.  I feel like it is a deep secret and we can’t tell anyone! I have used the entire thing and it LASTS. It has a nice creamy feel that absorbs well.  My skin is soft , looks good and feels amazing as well. I have not had any pilling as others have said they experienced. I use sunscreen over this daily. My skin is on the dryer side and this moisturizes well some daysit is  a-lot more dryer than others. I find this is now a top 5 product in my regimen.  Price and ingredient it is a WIN. IMPRESSED! MUST BUY
