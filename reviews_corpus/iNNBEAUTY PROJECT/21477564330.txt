Needed a new cleaner, I normally use Cliniques foaming cleanser in the pink tube and wanted to try something new. I have oily/dry combination skin and was referred to this cleanser by a Sephora store associate. I am glad I bought it, washes all my make up off and leaves my skin clean. so far no breakouts or skin reactions from the change in cleanser. nan
