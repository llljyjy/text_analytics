Smells and looks delicious, like sour cherry candy, but does not taste delicious. The oil is kinda thick, but it doesn’t go on gloopy or super sticky even after a second layer. No sticky tendrils every time I open my lips. It feels very comfortable and moisturizing and leaves a healthy sheen (not a glassy high shine finish, keep in mind this isn’t exactly a lip gloss) and tint to my lips; think of the tint as mlbb. It reminds me a lot of the Etude House Honey Cera lip oil in terms of texture and finish, but a bit thicker. #1 candy apple
