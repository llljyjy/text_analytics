My skin feels hydrated  after using the Keep it Clean Gel Cleanser and that’s a win for me! I love love that it has 10 Amino Acids in it with Ceramides. Skincare in a cleanser is a great idea and I love that this is included in the Keep It Clean cleanser. I noticed that after the first use my skin didn’t feel stripped of moisture or dry. It took my makeup off just fine. It’s a nice big size too and easy pump. Keep It Clean gifted me this produce for my honest review. Skin Felt Hydrated!
