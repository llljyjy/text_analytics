The Green Machine jelly serum was gifted by INNBEAUTY project. This product is great. It is gentle and didn’t cause any irritation to my sensitive skin. I love how glowy it makes my skin feel! It just brightens it up altogether and hydrates it at the same time. I’ve also worn it under makeup and it worked really well! It’s a different consistency because it’s an oil-serum hybrid but I think that’s why it hydrates so much! My skin has been pretty dry and i am loving the results so far after 7 days of use! So gentle and hydrating
