I received this Healthy Skin EditBestsellers Kit complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project in exchange for my honest review. This kit contains minis of a cleanser, serum, serum moisturizer, and a moisturizer. Overall, these minis seem like a decent value since the sizes are big enough to get to try these a few times before deciding to purchase the full sizes. These products work decently well for my skin and donâ€™t really have much fragrance/scent. I did notice some pilling after using the moisturizer though! nan
