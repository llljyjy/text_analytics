I am already obsessed with this new eye cream. One of my favorite things about it is the packaging, it’s a pump so no contamination.  But the formula is also outstanding! One pump is more than enough for both eyes, it blends in nicely and instantly brightens and it’s a great base for concealer. New favorite! You need this!
