I really like the formulation of this product & appreciate new and innovative serums such as these... however it just feels like it isn’t doing much. Goes on runny (I know it’s a hybrid) but just sinks in fast & is like it’s not there... hard to say on results! Overall it’s nice, but nothing crazy Nice but not a staple!
