This is a nice product but it’s not a lip oil, at least not by my standards. This is a REALLY thick gloss rather than an oil, but it has amazing shine. This smells and tastes like green apples, which I like but it’s not too noticeable when wearing. The reason this isn’t a 5 star review is because it’s not an oil and I felt like this just sat on top of my lips. Overall this isn’t bad for the price in my opinion, especially for a clean product. nan
