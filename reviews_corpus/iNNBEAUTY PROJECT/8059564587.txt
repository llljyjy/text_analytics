gifted by INNBEAUTY Project to try. I like the benefits behind it being clean and the cute bottle but what’s inside the bottle is super potent. In the best way. It’s light and airy and it did not feel like it was clogging my pores. It was easy to add this into the skin care routine that I already have which I like I did not have any breakouts I did not have any dry skin or any issues when using this. I think the price point is really great as well. Overall I like this brand and I like the product. Amazing
