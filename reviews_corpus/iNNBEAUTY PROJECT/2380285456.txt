I am such a fan! Inn Beauty project gifted me Retinol Remix & while retinol products can be tough to review if you are already a user or if you are a new user and haven’t given a good 6 weeks or so prior... as an advanced retinol user I feel like I can just ’tell’ when one seems effective by the way it feels on my skin after so many nights of use.  This one did not irritate but worked well on my skin.  Because I recently went back to a (skin assessed) rx strength tretinoin for the first time in years...and after 3 nights in a row already had the flaking/peeling...I swapped 4 x per week with this, 2 with the rx, 1 night off.  This regimen is working perfectly for me.  I really like the ingredient combo in this product & think it will be a great fit for new or sensitive users.... or for something like I am doing.  Great product & can’t wait to try more from INN!! Great product, cool brand
