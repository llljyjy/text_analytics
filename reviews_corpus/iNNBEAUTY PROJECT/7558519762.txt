This is hands down my favorite moisturizer I’ve ever used. The texture is so luxurious while also being lightweight...it seriously feels expensive. I wear it morning & night and have not experienced any pilling under makeup or greasiness. Besides the texture being amazing, this product actually works. My skin looks noticeably brighter and more even after using this for 4+ weeks, and it’s definitely hydrated and bouncy. For the price and the results you can’t beat it. the best thing ever
