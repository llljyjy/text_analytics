this is such a nice lighteweight moisturizer that is suitable for parched skin. I love how it absorbs nicely and doesnt leave a tacky residue. I have acne prone skin and this is a really nice option and leave my skin feeling soft and supple. I personally prefer moisturizers in a pump form because the product stays cleaner that way but the formula in this one is so nice. such a nice moisturizer!
