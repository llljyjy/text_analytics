This Face Glaze complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project  is perfect for minimalistic beauty routines. I apply this all over for a natural looking glow. It pairs well with my moisturizer and sunscreen. Even under makeup , it creates a smooth glowy canvas for the days I wear foundation . I love that it’s a light gel like texture that applies easily .You get the glow without looking oily. I have been using it Monday to Friday with my sunscreen and on weekends as a primer and highlight. It’s become an integral part of my routine since it is skincare which also looks like makeup .
