I received this moisturizer gifted by INNBEAUTY Project and I absolutely love it! I love that it contains ceramides and Vitamin C. It’s lightweight but creamy and absorbs really quickly. It leaves my skin feeling super soft and smooth by morning! I also use this on my 6 year old daughter’s cheeks, they get super dry in the winter, and it’s been working great! nan
