This cleanser feels so luxurious and silky, it left my skin feeling soft and nourished while still cleansing my skin. I use an oil cleanser to remove my makeup first but I love this as a second cleanse. The packaging with a pump also makes using it super easy and mess free (unlike squeezey tube cleansers). I would definite recommend this to someone who wants to try a non-stripping cleanser! A luxurious feeling cleanser
