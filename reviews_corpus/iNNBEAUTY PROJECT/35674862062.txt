I was looking for a new cleanser and was interested in this one because of the clean ingredients. There is no smell, it comes in a large pump bottle in an almost clear gel like liquid. It lathers well under water and I usually pump it into my hand then I rub my palms together to make a lather before applying it to my face. I didn’t have any sensitivities but it didn’t really have much effect either. It was gentle enough so it didn’t strip oils in my skin. Clean ingredients!
