I decided to try this product last minute as I was checking out. I wanted a moisturizer that does it all, because I already have so many steps in my skincare. I have been using this for a little over a week and my skin is noticeably brighter due to the Vitamin C and more even. I love anything that protects my moisture barrier, so peptides and ceramideâ€™s reeled me in. I have acne prone skin and so far no breakouts have resulted from this moisturizer. Definitely give it a try, making this a staple in my routine. Loveeeee this
