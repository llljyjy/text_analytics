This cleanser has a lightweight gel consistency and it foams a little. As someone with dry skin, I tend to shy away from cleansers that produce foam as they tend to dry out my skin. Thankfully, this product was very gentle. It effectively cleanses my skin and leaves it soft, supple, and hydrated. It works great as a second cleanser but unfortunately, it doesnâ€™t work as well as a first cleanser. I will definitely prefer using an oil-based cleanser as a first cleanser to remove my makeup. Great for dry skin!
