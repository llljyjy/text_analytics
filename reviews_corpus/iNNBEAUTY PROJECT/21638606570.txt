I was so excited about this new release. I am always on the hunt for a good cleanser that’s not too expensive. This cleanser felt nice on my face but I haven’t been using it enough to say if it really did anything to my skin. I will say that it doesn’t dry my face and it cleanses well and makes sure I have no leftover makeup on my face. AFFORDABLE CLEANSER
