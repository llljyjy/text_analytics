This new eye cream is designed to provide brightening and lifting in a gel cream formula. It has a peachy color with a creamier texture that requires making sure it is fully tapped into skin due to the thickness of it. I found it be lightly brightening and it helped with smoothing the area under my eyes. It is non-irritating and gentle, and a little goes a long way for this cream. I would have liked to see a little more brightening effect given the addition of beneficial ingredients like caffeine, vitamin C, and bakuchiol but I think it just needs a little bit longer use to see a more drastic effect. nan
