I have used effective products containing inert ingredients like dimethicone (silicone) and they have been safe, seal in moisture and add an elegant texture. So I have no issues with it used as a top of the list ingredient. However, this product feels VERY DRY and provides LITTLE MOISTURE to my skin. The humectants, emollients and peptides don’t seem to do anything at all.  I have introduced other moisturizers and emollients, but besides the shine it still feels dry! I also have little faith in the ethylated vitamin C used as the science doesn’t back any benefits for brightening and collagen production, besides being a mild antioxidant. I could only theoretically recommend this for the most oily of skins, perhaps in a humid summer environment. I’m combination. VERY DRY / LITTLE MOISTURE
