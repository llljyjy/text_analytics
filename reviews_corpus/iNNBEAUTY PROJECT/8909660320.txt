Gifted by in beauty project A vegan Retinol that I liked a lot. At first the skin feels stretched and very dry, but with the passing of days it begins to peel off and your new skin begins to shine, I really like my skin, it feels alive, my spots still diminished and my skin feels hydrated, also qyidl with some expression lines on my forehead, I love it I will continue using it Love
