I really enjoyed the serum and the moisturizer but I absolutely love the Slushy moisturizer. It feels good applying and it gives me a nice glow.  I also liked the gel cleanser because it cleans well without stripping my skin.  This is a great way to test this line and it would make a good holiday gift. A must try!
