After using this product for a little over a week, it’s performed “ok“ and about as well as I could have hoped. I have persistent dark circles and frankly haven’t found any product that helps with them, so I went in not expecting much anyway. My bar is pretty low! I noticed no change in dark circles, but slight improvement in puffiness and fine lines.  It does have some immediate benefits in hydrating and smoothing. This eye cream did not run into my eyes or cause any burning, singing, or watering. I found that a full pump is actually too much (even for both eyes) and I can do with a half pump spread thinly and evenly. This small dispenser will last me quite a while. I do like that it provides a smooth base and (very) slight color correction which is great under makeup. I applied foundation, concealer, and eye makeup over this product with no problem (no caking or creasing, no effect on longevity). As an eye cream it performs about the same as many other products I’ve tried. Again this is granting that I don’t think ANY eye cream helps with diminishing my dark circles. Its flexibility in use under makeup as well as the relatively affordable price point bumps it up to 4 stars. Nice under makeup
