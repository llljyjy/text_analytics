Received complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project in exchange for a review. Such an interesting product! Love how many ways you can use this! I tried it by itself and it gave my skin a subtle glow! Tried as a primer, and makes a lovely make up base too! You can also use this as a highlighter! Love that it has great skincare ingredients that make my skin hydrated and soft. It applies beautifully and blends in with the skin in no time without any tackiness! nan
