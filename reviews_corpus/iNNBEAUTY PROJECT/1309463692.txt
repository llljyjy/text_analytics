I tried this cleanser as the first of two step cleansing. It removed most of the makeup but my mascara needed more direct cleansing to be fully off.Within 5 minutes after rinsing, my face wrinkled up like crazy! For fact, I am over 60 and have used PTR orange cleanser for 20 years which does not do that.Thank you Sephora for your kind return policy.Sticking with the PTR. Wrinkled my skin did not remove all makeup
