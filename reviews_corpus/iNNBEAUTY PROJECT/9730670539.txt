mid at best. fragranced, comes out very thick, a little goes a long way; feels really greasy and suffocating for the skin when you put it on, but doesn’t stay like that. oh but instead of the skin absorbing it, the stuff just kind of disappear without moisturizing ur skin at all. didn’t have issues with the packaging though mehhhh
