Itâ€™s my first product from INN beauty. I am impressed with this retinol. The formulation and ingredients look promising.Good thing is it did not dry out or peel unlike other retinol products I tried. It has a fluid texture that absorbs quickly.It is a great beginners retinol for sure. I am looking forward to seeing the results. nan
