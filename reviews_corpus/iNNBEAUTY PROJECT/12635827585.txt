I had a a good experience with this product. I tend to stay away from cream pimple stoppers- but I loved the consistency of this one and the efficacy of it. I tend to struggle with acne around my period, and as soon as I saw one pop up, Iâ€™d put this on... most of the times it was gone next day. Love it! nan
