This stuff 100% works! I usually use Tretinoin cream on breakouts however it dries your skin also which I don’t like. This cream got rid of my acne over night without drying my skin! Impressive. I am acne prone, sensitive reactive skin so I am happy I’ve found this product! I highly recommend it. Less than 1 star since it’s pricey given the amount of product you are getting, could have been better size with the price imo. Unbelievable!
