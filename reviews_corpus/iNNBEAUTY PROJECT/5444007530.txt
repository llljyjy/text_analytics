Wow! Okay well to start with the texture of this product is very thick and perfect for dry skin during the cold winter months! My skin felt instantly more hydrated and plump after the first time applying and brighter. Definitely gives a radiant glow to the skin after using, 10/10 would recommend! It honestly felt like the extra boost my skin needed at the end of my skin care routine. Complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project. Thick moisturizer perfect for winter weather
