I’m loving this vegan retinol so far. I’m in my 30s with very fine lines and some scars from acne and I’m interested to see how well this vegan retinol does long term. So far I have noticed that my skin looks more glowy and hydrated and plump. My fine lines look less obvious not sure if it’s working in a short time or just helping to plump them up. No irritation yet and my bumps seem improved from using retinol. Must try for acne prone gals. Complimentary from Innbeauty project Good vegan retinol
