I have very sensitive eyes! So I’m always a bit leery of any eye products. But I was genuinely curious about this one, and thankfully was not disappointed! This serum really does brighten your undereye area as it has some pearlescent characteristics! This work’s fabulously well with your undereye concealers for a gorgeous “no makeup” or refreshed look! This product does hydrate the undereye and have it feeling soft and velvety! Because I’ve only been using the product for about two weeks I haven’t noticed a huge difference in my fine lines, but I’m going to continue to use! nan
