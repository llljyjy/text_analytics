I am ecstatic! I absolutely love this product. At first I was a bit cautious about the scent, but it work like a charm. I applied it before going to bed and it got dry in about 5-10 minutes, so before I fell asleep. All I had to do in the morning is wash it off and the pimples would either decrease in size or disappear. Love it and highly recommend it! It works!
