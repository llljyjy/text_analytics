I’m a retinol newbie and am in my mid-late 30s. I wasn’t familiar with the brand because their customers seem to be in their teens and early 20s, but I wanted something gentle and kind of took the thought line of — if baby shampoo is no tears and gentle enough for a baby, I can use it, too… so if this retinol is gentle enough for a young person who might not “need” this like I do… maybe I won’t experience “retinol uglies.”Okay! As a complete beginner, I made the mistake of applying this to damp skin like I would any other serum. Big mistake! Please learn from mine. Cleanse your skin and make sure it’s thoroughly dry. Everyone says one pump, but I have a rounder face and apply to my neck. So, I use two pumps, dot product on my forehead, nose, cheeks, chin, jawline and use upward strokes on my neck. Pat in the rest. Must follow up with a moisturizer. Since learning from my error, I haven’t had any sensitivity issues, and I have really dry and sensitive skin that is easily reactive to skincare products. I’m lucky not to have many skin issues, but with regular use at least every other night for five weeks, I’m seeing smoother texture and the one wrinkle I have between my eyebrows is softening. Not really helping milia or blackheads, but I’ve added an AHA / BHA / pineapple enzyme scrub to help exfoliate in the morning (not sold at Sephora) that seems to do what this retinol cannot. I’ll consider repurchasing one more time. However, retinol doesn’t seem to do much more than lactic acid serum for my skin type personally. Also— tried their two other serums— slushee and green something. Great for teen and 20s ski, or maybe for normal / combo / oily, but not mine. Overall, good value for the quality I’ve seen so far and the price point seems fair. First time retinol user, 36, dry-sensitive skin
