I was hesitant to order this because it’s a dropper and not a pump (due to how quickly vitamin c serums oxidize and go bad after exposure to air). I enjoyed the scent and the fresh feeling when applying this, but saw absolutely no skin benefits whatsoever. I think this actually may have caused some clogged pores, especially along my cheeks. This has a jelly consistency which dries quickly and can be difficult to get to absorb. I will try to finish this bottle, and I definitely won’t repurchase. Just meh for me!
