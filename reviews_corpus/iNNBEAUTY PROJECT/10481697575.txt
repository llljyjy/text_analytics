I really liked this serum! I have acne prone skin and it didnâ€™t really help with my scarring but it made my skin feel very nourished and oh so GLOWY. The glow is definitely the best part. However, my only complaint was that the bottle barely lasted a month with using it twice a day. It is only an ounce after all...but a larger size would be nice! GLOWY
