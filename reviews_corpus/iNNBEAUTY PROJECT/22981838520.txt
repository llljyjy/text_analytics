Loving the feel of this moisturizer on my skin. Its light but rich at the same time. Very nice ingredients, if this doesn’t restore your skin barrier I don’t know what will. Also the packaging is super cute, this line overall is very nice. Also it is a sustainable line and cruelty free. Received this as a gift Great moisturizer
