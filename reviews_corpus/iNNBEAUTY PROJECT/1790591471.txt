I was highly impressed with this wonderful eye cream! It can be used day or night, although it has a bit of tint to it which would provide a nice undereye base for concealer. I liked the bottle design and pump feature as it makes for a clean and easy application compared to eye creams in a pot. My eye area was instantly brightened and the cream itself blended so easily and was the perfect texture. Highly recommend! Adore this eye cream!
