i love this stuff! i’m super picky when it comes to vitamin c serums (tried sunday riley, drunk elephant and the ordinary) but this by far has a way better consistency and has given me the best results. i have a lot of redness from rosacea and acne. i’ve been applying this serum every single morning (spf on top, of course) and a lot of my acne scarring has significantly improved! the consistency is slushy-like, as described, which i prefer to a liquid.  it has a very slight stickiness, which is common for vitamin c, but not bothersome! i’m on my second bottle and i even look forward to doing my morning skincare routine which can seem like a chore at times. definitely recommend! on my second bottle!
