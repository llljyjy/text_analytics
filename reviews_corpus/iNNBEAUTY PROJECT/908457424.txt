I have suffered from hyperpigmentation for years and have tried absolutely everything on the market to minimized my ugly brown spots.  Nothing has been as effective and plesantly surprising in just four weeks of use, as 10+10!! Iâ€™m obsessed with this moisturizer and attribute it to giving me glowing, hydrated, plumper and    more even skin tone! I highly recommend this moisturizer for those who want a filter in a jar! I give it a 10 out of 10+10!!! Magic in a jar
