I have seen this product on tiktok and since it was complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project, I had to give it a shot. This product is so unique in the texture and how it applies to the skin. I loved it as a dewy under makeup highlighter. I applied it on areas I would with liquid highlighter then put foundation on and it looked amazing. After that I had to try it as a liquid highlight over makeup (powder specifically) and it did not cake up my makeup. This is now a new staple and will be used all summer long! New makeup staple
