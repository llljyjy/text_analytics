FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT DELIVERS! I am excited to have discovered this product line from an Instagram ad and was able to purchase from Sephora. I donâ€™t like to wear makeup so this face glaze is a great substitute for someone wanting a light coverage during the harsh winter months. It definitely blurs any imperfections, feels so lightweight and gives a gorgeous glow to your face! I was so impressed by this that I decided to buy their new moisturizer and so AMAZING too! This Product Does Everything It Says!
