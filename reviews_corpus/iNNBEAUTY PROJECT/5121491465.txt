Thank goodness for the added Cica in this vegan retinol because those who are beginning users can benefit from this skin calming goodie! I’ve been using retinol for years now, so it’s been easy to incorporate into my routine.  What sells me even more are the peptides, all combined into one easy to use vegan retinol that my skin has enjoyed thus far! *gifted by Innbeauty nan
