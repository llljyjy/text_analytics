I really love this moisturizer! It applies very lightweight for a cream, that absorbs quickly and without any residue into the skin. Minutes after applying my skin feels hydrated. It doesnâ€™t have a fragrance to it, so that is nice. It sinks in and hydrates for hours after applying. This is a great moisturizer! Phenomenal
