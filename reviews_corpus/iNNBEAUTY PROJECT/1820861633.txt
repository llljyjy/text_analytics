I was so excited to try the brand new moisturizer complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project.  This bouncy texture product is very nice.  I have dry skin, so I feel like this would be a great Spring/Summer moisturizer for me.  I had to layer another moisturizer over this just to have an added layer during the Winter months.  It feels super lightweight - like a drink of water for the skin.  I really like it, but I need a little bit more for the Winter months. Great for lightweight moisture
