I’ve tried many retinol serums with mixed results, some are too strong to use on my sensitive skin or too weak to notice a difference- this one has been game changing! The serum feels great on my skin and absorbs quickly, and plays well with my overnight moisturizers. My hyperpigmentation has started fading already, I can’t wait to see the progress in a month! Will definitely be getting another bottle when this one runs out! nan
