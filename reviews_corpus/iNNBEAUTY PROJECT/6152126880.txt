This moisturizer has a gel-cream, lightweight texture with no scent, which I LOVE! It absorbs nicely and leaves my skin feeling well moisturized and replenished, even during the dry winter months. I love how this contains powerful ingredients, including vitamin c, peptides, and ceramides. Complimentary from INNibeauty. 10/10
