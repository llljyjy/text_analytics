This is great to control my acne.  I use it 2X a week as part of my nighttime routine and my skin has no irritation at all.  It has a lightweight milky texture that easily applies and my skin soaks it right in.  My face looks more smooth and looks brighter.  Just donâ€™t forget to apply sunblock in the morning. nan
