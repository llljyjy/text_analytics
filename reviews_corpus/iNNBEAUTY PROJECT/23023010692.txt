I didn’t experience so much hydration and moisturizing from this product. I have a very dry skin and was so excited to use this; however, didn’t work out on my skin type. It has a glue like scent which is not pleasing. After applying this serum moisturizer I felt like I still need more products to moisturize my skin. nan
