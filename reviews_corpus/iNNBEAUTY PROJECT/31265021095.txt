I was looking for a really good eye creamthen, I found this one.This cream is made with amazing ingredients.This cream is on the thicker side but you only need a little bit.I am a sleepless mama of two and  my dark circles has improved beautifully. It is very hydrating and moisturizing. I apply this cream and I look well rested. After application, my  face feels adequately hydrated. My skin feels highly nourished. I have been using it almost 2 weeks and my face is already transformed for the better. I have sensitive skin and my skin didnâ€™t experience any kind of irritation. Highly reccomend this amazing nutrient dense product. nan
