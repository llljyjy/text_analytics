I received this product complimentary from iNNBeauty Project.  This treatment works great for my skin. My face is showing some fine lines and wrinkles and has some dark spots, and this retinol treatment really helps to reduce the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles and to provide my skin with a more even tone. This treatment comes in such a beautiful colorful packaging. After using this treatment each night for a few days, I already saw results. My fine lines and wrinkles are less visible, and my skin feels softer, hydrated, firmer and looks brighter. I use the treatment at night right before bed. It is easy to apply. I clean my skin first and then I use a small amount and tap it into my skin. I love that this treatment is silky smooth and absorbs fast. It has a nice lightweight texture and does not leave a sticky feeling. It has a light citrusy scent. My skin feels hydrated and soft and is looking bright and radiant when waking up in the morning. This retinol treatment is clean, vegan, effective and gentle enough for my skin to use daily. I have not experienced any bad skin reactions like peeling of the skin or dryness of the skin, and I makes sure to wear sunscreen while using this retinol treatment. I canâ€™t wait for the long-term results. I Highly recommend this retinol treatment! improves my skin tone
