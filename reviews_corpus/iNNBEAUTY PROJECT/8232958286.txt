I expected myself to like this more. It’s a pretty simple gel cleanser I just don’t think it was great for me. The fragrance was odd it wasn’t like it was bad but it definitely has like a particular smell to it and unfortunately this stung my eyes. Might be better for someone else but unfortunately my skin was a little too sensitive to it nan
