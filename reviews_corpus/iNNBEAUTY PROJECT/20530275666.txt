INNBEAUTY  retinol remix is vegan and clean and a perfect retinol product to use when you’re trying to see the real results from the retinol products and not yet ready to use something strong as tretinoids. I started using it every two to three days and noticed a little bit of skin shedding. But this is normal for retinol product it only means it’s working plus I have a very sensitive and dry skin so if your skin is not like mine - you might not even see the skin shedding that much. I’m very happy with the way my skin starting to look, it became more smoother and brighter I’ll continue to use it more often and see even better results. I received this product complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project and I’d definitely recommend it. Amazing clean retinol product
