I wasn’t sure how retinol would be on my skin but this product is super easy to use. You apply before moisturizing your face. The packaging comes with an instruction manual on what areas to apply. I apply on my forehead, cheeks and chin. My skin does feel firmer and my skin is glowing! I’ve been using this for 2 weeks and am happy with my results. This product was gifted to me by iNNBEAUTY. nan
