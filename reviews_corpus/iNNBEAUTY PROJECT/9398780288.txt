I was searching for an exfoliating toner that had lactic acid and I’m glad I found this one. Yes, it has a bit of a vinegar scent to it, but I can overlook that with the results. My only complaint is that there wasn’t the usual expiration on the packaging or bottle. I had to do some digging on the brands website to find it. excellent toner
