I’m very pleased with the results after using this for about 3½ weeks. I was initially looking for more of a serum to replace the $79 Caudalie Vinoperfect that I’d been using. This is slightly thicker, more of a combination moisturizer serum duo. I still follow up with my moisturizer afterwards, but I must say, my skin seems bright, clearer, and more even toned all over. I’m quite please. Especially at half the cost of what I was using before Best Results for your Buck
