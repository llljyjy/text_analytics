So, I got this serum to start incorporating Vitamin C into my routine for its brightening properties and my minor hyperpigmentation. However, I noticed that it also helped keep oil production down ALOT for me. It was super interesting because I patch tested it on a part of my forehead that I can hide under bangs if I experienced any issues and the area I applied it to was very noticeably less oily than the rest after the work day. Surprised, as it was not my intention, but definitely not mad at it! Still a new product to me so I can’t speak on its brightening yet. Also a disclaimer, I wouldn’t say I “struggle“ with oily skin, more so that I just get moderately greasy through the day with some shine. So, if you really have issues with oil, I’m not sure if it would work to the same extent I experienced. But, worth a shot if you’re not sensitive to Vit C or its other ingredients :) Pleasantly surprised!
