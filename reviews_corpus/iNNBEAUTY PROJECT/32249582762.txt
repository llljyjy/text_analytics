Given this just about a month and really wish I loved it more. I have sensitive skin and have never been able to tolerate vitamin c products. I was so excited to try this as it’s formulated for sensitive skin, but I’m still seeing redness / irritation. I pushed through in hopes that it was a purge of sorts. No luck.Love the smell and feel of the serum itself - so unique. It very well could be another ingredient that triggered my sensitivity. Wish it worked for me!
