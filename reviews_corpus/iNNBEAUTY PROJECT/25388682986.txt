This retinol remix gifted by Innbeauty project is great for anybody who’s new to retinol or has a sensitivity to retinol. I’ve only been using it for about a week but I noticed that it does not make my skin irritated. I also do not notice any strong fragrance. The packaging is cute as well! Since I’ve only been using it for a week, I cannot speak on any long-term benefits at this time. nan
