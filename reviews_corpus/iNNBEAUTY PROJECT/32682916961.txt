I have been using this under eye cream for 10 days and I loved it! The product is super hydrating and it has a cream like texture that absorbs super fast into your skin. I noticed an instant brightening and hydration of my under eye. I have some dark circles under my eyes and this product has worked to minimize and brighten them. It is gentle on the eyes, I havenâ€™t had any bad reactions or irritation. The caffeine in it helped me have a more refreshed look in the mornings. I definitely recommend recommend this product. A must have!
