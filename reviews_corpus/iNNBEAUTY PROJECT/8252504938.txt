It’s been pretty cold on the East Coast and as a result it’s difficult for my skin to stay moisturized. It seemed like no matter what my face creams weren’t helping. Adding this to my skin care routine helped a lot, especially with the dry achy pain my skin on my face was feeling after washing and toning. It has a softening and plumping effect and my skin feels protected. nan
