I received this complimentary from Innbeauty Project, and I’m loving the results. This vitamin c is very different than all the other vitamin c I have used in the past. The texture is like a serum but also has oil. This helped reduce my hyperpigmentation, dark spots & uneven tone unlike anything I’ve ever used. It is so  gentle & non-irritating and not only that but it improved the look of firmness & reduce appearance of wrinkles! Loving the result!
