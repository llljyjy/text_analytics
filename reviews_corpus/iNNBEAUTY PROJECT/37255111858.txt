I have tried so many lip oils and this is one of my favorites. the smell isn’t super overpowering, the pigment is just enough (it leaves a pretty red), it isn’t super sticky, and the applicator is a big doe foot! that’s what I always look for in a lip oil. for sure will be repurchasing super hydrating!
