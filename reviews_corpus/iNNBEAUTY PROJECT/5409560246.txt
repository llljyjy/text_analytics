The best, most comfortable lip oil I’ve ever worn! It’s the perfect consistency, not too thin or too thick. It isn’t sticky and is very hydrating. It smells delicious and doesn’t taste like anything. The price point is also fair for a product this hood! I only wish there were more compute! Fries looks like a sheer Chi y gloss on me :) Better Than Dior!!
