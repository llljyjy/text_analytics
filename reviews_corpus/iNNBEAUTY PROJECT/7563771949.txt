I loved trying this moisturizer! It was a bit thicker than I expected, I usually prefer lighter creams for my oilier skin. A little went a long way and it absorbed well into my skin. I loved how it includes so many different ingredients for different purposes, and only after a few days of us e my skin feels hydrated, bouncier, and brighter. nan
