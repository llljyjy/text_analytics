This moisturizer is good for oily skin.  It might be too drying to use alone if you have dry skin.  However I do see results which are subtle but overall my skin looks good when I use it.  It’s also non irritating and has no scent which is great.  I use it with the Glow recipe dew drops and there’s no interaction with the 2.  Hard to find a day moisturizer that doesn’t irritate or make me look too shiny but this one is great.  I would purchase this again. slushy is great
