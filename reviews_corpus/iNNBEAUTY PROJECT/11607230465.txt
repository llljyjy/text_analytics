I receI received this vegan retinol complimentary from Imnbeauty Project. I absolutely adore this retinol from Innbeauty Project. I’m a bit of a retinol snob, so I’m very picky about what kind I use. I’ve used products from this brand before and loved them, so I had to give this one a try. Let me tell you this retinol is amazing.  I use this a night up to 3 times a week and I’ve definitely seen results, and fast. My skin has been struggling lately with breakouts,  uneven skin tone and texture, and dark spots. This retinol has tremendously helped fade my dark spots and my skin looks brighter and more even. The texture is smoother and I’m noticing small fine lines beginning to fade. The texture is lightweight and absorbs quickly. It doesn’t cause any irritation and is great for sensitive skin. Every time I apply this retinol, my skin looks better and better. I love that it’s made with good ingredients and is vegan. My skin is looking healthier and has been glowing. I will definitely be keeping this product in my skincare routine from now on. Love it!!!
