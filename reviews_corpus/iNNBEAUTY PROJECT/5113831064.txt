This retinol seems great for first time retinol users, itâ€™s not too harsh! The texture is creamy and smells just like a dreamsicle popsicle! I used this at night and woke up to super soft supple skin. Definitely helps with texture over continued use, (this product was gifted by inn beauty project) nan
