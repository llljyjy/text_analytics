This product was gifted to me by the brand and I’m so grateful! It left my face feeling and looking so healthy and hydrated in the morning after washing my face! I tried it out for a week and its not too bad! The only issue I ran into was pilling which is why I give it a 4. I would suggest patting it into the skin when applying it to avoid pilling because when I massaged it in like suggested I ran into that problem. Regardless of the pilling, when I pat it in the rest of the days I tried it, I noticed the way my skin did have a bit of a pick me up moment because it wasn’t as dull as before. Overall I’m pretty content with the product! pat it in to avoid pilling!
