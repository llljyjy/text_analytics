I have pretty dry skin, so I was so excited about trying out the Keep It Clean Hydrating Gel Cleanser. Even more so when I heard it can be used to remove makeup. Just like the directions say, I used two pumps and rubbed it on my face, however, I found it was way to dry to do anything. The gel texture just grew super thick and I ended up needing a bit of water to massage it into my skin. As for using it as a regular cleanser, it was okay -- it does get very sudsy which is not my favorite for a facial cleanser. I will continue to try the bottle I received, but I personally prefer my current, milky cleanser. It's Okay
