Suddenly, now that I’m old enough to claim my senior discount is when I finally break out in cystic acne! I read great things about this pimple paste, and frankly, I was desperate. I was collecting these things that acted like baby spiders were going to explode from my face, neck or chest. For $15 I thought, I’m only out $15 bucks if it didn’t work! IT WORKS! It stings a bit, and smells medicinal, but it does the Lord’s work.It’s not a huge tube. It’s only slightly larger than the photo, but you won’t need much. I went from looking like a red, blotch faced monster, back to my more Casper/ almost transparent self. Just two blue orbs floating in a wispy sea of alabaster and strawberry red hair. BUY IT! It takes a few days, but IT WORKS!
