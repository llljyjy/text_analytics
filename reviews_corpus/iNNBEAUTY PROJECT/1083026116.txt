I wanted to like this since the texture is great, it really is like a lightweight jelly. However, I have given it a few weeks now and every single morning after I use it, I wake up with whiteheads on my cheeks and under my eyes where I’ve applied. I just don’t think it is hydrating enough to make up for the reaction my skin has. Whiteheads and not moisturizing
