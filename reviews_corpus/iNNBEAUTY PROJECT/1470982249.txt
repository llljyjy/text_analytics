I can’t use so many effective ingredients during pregnancy so I was struggling to find a product that would work. I decided to give this a try even though I’d never heard of the brand. I was really, pleasantly surprised! It has worked so well and dries up acne without drying skin out like the sulfur treatment from Sunday Riley which is more expensive and less effective. pretty impressed
