Low key obsessed with this eye cream! I was lucky enough to get an early press preview bottle and I’m telling y’all, this is going to be a bestseller. It reminds me of FAB eye cream with its peachy tint that helps minimize the look of dark circles, plus it comes in a pump bottle so you don’t have to constantly dip into the same jar for a product that will go around your eyes. It’s not greasy, absorbs somewhat easily but not to the point where it just disappears from your face, and it’s just an all-around excellent skin moisturizer. My eyes look like I got a full 8 hours so she’s a winner in my book! nan
