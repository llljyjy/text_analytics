I usually stick to the same Vitamin C serum but since trying this, it’s my new favorite. I love how this makes my skin feel hydrated. I also noticed that my skin seem a bit brighter after after using it a few times. I also love the ingredients in this product too. It’s got vitamin C, plant stem cells, and aloe base. Which are all amazing for skin. I would highly recommend this product. This is amazing
