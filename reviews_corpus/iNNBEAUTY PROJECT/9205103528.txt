I have combination skin that is also sensitive because I have rosacea. I do like this so far, it kind of neutralizes my redness but it’s not dramatic like some other products. I don’t like the texture unfortunately, but it’s overall not irritating and layers well with my other products. On the more affordable side for similar products! nan
