I’ve used the Dior and Fenty skin lip oils and although all three have a similar consistency and effect, this one definitely takes the cake! Love the large doefoot applicator and smooth, mostly clear feel and look. The biggest thing this oil has over all others I’ve tried is the smell/taste! The candy apple is so deliciously scented that I get excited every time I use it. I put it on every night before bed and in the morning when finishing my skin care and have no issues with dry lips or chapping through the day, even going into the cold dry winter months. It is amazing that this lip oil is half the cost of others that aren’t nearly as good. This will definitely get re ordered many times by me! Best Lip Oil Ever!
