This was gifted by INNBEAUTY Project. This is my first product from INNBEAUTY, and I enjoyed using it. It’s a clean, vegan retinol, which differentiates it from some other retinol products. I usually use a retinol serum daily, so my skin is not typically sensitive to retinol. I didn’t experience any irritation with this product. This doesn’t feel drying or tacky either, so application feels great. This has helped with a reduction of fine lines that I’m trying to retain through use of retinol products! Vegan and clean retinol!
