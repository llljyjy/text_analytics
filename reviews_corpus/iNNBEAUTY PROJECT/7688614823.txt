the texture was very nice and smooth. my skin felt very nice after washing off this product, I used this after my oil cleanser both morning and night (the oil cleanser for removing my makeup). my skin felt hydrated and not tight after trying. this is a new staple cleanser in my routine! I like most the simplicity of this product. I would recommend this! new fav cleanser
