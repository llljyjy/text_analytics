Meh...I’m on the fence. This serum feels lovely going on, but there are much more effective Vitamin C products out there. This seems like a good product for general maintenance or skincare newbies, but not for someone who really needs to target specific issues. I prefer the Slushy serum over this one. I usually use the Green Machine for lazy days when I’m not leaving the house and don’t want to use my nicer products. Not impressed
