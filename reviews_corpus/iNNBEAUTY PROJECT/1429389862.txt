I’ve used this serum for couple of weeks so far and I love it. My skin looks much healthier and my uneven skin tone is getting better. I didn’t have any reaction. It is great for sensitive skin as well. I use it in the evening before I put my moisturizer and it works great! Good product and not expensive. Gifted by INNBEAUTY. My review is honest. Great Vitamin C serum!
