I’ve been using this product for a week and I’m loving it so far. The application it’s very smooth and the product absorbs pretty quickly.After applying it, the skin looks dewy but not crazy, it’s more a natural dewy which personally I love!Also my skin looks smoother and the pores are minimized.I used it before makeup and I’ve noticed that it makes my base lasting longer.If I want and extra glow I put a little bit of product on my cheekbones, it gives me a nice natural glow! 10/10 for me! (I have dry skin, so not sure how it would be on other types of skin)I’ve received this product gifted by INNBEAUTY to give my honest opinion. nan
