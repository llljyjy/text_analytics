Very similar to Mario Badescu drying lotion. This dries everything out of your pimple, so use sparingly. I only use this when I’m desperate, since it isn’t the best for my sensitive skin. However, if I need a pimple gone in two days, this does the trick. Very strong sulfur smell, but better ones it dries down. Good for Quick Treatment
