This lovely moisturizer has all the ingredients we look for to nourish and maintain a healthy skin barrier. It also has ceramides, whichI love during winter! I use this morning and night and it keeps my skin moisturized. There is also very subtle glow on my skin, which I love! Iâ€™m always impressed with innbeauty products and this is no different. Great for winter dryness!
