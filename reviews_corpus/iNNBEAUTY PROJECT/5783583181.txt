This product was gifted to me by the brand, my opinion is honest and based on my experience using this product. I am new to InnBeauty Project and I was very curious about this product. As a person who has to wear a mask for long periods of time at work, I was looking for products that would keep my skin hydrated, but wanted to look “presentable“ in the same time, if you know what I mean. This product turned out to be great. I wear it on my no makeup days, it just melts into my skin, evens it out and keeps it hydrated. I love the subtle glow of a radiant and healthy skin. Definitely worth the money. Great product - worth investing in it
