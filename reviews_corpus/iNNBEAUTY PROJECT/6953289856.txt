I am newer to retinol so I’ve been using this twice per week and shocked that I had zero negative effects. Typically I’d get some peeling when using retinol, maybe even a couple breakouts, but so far my skin has been very happy with this one. I believe it’s because this also contains centella Asiata which is a soothing and hydrating ingredient. It’s only been a few weeks since I started using this and it can take months for results, but so far I am loving this and I’ll be sure to update again in a couple of months!
