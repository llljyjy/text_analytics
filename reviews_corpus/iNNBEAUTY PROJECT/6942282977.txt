I really wanted to like this product. It smells great and looks good when applied. However, literally everything else made me opt for a different lip oil. For starters, the applicator is impossible. For some reason, it never picks up any product from the bottle, even with the bottle completely full. I find myself having to dip it in the bottle minimum 4 times to get a full application on my face. Also, to make matters more difficult, the applicator is hard to pull in an out of the bottle. Most lip oil products don’t take any time to apply because usually more than enough product comes out with the applicator. I’m young and healthy, but somebody with mobility issues would never be able to use this product because it takes over a minute of struggling with the packaging to dip the applicator in enough times to apply it to your face. the product is fine but that’s where it ends
