This Healthy Skin Edit from INNBEAUTY PROJECT is one of the nicest skincare package I have ever received.  I love the Keep It Clean Hydrating Gel Cleanser. It foams up nicely and lathers so well on the skin. The cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean, smooth and clearer. It feels gentle and also leaves skin very hydrating. The Slushy Serum Moisturizer Crush is a lightweight, yet very gentle moisturizer. It’s watery and quick absorbing. This helps keep my skin hydrate, soft and smooth. I feel my skin appears smoother and somewhat firmer after using this Slushy. Green Machine Oil Jelly Serum has a nice thickness in consistency.  i like the green tint of the seum. It doesn’t feel oily or greasy on the skin even though it contains Vitamin C and Superfood Serum. The serum leaves my skin with a nice soothed and hydrated skin throughout. There’s a tightening effect can be felt after applying, but the serum is gentle enough not to irritate my skin in anyway. 10 + 10 More-Sturizer is such a beautiful cream with a silky smooth texture. It’s a rich cream  with Peptide and Vitamin C combination to help brighten the skin, smooth out fine line and wrinkles. The cream absorbs well without  leaving any residue or greasy behind. I love how silky smooth this cream feels on my skin. It visibly helps firm up the skin as well as smooth out fine lines and wrinkles. This is such a great skincare set for it very affordable purchase point. I would definitely recommend this INNBEAUTY PROJECT Healthy Skin Edit. Very Nice Kit
