- I’m an advanced retinol user so I used this 5x/week & had no irritation or flakiness- The texture feels like a thin creamy serum that feels nourishing & absorbs without a sticky residue or film- I’m really impressed by the combo of soothing & hydrating ingredients incorporated because most retinols are jam packed with actives that easily cause irritation- I only used this for 2 weeks and my skin feels very smooth in acne-free zones & has that dewy shine when light hits my face- This did cause some purging but I’m not upset about it as I know it’s the process with acne-prone skin. Plus it’s mainly tiny bumps that are improving with pimple patches & this retinol-Overall, I would recommend this for retinol beginners & those with sensitive skin because this has calming ingredients. This is nowhere as strong as the Paula’s Choice (PC) Retinol, but I like that with this retinol I’m guaranteed no irritation for my skin. *Follow @sassandskincare on IG for more reviews*Gifted by iNNBEAUTY PROJECT Gentle & Effective Retinol
