This moisturizer is super hydrating!! It has a very light, airy texture and the consistency isn’t too thick or thin. It’s that perfect balance in between. It’s very moisturizing but not greasy feeling. It’s heavy enough as a night cream but a light amount is perfect for daytime, especially during the colder weather. It’s fragrance free as far as I can tell, so great for sensitive skin. nan
