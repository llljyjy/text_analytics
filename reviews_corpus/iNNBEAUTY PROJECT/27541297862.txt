Retinol is my favorite skincare ingredient so far. Since I have very dry and sensitive skin I usually choose to use infused retinol forms. My biggest skin concern is hyperpigmentation and this retinol has tranexamic acid which is very good for fading hyperpigmentation. I really looking forward good results with this one. Complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project. Loved it!!
