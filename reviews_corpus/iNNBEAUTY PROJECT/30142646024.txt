This product is a hit or miss in my experience . I’ve seen average results so far - nothing “wow” . Unfortunately somehow at night is comes off - maybe that’s what I’m not getting the results I wished. But I do see minimal results , my skin acne does decrease a little . Complimentary from Innisfree. nan
