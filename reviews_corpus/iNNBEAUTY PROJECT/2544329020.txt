I LOVE that this can be used as both a regular cleanser or the first step of double cleansing! The fact that it can go on dry or wet skin, and still do its job either way, is such a nice aspect of a cleanser. Personally, Iâ€™ve been loving it as the first step of my routine in dry skin to take my makeup off. It really gets everything off and leaves my skin so soft and smooth. nan
