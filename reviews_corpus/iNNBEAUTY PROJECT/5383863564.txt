I was looking in store for a dupe for the sold out Dior lip oil and decided to look online as well. I’m so glad I found this product. Not only does it have better ingredients and half the price, but it’s so hydrating. It gives a flattering sheer wash of color and keeps lips soft. It doesn’t last long, especially with eating/drinking/talking, but my lips still feel good hours later. Berry Hydrating
