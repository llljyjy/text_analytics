So good I love it I mix it with so many things I mix it with my niacinamide moisturizer and mix it with my cream if I don’t have anything else on for that day which usually I do but regardless I always find a way to add this and it’s so good it dries super quick and great price it’s not the best effective vitamin C but it works overtime and I love it I’m on my second bottle nan
