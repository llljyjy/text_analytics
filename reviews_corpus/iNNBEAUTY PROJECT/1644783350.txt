I was super pleasantly surprised by this moisturizer. I’m always very skeptical of trying new skincare products, especially moisturizer, because I am super acne prone but I needed a new lighter weight moisturizer for daytime and under makeup and this fits the bill perfectly and did not break me out! I’ve almost used the whole bottle and I’m going to repurchase. I have dehydrated, acne prone skin for reference. This is lightweight but still moisturizing enough and works great with my makeup products. A little goes a very long way too! nan
