I received this complimentary from InnBeauty Project to test out and review. I really like this cleanser. I think its a good, straightforward formula with lots of soothing and nourishing ingredients. It starts out as a gel, then turns into more of a cream as you start using it, and then finally becomes more of a foam when you add water. It felt very silky on my skin and left my face very soft. I feel like it did a good job as a second cleanser step and Iâ€™m definitely going to be keeping this in my daily routine! Gentle second cleanse!
