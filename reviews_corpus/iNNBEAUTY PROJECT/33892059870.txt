first off i wanna say that i LOVE the inclusion of azelaic acid in this product (pretty much a holy grail ingredient for me, and not altogether that popular as of yet, so kudos to innbeauty project for throwing it in there). acne spots look noticeably less inflamed the morning after i apply this - i don’t find this dries them out by drawing the pimple to a head, more just by helping the natural healing process along. this certainly won’t clear you up overnight, but the spots i apply it to look and feel better the next day. it dries down very quickly, and i haven’t had any problems with it rubbing off on my pillow or anything. good economy too, a tube will last a long time. there is a strong scent, but i don’t mind it, and it fades quickly. not sure if i will repurchase, but i will absolutely finish off the product i have. pretty solid!
