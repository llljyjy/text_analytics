I received this product in exchange for a honest review. I love how foamy this cleanser is! And you can also use it as a first step oil cleanser by using it on dry skin. I’ve tried it that way and it did a really good job taking all of my make up off and it doesn’t have any fragrance! It also didn’t strip my skin so that’s what sold me! I would definitely recommend nan
