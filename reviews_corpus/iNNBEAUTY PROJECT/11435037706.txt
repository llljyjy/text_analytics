I received a retinol remix complimentary fromINNBEAUTY project. The first thing that I liked about the product was the packaging. I never used Retinol before so this was my first time. The product formula is like a thick serum consistency that spreads evenly on my skin. I am using it for the last 10 days and I am already in love with this Vegan Retinol!!! My skin looks healthier and bright. It even out my skin and lighten my dark spots. I will definitely be going to purchase it after using this one.. nan
