The texture of this cream is kind of like a water cream but it has a white texture. It definitely absorbs well and your skin feels somewhat bouncy. But it leaves an oil residue on your hands. It feels really hydrating for dry skin! It also didn’t break me out. However I can’t get over the scent of this product. It’s like glue and doesn’t really go away. I haven’t seen anyone mention it but if you’re sensitive just be aware? I can’t use it for this reason even though I can’t see fragrance in it. I think the ingredients are really nice and if you don’t mind that. Also I need to note the packaging feels a bit cheap when you screw the cap on but it’s okay for me since the material is partially made of recycled plastic! nice but I can’t handle the scent
