Amazing set and a great way to try out all of Innbeauty’s bestsellers! I have tried out each of these products extensively and here’s what I think on each of them. Gel cleanser: 4/5. This is a makeup remover and cleanser all in one. The foaming is a bit too much but it’s still gentle. Green machine: 3/5. I wish I loved this product yet the skincare I apply on top pills when I use this. Slushy: 5/5!! Best product ever. I use this as a serum and apply a moisturizer on top, but you could use this as a moisturizer too if you don’t have dry skin. This gives me that glow that I love. Hydrating, glowy, and smooth! 10+10 moisturizer: 4/5. This is a good moisturizer but I’m not obsessed with it. It’s nice to use but not my favorite. Overall, a great set to try out some products! Definitely pick this up if it is in a store near you. If not, I would recommend purchasing Slushy. Slushy is a new holy grail!
