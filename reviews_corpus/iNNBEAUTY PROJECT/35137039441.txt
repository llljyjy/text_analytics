After a few days of using I’m not 100% sure I like this product. I love the way it initially feels when applied but then when it dries my face feels dry. It’s more jelly than it is oil. I haven’t noticed it help with hyperpigmentation or making my skin look more hydrated. I’m going to keep using it to see but overall nothing at the moment. Gifted by INNBEAUTY Project Not sure yet
