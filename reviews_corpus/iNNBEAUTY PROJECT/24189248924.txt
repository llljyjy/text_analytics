Can I just say that I love these products? The moisturizer makes my skin feel so incredibly hydrated and I love the face glaze. Dewy skin is finally trending and these products help achieve that perfect look. I haven’t been wearing makeup recently, but i can wear it as a primer too when I do wear makeup or occasionally as a highlighter. On it’s own, it is still amazing. I like to mix the face glaze with my tinted spf for a perfect glow! They both apply so smoothly, and make my skin look and feel SO GOOD! Although these products were gifted by INNBEAUTY Project, I couldn’t recommend this more! Love!
