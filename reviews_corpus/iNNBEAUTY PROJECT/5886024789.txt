I’ve only been using this cleanser for a week and I can already tell that it will be the only cleanser I will be using now. Not only is it vegan a cruelty-free but when I first used it I had a huge breakout around my face from the pervious cleanser I tried and from just one wash I could feel the inflammation in my face going down. The next days my skin is almost clear and I’m not in pain. My face also doesn’t like it begging for moisturizing after cleansing. If you have dry, sensitive skin definitely try this out!
