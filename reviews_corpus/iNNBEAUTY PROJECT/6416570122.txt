Adding this product to my daily skincare routine! I’ve tried other vitamin c serums and this one has been one of my faves so far. My skin feels soft and hydrated when I use it, and it looks brighter. After using it for a couple weeks I can see a reduction in hyperpigmentation (leftover from past acne). Definitely a good product for the price and love that it’s clean, vegan and cruelty free. I would absolutely recommend this to a friend and will keep it in my daily routine! Love this product!
