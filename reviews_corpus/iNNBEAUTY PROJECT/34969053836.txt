I received this complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project in exchange for my honest review. I’m a regular retinol user, in varying strengths but I usually use 0.3% Neostrata serum every other night. This was a definite step up! I’ve been using it every 3rd night to start, but have experienced no irritation whatsoever so I’ll be stepping it up to every other night soon. I LOVE the creamy texture of this & that it doesn’t drip, doesn’t have any weird smells, & sinks in quickly. I also love how smooth & youthful it makes my skin! I’m just starting to show signs of aging & loss of elasticity, & I feel like this is already helping with firming & texture. Super excited to have found this one & would recommend. I would say it’s every bit as good as $60-80 retinol serums I have used but for less money. Works on skin texture immediately!
