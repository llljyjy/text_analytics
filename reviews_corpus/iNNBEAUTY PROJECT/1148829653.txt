Innbeauty makes such amazing products!! I have a few staples I use from them and this NEW illuminating eye cream became another favorite!! The texture is like a creamy gel and has a cooling effect as you apply it..it feels super lightweight on but hydrates the eye area wonderfully!! I have been using this for a few weeks now and I can say that it did make my dark circles improve (it looks less dark now)…again, with consistent use this supposed to help brighten & smooth the undereye area to show even better results!! I can’t wait for that! makes eye area look brighter!!
