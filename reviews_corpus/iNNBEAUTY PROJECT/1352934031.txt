This is a great affordable gel cleanser. It’s made with nice hydrating ingredients like ceramides. Can be used as a first or 2nd cleanse. The texture is a clear gel/liquid texture. My skin feels comfortable after washing my skin. I’ve used this as my 2nd cleanse. First cleansing with my oil cleanser followed by this cleanser. My skin does not feel dry or irradiated at all. Def keeping this in my routine as my everyday cleanse. Great affordable cleanser
