this product did such a good job at removing my makeup!!! it just wasn’t as hydrating as I wanted it to be :( I double cleansed my face twice with it because the first time didn’t take off all of my makeup and then my skin started feeling tight so I definitely recommend only washing once with it! i have sensitive skin normally so that also could be why! But I will definitely continue using it because I like the consistency and how well it takes off dirt, oil and makeup. I just wish it was a little more hydrating! nan
