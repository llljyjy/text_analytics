Love the smell and the way this applies to the skin. It’s got this kind of herbal gingery type of smell and you really only need like 1.5 pumps to cover your face in it. I’m not sure if the bakuchiol is doing anything or if there is even enough of it in the formula to do anything, but there is hyaluronic acid in there and that definitely seems to be working to hydrate the skin. They are calling it a “serum moisturizer“ but I use it like I would any other hyaluronic acid treatment/serum and apply moisturizer after this sets a little. nan
