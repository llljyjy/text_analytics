Nothing special about this serum. I used it religiously everyday and did not see a difference. The smell is a bit odd & the texture feels watery almost. I would recommend another vitamin C serum, it may work for others since everyoneâ€™s skin is different so take my opinion with a grain of rice Nothing special or noticeable
