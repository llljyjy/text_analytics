This is such a great deal! If you love skincare and love to have products for on the or traveling or if you just want to try the brand for the first time without committing to full sizes this is definitely a great option. I personally will be gifting a couple of these as it’s a great starter kit for skincare newbies and without all the harsh exfoliants it’s perfect! Of course I have this one for me and I’ll be bringing it in vacation because of the hydration, vitamin C which will be perfect for the tropics. If you’re looking for clean skincare, that’s affordable, works amazing on the skin then you need this! Perfect for newbies to the brand!
