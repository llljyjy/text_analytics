So good! I have combo skin with a tendency to break out and hyperpigment easily.  This serum sinks in so well; I didnâ€™t feel the oils were greasy ever. It also keeps my wintertime flakiness at bay. After a few weeks, my skin looks calmer and more uniform. Post acne marks are fading nicely, and I think it keeps pimples away nicely. Great texture and results
