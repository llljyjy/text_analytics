I like this product. It’s aesthetically pleasing, has a great texture, no scent, and improved the look of my skin. I just feel you should get a bit more for the price, and the results weren’t anything outstanding. My skin felt moisturized and I liked that it set pretty matte. I didn’t necessarily feel “radiant“ or “bouncy“ but the product worked well under makeup and overall I was happy with it. I don’t know if I would switch from my current moisturizer (Neutrogena Hydro Boost) but this is a great backup. INNto It
