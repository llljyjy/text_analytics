I was sent this 10 + 10 More-Sturizer complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project for review purposes. This silky moisturizer contains a 10% Vitamin C complex as well as a 10% peptide complex and ceramides. It feels light and creamy and absorbs well into my skin. It feels incredibly nourishing and moisturizing. My skin looks more hydrated and plump after use. I look forward to seeing my results after using this for a few more weeks but so far I am loving this moisturizer! nan
