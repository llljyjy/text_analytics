i have v sensitive, acne-prone, pale skin and this helped immensely with redness issues/fading lighter acne marks that have stuck around. it has helped reduce irritation from the Epiduo i use too!! i was always scared to invest in a vitamin c serum but this is a gift from god tbh great for sensitive skin <3
