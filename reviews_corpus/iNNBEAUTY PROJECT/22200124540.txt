I really like the consistency and oddly enough, the smell of this product (it smells like a green juice smoothie), but I’ve used it a few times and seem to break out whenever I use it. I want to think my skin may be purging but I think it’s just too harsh/unsuitable for sensitive skin :( I wish this product worked for me
