Firstly, how fun is this packaging?! I love it! This cleanser has a somewhat gel like consistency, is clear and foams up really nicely. It also does a great job at removing makeup! I appreciate that it doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped or dry. A lot of times, foaming cleansers can leave the skin feeling stripped after but this doesn’t. My skin is left feeling clean and fresh! If you want a gentle everyday cleanser, this is worth checking out! It’s made with an amino acid blend to maintain skin hydration, ceramides to strengthen your skins moisture barrier and vegan collagen to hydrate and smooth the skin.I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5 just because I have cleansers that I personally prefer more for my skin. I have acne-prone skin. With that said, it doesn’t cause me to breakout which is great! This is a nice cleanser for anyone that wants a simple everyday cleanser that will cleanse and also help maintain good moisture in the skin. Great Everyday Cleanser
