I absolutely love this moisturizer, especially in these colder winter months. As someone who has always had dry, sensitive skin this has become one of my favorite every day moisturizers. Itâ€™s thick enough to use in the evenings and lightweight enough to wear during the day under makeup. I would definitely recommend this one to anyone who wants a good boost of hydration. Game changer for dry skin!
