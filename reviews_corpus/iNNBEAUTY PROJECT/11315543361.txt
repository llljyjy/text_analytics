I like this. I primarily wear it under my SPF on no makeup or light makeup days. I find it does a beautiful job of brightening the skin, likely the help of the vitamin C and peptides. I used to use a dedicated vitamin C but  it’s been nice to use it packaged with a bunch of other awesome skincare ingredients. You will definitely notice a brightening effect. Sensitive skin approved and I don’t find it pills under makeup. I removed one star cause while it is fragrance free, you WILL smell an acidic vitamin C scent if you leave this on your skin with nothing else- this smell will be noticeable for the duration this is on your skin and does not go away. If you can contend with the acidic scent, this is a really great product. nan
