I am OBSESSED with this. I love it as a primer before my foundation, and even as a highlighter. In my opinion it’s def more a “wet look” kind of glow as a highlighter as opposed to like sparkly… so more of a natural look. As a primer, it looks GORGEOUS and just gives such a pretty glow. I like using matte products a lot because my skin is so oily, but this didn’t make me overly-shiny. It gave a great glow and didn’t make my makeup wear weirdly!! I really recommend. Super versatile product and would look beautiful a lot of ways. I have a medium skin tone and it’s still not too light on me either! YAY I LOVE
