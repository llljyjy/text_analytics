This serum is amazing.I have very sensitive skin on my cheeks and have not been able to use vitamin c as it was too irritating. This product, with all of its skin soothing ingredients does not irritate my skin at all.I have noticed an overall difference in the brightness and clarity of my skin. Normally when I get a pimple the mark hangs around for what seems like forever, but since I’ve started using green machine they seem to fade much faster.The texture feels great and it’s hydrating. If you have oily skin you might be able to get away with using this as your moisturizer. Doesn’t have a weird smell. My only con would be that it’s hard to get all of the product out of the bottle and it might benefit from a pump instead of a dropper.I have already repurchased this serum and plan to do so as soon as I get low. Good for sensitive skin
