I don’t think I’ve ever tried a product before that really and truly did nothing at all, but this one really and truly did nothing. Like at all. I’m actually kind of shocked at the high reviews and now looking back on it, the price, because it was the equivalent of rubbing water on your face. It’s a vitamin C serum that only has 1% vitamin C. I just feel duped. And annoyed that I spent money and time on it because my skin actually got worse as I used it. It’s just so bad. I typically see results with a good vitamin C serum pretty quickly, sometimes even after the first application. I cannot stress this enough, I used this for months and it did nothing. nan
