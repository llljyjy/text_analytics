a fairly good moisturizer that is suitable for dry/combo skin. it doesn’t feel heavy on the skin which is a plus. i haven’t noticed any of the firming/brightening/plumping benefits though. i wish the price point was a little lower too.. don’t think I would repurchase this as my favorite moisturizer contains 80mL and costs less nan
