I recently received this vegan retinol complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project.  First off, I love this packaging!  I love InnBeauty Projectâ€™s packaging because it is so bright & cheery! It has been super effective for my skin, as it has been smoothing the texture that I have been seeing lately on my forehead.  Best of all, this retinol does not have an off putting smell which makes it much more delightful to use!  It is a super light, creamy texture that blends on my skin perfectly & is not tacky at all.  It is incredibly gentle & does not irritate my sensitive, dry skin at all! Love!
