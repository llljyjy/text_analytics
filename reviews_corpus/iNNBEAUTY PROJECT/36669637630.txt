I haven’t been very consistent with using this product but I still feel like I have some decent results. I have been using about 1x a week and my biggest skin issue is my acne scarring and dark spots. I have seen a good improvement to my skin texture and fading of my dark spots. I’m sure if I used more often I would have even better results. I also feel like this product is way less harsh than a regular retinol cream. I will update once I use more consistently. I need to be more consistent
