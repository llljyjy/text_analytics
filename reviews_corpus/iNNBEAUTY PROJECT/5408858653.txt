Gifted by INNBEAUTY Project.  If you know anything about retinol, it can be rough the first few weeks with dryness. But if you stick with it, you’re skin will look so amazing! I feel like this retinol one is milder on the skin and my skin still feels smooth. I’m really enjoying this formula because it has clean ingredients and vegan. The texture of product goes on smooth and feels perfect under my nighttime moisturizer. I can’t wait to see my skin in a month! This is the one!!
