I have extremely sensitive skin that does not react well to sunscreens. I have tried many, many sunscreens (Josie Maran, Beauty of Joseon, Dr. Jart, Fenty Skin, even other Supergoop sunscreens), and they have all left my skin red, irritated, and itchy. This is the only sunscreen I’ve ever used that hasn’t irritated my skin. It has a very unique texture (similar to the Benefit Porefessional) that is very blurring and smoothing, while still being soft and hydrating. It has great packaging and little to no scent (at least that I can smell). Supergoop knocked it out of the park for the sensitive skin folks on this one, and I hope they never reformulate. My tried and true ride or die!
