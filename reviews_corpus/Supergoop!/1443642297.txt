The packaging of this product is cute and sleek, while still making it obvious that it’s a sunscreen product (white bottle, yellow cap). I really liked it overall and plan to continue using it. It gives a nice subtle glow without being too intense like some highlighters. My only issue is that if you accidentally use slightly too much, it can cause some pilling with your moisturizer. It stayed put and did not affect my makeup/foundation at all though. Also make sure you blend it evenly throughout the skin, and check near your jawline and edges of cheeks, because it can be really noticeable if you don’t blend it out. My advice would be to start with less than you think you need and just make sure to blend it quickly before it dries. Really nice but some slight pilling
