This sunscreen is just ok. It works well when I am going out with no makeup on. But, under primer and makeup, it always pills/gets into the creases of my eye lines and makes the makeup chalky. I wish it would layer better, because the Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen formula is incredible, but that product isnâ€™t mineral-based. Good alone; can't be used with makeup
