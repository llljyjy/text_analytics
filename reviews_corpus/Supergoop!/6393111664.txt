I’ve had nothing but positive experiences with this brand and this serum is no exception.  It is an oil but my skin absorbs it immediately and it doesn’t look or feel oily after applying. It dries immediately and is definitely helping my moisturizer keep my skin hydrated and healthy looking. I love that it contains sunscreen protection as well. Ceramides are my favorite ingredient in skincare. I received this product complimentary from Supergoop! Keeps my skin hydrated
