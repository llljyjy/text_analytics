I just repurchased for the fourth or fifth time so I’d say it’s time to give this product a five-star review. When I first started using it, I had about a week of adjustment where my skin was slightly dried out but then it was all golden from there. I get so many compliments on my skin now and it is mainly thanks to this ultra-glowy sunscreen. Probably not suitable for oily skin, but my dry/combo skin adores it. Works great under all kinds of makeup. I have tried the Supergoop invisible sunscreen but much prefer the consistency and feel of this product personally... love her and appreciate her :) My secret weapon :)
