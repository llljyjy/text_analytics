I am obsessed with the play sunscreen… every other sunscreen I’ve ever tried broke me out on my face except this one!! It’s so nice, I can just skip my moisturizer and apply this and I’m good to go! I have dry skin and this is extremely hydrating. It does tend to look a bit greasy but I set it with Laura Mercier translucent powder for like a flawless face. It also works great as a makeup primer. I initially had tried the unseen sunscreen but that pilled with every makeup product. I’m on my second tube of play and it has never caused any issues. My daily go to routine for college is the rare beauty liquid blush + bronzer on top of the sunscreen and setting powder! (Sometimes also a liner/lipstick/mascara) It looks lovely without any foundation/concealer. holy grail finally!
