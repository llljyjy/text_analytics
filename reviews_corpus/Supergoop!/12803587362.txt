Supergoop is a great company I have other products that are mind blowing (like unseen sunscreen) however there is something really wrong with this product. The consistency is bad not like normal creams but weird water. The effect on the skin is also not good. At the beginning it seems ok but at the end of the day my face looks more tired and off than usually. My face doesn’t like this product and I don’t recommend it. I wish I bought their unseen sunscreen instead of this. please don’t buy this
