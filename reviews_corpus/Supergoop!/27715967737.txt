I was thrilled to be gifted this Supergoop Glowscreen SPF 40 in Sunrise in exchange for my honest review. Packed with hyaluronic acid and vitamin B5 this sunscreen not only provides ample sun protection for your skin, but it also does triple duty adding a luminous glow as well as being a lovely primer for your makeup as well. I adore how lightweight and non-greasy this formula is and how it both looks and feel on my skin. The sunrise tint is what I would call a radiant champagne tone and gives the skin the most gorgeous lit from within glow. My skin feels hydrated and protected when I apply the sunscreen alone or under my makeup and wears well throughout the day. It has quite a nice pigmentation, so a little bit goes a long way and once applied it gives the most perfect glowy finish. No white cast or heavy fragrance, I am definitely a fan and excited to use to help protect my skin in the hot Texas sun this summer! Gorgeous GLOW!
