One of my first favorite daily sunscreens was the Dr Jart Every Sun Day Sun Fluid for its ultra lightweight and watery texture and this has such a similar feel! Love that this is a daily sunscreen with spf 50 for maximum protection. So far this has layered easily over all of my skincare and works well under makeup. It blends in really quickly and leaves no white cast- the only downside for me is that it smells heavily like that sunscreen smell. It’s not a deal breaker for me, as long as the fragrance doesn’t make me break out (so far so good). Love the packaging too! Great texture, slight sunscreen scent
