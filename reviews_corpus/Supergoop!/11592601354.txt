for starters I have very dry skin like desert dry skin. I am so confused by this product. it feels very nice going on the skin but I don’t see anyway that you can get the recommended amount of sunscreen (1/4 tsp) onto your face and keep it there. it doesn’t sink in, it moves around and it also turns me into a grease ball. I just don’t get how this works as a solo spf. I think I can work this in as a face oil to mix with makeup but otherwise it’s just a no for me. confused
