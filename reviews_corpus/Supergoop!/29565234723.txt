I received the Supergoop Glowscreen SPF 40 for my honest opinion. I’m extremely happy with this product, I feel like it doesn’t make my face to oily and my makeup goes over it pretty well. Also I don’t swear like crazy after applying like I do other SPF’s. It does give u a glow too tht I like bc it looks like I have highlighter on when I don’t. Great product! Highly recommend Lovely product
