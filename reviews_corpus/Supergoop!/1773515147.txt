I loved the way it made my skin look, but unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to it. It’s probably the octocrylene which is known to be problematic for people with sensitive skin. The smell is also pretty awful, a very strong sunscreen smell. If my skin could tolerate the formula I’d probably suffer through the smell. Here’s to hoping they reformulate it for sensitive skin. Not for sensitive skin
