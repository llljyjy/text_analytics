My complimentary Glowscreen SPF 40 - Sunrise finally came in and not a day too late. It’s finally sunscreen weather and this sunscreen goes on super smooth without that chalky feeling that some sunscreens have. Not sure if it was just the temperature of the room, but the sunscreen was hard to squeeze out initially but did go on without any residue. It feels light enough for those days when the sun hits you hard but works with enough protection so that you don’t have to reapply every hour. It also provides a soft glow right off the bat, making your face look sunkissed. Goop Up: Sunny days ahead
