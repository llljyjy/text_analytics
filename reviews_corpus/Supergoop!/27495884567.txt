Gifted by supergoop but definitely my honest opinion this oil is amazing. I love that not oil itâ€™s an oil but itIncludes spf sunscreen mixed. This oil leaves my face feeling so hydrated after I put it as my last step in my skincare routine. Even tho it has spf so you can use it as a morning oil And be outside with no  worries about sun damage I still like to use this at night and it makes my skin feeling hydrated in the morning. Either way for day or night I would definitely recommend this oil. Really hydrating oil for dry skin
