I’m actually a little surprised to see so much love for this item.  I was hoping to use this for a “no makeup“ look but it’s not what I thought it would be.  1) The shimmer actually makes my skin look really greasy, like immediately turned made my skin look as oily as it gets at the end of the humid summer day.  However, WITH foundation the shine is reduced and creates a nice underglow.  2)  The texture is not the same as the Unseen Sunscreen, which is like a primer.  It’s more liquidy and doesn’t have that softness.  Overall I will finish the bottle but it was not the ultra light coverage “foundation“ I was hoping for.  I may try the bronze version, but as a sample first! Made me look oily
