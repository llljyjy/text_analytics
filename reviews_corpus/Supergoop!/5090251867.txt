I’ve only used this once, but let me say this… Boy, am I impressed!! I HATE sunscreen for my face, everything I’ve tried has dried it out. But this? This made my skin glow, and it was beautiful under my make up. It says it acts as a gripping primer for make up too…. And, that is where this product shines. My boyfriend has a beard and when we kiss, my make up on my chin gets rubbed away with any other primer. Not with this. It stuck on for dear life, and it even stayed on while we ate dinner. I’m so excited to use this every day- and at my age (I’ll be 37 in two months) I know I’ve needed to use sunscreen but could never find one to work until now. I’m going to the Dominican Republic in October and it’ll be so beautiful to use there. Try this out! This review is coming from someone who has very finicky skin that doesn’t like a lot of skincare products. Try this baby out if you have finicky skin!
