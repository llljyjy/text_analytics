This is my go-to tinted moisturizer with spf. I’ve been using it for years, and while I’ve occasionally tried other new products, I keep coming back to it. Depending on the season, I sometimes need to lightly moisturize before applying or I get some dry spots. It’s the perfect light coverage for me that lasts all day and keeps a natural matte finish. Be sure you shake it up before applying- it should be a soft, whipped texture. nan
