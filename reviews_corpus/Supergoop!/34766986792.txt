I hate this product. Itâ€™s super greasy and the texture feels disgusting on my skin. I have combo skin that leans on the drier side. Waste of money. Instead buy a cheaper sunscreen with no shimmer or shine and use a makeup product that adds a nice glow to the face like Mac strobe cream or CT hollywood glow. nan
