This is so sad because I love this brand but this sunscreen gave me so much acne, it’s insane. I’ve been on curology for two years, my skin has been flawless since I started. I used this sunscreen for almost three weeks and my face literally hurt from the acne. As soon as I stopped using it my acne cleared and now my skin looks good again. That was also the only new product I added to my routine so it couldn’t have been anything else. Too sad nan
