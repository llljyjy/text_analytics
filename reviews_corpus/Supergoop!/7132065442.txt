This is my FAVORITE sunscreen I have ever tried. It blends in really well. It is very hydrating where after you apply it gives your skin a glow that still moisturizes the skin. The tinted version of this for the face is good so you donâ€™t get a white cast on your skin which some white sunscreens will give you. This sunscreen has really good ingredients in it that while wearing it it will improve your skin while helping to protect your skin from the sun! It is also really good under makeup as well, it give you a natural glow. Definitely recommend
