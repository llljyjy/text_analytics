Really easy to apply! There was Snow White cast from the sunscreen. The formulation was thin but also gave me good coverage. Extremely light weight and was very easy to incorporate into my skin. This is my first time trying sunscreens from the brand, so Iâ€™m really excited to see its effect as I build it into my routine. This was complimentary from Supergoop. Hydrating and good coverage
