I have pale freckly skin, I also live in Sydney Australia most of the time where the sun is incredibly harsh and I work outdoors as a landscape designer. This sunscreen is everything. I have very sensitive skin, especially my eyes and this goes on perfectly and doesnt make me have a reaction. So light, and a wonderful scent. Very hydrating. If im going out for the day and dressing up + going to be in the sun I combine this with a little of the the Supergoop Glow Screen and a few drops of the Drunk Elephant bronzing drops and my skin looks amazing, donâ€™t even need foundation over the top, just a bit of mascara and lip colour. Highly recommend this product to anyone, especially those new to suncare products. Very versatile and non-irritating. Now I just need Supergoop to be available in Sydney!!! Incredible! and I am a fussy sunscreen user.
