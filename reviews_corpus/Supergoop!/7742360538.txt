More like a 3.5. Goes on easily and smoothly. It’s almost soothing. I also don’t notice any white cast which is awesome! Not crazy about the scent but I don’t actually find it that intense so not a big deal (to me). Packaging is meh. It’s cute but hard to control how much product is dispensed and I can see it being difficult to get the last bits of product out. My main concern though is how the sunscreen looks and feels after application. It’s beyond a glowy or dewy look - it looks greasy and given that summer is approaching, I’m apprehensive about wearing this when I know I’m going to be sweating a lot. Goes on nicely but looks and feels greasy
