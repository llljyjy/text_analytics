Silly me.  The size of the bottle made me think it would be mostly full…or at least half full!  Only 30ml for almost $50!  If you applied the 1/2 teaspoon amount needed for face and neck to get an SPF of 40, the 30mls of product in this bottle will last you about 12 days.  The instructions say to apply 6-8 drops (nowhere near enough to get any serious SPF) and to layer with other sunscreens. So really, this is NOT a sunscreen.  It’s a facial treatment oil that just happens to have SPF.  Likely I would not have purchased if I hadn’t been in too much of a rush to read the label.  I like most of the brand, and made the assumption that it was one of their sunscreens in a lovely oil base.  And it is very nice. Apply, let it set for 15 to 30 min, and apply foundation - it gives a nice glow without looking greasy, and my makeup never looks dull or dry. Too bad it’s such a small amount for the price, I would probably buy it again and again.  As is, I won’t repurchase. Misleading bottle size, only 30mls in it
