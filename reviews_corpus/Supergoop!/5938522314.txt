This product was gifted by Supergoop. I appreciated the fact that this product makes it easy to top up on your SPF throughout the day, even over makeup! However, I did feel that it was hard not to get product in/around the eyes and as we know SPF really stings. I think this is a cute product to toss in my bag on the go but I don’t think I’d repurchase it. nan
