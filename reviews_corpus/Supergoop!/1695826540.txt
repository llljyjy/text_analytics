I know how important it is to apply (and reapply) SPF on a daily basis, but when you can’t find one that works for you it becomes a dreaded task! This new one from Supergoop is amazing! I love that it is spf 50, has a runnier consistency for easier application and absorption! My only complaint is it does leave me looking a little greasy. I have yet to try under makeup so I can’t really speak to how that would work, but I have high hopes! Applying my spf daily won’t be such a chore now!! Love it so much already *gifted by Supergoop! nan
