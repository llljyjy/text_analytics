This sunscreen has a unique spf — 40 to be exact. I do aim to use sunscreen that I at least spf 30 so this fits the bill. This one is perfect for ‘no makeup’ makeup or alone without makeup because it actually gives your skin a nice glow. I would prefer that the moisturizing and glow effects be longer lasting but my skin looks bomb right after using this. The benefit of having a glow effect is that the sunscreen is not white and therefore doesn’t give a white cast and blends into the skin easily. I actually really liked it and see myself using it over and over especially for summer. nan
