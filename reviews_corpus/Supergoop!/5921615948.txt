I can’t say enough good about this! I used it on my first day of the summer out on the boat and I was out ALL DAY. I had ZERO sunburn the next day and I only had to reapply once. I alway get a burn the first day I’m out during the summer so this was a big win for me.  It left my skin feeling soft and not that sticky sunscreen feel. I will be using this every time I’m in the sun! nan
