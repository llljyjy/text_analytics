This was gifted by Supergoop!.Iâ€™m a big fan of the Supergoop brand! and I use several different products from them and I had never tried this one before. As always, I loved it. I had no doubts about it.My skin is very dry, especially in winter, like now. With this product my skin is always soft and hydrated, but not sticky. The product absorbs very quickly and I can wear makeup perfectly right after applying the product.  I highly recommend. nan
