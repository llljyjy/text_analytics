I got the product as a gift and really enjoyed it (gifted by Supergoop). This is an oil, but it’s not too heavy or sticky. It’s not dry oil either, it has very nice consistency: easy to apply as it distributes well, but not too oily that I have my hair sticking to my face afterwards. I also like that it makes my skin quite smooth. It contains chemical physical sunscreen, but it does the job and doesn’t irritate my skin. Will definitely keep using it! Easy to use
