I was super excited to try this sunscreen since it sounds so cool with all these good ingredients and protection of your skin from sunshine and enjoy the glowing. Tried it immediately when I got it. I have to say it’s a little disappointed. The sunscreen made my skin “unbreathable”. And the glowing part will make your skin looks so weird and oily. More like you put an oily highlighter all over you skin. nan
