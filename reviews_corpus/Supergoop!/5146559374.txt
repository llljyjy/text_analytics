Okay so far I’ve had it on my face for two hours, and haven’t gotten greasy. It holds up well and doesn’t leave a cast. So far great product. The only thing I don’t like,  is that the product comes out very aggressive. I don’t know if mine is messed up, but it doesn’t spray out like usual setting spray. It like hits my face hard. And does indeed smell like SPF (go figure haha). But so far I really like this product. Easy to apply your spf!Gifted by supergoop nan
