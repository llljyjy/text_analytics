i love this! i would say it’s a very good skincare/make-up hybrid but doesn’t really work as an spf. i got it in the shade golden hour which on my fitz skin type iv adds a subtle tan & does a good job at evening out my skin tone even though the coverage is very light! this works perfect as a skin tint & the glow is out of this world. as an spf, using the proper 1/4 tsp amount, this would be waaay too much & you’d end up looking like the tin man. i prefer to use a pea sized amount on top of another proper layer of a different sunscreen to add that lit from within glow. overall though it’s a 10/10! good skincare/makeup hybrid, spf is bonus
