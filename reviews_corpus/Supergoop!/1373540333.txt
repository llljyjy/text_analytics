I love how lightweight and easy to apply this is. It makes my skin look glowy and dewy when I’m not wearing makeup so definitely great for makeup free days. I’ve tried it a few times when wearing makeup though and I haven’t like how it does under makeup. It could definitely be the foundation I’m wearing over it, but whenever I use this is lands up separating. I will definitely keep it for days I am not wearing any makeup, but I was bummed because I thought it do better with it. Gifted by Supergoop! nan
