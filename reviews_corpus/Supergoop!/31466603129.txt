The Supergoop! Glow Screen SPF 40 sunscreen was incredible. As a person of color, I have been looking for a sunscreen that does not leave a white cast on the skin. The Supergoop! provides nice protection from harsh UV rays without leaving excess sunscreen on the face. The Glow Screen part was incredible. It provided a nice highlight effect to my skin without making me look oily. The Supergoop! is also a great addition to my skincare routine before make up. It provides a nice glow to my skin and gives extra protection. Loved it!
