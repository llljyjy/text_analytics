This is my first time using an SPF Oil. This is basically a dream product for those of us with dry skin. The oil is thin and absorbs very quickly into the skin. Doesnâ€™t have any particular scent to it. It feels quite smooth after absorption so good for makeup application as well. This product is gifted by SuperGoop to me. Great SPF lightweight oil
