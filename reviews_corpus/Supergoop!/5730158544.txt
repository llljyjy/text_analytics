Really good sunscreen that feels light and hydrating on the face. It has a matte finish which I love for the summer. It also works really well as a makeup primer because of the texture and consistency. I only take 1 star off because itâ€™s expensive for so little product. I prefer to buy the Play given the size options and because for winter, it gives a super dewy finish. Good overall sunscreen
