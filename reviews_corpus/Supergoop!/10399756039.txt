I was so excited by the concept, could not have been more let down. Not only was it an intense stream even holding the bottle as far away as I could, but it was outrageously greasy. I didn’t think I’d gotten it in my hair, but it looked like I hadn’t washed my hair in days (right after a shower). I tried setting it with powder anyway, just to see, even though it’s supposed to BE a setting product. Well, even with powder, my face turned into a complete grease ball after as little as two hours mostly indoors. My face makeup was completely sliding around on my face, and when I tried to gently blot away some of the intense grease, it just came completely off. I don’t understand how they call it a “setting“ mist- for me it acted more like a makeup remover. I really don’t understand how it has so many positive reviews, because I can’t imagine this product working well for anyone. I have seen some comments/reviews saying that people having issues should shake it more, but I shook the bottle vigorously for at least 10 seconds. I really feel like I gave this product more than enough chance at success and it still majorly disappointed. Try anything else- NOT worth it.
