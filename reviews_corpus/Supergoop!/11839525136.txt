I had my hopes up for this eye cream since I have been using the Supergoop Unsean for years and love it. This eye cream is thick and oily. They advertise it for all skin types but in fact it should be for dry skins. I would have returned it if Sephora didnâ€™t throw it away. Instead I use translucent powder and treat it like a concealer, although it would not replace any concealer cause the coverage is very minimal. I would buy again ONLY IF they change the formula to a light weight cream. It's thick and oily
