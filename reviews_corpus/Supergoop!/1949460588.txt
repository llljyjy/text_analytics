I love the feel of this on my skin, doesn’t feel heavy or greasy and I haven’t experienced and pilling. It works okay but even reapplying regularly I get sunburnt and I burn very rarely. I think this would be a great product when the UV index is below 6 but on those higher UV days is just not strong enough for me to protect my skin effectively. Possibly better on lower UV index days
