I am a huge fan of serum like SPFs, this one has a mild tint to it but blends well. I didn’t notice any scent, and the finish was a little on the shiny side but not terrible. Packaging is cute but a little big for 30 ml product. Love that it has Bioretjnol because who doesn’t need retinol at my age?! No whitecast
