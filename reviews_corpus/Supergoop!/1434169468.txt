Iâ€™ve been using this sunscreen on my young freckle prone daughters for years and it is the best! It is so easy to apply, makes their beautiful little faces glow so it is easy to tell where it was applied, and requires no rubbing in or blending. A superior option for little ones! It also works well on their shoulders and I use it for a quick swipe on a no make up day for myself, but do find it to be very shiny on my skin. It causes too much slip under make up for me but for my three daughters aged 7, 5 and 5 this is a must have! Great for kids!
