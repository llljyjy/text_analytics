Really wanted to love this sunscreen because of the price, but it just didn’t work for me. I have light tan complexion it leaves a pretty harsh white cast on me. I don’t think the white cast is as noticeable in natural light/light with more of an orange tint, but under i definitely look pretty washed/ghostly when I use the recommended 2 fingers length amount. Again, some of this white cast does go away, but would recommend for people with a deeper complexion. It also has a thick consistency so you have to take some time to work it in to the skin. That being said, I do like the feel of it, I think it protects well, and when I sweat it doesn’t irritate my eyes. Works great for neck and chest so I will keep using it for these areas!P.S.: Make sure you cleanse and moisture your face well or when you apply mineral sunscreen it will highlight all the un-exfoliated skin. White cast on face, but great at body sunscreen
