I have some mixed feeling about the glowscreen. Overall I do like it because I think it’s a unique product, but the tint is a little bit tricky for me because it’s more orange than my pale skin tone. I see that they recently came out with a deeper shade so maybe they will expand their shade range further in the future. It is VERY glowy which I can’t really dock points for since it’s in the name, but I wouldn’t buy it unless you want something pretty intense. It also smells like sunscreen which I don’t mind but I know a lot of people hate. Good for a specific type of person
