I received this complimentary from Supergoop! I love this!! I always apply SPF before my makeup or just on it’s own when going out but this is amazing for on the go touch ups once the initial spf has worn off! It doesn’t effect the wear time of my makeup either! I put it to the test in 80-90 degree weather with a full face of makeup on and working (I’m on my feet and moving constantly & I have oily skin so my makeup gets put through a vigorous testing for longevity) I LOVE THIS!!!
