This was my first supergoop product and I really did not enjoy this sunscreen. For one this is a mineral sunscreen so it leaves a white cast which was expected, but this sunscreens smells so strong it was hard to want to keep it on my face. I have acne prone skin and this sunscreen made me breakout. I tried to like it and work with it but I just looked like a white ghost with bad texture. nan
