This is my first Supergoop product! First off the bottle is so light I was afraid there was nothing in there. Then I saw the color I was little afraid it wasn’t going to blend with my skin tone. I’m quite impressed it blended nicely ! I will say if you have dry skin you may want to pair it with something a little more hydrating. Also, you will want to pair it with another sunscreen because 6 drops isn’t enough coverage nan
