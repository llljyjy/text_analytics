Just finished this up. It’s a good sunscreen but I wasn’t too crazy about the silicone texture. It feels like a primer but do not use too much or it will feel heavy. I don’t notice my makeup looking particularly better when I use this underneath since it doubles up as a primer. I much prefer the Glow Screen from the same Supergoop line . It looks amazing on its own and underneath as a primer nan
