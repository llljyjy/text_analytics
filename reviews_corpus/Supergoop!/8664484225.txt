Amazing. I have medium toned, combo, SUPER sensitive skin and this covers all my bases. Doesn’t leave my skin looking ashy bc it’s completely clear, doesn’t make my t zone oily, and most importantly doesn’t irritate my skin at all. It feels weightless, like you have nothing on. Also, it’s great under makeup as a primer, the only thing I can compare it to is the milk makeup primer or the elf silicone primers! Definitely a good buy especially if you’re tired of sunscreen not blending into darker skin! the hype is REAL
