Supergoop gifted me their new Ever.Single.Face Watery Lotion, and wow it feels so light & creamy on my face! Leaves a bit of a nice hydrated look too. Very comfortable to wear, not heavy at all! It works nicely with or without makeup & I don’t have any pilling so far with other skincare products. It does have the sunscreen scent, which I love as it reminds me of summer! An Spf 50 that protects for UVA & UVB as well as blue light & pollution. I’m quite loving this one! So light & creamy!
