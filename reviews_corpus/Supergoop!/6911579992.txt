I was a little worried reading the reviews that this would be heavy on my skin during the spring and summer months. A little goes a long way, so Iâ€™m wondering if others were putting too much on. It feels great, and is non greasy. Just give it a minute and it soaks into your skin. Perfect moisturizer/sunscreen combo
