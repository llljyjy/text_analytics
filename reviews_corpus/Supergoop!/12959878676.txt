I wanted to like it - it feels cool and disappears instantly - not thick like other sunscreens. However, I don’t think it works very well... my face got burned twice while wearing it. Perhaps you have to reapply much more frequently than other sunscreens, but that’s not so convenient for me. For the high price, I don’t think I’ll purchase again. nan
