I bought this sunscreen to use everyday. I started to notice sun spots on my face maybe 8 years ago and it was advised I wear sunscreen daily. The active ingredients to look for are Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. This sunscreen does not have these active ingredients, they are inactive. This did not provide the protection that I needed. I am choosing another option that goes on more milky white and be a better protection for my skin. Not for fair skin
