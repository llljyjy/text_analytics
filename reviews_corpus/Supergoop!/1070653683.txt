I rarely take pictures of myself, took a selfie w/ my son on vacation and was shocked at the amount of freckles I have now. Need a sunscreen I can put near my eyes. This is the perfect product. Light, not shimmery or matte definitely has a natural glow finish. I actually repurchased this item and can tell you the first pump is so light and creamy! The last pump is a little dried out. Which is sad since itâ€™s in an airless pump. A little expensive but the other face sunscreens from this brand sting the eyes. Probably intentionally. Wish I had this formula for the whole face! A rare repurchased item
