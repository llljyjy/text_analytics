my three factors when choosing a sunscreen is that it has to be 1) noncomedogenic 2) SPF 40+ and 3) mineral. this passes all three, but i found myself just not loving this product. the texture is fine and i always apply two fingers lengths of product. it has a slight tint and i wouldn’t recommend for extremely pale skin because it may make you look a little orange. it has no scent to it which i like. the reason i will likely not be repurchasing is because it leaves my skin feeling drier than i’d like it to. i wish more matte sunscreens just made the skin matte without drying it out :( even with my moisturizer under, i still feel like it just sucks all the hydration out of my skin. going to be trying the sheer screen next and see if i like it better! not my favorite but does the job
