I was so excited to try this out because I am a daily spf wearer and I absolutely love supergoop ! This did not disappoint at all. I love that not only is this formula very good for sensitive skin because it’s not greasy , but it doesn’t white cast either which is awesome . The inclusion of skincare is such a nice touch as well because you can really ensure that you are taking good care of your anti-aging routine all day . The plant based formula is great because you don’t need to worry about photosensitivity . Amazing formula !
