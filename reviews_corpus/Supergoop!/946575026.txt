Gifted by Supergoop!  The rule is to reapply sunscreen every 2 hours and this helps you do this without ruining your makeup.  I love how it’s a setting spray as well.  The scent initially threw me off, but it quickly fades.  It has somewhat of a medicinal smell in my opinion.  That’s the only thing I would change.  I love it and can’t wait to use it all summer long!!! Love!
