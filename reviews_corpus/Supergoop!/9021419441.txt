Supergoop is my go-to daily sunscreen so when I saw these drops I was soo excited to try them. This sunscreen blends right into my skin and I love the way my skin feels after applying. The ONLY thing I would change (and this is me being high maintenance) is maybe having the product in a nicer container because the plastic is kinda flimsy. BUT, this product is amazing and I will be repurchasing. LOVEE <3
