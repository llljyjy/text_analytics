I recently tried Supergoop! Daily Dose Bioretinol + 100% Mineral SPF 40 and I am extremely happy with the results. The product is a lightweight, non-greasy sunscreen that easily absorbs into the skin. It provides excellent protection against UVA and UVB rays, and I love that it contains Bioretinol, a powerful anti-aging ingredient that helps to smooth and firm the skin.One of the things I appreciate most about this product is that it is made with 100% mineral sunscreen, which is more gentle on the skin compared to chemical sunscreens. It is also reef-safe, which is important to me as I try to be environmentally conscious in my beauty routine.I have sensitive skin and I have had no issues with this sunscreen. It does not cause any irritation or breakouts, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. The formula is also fragrance-free, which is a big plus for me as fragranced products can often be irritating to my skin.Overall, I highly recommend Supergoop! Daily Dose Bioretinol + 100% Mineral SPF 40. It is a high-quality sunscreen that provides excellent protection and skincare benefits, and it is suitable for all skin types. It is worth the investment and I will definitely be repurchasing in the future. Daily Dose of Sunscreen!
