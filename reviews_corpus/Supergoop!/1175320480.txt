I’ve been using this for about 3 years now. After trying many different sunscreens (Korean brands,  high end & drugstore brands) this has become my holy grail sun screen. It doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin and doesn’t irritate my face (my skin is acne prone). Plus it’s 2-in-1 product, and works great as a primer for makeup. I’ll be buying this for a long time. Glad they came out with a larger size. My holy grail sun screen
