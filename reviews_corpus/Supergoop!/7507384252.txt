I bought the mineral trial size kit. I’ve been in search of a mineral sunscreen that a) didn’t irritate my skin and b) was easier to blend in/not leave a terrible caked on white cast that required me to put makeup over it to look like a human again. My face is all of a sudden mega sensitive to sunscreens and several that are high end mineral ones irritated it so much it itched and burned for days even after patch testing for a week. So I’m on day 3 of my patch testing now,wearing it on my forehead and half of my face and so far, no irritation! I love the application. Yes, it leaves a white/bluish cast for a minute as you put it on but it is minimal in comparison to most other mineral sunscreens. Also,it is easy to blend in and does not feel heavy. I’m going to push on with my 5-7 day of patch testing before I purchase full size but I have high hopes. I have not noticed the smell of it at all yet, makes me wonder if some people are getting older product that’s starting to go bad, same with those who say it pills on them significantly. So far no pilling, but I have not put makeup over it as that was my first goal. SPF to throw on and walk the dog without a full face of makeup in 90 degree humid summer weather. so far aMAZing
