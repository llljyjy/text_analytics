I’ve always wanted to try the Supergoop Glowscreen SPF 40 - Sunrise because I’ve only heard great things about the product! I love how smooth the sunscreen is, and it also feels great on my skin. It’s not too thick and oily, which I love about it, so I can’t wait to use the sunscreen more this summer! loving!
