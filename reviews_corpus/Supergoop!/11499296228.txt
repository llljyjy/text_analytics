This is a decent spf spray. It’s dries down quickly. I have to be careful around my eyes since this is a chemical spray when spraying on my face. It has a sunscreen scent to it. My biggest critique is that the sprayer really shoots out at you. I wish it had a finer mist. Overall, it’s just okay. Gifted by supergoop. It’s okay
