I have oily skin so I am always hesitant when looking at a setting spray but spf is so important especially as the temperature is rising. I love that this bottle is small enough to fit in my bag and large enough where its a good size. I plan to use this for beach days instead of on a make up day. (gifted by supergoop!) nan
