I was so excited to use this for my sunscreen reapplication. As much as I love the unseen sunscreen, this was a total fail. The stick lifted my whole makeup and smeared all over my face. I could see streaks whenever  the stick touched my skin. My face looked like I used a cleansing balm to remove my makeup when I used this stick. I tried it on without makeup, I looked like a grease ball. Going back to my good oldie shiseido stick spf. nan
