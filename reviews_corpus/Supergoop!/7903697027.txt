I loved this setting spray and sunscreen gifted by supergoop!! It was always annoying to me that I couldnâ€™t reapply sunscreen during the day or if I did it felt really oily or left cast. This was clear and light, love it and would buy it in the future to add ease to my makeup and skin care routine. In love with this / will be adding to my routine.
