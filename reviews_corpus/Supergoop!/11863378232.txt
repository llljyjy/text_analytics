This is my new holy grail loose powder!!! I can’t review it as a sunscreen because I always use it over a liquid sunscreen or SPF foundation, but I am in love with this powder. It’s so light and so fine - doesn’t look cakey at all and sets my whole face of makeup without sinking into my fine lines or sitting on top of my foundation/concealer. I’ve tried SO many powders - Laura Mercier, Wander, every Bare Minerals, Charlotte Tilbury, Cover FX - vainly searching for something that would set under my eyes without enhancing the texture of my skin, and this is finally it. It also doesn’t get oily after multiple hours of wear like the Bare Minerals original does. I have combination skin and this truly gives my skin a natural airbrushed look in the best way. I also love that it’s self contained so I can throw it in my bag and reapply if/when needed. I have combination skin and wear this over liquid foundation (It CC+), cream blush and bronzer (Milk), and concealer (Fenty Pro Filt’r for highlight and Lancome Teint Idole for coverage). My new favorite loose powder!
