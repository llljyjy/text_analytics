This is a very light weight sunscreen which I like. It has no white cast but as someone with combination skin it does give a glow to the skin I’ve worn it a couple of times and my skin looks glowy but not greasy. So far I’m okay with it but I don’t know how it will wear in the summer time as my skin sweats a lot. nan
