This is by far my favorite fluid SPF, Supergoop has impressed me once again with their SPFS!! The fluid is slightly tinted so I know when it’s completely rubbed in and it absorbs quickly and easily into my skin. I have absolutely no pilling when I apply makeup over this, and I typically have pilling with other mineral SPFs. My skin looks so smooth and glowy after applying, I’m excited to see the long term results! Best fluid SPF ever!
