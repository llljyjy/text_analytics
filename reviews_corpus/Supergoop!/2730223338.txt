I really wanted to find an easier way to reapply my sunscreen during the day while making sure my make up stays great. I bought the mini one to try it out first. This product is an absolute FLOP!!! Instead of resetting my face it more so MELTED ALLLLLLL my makeup OFF. I had to go home immediately and wash my face and redo my whole look. I love supergoop products. But this is an absolute NO for me. Itâ€™s a NO for me
