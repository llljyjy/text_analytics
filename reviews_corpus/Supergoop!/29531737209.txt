I received this product complimentary from Supergoop for an honest review. I really like this SPF! I have used other Supergoop products and liked them and this one is just as good, if not better. It has a more watery consistency which is nice, it doesn’t feel thick and greasy at all like other SPF can. It feels light on my skin and I didn’t notice a white cast (I have light/medium skin tone). It wore really well under my makeup and on its own! Definitely keeping this is my SPF rotation! Love
