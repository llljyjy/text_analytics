I am happy with this product! I have never used Supergoop before, so this was a great introduction! It’s very light and goes over my makeup pretty effortlessly, it didn’t negatively effect my makeup at all. It is scented with a minty smell but I can definitely smell the sunscreen in it. It isn’t a bad smell but it is strong in my opinion. I’ll definitely be using it during the day! This was gifted by Supergoop! Refreshing Spray but fragrant!
