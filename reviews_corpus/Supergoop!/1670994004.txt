I was really excited to try a product they I can reapply sunscreen without having to reapply makeup. I’m oily so reapplying a powder sunscreen wasn’t my favorite way to reapply. I really like this product because it doesn’t mess up my makeup and it doesn’t leave any residue. Super easy and convenient to reapply! I was gifted by Supergoop! Easy way to reapply sunscreen!
