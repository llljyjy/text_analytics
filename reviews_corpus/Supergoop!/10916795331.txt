This is by far the best sunscreen I’ve ever tried. It’s super lightweight and moisturizing, doesn’t leave a white cast, and it works awesome as a primer AND highlighter! I normally hate most sunscreens I try, mostly because they leave a white cast and leave my already dry skin even more dry. This is the exact opposite and made me love wearing sunscreen because of how soft and glowy it leaves my skin. I cannot recommend it enough, it’s everything I could’ve asked for as a sunscreen! Use for soft, glowy, sun-protected skin!
