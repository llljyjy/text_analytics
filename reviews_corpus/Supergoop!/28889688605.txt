It helps my skin feel great, and it doesn’t pill like my other skincare products do. The only drawback is the overpowering odor. It doesn’t have an unpleasant odor, but it’s really powerful, similar to their spray sunscreen, and it’s a lot when you’re putting it on your face. But I have to tell, the sensation on my skin makes it easier to ignore the odor. It also gives off a soft glow. Gifted by Supergoop Glow
