[Sunscreen Review] Supergoop! Every. Single. Face. Watery Lotion SPF 50 PA++++ #complimentaryfromsupergoop~ I want to start this review saying that I’m honored to try this new product out and for the ability to promote a product made for everyone. This is a brand NEW sunscreen and is the first sunscreen I’ve ever tried from Supergoop! so it was a huge deal to me! Here’s what I thought…~ Star Ingredients: Alcohol, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Tremella Mushroom Extract, & Apple Fruit Extract~ Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA++++~ SPF Filters: Avobenzone 3%, Homosalate 9%, Octisalate 5%, & Octocrylene 9%~ Zero Whitecast~ Water & Sweat Resistant up to 40 Minutes~ INCI List: This has a simple & expected INCI list. The alcohol is quite high up on the INCI list, but I have to say that I didn’t notice it at all and wouldn’t have noticed if I didn’t read the INCI list. This is so moisturizing from the other ingredients in here and the formulation as a whole that I have absolutely no worry about the alcohol.~ Price: $36 [$0.72 per ml]	~ Texture: Lotion~ Finish: Dewy to Greasy~ Scent: Alcohol to Floral~ Size: 50ml~ My Usage: Mornings as last step~ Rating: 3.5/5~ Experience: This is an amazing sunscreen, but it has a dewy finish which I hard for me to get around. For someone that has oily/combo skin here in Hawaii it’s hard not to notice the greasy glow that this sunscreen gives me. For that reason, I absolutely need to powder this which isn’t a problem and results which me having an inner glow that I like.~ Final Conclusion: I would recommend this for those with dry skin because it’s ultra moisturizing and leaves a nice radiant finish to the skin.~ Recommended for: Sensitive, Combo, Dry Skin Types Great for dry or dehydrated skin!
