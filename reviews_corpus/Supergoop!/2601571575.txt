Love this product! I use it after all of my skincare but before I apply my makeup. It has a slight hint so it works as a great primer before I apply foundation. It has a glow about it but isn’t full of glitter and provides the tiniest bit of coverage so if you didn’t want to apply makeup, this would still look nice! Glowy without glitter or grease
