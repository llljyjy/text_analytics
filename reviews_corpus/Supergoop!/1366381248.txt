I accidentally purchase Golden Hour and am so glad I did because it brighten up my face to match my summer tanned skin. Originally was using a different non tinted mineral sunscreen that made my face more white. Glad I gave this a shot because I really like it and it blends so easily!!! Summer Glow- matches my tanned skin!
