The watery lotion name is misleading. I have combo skin, but I love a good glow. This is oily feeling, and after it’s applied I want to remove it due to the heavy, greasy feeling it leaves in my skin. I also suspect this sunscreen is breaking me out a bit. I will probably return. 2 stars for the SPF 50 and didn’t leave a white cast. Should be named oily lotion, not watery
