I love this moisturizer! I’ve recently started using tretinoin in my skincare routine and it requires lots of spf and hydration and this moisturizer delivers! It can leave your skin looking a bit shiny or greasy but I just dab it a little with a napkin and I’m good to go! I would recommend this for dry skin. Amazing!
