The powder itself is really nice and a great way to add spf throughout the day. The packaging leaves a lot to be desired. The brush doesn’t distribute well or evenly. It would be better as a separate brush and loose or pressed powder. I’d recommend buying the refills from the Supergoop website and filling your own pot. nan
