Gifted by Supergoop. I am always on the look out for good sunscreen and this one checks off most of the boxes. I like that it was SPF 50 as I am very fair skinned. I found that due to it being a watery lotion it was easier to spread then some other high end sunscreen. The only downside to me is it made my face feel a bit oily but that happens to me with most sunscreen. nan
