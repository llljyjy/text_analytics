My new favorite spf. I just wish it were a 50 but I haven’t had any sunburn so 40 must get the job done. I have skin prone to dryness. I’ve used Prescription Tretinoin for many years now and it has that affect. I love that this sunscreen replaced any moisturizer I had to use for day so it lightens the load and amount of products I had to use. It’s a light layer that packs a punch with continuous hydration. Now I use a serum (Lauder Advanced Night Repair, and eye serum, an eye moisturizer and then this on top. It is perfect and I hope they never stop making it. I don’t need primers under makeup if I wear it. It moisturizes and keeps my skin feeling comfortable all day. Have not have any issues with breakouts. The scent is light and reminds me of soft honey. It dissipates quickly and I never notice again once I’ve applied. It’s gentle enough that I’ve had zero issues with it stinging or burning my eyes. Now that I think about it I haven’t had any burning when I rub my eyes. I don’t know that this would be ideal for anyone with normal or normal to combo and oily skin. Maybe in the winter for normal. But if you have truly dry skin ( mine is also sensitive and prone to redness) this is the one. For my neck and chest I use Super Goop Play. It’s a 50 SPF and is working out great. I also use that one on shoulders and arms as needed. Love this line. excellent for dry sensitive skin (retinol users)
