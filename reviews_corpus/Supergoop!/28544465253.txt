I really like this sunscreen because it doesn’t leave any residue, is light weight and leaves a flawless finish but it made me break out really bad. My skin was clearing up but after using this sunscreen for the first time, my skin started to break out like crazy on my face I typically don’t have acne. Will still continue to see how it is on my skin overtime because it is on the more pricey side and I wouldn’t want this to go to waste! Try at your own risk
