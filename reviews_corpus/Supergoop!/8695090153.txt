I love a dewy finish sunscreen so this was not a disappointment. If you donâ€™t like a glowy finish, this is not for you, so beware. But I did find it pilled on me the first time using it yesterday, but I tried 2 smaller applications/layers & it fixed the issue! This shade in particular is more bronzey so if you have fair skin or a deep tone, probably not a good option. I am naturally tan & I found it only enhanced it & made me look nice & bronzey. I am a fan! Glowy Protection!
