Awful! I SO wanted to love this product, but it is a massive letdown. I vigorously shook the canister for 30 seconds, applied it 10ish inches away from my face, and it looks like I just sprayed my face with cooking oil or baby oil. I even tried using a hairdryer to dry it down but it didn’t work. It’s been over an hour since I applied it and my mascara (which is waterproof and usually never comes off!) is transferring everywhere and I look just as greasy as I did when I first applied it. I blotted my face with a napkin and like 80% more of my foundation came off than it usually would. The transfer is CRAZY. Bottom line: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. It doesn’t give you a healthy “glow” or make you look “dewy”—it’s straight up greasy. The worst part, IMO, is that you can’t save your makeup after you’ve defiled it with this product. Powder doesn’t help AT ALL. If you’re going to buy this product anyway just to try it, do so at home when you’re not planning on going anywhere, because it will 100% RUIIIINNN your makeup. Unbelievably greasy and unforgiving
