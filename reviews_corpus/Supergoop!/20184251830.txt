I liked it! I have combination skin around my t zone and don’t mind the glowy look, but someone with oily skin or doesn’t like that look may not enjoy this sunscreen. When you reapply it def feels a little greasy at first, but it absorbs in after a few minutes and you can’t even feel it after that! leaves you looking glowly!
