I received supergoop glow screen in shade golden hour as a gift. After cleansing and doing my skincare, I applied the sunscreen on face. The consistency looked almost liked a bb cream. It gave my skin a beautiful glow and made my skin look healthier. I did not wore a little concealer and lipstick after that and skin still looked healthy and glowing. Golden glow on a brown skin!
