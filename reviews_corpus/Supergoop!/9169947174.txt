I got the chance to use try this product complimentary from Supergoop . I like that it is easy to use and travel friendly. I do find that it is greasy and doesnâ€™t apply well over makeup. It tends to break up my concealer due to it being a little oilier. It might be best to use it on your neck, chest or when you are bare faced nan
