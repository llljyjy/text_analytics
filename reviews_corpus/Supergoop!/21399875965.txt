This sunscreen has the strangest texture when you try to reapply it (which you need to do every two hours during sunlight when you apply sunscreen properly). It started clumping on my skin and made it seem as if my skin was peeling off. Mind you I do not have this problem when I used their regular sunscreen or the matte screen. There is also the other negative of the fact that it looks incredibly greasy and I do think it may be clogging my pores. It does not give off this attractive glow like it claims, it just looks like you just dipped your entire face in oil. It is very strange and sad given how much this product costs... Greasy not glowy...
