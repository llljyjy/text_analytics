I already love glowscreen and unseen from Supergoop so am not surprised that i am loving this too. This is a tinted mineral broad spectrum SPF 40 PA+++ that comes in a plastic bottle with a dropper and has serum-like consistency. It absorbs quickly and is easy to spread. The directions don’t state how much to use but on their website it states to use 6-8 drops and pair with other mineral spfs for best results. I assume pairing with other spf comment is for reapplication throughout the day. This seems to be a very innovative sunscreen. I haven’t seen an spf that has Bakuchiol (retinol alternative) so this is especially great for folks who can’t tolerate retinol. I plan to use it only once a day and use another mineral spf during the day for reapplication. I also plan to continue using my tretinoin at night since my skin is pretty resilient.The tint seems to be universal and seems like would work for most skin tones if not all. The packaging is adorable and it is also vegan, gluten-free, and cruelty-free. What more could you ask for. I am absolutely loving it. Innovative and Beautiful !!
