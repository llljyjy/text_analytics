I LOVE it! The perfect coverage and the perfect glow. This is the best product for the summer. For years I was using the Cerave tinted sunscreen but the Supergoop feel so much more lightweight and less sticky! I got the color “Golden Hour“ but I think that was a bit dark for me - I am going to try the “Sunrise“ color now! Better than any Tinted Sunscreen I've Tried
