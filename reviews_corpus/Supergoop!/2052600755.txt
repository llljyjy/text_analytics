I’ve only used this a few times and sadly the spray is really wonky. I now just spray it onto my hands and pat it on to my face. I was hoping to use this for days I have makeup on but now I’m not sure if it’ll just ruin it because of the spray. Other than that I love scent and the fact that it dries quickly, but I wish it wasn’t so oily feeling. If they fixed those few things I’d be happier! I’ve needed a better way to reapply sunscreen in public for a long time! Supergoop gifted me. A bit disappointed
