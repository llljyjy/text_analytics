*gifted by Supergoop! This sunscreen is one of the best formulas I have ever used. At first I was a little skeptical because of the way it looked on my skin. Application is very easy and because it is liquid you can really blend it out everywhere but once it was on my skin I didnâ€™t like the way it looked. It was shiny and I looked very oily. I left it on for a minute or so and it dried down and looked absolutely flawless. I give it a 10/10. nan
