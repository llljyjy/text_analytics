I’m giving this product 2 stars because the brand DOES have some great products and also for innovation (clear sunscreen). HOWEVER, this particular product of theirs is terrible (IMO). It is definitely not suited for anyone with combo or oily skin. It is very slippery in texture (due to the oils, silicones & silica). I wore this inside my house and I’m glad I did. Initial application was just the sunscreen alone for about 15-20 mins. My skin had a slight sheen to it. I then proceeded with my normal makeup routine to see how the two interact. Because it is SO slippery with silicones, it allowed the makeup to “glide” onto my skin. This is great for using less makeup & easier application. HOWEVER, over time, my face began to look “sweaty/shiny”; so much so that it looked that I had applied Illuminator to my face when I wasn’t wearing any. I never have to wear setting powder unless I’m wearing a glam makeup look for a special occasion. The setting spray I normally use locks everything in place (even through heavy sweating at the gym). I wore this sunscreen inside for about 6 hours and by the end of the day, it was just not cute. I have combo skin and my whole face looked oily and felt moist *barf*. I don’t see how this product does well or stays put in place in the blazing sun. This sunscreen was just not it and I’m not a fan. This is not the one
