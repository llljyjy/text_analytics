I LOVE this sunscreen. I have super sensitive eyes, and so finding a daily sunscreen has been a bit of a nightmare for me. Everything I tried either burned my eyes, or smelled terrible, or left a white cast. And while this is definitely not a low budget product, it is SO nice and SO worth the price. It goes on effortlessly, is so smooth and so light, and the slight tint and glow means it doesn’t leave any white cast. This is the first sunscreen that I’ve tried that I’m actually excited to put on every morning and that I feel like I can really incorporate into my makeup and skincare routine. It actually makes me want to wear sunscreen
