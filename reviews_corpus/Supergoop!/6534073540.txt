Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall you must apply sunscreen if you want to keep that fresh faced look as you age. The formula is quite runny & appears to be oily upon first application, but once it is absorbed into the skin, it does feel like a heavier sunscreen that has a bit of a dewier/oilier finish. Overall, love it! Love!
