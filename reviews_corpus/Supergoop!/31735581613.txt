I’ve spent the past year seeing this sunscreen go viral and I haven’t had a chance to try it until now. . . and all I have to say is, i’ve been missing out. This formula is IMPECCABLE ! i’ve never felt a product- let alone sunscreen, that’s as weightless and soft as this one !! As I’m rubbing this in my face, it just disappears; no scent, no weight, no stick, just nothing; the only thing I feel after is the velvety, (& invisible) soft finish it leaves on the skin. The formula is also oil-free which I’m so happy about as my typical biggest problem with sunscreens is how grimy and oily they can make my skin feel. My new fav :))
