I have been looking for a facial sunscreen staple for a while now, and I really love this one from Supergoop! I love that it is a gel base, because it gives a cooling effect which is super nice in the summer and spring. I love the texture of it and it honestly makes my skin feel super good after applying it. This product was gifted by Supergoop!, but I am definitely going to repurchase! nan
