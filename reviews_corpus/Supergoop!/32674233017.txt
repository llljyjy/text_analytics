This is complimentary from Supergoop! I love supergoop sunscreens and even own the glowscreen which is my fav to use naturally or under foundation and makeup. So when they had this I had to jump on it. This is a hydrating oil that has ceramides in the oil along with a great SPF of 40!! It’s for everyone but I would highly recommend it to my dry-skinned babies; you will love it! The couple of times that I have tried this, I have loved it and will continue to use it. I think this will help long term skin benefits for me personally too which I’m looking forward to sharing with you all :) Hydrating SPF!
