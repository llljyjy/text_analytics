I received these ReSetting Refreshing Mist complimentary from Supergoop to try and review.  I need a good sunscreen that is easy to use, especially this time of year. I love that this is small enough to drop in my bag and carry around and the spray mist is super easy to apply. I have not tried this over a full face of makeup yet, but this has been great on the go.  I also like to use it before I get outside in my gardens to keep my face protected from the sunâ€™s harsh rays. Easy to reapply on the go
