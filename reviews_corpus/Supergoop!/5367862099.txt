I love this stuff!!! I didn’t notice a smell other than sunscreen scent. It does make you shiny but I brought some blotting papers and that did the trick! Didn’t see any separation on my foundation just my eyeshadow so I wouldn’t wear eyeshadow with this or do something light colored! Didn’t effect my lashes either. good!!
