This is my favorite sunscreen out of all the SPF products I’ve used and definitely my go-to holy grail! It doesn’t leave a white cast and provides a nice glow without the greasiness. It is very lightweight so I can also apply makeup easily on top of it. I would definitely recommend this product to others! nan
