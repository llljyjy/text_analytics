This is such a unique product but I’ve found it to fit perfectly into my routine - I brought it with me on a trip to Alaska in the winter, so I *loved* having this to hydrate my skin, protect my skin barrier, and protect me from UV. I’ve still been using it even after the trip, because I just love that extra nourishment and spf protection (I still wear Unseen or another SPF over this). It’s thinner/runnier than other face oils I use, which I don’t personally mind - I just have to be careful not to get it in my eyes, as I’ve found it stings a little. Overall I think it’s a really nice product if you’re looking for that extra hydration and UV/skin barrier protection! nan
