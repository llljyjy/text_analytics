I bought this product after a long search for a good tinted moisturizer. I tried it in store and it was fine and I love high spf so I bought it. I really wanted to like this product but I ended up really disappointed wearing it daily the next week or so. I felt like it was super thick and ended up looking cakey and dry. I was looking for something more natural and glowy and this just didnâ€™t give me that, it was super matte but it would get greasy and crease around my face so I was disappointed and ended up returning for the Fenty skin tint which I like a lot better. not what i wanted
