I wear sunscreen everyday, so I am always on the hunt for the perfect everyday sunscreen and this one checks most of my boxes! No white cast, hydrating, oil-free, reef-safe, fragrance-free, and gives the skin a healthy glow. She is rather glowy, which I love, but probably not ideal for oily skin. The only thing missing for me is that I would love to see this finish achieved with a mineral formula for a physical sun barrier rather than chemical. Product gifted by Supergoop in exchange for my honest review. Beautiful glowy finish
