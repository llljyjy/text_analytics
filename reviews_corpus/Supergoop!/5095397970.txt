I love Supergoop. I have the unseen sunscreen, lip balm, glow sunscreen and the resetting mist. I use retinol and I get chemical peels so I’m serious about sunscreen. This sunscreen oil… it was JUST OKAY. There was nothing spectacular about this. I will be returning…. And I will stick to the products I have. I am also curious how 2-3 drops can protect your whole face. C+
