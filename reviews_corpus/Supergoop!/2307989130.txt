Love that it’s clear, reef-safe, scent free, convenient to roll on, doesn’t break me out. I typically wear it without make up and it gives me a nice glow. You can be in the pool and it’s so easy to reapply. Only reason I rated 4 stars is because it is quite slick on your face once it warms up with your body temperature. Would still repurchase. nice and easy
