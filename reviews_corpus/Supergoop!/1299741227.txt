This sunscreen is great as far as blending in nicely and not leaving a white cast. I love that part of it, but I wouldn’t consider this a “watery lotion” it’s definitely more liquidy than most sunscreens I’ve tried, but it’s not as watery as I thought. It’s definitely thick enough to put on the back of your hand and then applying it to your face after. I will say this does have an alcohol/sunscreen smell it’s not extreme but it’s there so if your extremely sensitive to smells I wouldn’t purchase this. It’s definitely going to leave you with a really dewy face. Which is not something I gravitate towards with a sunscreen, but I like using this on days I’m not wearing any makeup. Which is the reason I kept it, but I don’t think this would work well under makeup, it’s too dewy and “greasy” for that. I wouldn’t consider it super greasy because I still think it sits well on the skin, but if you are any oily skin person I would stay away from this. I have combination skin so I don’t mind it. I gave this 4 stars because it literally left no white cast on my skin and I have medium/tan skin, but the smell and extreme dewy look made me take a point off. This is great for combo/dry skin and for days you’re not wearing makeup which is why I kept it and it was super easy to re apply during the day because it blends so well. NON GIFTED REVIEW
