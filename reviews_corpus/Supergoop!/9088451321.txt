I bought this sunscreen twice and it works great; however, be aware that it does not pair well with the Sephora nourishing moisturizer; it does not absorb well and caused me to break out, and I had to cleanse my face before reapplying the sunscreen due to the white cast. However, it compliments my other moisturizer (Malin+ Goetz, which is not available at Sephora). nan
