Really liked it, but it did not mesh well with my other skin products. I am on a few prescription creams for acne and I think the niacinamide reacted poorly with them, causing extreme skin sensitivity. Unfortunately, the acne creams win,  over this sunscreen.  Sad though because I loved the glow! Great Glow but didnâ€™t Mesh with my Other Products
