I have oily combination skin. Finding a sunscreen can be difficult sometimes when all the sunscreens I’ve tried have left me feeling so greasy and they leave a white cast. This sunscreen feels like you’re putting on a very light weight moisturizer and leaves 0 white cast. I will say it’s not my favorite smell only because I think it smells like peanut butter and I’m not a fan but everything else exceeds my expectations of a sun screen. nan
