Absolutely love this for my morning routine. One of the few products that doesn’t break me out, too! Only reason I’m not giving it 5 starts is because the un scented smell is weird (hate) and the container is so annoying. Wish it was in a squeeze tube so badly. isisannoying. Great daily moisturizer!
