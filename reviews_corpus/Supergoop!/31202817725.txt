This oil is everything, gifted by Supergoop! I already loved all the supergoop products I’ve tried so far but skin seems to be really loving this! I like to use this oil in my morning routine and layer it between my serums and moisturizer. It’s fragrance free and absorbs really quickly, making layering a breeze. I love that it has SPF benefits although I am sure to still use sunscreen in my routine. The dropper makes it easy to dispense and avoid contaminating the product. Overall I’m a huge fan of this and will be repurchasing! nan
