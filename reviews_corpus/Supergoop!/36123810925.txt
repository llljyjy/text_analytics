I have combination skin: Oily T-Zone with dryness in cheeks and neck area; sensitive skin. I use this sunscreen after I have washed and moisturized my face. Once you first apply the sunscreen, it may feel oily at first, but once you work it into your skin, it feels very light. As someone who has experienced clogged pores from sunscreens and stopped using spf due to that reason, this brand has not caused me any skin troubles. Has a very light scent. Definitely Worth the Hype
