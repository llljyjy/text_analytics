This is the sunscreen of my dreams. A friend raved about it and it was hard for me to understand how someone could be so excited about sunscreen. I was skeptical. But this sunscreen is miraculous. The texture is sort of like vaseline. Not promising, right? But the second it touches your skin, it turns into this velvety powdery layer, virtually disappearing. Can’t say enough nice things. I’m bummed because I got one of the summer kits from Sephora with a bunch of sunscreen samples, and I feel like I should use up the other samples before I buy more of this. But this sunscreen--it’s my one true love! Look no further
