I wish I could give this 0stars. As an esthetician I’m willing to give any spf a try especially one as easy to apply as this, however… this is the absolute worst! Firstly, why on earth would you put spearmint in a facial mist/spray?! It actually burned more than getting sand in my eyes.. Secondly, if this is supposed to be a makeup resetting spray why is there SO MUCH OIL?! Literally completely melted my makeup off after applying 2 layers which seems like to me it defeats the purpose. And lastly again, why the mint? A HUGE NO FOR ME, PLEASE REFORMULATE!!!! nan
