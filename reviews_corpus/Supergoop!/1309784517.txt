I was excited to try this product since I’ve used Supergoop’s unseen sunscreen and setting powder.  I tried Glowscreen in the shade Sunrise. Love that Glowscreen contains hyaluronic acid which is perfectly moisturizing for my dry skin. The sunscreen lotion, itself, has a tint to it and goes on smooth on the face. It leaves a “lit from within“ glow and I love how it doesn’t peel at all. Usually, other sunscreens make my hands and fingers feel icky, post-application, but this one is light enough and doesn’t leave that strange/unwanted feeling. It makes the application process such a breeze. I applied this, initially, over my serum and moisturizer and it felt a bit too heavy since it is hot and humid, outside. For summers, I’d prefer to just layer this over essence + Vitamin C/light serum and that should be good enough.  Also, acts as a great primer, under makeup, and leaves a nice glow all day long. Additionally, it doesnt leave a white cast as it has a nice, skin colored pearlescent tint to it. It might be a bit too glowy/oily for oily-skinned individuals, though. I highly recommend it for dry skin. Glowy, hydrating, super suncreen
