I use this every morning as my base face product. I use a retinoid nightly, so I have to be proactive about sun protection and using products that wonâ€™t further irritate my skin, and this one is perfect. May be a bit too oily for those with oily/combination skin, but is perfect if you have dry patches. Great for dry, sensitive skin
