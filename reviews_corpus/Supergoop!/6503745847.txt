This is my new favorite sunscreen! I love that it has a slight tint that makes my skin look glowy and helps prevent whitecast. On that note, it has no whitecast from what I can tell! It also doesn’t feel heavy on the skin so it’s comfortable to wear all day. The best sunscreen is one you love to wear! Love the glow, love the texture!
