I really wanted to love this product! Esp since it is a mineral sunscreen and is sooo moisturizing (it really seems to hydrate the skin!) but after a few weeks of using it, I realized it was making me break out (!!) and I  am NOT acne prone. I have small red zits on my cheeks and chin now. ;9 I wanted to write this review just to warn others that it could cause break outs. I was reading other reviews and saw others also share the sameâ€¦wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing. I have used Elta MD for years, and it never gave me any issue. made me break out :(
