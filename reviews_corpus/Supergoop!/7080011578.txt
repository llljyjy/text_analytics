I really like this brand, and as someone as fair skinned as I am I have to wear sunscreen every day. This doesn’t feel like you’re putting on an SPF AT ALL! It has no regular sunscreen scent. I also really love that it’s mineral based. Overall I’d definitely get this again and recommend it to others. nan
