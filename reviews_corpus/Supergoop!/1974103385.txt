I’m someone with extremely sensitive skin, and I hate when I can “feel“ and/or “smell“ a product sitting on my skin - which makes it very hard to find a good sunscreen!! I am very happy I found this product. I absolutely cannot feel it or smell the sunscreen during daytime. It’s very light weight, and the glow effect is there. I love this!!! I am now able to wear sunscreen on a daily basis. My fav sunscreen!! (sensitive skin)
