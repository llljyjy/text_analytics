Love this- leaves no white patches which is great! Use this everyday and I love it, definitely great for under makeup and using for summer glows! It does have some smell to it but I’m not really bothered by smells anymore in makeup lol- but it is great for skin that gets sunburn easily and is amazing for any skin types. I recommend this so much. I know I’m not a professional makeup artist but I have been doing makeup since I was 2 and I have a lot of experience in it! Write back if you have any questions for me! But I def recommend and will be buying again! Also mineral sunscreen is better for skin so this one and the supergloop are perfect for anyone so make sure to get your hands on it before it blows up and sells out! nan
