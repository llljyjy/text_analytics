I wore this sunscreen for the first time yesterday. Bought it the day before. It’s absolutely going back to Sephora tomorrow. This sunscreen looked so greasy, that I felt crazy. It made me look crazy. Anyone saying that it’s not greasy is not putting the right amount of sunscreen on. Don’t trust them. This would be great for someone with dry skin (maybe) but my God. I wore it yesterday and today and my forehead has tiny pimples coming through. Absolutely not. This is a pretty awful sunscreen. Wish they tried harder because it’s such a grate value. Greasy and will break you out
