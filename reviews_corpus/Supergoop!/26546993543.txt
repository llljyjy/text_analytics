Complimentary from my SupergoopFinding the ideal sunscreen is not always a simple task! I like my sunscreen to be non-greasy and non-sticky! In other words, it has to be so light-weight and comfortable to wear that I don’t have to feel that I am wearing one.  “Every Single Face“ is perfect and offers all what I look for in a sunscreen! Having SPF 50 protection is a big plus for me too! It absorbs very quickly and applies evenly so it is perfect to wear under makeup. Another thing that I love, is that it doesn’t leave any residue or cast. It is ideal for daily use and feels incredible! It comes in a compact design that makes it also easy to take in your travel bag to keep your skin protected during vacation! I highly recommend it! Cast free and non-greasy!
