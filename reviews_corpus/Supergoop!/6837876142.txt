I really wanted to love this product because I have oily skin and this gave me a beautiful glow despite the fact that I hate looking glowy due to my oily skin. For a while it was good but I noticed the oil separating from the sunscreen. So when I squeezed the product out, I would get a puddle of oil and a little bit of product if that makes sense. nan
