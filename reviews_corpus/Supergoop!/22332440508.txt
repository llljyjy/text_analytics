Spray nozzle instantly clogs every time I use it. I scratch the built-up goop away to unclog it every couple seconds, and then it sprays in totally unpredictable directions. So I have to rub it to spread it around. I thought it would evenly coat my face in a mist... ha. No way. Also it’s supposed to set your make up... also no way. It’s sticky and makes the makeup run. Since it sprays in crazy directions often it will spray on my eyes accidentally and mess up my mascara too. Wish I had asked for a refund. Not good, don't recommend.
