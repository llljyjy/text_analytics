Wow. Just wow. Amazing product overall. I tried it in the morning after my simple morning routine and went on my skin flawlessly, doesn’t require much blending at all, doesn’t pill, doesn’t look oily (and I have oily T zone and normal skin on my cheeks) looks glossy but not oily. Doesn’t look oily throughout the day either, when it’s time to reapply it goes on smoothly without any pilling and doesn’t look gross. I even decided to reapply with makeup on and it looks great!! I’m actually really surprised it looks perfectly fine over makeup (I don’t wear heavy makeup). I have light acne prone skin on my T zone for reference. 10/10 would recommend. nan
