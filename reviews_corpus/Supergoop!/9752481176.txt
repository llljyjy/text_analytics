I have a medium skin tone, and this is the first physical sunscreen that doesn’t leave me a cast. It’s easy to blend and leaves a silky finish. I have combination skin, so It’s a little drying for my cheeks but nothing too crazy. I was breaking out due to chemical sunscreen, so I switched to this one, and my acne is gone. I think that many bad reviews are because people expect this to perform like a chemical sunscreen when it isn’t. great physical SPF that helped with my acne
