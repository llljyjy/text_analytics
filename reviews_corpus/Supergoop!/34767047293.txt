The tube is really nice looking. It’s tinted sunscreen and color matches with my skin tone so I don’t need to worry about any white cast that some sunscreens leave after applying. I love products that have multiple uses like this one has tint so it gives little coverage, has niacinamide and hyaluronic acid for nourishing the skin as well as spf for skin protection.It smells really good but a little typical sunscreen smell is still there. It’s semi liquid, very easy to apply and with few strokes blend easily into skin. It has good amount of spf to help protect me from sunrays.This gives nice dewy matte finish. I took 1 star as I found it a bit sticky on skin and it remains like that for quite some time. Smells nice
