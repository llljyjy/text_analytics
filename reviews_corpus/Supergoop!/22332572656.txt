I love this product, but not the packaging. I dislike the way it sprays, it’s not an even mist and I’ve noticed this on both the bottles I’ve had. Regardless, the product works and is really nice to wear over makeup throughout the day. It gives a radiant finish that I love. (gifted by supergoop!) nan
