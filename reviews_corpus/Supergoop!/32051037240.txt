This is a good sunscreen, especially for those who like a glowy face like I do. I use it as a primer and i really love how my makeup looks after. The only problem if you’re oily would be that it gets a little greasy after 2 or 3 hours, and I have normal skin type, so I don’t mind it. It also seems to really protect my face against the sun, unlike others I’ve tried.Overall is good, and I recommend to try it. Glowy sunscreen!
