The new formula of this product is such a letdown. I was absolutely in LOVE with the old formula and probably would’ve exclusively worn this product for the rest of time. This new formula feels different, doesn’t dry down, makes skin look worse when applied and this  formula broke my skin out, where as the old formula never did. Please, please, please, Supergoop! Bring back the old formula! This one is NOT working! The Old Formula was Better! Bring. It. Back.
