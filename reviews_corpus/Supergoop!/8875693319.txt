I loved this product and how it operated almost as a primer. But I recently have been doing research on harmful chemicals in sunscreen and this has avobenzone, which can disrupt your hormones and is toxic when exposed to chlorine. I wanted to use this all summer but don’t want to put those chemicals on my skin. I’m currently looking for a cleaner alternative. Feels great but don’t love the ingredients
