I am not a fan. The scent is extremely overpowering in my opinion. Usually I’m not sensitive to smells and/or they will subside throughout the day but this was constant. I know this is great for others, but apparently when it comes to Safflower, it’s just not for me. It was, however moisturizing. Moisturizing BUT scent is OVERpowering
