I was looking for a more cosmetically elegant physical sunscreen and this product hit the nail on the head. I was nervous to buy this because of the comments about this product pilling, but haven’t had any issues at all. I use this between moisturizer and primer + makeup and have noticed zero pilling so far. I have warm light to medium skin and this product does leave my skin with a bit of a pink tint. The pink tint can easily be covered with makeup but also isn’t super obvious on my skin and would be fine to wear out without makeup occasionally; definitely doesn’t leave a noticeable white cast like other physical sunscreens I’ve tried.
