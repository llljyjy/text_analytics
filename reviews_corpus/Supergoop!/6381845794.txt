Totally worth the hype! I’ve tried so many other SPF products, and this is the ONLY one that works best for my skin. I have dry/normal or normal/combination skin, depending on the season. It blends so smoothly. Works amazing as a primer before applying makeup. It goes on clear which is what I was looking for in a sunblock since I have tan/dark skin tone and other sunblocks leave a white cast causing my skin to look purple-ish. I’ve already repurchased this item 4 times and I’ll keep purchasing it over and over again!The only con I have with this product is that it does stings the eyes. It’s a chemical sunscreen which is expected to happen if it gets near the eyes. Totally worth the hype!
