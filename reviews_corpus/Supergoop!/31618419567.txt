was so excited to try this  sunscreen oil, it is very necessary to have one at any time of the year, i live in florida and usually there is always a lot of sun So this is a must have, this sunscreen works absolutely good on my skin, leaves no white cast and absorbs quickly into the skin the texture is lightweight and it doesnâ€™t leave my skin greasy, I love it!! Complimentary from Supergoop Must have
