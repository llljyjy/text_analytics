I’ve always had a problem with reapplying sunscreen throughout the day, especially when I have a full face of makeup on. That is why I was so excited when I was gifted by supergoop their spf setting spray.  It’s so easy for me to reapply my sunscreen throughout the day. It does leave my skin a little shiny but the pros definitely outweigh the cons! nan
