For the longest time, I used the “Supergoop! CC Cream Daily Correct Broad Spectrum SPF 35 Sunscreen“ which I really liked. Then, it disappeared so I purchased the SPF 50 instead, thinking it would be the same formula but it is not the same. The application seems a lot more liquid-ey and longer to apply so that I can make sure there aren’t any missed spots or streaks. It also seems to be a different shade in that it makes me look way too pale and doesn’t match my skin tone as well as the previous CC Cream. I do like that it is SPF 50 instead of 35, and it isn’t a terrible sunscreen + foundation so I will use it until it runs out but will definitely be looking elsewhere for options. Not a fan compared to old CC Cream SPF 35
