I’ve used this for years, and it’ll probably always be a staple in my skincare drawer. It does exactly what it’s advertised to do. This is not a moisturizing SPF, but it’s not supposed to be. It’s a fantastic sunscreen and extremely versatile. It’s not heavy to wear on a hot pool day, it’s water resistant, has a nontoxic chemical compound (for both skin and reefs), and works as an amazing makeup primer. The texture is definitely different than anything else I’ve tried, it’s almost like a dry silicone gel, but it dries down well and feels good on the skin. Good Versatile SPF
