This does exactly what it says what it will do. I used this during three entire days in blistering sunny heat at Disney and universal and I didn’t get burned at all. I reapplied it multiple times throughout the day and it was really easy. It does burn your eyes when you spray it on your face (yes, I closed my eyes), and I would be able to look past this but like other reviews have mentioned the packaging is horrible. I didn’t personally have issues with the spray not coming out but over time I noticed the bottle would start to leak, now I don’t feel comfortable putting this in a bag or purse because it’s super oily and greasy. I will be using the rest of this product but I wouldn’t buy it again just for the packaging alone combined with the price. wouldn’t buy it again
