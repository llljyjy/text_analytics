I love the regular Glow Screen so much, I wear it every single day by itself or under my makeup. This formula is the exact same just with a deeper tint and bronzy glow. I will say, Golden Hour is WAY too dark for my fair complexion so beware on that front. Even when blended out vigorously this was too dark especially if you’re using the proper amount of sunscreen that you need for protection. If you’re already tanned and love a glow and Glow Screen you will be equally as pleased using this version of the product. I’ll get better use out of this shade when and if I get a tan. nan
