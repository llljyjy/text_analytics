Gifted by Supergoop. I have dry skin so Iâ€™m always looking for a product with ceramides in it. Super goop has always been one of my favorite sunscreen brands so I was so excited to see they have an SPF oil with ceramides. The formula absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft. Highly recommend. Hydrating spf oil!
