I’ve used this for a year almost every day and absolutely love it. It gives a healthy glow, which often leads people to ask about my skincare routine, while in fact it’s this that’s doing all the work. When I first apply it, it’s a slightly grey colour but the colour settles in after a couple of minutes - I guess something to do with the spf, idk. I use a light dusting of Kat Von D or Laura Mercier translucent powder on top. It’s quite thick for a cc (about the same as Laura Mercier tinted moisturiser) so it might be too much coverage for someone just looking for sunscreen. Unseen Sunscreen would be better for that. Absolute favorite
