ive tried so many different setting sprays but none were quite like this one. i absolutely love how it sets my makeup, and if im not wearing any makeup i still spray it on my face before going anywhere. its lightweight and easy to apply. it does have a weird smell but i assume thats the spf. i will but this again and again until i find something better, but this one was gifted to me by supergoop! love this spray
