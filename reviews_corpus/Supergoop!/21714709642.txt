I love the glowscreen by this brand and happily wore makeup over it with or without foundation year long, and was hoping for a similar thin and “not sunscreen“ like feeling when putting this on as it is literally called the unseen sunscreen. Especially because this is so heavily promoted online. I was disappointed this felt very silicone-like and the best comparison I have is that it felt like a thinned out vaseline being spread over my skin. This did make me concerned this would make my skin irritated or cause breakouts as it feels very occlusive due to this texture, so I assumed it would act like a face oil. It also looked much greasier for a short while after applying, and I would not have kept this on my face and switched to another sunscreen if I was not going to apply a full face of makeup before going out.I was pleased that my concerns for my skin were not proven right - my face and neck were as happy as with my favorite formulas and no disruptions to the way the rest of my skincare or makeup sat on my skin all day as this worked very nicely under my makeup for the day. But that being said because I was worried this would cause my face to feel too hot and suffocated, and while this is on the better end of what US sunscreens feel like on the face, I would not opt for this over either the glowscreen or any of the highly elegant and much more affordable Korean sunscreens that are now widely available. Texture like thin Vaseline, but does the job
