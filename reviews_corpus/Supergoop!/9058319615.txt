I love a good tinted sunscreen and this hits the spot! The packaging is lovely and typical for Supergoop. The sunscreen is kind of oddly thick (I expected it to feel like a serum?), but still good. As sunscreen does, it leaves quite a bit of shine (no white cast though!) so I would not be able to wear this by itself without looking ~insane~. Yah itâ€™s good
