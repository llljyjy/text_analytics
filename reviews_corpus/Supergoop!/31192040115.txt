This product is good for summer time. It is my first time to try this brand. It is not very heavy, and easy to apply. It also help to protect the sunscreen. I think SPF 40 PA+++ is the good UV protect degree for summer. I am happy about the product and thinking to try the other products of the brand. Nice
