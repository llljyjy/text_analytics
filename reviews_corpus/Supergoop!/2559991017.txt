I’m such a fan of supergoop’s other sunscreens that I had to give this one a try and oof I was disappointed. I’m not sure if it’s my skin type or if it’s the product, but I look greasier than a butterball on Thanksgiving after applying. It never seemed to soak in either. I really wanted to love this since it has SPF + vitamin C, but I guess I can’t have it all. not in love :(
