I absolutely love the texture and the bronzing effect of this sunscreen.  It’s great for the pool or beach where you don’t want to wear makeup but would like something to enhance your skin.  I have light skin that tans easily so the Golden Hour color looked great  - it may not be suitable for very fair skin tones due to its amount of pigment. LOVED the Golden Hour Shade
