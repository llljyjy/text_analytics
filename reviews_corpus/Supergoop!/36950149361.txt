I wanted to love this as the texture is as what it claims to be; a lotion. For specifically my face area I wanted to find a SPF that was moisturizing and wouldn’t feel chalky. However a day after applying this, my left eye has been constantly watering nonstop and I’ve started breaking out around my face. I think I will stick to my k beauty spf from now on. wanted to love this…
