I really wanted to love this sunscreen but I’m not too sure how I really feel about it since it gave me a little breakout. It’s very glow my and does not leave a white cast which I really love. But I’m not sure I was a fan of the “glow” it kinda seemed like liquid highlight all over my face. It was okay
