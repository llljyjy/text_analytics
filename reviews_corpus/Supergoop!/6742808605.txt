I’ve really liked the Supergoop products that I’ve tried in the past so I wanted to try this. I recommend dabbing it on not rubbing because it will start peeling. It does leave a really pretty glow but for some reason I just can’t do it on my face without it being flaky. It can get messy so just be careful how your store it :) nan
