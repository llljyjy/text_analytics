Bought this hoping it would be a mineral version of Unseen Sunscreen (which I love love love), but sadly this has a heavy, tacky feeling on my face that doesn’t seem to go away for hours. Put a mask on top of it at work and it feels like the sunscreen is sliding off my face. Leaves a white cast on my fair-light skin but that fades quickly. Only pluses: no scent; doesn’t make my skin shiny. Back to Unseen for me! Heavy, tacky
