It’s super lightweight and the fact that it has SPF 50???? GIIIIIRL. It’s easy to apply on the skin. I’m oily around my t-zone so my face is on the oilier, shinier side by the end of the day but most sunscreens have that effect on me anyway so it doesn’t bother me. Gifted by Supergoop! A great sunscreen!
