I like the convenience of this product to reapply sunscreen midday and I like that it offers a matte finish to the skin. It would be better if there is more product in the tube considering the price you pay. The design of the tube can get faulty sometimes when I try to dispense the product out; I tap and swirl but nothing comes out in the open position. Overall I donâ€™t think I will repurchase it in the future. Not enough product, should fix the design
