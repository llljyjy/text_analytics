this product was gifted by supergoop. sunscreen setting sprays are so hard to come by so iâ€™m glad supergoop made one. while i do enjoy it, i think there is definitely room for improvement. the spray is a little too oily and i find the nozzle sprays a little uneven. however, i will still use this to reapply spf can be improved
