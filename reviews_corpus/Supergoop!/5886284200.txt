I wanted to love this but unfortunately it didn’t work out for me.I had to return it because I noticed my skin slowly reacting to it after 2 days and now my face is getting rashes around my mouth, eye and cheek area…I’d say I’m cautious with what I put on my skin but I wanted to incorporate a type of oil but not anymore.Also, vitamin C is an ingredient that’s very difficult to stabilize and I learned that it also isn’t effective when mixed with spf, so if you’re buying for the benefit of that, I might as well skip this.If it works for you, great. But you honestly won’t know until you try it. It didn’t work out for me, so I’m giving it a 1 star.. it’s a “no” for me
