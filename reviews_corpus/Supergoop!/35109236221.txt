I absolutely love the SPF 40 Supergoop Glowscreen! If you were to take your sunscreen and a liquid illuminating highlighter and mix them together, this would be the result of that. I received this complimentary to review in shade Golden Hour. It gave me a beautiful champagne glow that offered protection from the sun yet I looked like I was kissed by the sun. I also wanted to test this as a moisturizer under my makeup and it played in beautifully with my face products. It was such a beautiful application. I really enjoyed it as a stand alone product for a natural glam day. All and all, I was extremely impressed with this product and it is going to be perfect for the summer.
