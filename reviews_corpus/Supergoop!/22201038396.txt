I’ve tried this out in store before, so I was really excited when I was able to get my hands on this. The shade Sunrise appears to be the OG shade. When applied onto my skin (light-medium), it makes my skin look glowy yet slightly illuminated. I personally don’t think that this is too glittery or shimmery. However, I feel like this might look a bit excessive if using for everyday looks. Ultimately, I still really enjoy using this. nan
