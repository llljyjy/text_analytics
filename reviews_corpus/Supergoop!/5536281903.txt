Ugh, I wish I could love this more! So when I used the smaller sizes, the lotion worked great. But when I bought the 18 oz value size, it was so so sticky on me! My friend and I needed to wash it off our hands after application bc it felt so uncomfortable. Maybe it’s just the batch I received? I’m not sure, but I’m disappointed in the difference in quality. The sunscreen definitely worked for me and my skin - you can see my handprint where I didn’t rub it in. >.< The lower half of my back had sunscreen, the top half I didn’t bother trying to reach. Big ragrets. The bottling of this product is indeed annoying to travel to the beach with. Lots of lotions come in 18 oz and this wasn’t pleasant to travel with the hole and pump. This 18 oz bottling would be better for leave-at-home-daily-application, but I don’t even wanna use this daily w how sticky it feels afterwards. :c Value size is great for $3.2USD/oz (At time of writing). I’d recommend the smaller bottles I guess, I’m just not sure of the big one w how sticky and uncomfy my experience has been. Valuable at Value Size?
