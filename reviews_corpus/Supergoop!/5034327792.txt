I wanted to like this but just can’t.  I’m a dark tan skinned woman (nc44).  The powder is very light and made me ashy.  It never sunk into my skin. I have really good skin but the powder made me seem very flaky.Finally the container seems so flimsy and the amount of product is ridiculous.  Quickly returned Not a great value nor translucent
