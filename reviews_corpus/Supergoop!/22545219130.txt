Takes some serious massage work to get the white cast to go away, and this from someone who’s family affectionally refers to her as a “ghoul” with “undead skin” so if my pasty skin takes a good rub down…. Sits well while exercising (my main use for the product) a little goes a long way, and has prevented burns so can’t complain! Smell is not sunscreen-y and it doesnt cause underlying skincare to pill up. Nice! nan
