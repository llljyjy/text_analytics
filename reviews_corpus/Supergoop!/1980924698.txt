Really wanted to love this sunscreen, but unfortunately, it burns when I sweat or accidentally get it in my eyes. Definitely gives a nice glow underneath makeup, but not worth the stinging. My skin did not like this oneâ€¦ not for sensitive skin. I much prefer their Unseen Sunscreen! Stings my skin :(
