Initially the first uses I had difficulty with this sunscreen, if you use this under makeup you have to make sure you donâ€™t pair it with any water based creams beforehand, I would prep with water based serums and put this on top and it would pill and was so annoying, but I love the blurring affect this gives is great! And definitely provides some evening throughout the skin Surprisingly Well Done!
