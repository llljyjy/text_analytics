Maybe if you have tanner skin it would look kinda pretty just as a sunscreen if your goal was to look like you dunked your face in highlighter. I am super pale so I looked absolutely ridiculous and it didn’t help my dry skin at all. Instead it pilled up and led to me having to remove all the makeup I attempted to put on and start over. I’m not even sure who this is marketed for because it’s horrible as a primer. i don’t live for it
