I like it just fine but like most sunscreens it makes my face look like an oil slick. Not glowy, not dewy, just straight up oily. Even had someone ask if I was sick cause they thought face looked “sweaty“. If my face ever does sweat while I’m wearing this it’s not a good time. It’ll run into my eyes and burn. And it’s not like I can just use less product, that’s not how sunscreen works. You need a generous amount to get full protection, so putting less on leaves you less protected from damaging UV rays. I like the Unseen Sunscreen, but it too makes me look greasy, albeit less so than this one. I’m still going to try the new watery lotion by this brand, but if it’s as oily as the rest I’ll be continuing my search for that perfect sunscreen. Oil slick
