I’ve been using this SPF daily for 2 weeks now. I’m not a fan. I have pale white sensitive skin. I like to use SPF on my face, neck, and hands daily. This made my skin dry. Especially, on my hands. Unfortunately, I didn’t find this as effective as chemical based options Ive used in the past from this brand. I applied it 3 times when I was in the sun for 4 hours at a game and still got burnt. I was wearing sun hat too. Left my skin dry and red
