I love a good dewy glow, but this product is way too shiny! Luckily I WFH a lot so Zoom doesnâ€™t catch it, but I would definitely think twice about wearing it to the office. The second star had to go for the packaging - the cap is not easy to put back on with cream on your hands. That sounds like an easy improvement they could make. All in all, meah. Radioactive Shine
