I always had problems to put any sunscreen because most of them were too sticky and had a smell. This is thick when it comes out but glides on smoothly. It is almost like a primer. Not oily at all! Excellent product. I received the product complimentary, and I am genuinely impressed. Going to buy a bigger size! nan
