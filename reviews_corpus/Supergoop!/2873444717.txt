I’m a huge fan of Supergoop! products. However, THIS IS GARBAGE. It’s profoundly greasy and takes forever to dry/set. I had to take a dry washcloth to dab away the grease. There is NO way I’ll ever wear this again. Yuck. Do better Supergoop!. THIS IS SO EXPENSIVE for less than drugstore quality. GARBAGE. BEWARE OF EXPENSIVE CRAP
