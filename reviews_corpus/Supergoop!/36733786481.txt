I wasn’t sure how I felt about bakuchiol mixed with SPF but I was pleasantly surprised. The formula is thin and leaves sort of a dewy finish. No white cast at all. It feels hydrating and didn’t pill or sit weirdly with other products. Overall I really like this and am excited to see the results from using it consistently. nan
