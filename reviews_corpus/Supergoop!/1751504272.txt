I like this!! This was gifted by Supergoop! It is a nice liquidy consistency that doesnt leave a white cast and is blends nicely into the skin. I also love the packaging because its so nice to bring with you. It does have a bit of a sunscreen smell, which I donâ€™t mind.  Great protection for your skin! Nice sunscreen!
