I love products  that incorporate sunscreen into their Anti-aging products. Super group has been my favorite brand for a very long time. They always have amazing quality products they’re effective and affordable. This is perfectly safe to use during daytime because it has 40 spf. I love when products have such high amount of sunscreen protection. Sun is literally an enemy for our skin. This amazing sunscreen is lightweight, not greasy and fast absorbing. It’s literally a dream come true. It helps to smoke, firm and plump the skin. After 2 weeks of use it my wrinkles are less visible while my skin is protected from the sun adequately. I have sensitive skin in this product did not irritate my skin at all. It is such a good product to have under your belt. I use it daily and I couldn’t love it more I will totally leave purchase. nan
