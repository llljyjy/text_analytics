My skin gets really dry in winter and I was looking for a moisturizer with SPF- voila! I’m allergic to a lot of things and my skin is very reactive but this hasn’t bothered me at all- it feels great, creamy, and hydrating and not at all greasy. It has a faint scent, I’m guessing it’s from the ingredients, I find it pleasant. Dry, reactive skin friendly!
