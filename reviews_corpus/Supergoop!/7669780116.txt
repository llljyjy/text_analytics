I’m sorry but this is a big no for me. I have dry skin and this still was way too greasy and heavy on my skin. I applied it on at 9:30am, it’s currently 12:30pm and it’s still sitting very heavily on my face. I can feel it on my face and I don’t like that. It’s greasy and slippy. Also, if you’re using this under a mask it’ll feel ever more slippy and greasy because you’re basically breathing into it. Just no. Slippy, Greasy, all the things
