I received this product complimentary from Supergoop. The sunscreen oil is clear in color and has a smell that reminds me of agan oil. I like that you can use this as a daily SPF moisturizer and under your makeup. I found the sunscreen oil to be a little to oily for my combination skin. I mean, it felt nice and moisturized but too oil after a while. I suppose its possible that I used too much, but I don’t think so. I only used 3-4 drops as directed and it didn’t seem to absorb all that well, so it just seem oily. Overall, tis product was not meant for me. not for me
