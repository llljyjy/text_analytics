I thought this Supergoop! Glow Screen 40 SPF was pretty good. It is a tinted sunscreen so there is not a white cast that shows. While this was tinted, it did make my face look tanner if I used this sunscreen by itself. My skin felt moisturized using this product, but the glow definitely made me look oily. There was a slight sunscreen scent, but luckily it was not overpowering. So far my skin has not been irritated by this product. I love that this product is also a primer and can be used as a highlighter. nan
