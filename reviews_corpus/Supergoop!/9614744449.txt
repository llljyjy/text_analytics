holy cow. this is my new holy grail. i can’t get over it! my skin is SO dry normally and it flakes constantly. adding this to my morning has worked wonders for my dry skin. it feels so good, doesn’t pill with primer and makeup (i use the milk gel primer and nars light reflecting foundation) and then if it’s too glowy of a finish for me i will also use the supergoop translucent powder and that’s a great product too. definitely give this a try Amazing
