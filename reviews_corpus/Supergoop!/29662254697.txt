It does the job it claims! It spreads evenly, so when blended out properly it doesn’t leave a while cast. It’s not a chalky consistency as other mineral sunscreens turn out to be. My only concern is that it smells a bit like nachos - which is okay if applied before makeup. Every time I’ve put this on my face it has smelled like literal nacho chips. I understand that fragrances irritate skin so that’s why I can’t really dock a point but just be prepared to feel a little funny when applying - the smell wears off throughout the day! Overall a nice addition to my morning routine - I just wish it came in a bigger size! :) happy sun screening! Smells like nachos
