While I like the ingredients and think it is probably a better SPF for my sun health than others that I use (hence the 3 stars), it really looks awful on my skin. I am very oily, fair with some hyperpigmentation, fine lines. I feel like this exacerbates all my flaws: I look sweaty and oily, but with my hyperpigmentation and lines highlighted. Color-wise, it makes me look like I have an off-shade bronzer. Iâ€™ve gotten a bunch of samples of this and I do use it, but never on my face (which is what it is for). Not great for fair, for oily, for aging skin!
