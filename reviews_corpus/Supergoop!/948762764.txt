I can certainly understand what many of the reviews are saying about this product, but I do love it. I use this at home on make up free days. It has not broken me out in the greasiness does go away after a while. It’s true it’s not great underneath make up. But it has a time and place in my skin care routine. I would re-purchase this product. Great for makeup free days
