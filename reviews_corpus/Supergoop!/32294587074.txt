This sunscreen is amazing; 10/10. I use this every single day, no matter the UV index. With the mixture of niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, my face feels extra hydrated and soft. This sunscreen leaves a dewy look so if you have oily skin and want to use this sunscreen, you are better off using the other one. The only thing with this sunscreen is that you CANNOT use other serums before, otherwise it will pill and crack everywhere. Otherwise, it is really good and hydrating. It also does a great job with the goal of protecting your skin from harmful sun-rays and sunburns. Once again, 10/10. nan
