I love this sunscreen, it feels light and moisturizing and not super gloppy or hard to rub in. Most importantly, it works. I feel like you never know if you’re sunscreen is truly keeping you protected but as my photo shows, today I went to the beach, I applied my sunscreen once before heading out. I reached the top of my back and my shoulders and everywhere else I needed it but couldn’t quite reach my back/didn’t use it there. You can see a clear delineation where the supergoop sunscreen reached lol. Whoops! But glad to see the product works. Love this stuff
