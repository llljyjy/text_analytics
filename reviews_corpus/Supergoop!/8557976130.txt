I have combo but primarily dry skin. I use this sunscreen after I apply a lightweight moisturizer in the morning, but it leaves my face ultra-shiny. It’s definitely not greasy and not shiny in a glittery way - not ideal because it doesn’t radiate that natural glow vibe. I don’t recommend this product when you know you won’t sweat or under makeup and powder. Don’t wear it on the beach otherwise sand will automatically stick to your face!! SUPER SHINY!
