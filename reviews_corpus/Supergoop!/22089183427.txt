TERRIBLE!! Very oily and the spray disperses so weirdly, does not cover your whole face yet gets sprayed on clothes and hair very easily. AND!! It is NOT a setting spray, my makeup stays on so well before, after I spay this is all downhill, my mascara gets on my eyelid, my eyeliner gets smudged. I HATE this so much. Oily & Ruins Makeup
