Supergoop gifted me their Every. Single Face sunscreen in exchange for my honest opinion.Sunscreen is an indispensable summer accessory and i am a sucker for good sunscreens.I was super excited to try this new stuff from super goop. I found the packing to be super cute . The carton states it is vegan and its really important. The product is white when squeezed out and the best part is it glides smoothly all over the face and does not leave any white cast as most sunscreens do. But I found it to be super greasy and slick. My face looked smeared with oily which I dint like much. I had to dab a little powder to tone down down the shine. On the other hand it is good to keep dry skin moisturized . I would prefer using it during the winters when my skin gets dry and flaky. It does not have any fragrance which is good for me but it has a weird chemical smell which is not felt after a while. Despite making my face look oily it proved to be a good barrier against the sun. I would definitely consider purchasing it if it came with a matte formula. Good stuff but oily.
