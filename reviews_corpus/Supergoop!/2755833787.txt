i was very skeptical at first. after my first application, almost decided to return it because it feels cakey for the first good minute. but guys im so glad i gave it a chance. the cakey look dissolves very quickly and your face end up looking fresh and matte. i have oily skin and had always hard time finding a good sunscreen, that i can also wear under makeup. never have been this impressed. it is perfect for my brown and oily skin. highly recommend it. game changer!
