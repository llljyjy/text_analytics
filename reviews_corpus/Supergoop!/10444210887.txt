I was gifted by Supergoop, and they are definitely a favorite brand of mine so I was excited to try this resetting Spray with SPF. It did not disappoint. It wasnâ€™t sticky and best of all of smelled so good! I loved getting like whiffs off it here and there. The fact that it has SPF is just icing on top! nan
