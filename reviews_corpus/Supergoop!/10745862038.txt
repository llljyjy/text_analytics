For awhile now I kept seeing posts of this product but I was using neutrogena sunscreen. So when it ran out I decided to give this a try. Not disappointed at all except for that I didnâ€™t switch sooner! It applies nicely, no smell & my makeup can sit on top with out breaking apart.  Bought the sample just in case but I will be back for the big one. Added to my daily routine
