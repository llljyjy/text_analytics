I don’t like writing bad reviews but I think this needs to be said. The idea is great! And this actually doesn’t smell bad nor does it have a white cast. I believe this isn’t for everyone. My pores were more noticeable when I applied this and I did try giving a few more tries but it just made my skin looked texturized. It might be that I have dry skin that this doesn’t suit me the best. Not for dry skin
