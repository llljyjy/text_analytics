I bought this for a trip to Hawaii, and I was initially really happy with how it went on because there wasn’t a white cast and it didn’t feel greasy, so an extra star for that! But unfortunately it didn’t really work. I have pretty dark skin already and I still got sunburnt after sitting in the sun for an hour. It also did leave a white cast when I reapplied. nan
