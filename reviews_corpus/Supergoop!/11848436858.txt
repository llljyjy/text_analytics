FIVE STARS - I have dumped SO much money into different facial sunscreens, and have been disappointed with all of them. They either end up making my skin look greasy, make me break out, dry me out, or transfer & get into my eyes by mid-day. I bought the mini version of this because I was afraid to dump more money into something I wouldn’t like. I saw great reviews for this, so I was hopeful, but I wasn’t ballsy enough to buy the full size until I tried it. I WILL 100% be buying the full size now. This is hands down the best sunscreen I’ve ever used. It does not leave my face looking or feeling greasy. It feels smooth, lightweight and is perfect for me. YES YES JUST BUY IT
