Ok, first of all wow second of all wow. I totally get the hype on the Glow screen now! Itâ€™s super lightweight, blends into the skin easily, feels hydrating of skin and leave your skin with a healthy glow. I have combination skin, it looks too shiny on my t-zone, but I can manage that with some setting powder. It has semi-thick texture with no scent. It does pill little if I apply to many layers of skincare care products on my skin. First of all wow second of all wow
