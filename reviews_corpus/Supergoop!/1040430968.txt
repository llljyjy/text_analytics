Loving this sunscreen! I always burn on my shoulders and chest but not with this. I love that there is no strong scent to it and it really gives a nice glow without being greasy. I took a chance and used it on my face. I layer my sun products and always use the glow stick and the watery one in the round bottle so I added this on top and wow it works amazing! You canâ€™t go wrong with this brand. They knock it out of the park every time. I used to hate sunscreen because it was sticky or greasy and left a white cast. This does none of those things. I wear it every day and I love it. Glowy but not greasy
