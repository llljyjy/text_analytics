Love this oil but 4 stars because of the price and because you need to use more SPF for optimal protection. If I could wear this alone for SPF 40 it would get 5 stars but it’s very expensive to have to use another sunscreen with it.It’s hydrating and feels good on my skin, doesn’t pill, and doesn’t look greasy at all (I have dry skin in a dry climate). It also layers well under makeup great for dry skin
