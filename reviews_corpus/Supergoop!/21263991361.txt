This sunscreen works decently as a base under makeup. It’s important to me to have adequate sun protection every day, but I also wear makeup most days and want the products I layer to be compatible. I have combo/oily skin and use a prescription retinoid at night, so it’s hard to find a routine that keeps my oils under control but doesn’t exacerbate my dry patches and make me look flat. Glow screen is pretty good for this. My soft matte foundation goes on smoothly over it and a bit of the glow carries through. I do get pretty oily later in the day and my makeup doesn’t last as long as if I use my usual primers, but it’s much better than the results I get with most sunscreens.I would not, however, wear this sunscreen on its own without makeup. For one thing, the lighter shade Champagne is too dark for my fair-light skin tone. It also has a very strange finish, almost metallic. It definitely doesn’t look natural by itself, at least not if you use enough to be properly protected from the sun. Good as a makeup base, weird on its own
