I am conflicted on this one. This was gifted by Supergoop by the way. SPf 40? That sounds great! It’s the first supergoop product I have tried so I didn’t know what to expect from their products. I do like the bright packaging but the spray left my face soaking wet with the product. It takes a long time to dry too. It has a very strong alcohol smell  after spraying that turns into a strong chemical smell later on. I wasn’t really happy about that. But when I try to wash it off with water alone, it doesn’t come off easily so that’s a good thing for me since I go to the beach a lot. I think I’ll only use it for that reason but wouldn’t apply it as setting spray when I am wearing makeup because of the smell. Is it just me?
