So greasy and shiny and heavy and has a strong “sunscreen” smell. I used on my body but with it being this heavy and thick no way I’d use on my face. For the beach it’s ok but not to wear while wearing regular clothes if you still want to feel clean and not sticky all over. I’m sure you could find a drugstore formula like this for much less. For face unseen and matte screen and glow screen are all so much better. nan
