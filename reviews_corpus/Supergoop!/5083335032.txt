This is another supergoop product that makes my eyes itchy and watery even though I don’t apply it around my eyes. If you have sensitive skin and eyes, please stay away from all Supergoop products. Last year I got an allergic reaction from their spf face spray and they keep on changing the ingredients and packaging, which I find very suspicious. If you’re looking for a great spf for your face I’d highly recommend Algenist or Josie Maran instead. Made me eyes itchy and watery
