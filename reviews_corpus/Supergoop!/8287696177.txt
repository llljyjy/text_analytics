So I was gifted by Supergoop! This product, and so far I’m impressed. First I love that it has spf built in so I’m already adding a layer of protection to my skin , but it’s so lightweight and helps my makeup last all day. I’ve been out running errands for hours , I applied some more to refresh and it still looks good as new New Fave !
