For all the rave reviews, I was expecting a god-tier product but this was just... okay. It feels exactly like a primer instead of sunscreen, which may be what some people want but since I mostly just wear sunscreen, I was hoping for something more like that. I really dislike the silicone feel of it, even if it were a primer. Also because it’s clear right away, I find it difficult to see if I’ve missed a spot without feeling around my face which is not my favorite activity, and more important to me since it’s sunscreen vs. other makeup types. nan
