This is a beautiful sunscreen - it appears white initially, but blends into the skin very rapidly and leaves no white cast behind. It leaves a dewy and flattering finish on dry skin and the smell is exactly that of the sunscreen you grew up with (but it feels nicer lol. What causes that smell anyway!? It’s so specific and yet ubiquitous)All this said, I’ve got to point something out. The product says it’s 1.7 fl oz. But WHEW that feels like a tiny tube! I don’t believe Supergoop is lying though; in fact, I think this is probably quite honest packaging. But here’s something important to keep in mind: will the tiny packaging lead you to use less of the product? It’s important to always apply sunscreen in the proper amount. Even as a product tester, I felt my brain go “whoa careful! Don’t use up all of it in one go!!” So be aware that if your brain works like mine - you’ll need to fight it for adequate sun protection!Gifted by Supergoop, hope this review helps you decide whether it’s for you! nan
