I really wanted to like this since I love Unseen Sunscreen, but I wanted a mineral version with tint.  It was very thick and chalky.  The color match was just okay.  It might be okay to smear on for more heavy duty coverage in the summer, but it didnâ€™t hit the mark for light, everyday wear for me.  Wish I could return it. There Are Better Options
