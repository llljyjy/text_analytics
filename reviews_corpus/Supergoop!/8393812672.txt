The Super Goop Glowscreen is a staple in my everyday routine!! Wether it’s a no makeup day or I use it as a primer, it always leaves my skin looking dewy and sun kissed.  I love that because of the golden tint it doesn’t leave a white cast on your face, but you still get the ultimate protection with 40 spf! The Skincare Product of the Summer
