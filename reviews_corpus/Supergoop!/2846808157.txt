I’ve used the unseen sunscreen by Supergoop but I wanted to try this one since Glow Sunscreen  gives you more of a glow. I use this after I apply my moisturizer and the texture is lightweight & also very hydrating which I love! Doesn’t smell like sunscreen at all which is a plus! Definitely gives me a natural glow! Gives you a natural glow!
