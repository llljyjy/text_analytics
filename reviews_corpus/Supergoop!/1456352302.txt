My whole family loves this sunscreen. We all wear it regularly. It spreads very easily and does not leave a cast. I use it every day on my neck. My husband likes it because it spreads easily over his very hairy body. :) My kid likes it, too. We keep it in a jug on the kitchen counter to easily pump and apply on our way out. I keep the small version in my makeup bag, plus small and medium for day trips and plane travel. I have never been loyal to a sunscreen brand/formula until this one! Truly the best everyday/ all the time sunscreen
