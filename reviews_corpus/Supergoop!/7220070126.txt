Finally, a sunscreen I can apply throughout the day that doesnâ€™t ruin your makeup! The Supergoop (Re)setting sunscreen did not leave my skin feeling sticky after application. The spray is a fine lightweight mist. This keeps my skin feeling protected. It even works great on days I am not wearing make-up! This item was gifted to me by Supergoop but I would buy it again with my own money! nan
