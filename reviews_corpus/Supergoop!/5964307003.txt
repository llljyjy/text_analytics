I am thrilled to add Supergoop’s Glow Screen to my daily skincare regiment. It has an SPF of 40, is shimmery & tinted (light-to-medium), and doesn’t leave a white-cast on my skin. It has a slight sunscreen scent and leaves my skin looking radiant - you can use it alone or under makeup. The tube is compact and easy to trace with; the applicator tip is very nice as well and ensures that too much product doesn’t come out since a little goes a long way! nan
