I have tried so many sunscreens. I understood a long time ago that I needed to use sunscreen, but it was so difficult for me to want to apply sunscreen when it would always make my makeup look oily or slip off. However, this sunscreen was a game changer! It is the first sunscreen I have found that doesnâ€™t impact the way my makeup wears throughout the day. I will definitely be repurchasing! Great Sunscreen!
