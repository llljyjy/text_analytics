This product was gifted by Supergoop and is unlike anything else I’ve tried before for sun protection. I think you have to have dry skin if you’re wanting to use something like this, otherwise it would be too oily. But my dry skin drinks it up! My skin looks healthy, plump, and dewy. I will say that I need to let this absorb into the skin before applying my makeup, but it works well as a primer once I let it sink into the skin. I definitely recommend if you have dry to normal skin! nan
