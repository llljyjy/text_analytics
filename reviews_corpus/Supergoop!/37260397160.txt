I really love this product! I tend to have issues with sunscreens feeling greasy on my face and making me look oily and shiny, but this spf fixed that issue. While I originally bought it to be my main sunscreen, I found it layers beautifully with the cream sunscreen I already had, which provides me with more security because I know It will actually protect me from the sun. The formula is very soft and it easily eliminates any shininess left behind by my cream sunscreen. It makes my face look great and I donâ€™t find myself having sensory issues with my sunscreen anymore. I pair this with the hero brand sunscreen if anyone was wondering. Definitely try this out I totally recommend it Blends seamlessly into my cream sunscreen!
