I was so excited to try the SuperGoop Re Setting Refreshing Mist with SPF. I love a good setting spray and always look for new ways to infuse SPF into my routine. I got the product and the packaging is nice - very sleek. You have to shake it to activate it, which makes a loud noise and I didnt find was a good experience. The formula smells like sunscreen mixed with coconut, so not a pleasant scent. When it hit my skin immediately got a painful burning feeling - I donâ€™t have sensitive skin so was surprised. The feeling left after a while but it really turned me off to the product. The nozzle / spray is super pointed and really over saturates a small part of your face rather than being a true mist.
