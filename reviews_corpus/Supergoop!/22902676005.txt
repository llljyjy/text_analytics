Shouldn’t be marketed as a sunscreen, instead as a primer. I’m not a fan of the consistency and every time I put it on it just feels like it’s clogging my pores. It has a velvety consistency and it just feels as if it immediately sinks into my skin which makes it impossible to distribute it evenly. I wanted to like this but some products aren’t for everyone nan
