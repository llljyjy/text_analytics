A wonderful gentle mineral spf for the eye area. This is one of the only SPFs that is not painful for me to use around the eyes. That alone justifies buying it and I have many times. The tint is helpful for minimizing darks circles, but I think a proper concealer is still needed if the dark circles are very noticeable. This bottle lasts a very long time, so is a good purchase for me. I think the key is using a small amount and massaging it in until it is sheer around the eyes. Gentle for eyes!
