First of all, I absolutely love the finish this gives. Idk why a lot of people don’t. I just if you’re looking for a matte finish then this wouldn’t suck to you. It is a bit weird to blend but that’s because it dries as it blends, kind of like the Fenty foundation. I appreciate this feature bc the finish not only is the finish dewy, it’s also not tacky and it creates a smooth film over the face, unlike the Ilia super serum tint (too oily). That aside, I have seen reviews about the colors being way off and at first I thought so too, but you have to remember this is a mineral sunscreen first and foremost. It takes time to blend in and oxidize to the correct shade so I really think everyone may be a shade lighter than they think. Because of this I don’t think the names are correct for this selection of shades. I am not fair, usually. This is the first time my correct shade is considered fair. I’m usually light skinned with yellow/warm undertones. So of course I didn’t go for the shade that actually matched me first, I went darker and it was a big mistake bc this oxidizes. The fair neutral turned out to be right for me because as it oxidizes it turns more warm. Frankly, this matches me more than any foundation ever has! So glad I didn’t listen to the reps at Sephora and just got sample of the shade I thought I’d be and one lighter. Try this out before you give up on this amazing cc cream. THIS OXIDIZES
