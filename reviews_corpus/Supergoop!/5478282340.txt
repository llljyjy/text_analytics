I always love to try out new sunscreens as I live in Florida and the sun here is absolutely brutal. I love the idea of a spray sunscreen, the packaging is adorable, and the mixing balls inside make shaking it super fun. I think I had a reaction to this sunscreen, but I will continue to use it (at least on my body) because it caused some pimples on my face that I never get otherwise. I wouldn’t recommend if your skin isn’t sensitive. Gifted by Supergoop! New supergoop!
