I was looking for a product that protects my skin without leaving product residue or turning my face white. Iâ€™ve been using this product for a while now and this is one of the products I grab when I stock up on Sephora. It applies smoothly on the skin and is not sticky at all. Works well with sensitive skin. A must-have for daily/travel.
