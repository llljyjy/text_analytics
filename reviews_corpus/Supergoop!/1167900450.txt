Amazing! I LOVE this product. I’m a HUGE fan of multi tasking products. I tend to avoid face sunscreen because of the texture and I almost always break out. However, this hybrid sunscreen and makeup primer is worth it’s weight in gold. I even apply this down  my jawline and neck! Will probably buy the Large size as soon as I run out!! This product is also a CLEAN sunscreen which in my book is how all sunscreen should be considering how harmful other toxic sunscreens can be on our environment and health. nan
