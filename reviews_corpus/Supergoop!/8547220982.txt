All right y’all I’m gonna first off say I am not a fan of chemical SPF in most cases. I have very easily sensitized skin, and typically chemical SPF is not good for me. But when I saw the texture and consistency of this sunscreen I knew I needed to try it. Supergoop tops the game when it comes to sunscreen, and this is no deviation from that. It comes out thicker than I expected but immediately melts down onto your skin like water. It blends in so seamlessly and doesn’t leave any residue on your face, it leaves a nice glow, but not super dewy. It does smell a lot like sunscreen but I noticed it dissipates pretty quickly. This is going to be perfect for summer time, and is great for anybody who likes a lightweight sunscreen. It is pretty hydrating, but since it’s so thin it is not super moisturizing.  It’s super nice under make up since it is so light weight, and does not pill. Overall I am so impressed and this is definitely going to stay in my routine. When a mineral SPF lover coverts
