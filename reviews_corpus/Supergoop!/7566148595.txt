Received this complimentary from Supergoop in exchange for an honest review. It’s nice to have a product you can use to reapply sunscreen especially over makeup. I do notice that it makes my face a little oilier than usual but it’s easily fixed by putting powder on top. It has that sunscreen smell mixed in with eucalyptus. It’s minty but doesn’t bother me too much. nan
