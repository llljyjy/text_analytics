This spf is very lightweight and easy to absorbed into the skin. The active ingredients are standard US approved UV filters, Which is not as advanced as those sold in the Europe countries. I am glad that the formula is reef safe, safe to the ocean also safe on us. It is a bit tacky though upon first application.  Gifted by supergoop to exchange my honest opinion. nan
