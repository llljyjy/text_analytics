3 steps in 1 product-replacing my foundation+SPF+powder.This brightens and protects. Love it. I think it looks beautiful. Applies kinda dry on face when first applying since it’s mineral-based, but that’s OK since using a beauty blender sponge works well- and that also means it’s not oily. I love the Matte Screen also, which applies much more smoothly and blurs pores (the Matte Screen one) - but this CC Screen has a brighter shade, whereas the Matte Screen has a neutral tone.The shade 215N is a tad light for me (usually I’m light medium neutral) but that’s OK because I love the brightening. Love this- 3 steps in one
