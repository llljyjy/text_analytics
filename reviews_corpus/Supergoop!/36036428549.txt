I love this sunscreen so much! I put this on top of my morning moisturizer and bam, it’s silky smooth matte perfection. My skin doesn’t feel irritated or dry whatsoever and it feels like barely anything is there. Absolutely no white cast on my skin (though I have fair skin, so I am not sure how it is for people of different skin tones). This is a dreamy facial sunscreen from a brand I’ve long been a fan of. My one and only gripe, and the reason it’s not a five star product is that you pay quite a hefty price for this product. Considering how much sunscreen is needed to protect the face and neck area, I feel like it’s a luxury to use this product, when it is something I use everyday. I would hope they could increase the size of this product because I’d love to see a larger size available, but the price point feels prohibitive. Excellent mineral sunscreen
