This sunscreen goes on very smooth and it’s scentless. I put this on right after I wash my face and moisturize and it doesn’t cause any issues with my makeup. I really love the clean ingredients and that it is water resistant for 80 minutes. My one complaint is it seems to separate a bit so if you don’t give the container a good shake, your first squeeze will be watery followed by the cream of the lotion. But overall I think this is a great every-day sunscreen; I like to use it on my face and I use it on my 2-year-old’s face as well. I love Supergoop. nan
