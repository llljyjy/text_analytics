This new Supergoop SPF is one of my new favorites. Also love Supergoop’s Glowscreen. The new Every Single Face SPF is great for days not wanting a glowy look, just natural and light. Love SPF 50!! The watery lotion sinks into my skin effortlessly. It reminds me of a lightweight lotion moisturizer, not oily at all but perfectly moisturizing for my dry areas. I’ve worn with and without makeup, works well both ways. Highly recommend! Amazing Every Day SPF!
