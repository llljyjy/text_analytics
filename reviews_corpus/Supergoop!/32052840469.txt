Been using non stop the Daily Dose Bioretinol + Mineral SPF 40 by Supergoop! and to be honest I’m obsessed, so far this is my favorite Supergoop product. It’s very lightweight, doesn’t cause any irritation at all, it goes amazing under makeup and even alone it gives you a healthy glowy skin, it’s a little bit tinted and that helps with evening the skin tone. Totally recommend this product Your skin will be glowing & grateful
