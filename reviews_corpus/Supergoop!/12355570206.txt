This sunscreen oil was a pleasant surprise! It leaves you glowing and hydrates your skin without leavening an oily sensation. I use it as the last step in my morning routine before applying my final sunscreen. I usually do the unseen or the everyday lotion and they work perfecty together. Layering spf gives me peace of mind and assure me that Iâ€™m good protected from the sun. I love it! big fan of Supergoop
