I LOVEDDD the old Supergoop SPF eye cream from a few years ago that came in a tube. It was way easier to dispense and did not waste product like this packaging does! This one dispenses way too much and I end up throwing away 1/2 of whatâ€™s dispensed. The cream itself is okay-  it ends up balling up when I apply concealer or foundation... even after waiting 5 minutes for it to dry/soak in. Poor packaging
