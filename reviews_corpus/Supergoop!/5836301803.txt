Gifted by Supergoop. Right of the bat, I have to say this is not my favorite product from Supergoop. This is a great additional product to use with SPF but not instead of SPF. Although layering different SPFs may be beneficial in many ways, most people will usually just apply a single one, and on its own this SPF does not offer enough protection. Overall, this is a good product when used properly but not on its own. Not a stand alone SPF
