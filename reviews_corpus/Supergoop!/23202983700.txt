I liked the texture of this sunscreen/primer a lot. It’s not runny but it also is easy to spread and absorbs well. The packaging says a dime sized amount but I didn’t need that much. It worked well as a primer - my foundation stuck to it well. It is VERY glowy so when I applied it my face looked really shiny. I prefer a matte finish so I probably will only use this when I plan to wear makeup overtop of it. Glowy, multitasking sunscreen
