I’ve never tried sunscreen oil so this is a great creation from Supergoop! I received this complimentary from Supergoop to test out and review. I think it’s nice for dry skin and saves time for someone who well versed in skincare oils. It combines the power of ceramides, fatty acids & microbiome friendly prebiotics with broad spectrum UV protection in a nourishing lightweight oil. Its formulated to replenish the skin barrier, it will soothe, soften & provide lasting hydration all while protecting you from the sun. This has performed well for my skin and has worked well paired with other skincare products; no pilling or breaking down makeup. Wonderful new product!
