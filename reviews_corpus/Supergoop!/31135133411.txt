I have been using SuperGoop Daily Dose Hydra-Ceramide Boost + SPF 40 Sunscreen in my daily skin routine for several days. My skin has been on the drier side during these winter months, so i welcomed extra hydration. This oil absorbed into my skin pretty easily. I love that this contains ceramides, squalane, etc for hydration and help with fine lines. Overall, i like this product, I’m just a little confused with how to use since it indicates to use with an additional SPF sunscreen for optimal protection. If this is spf 40, isn’t that sufficient enough unless I’m directly in the sun for a long period? If they clarified this, that would be great. SPF and hydration
