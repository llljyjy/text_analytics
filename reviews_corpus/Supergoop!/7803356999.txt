I really like the appeal and convenience of this product for reapplying sunscreen throughout the day. I do think it’s a little bit greasy however and it’s formulated with alcohol so you have to shake it to combine the two layers before you use it. This might make it a little bit drying on some skin types. The smell is very herbal and refreshing if you like the essential oil type of smells. If you don’t like that then you will definitely not like this product. I wish it was formulated without fragrance but regardless I think the convenience of this makes it worth it. Complimentary from supergoop Convenient but greasy
