It’s okay, nothing special. I feel like it makes a pretty big mess for how low the spf is. I just feel like for all that it should atleast be more. I haven’t tried this over makeup yet but I’ve used it over my dried down skincare and it clings slightly on my super dry skin even though it’s well hydrated. I found better ways to reapply sunscreen throughout the day and on top of makeup so I won’t be repurchasing and will instead be passing this on. nan
