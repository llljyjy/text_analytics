Gifted by supergoop! supergoop never disappoints when it comes to their new products and sunscreens! This beauty definitely doesn’t fall short! I’m obsessed with the texture and the consistency! It absorbs into the skin beautifully while leaving a slight satin finish to the skin! Zero white cast and the perfect size to take on the go! This one is going to be a summer favorite! Such a great sunscreen!
