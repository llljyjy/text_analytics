This Watery Lotion SPF 50 I was gifted by SuperGoop has a very nice lightweight consistency.  I love that it glides smoothly on my face and doesn’t leave any white cast. I really want to love this product but I don’t like how my skin felt oily and greasy after a few hours. I have a combo skin so you might have a different result. I am also not a fan of its alcohol-y smell although it doesn’t really linger. Nice but has a greasy-feeling
