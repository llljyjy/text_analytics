A little bit of a learning curve learning how to get the powder to disperse and then get the brush back in it’s cover (twist it on the inside of the cap and the bristles will all get back in there!) but this has been awesome. When it’s the middle of the day and I’m in my car or in the park reading, super easy to dust my face with no mirror. Hasn’t broken out my sensitive skin. Learning curve, but sensitive skin approved
