I am so late to the idea of wearing SPF everyday since I always wear a tinted moisturizer that includes sun protection, however now in my 30’s I don’t want to risk my skin. I have never been a fan of sunscreens because of their heaviness and sticky feeling. This oil is the complete opposite of that. It’s light, moisturizing, and wears great under my skin tint.
