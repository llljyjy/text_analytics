This product was complimentary from the brand. I’m a sucker for a face sunscreen and I love that this is easy to apply and also sets your makeup and has a nice finish. However, I wasn’t a huge fan of the smell of this. It’s not a deal breaker but definitely not what I expected. It’s also more of a spray than a mist which was a bit disappointing. Overall though, it’s an easy way to make sure you wear your sunscreen for the day which it the most important part! nan
