I was recommended this when it was new, and I have been using it for a few months now. I have sensitive skin, and it hasn’t caused me any issues. I usually use it for my 12-hour indoor shifts when I’m not wearing any makeup. I haven’t used it under foundation, so I cannot attest to that. I also used it while tubing this summer--I reapplied when I was already wet/sweating, and I didn’t get sunburned. My only real complaint is that it leaves my skin looking a little oily, but it doesn’t bother me enough to not use it. nan
