This is absolutely my favorite sunscreen I’ve ever tried, and I’ve tried A LOT. I love sunscreen and I work outside so I use a lot of it, reapplying every 2 hours. It is so light and sinks in and leaves such a nice texture, it’s not too heavy even under my mask when I am inside. Not sticky or drying or greasy at all. So good! Perfect sunscreen
