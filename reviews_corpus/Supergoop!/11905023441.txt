I love SPF and try to wear it daily. I have tried this product with and without makeup, to see both effects. With me having oily skin, I feel this amount of glow might be too much. I will say that there’s no glitter involved, which is a plus for me. I could use this in my high points, underneath highlighter, but I can’t personally wear it on its own though. I do recommend this to all skin types, to all SPF lovers, and anyone who enjoys a glowy natural look. Very Dewy Look
