I LOVE LOVE LOVE this sunscreen. It has a mild tint to it that covers my dark spots really well and evens my skin tone. Feels really weightless on the skin as if you have nothing on. It feels like a tinted moisturizer without the oiliness. If youâ€™re really pale this may be too dark for you but I am a little lighter than medium shade and it works perfectly for me Love this
