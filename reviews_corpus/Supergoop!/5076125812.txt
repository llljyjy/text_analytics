The good thing about this is that it leaves no white cast at all, bad thing is that alcohol is the second ingredient and it makes you look greasy if you have combination to oily skintypes. It also has that typical susncreen scent and I find the formula and texture to feel very low quality and cheap. It’s a sunscreen for $30+ and it’s definitely not worth it. It also irritates the eyes so we wary of applying it around the eye area. Probably one of my least favorite supergoop sunscreens but their unseen and the stick susncreen is amazing so defintiely reach for those two ! nan
