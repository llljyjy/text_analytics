I feel like this product gets the hype it deserves. After just once use I knew it would become a staple in my collection. It’s the perfect base for everyday makeup. I love how it’s an spf with a glow in it but it always has a nice tint which does a good job of adding some color and evening out my skin tone. I achieve the perfect healthy glow with this product. It’s hard for me to find an spf that doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin but this one works for me! A NEW HOLY GRAIL
