I received this item complimentary from Supergoop! for my honest review. I’ve been using this product for about a week now and really like it a lot. I’ve never used a sunscreen oil before, but this is a product I can see myself adding to my skincare routine. I tend to have dry skin, especially in the winter so this is great for hydrating. I would say a little goes a long way. I really only need a drop or two. It’s worked great with makeup too. I highly recommend giving this product a try! Awesome Sunscreen Oil
