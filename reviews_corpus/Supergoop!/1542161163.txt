Have been using for 3 years now and it’s the only thing I will use.  As a minimal makeup person, it has a great natural look that blurs the skin really well and blends into so many complexions nicely.  The mineral formula doesn’t feel greasy and controls shine throughout the day.  Holy grail for me. favorite spf product
