I would rate this higher but the spray bottle sucks so bad that so much of the mist comes out. This is the second time I bought this product and both times the spray nozzle is faulty and so much sunscreen messed leaks out. it’s frustrating when you’re paying for a product and so much of it is being wasted. I love supergoop products but this misses the mark when it comes to packaging. please fix this so I can buy one that works well. Faulty top spray nozzle
