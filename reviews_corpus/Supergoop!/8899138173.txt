I absolutely love all supergoop products and I am so excited for this new item. It has a great smell that isnâ€™t too sunscreeny. It has great heavy duty packaging that will be great for on the go in my purse or tote bag this summer. The sunscreen is pretty watery and does apply really nice. This product was gifted by supergoop. Best sunscreen
