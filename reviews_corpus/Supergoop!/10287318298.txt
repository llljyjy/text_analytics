I absolutely love this spf. There is absolutely no white cast on my dark skin. Yes, you will be shiny for about an hour after applying. But I literally look like a teen girl again! It really gives a youthful appearance. After about an hour, the oils sink into the skin. I do have acne prone skin and have not had a single issue with breakouts. I feel that my skin is actually looking better and better every day I use it. It keeps the skin so soft. By the end of the day, the oiliness has completely sunk in. I only use this on no makeup days. Yes, it does sting if it gets in your eyes. That’s the one thing I don’t like about supergoop but I’ll still give it a 5/5!!! amazing!!!
