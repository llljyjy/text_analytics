the first one i bought had a broken sprayer so i had to bring it back the next day.  the smell is kinda minty and if it gets in your month it’s not very fun.  it doesn’t burn your eyes as long as you keep them closed until your face feels dry.  this product is super handy to keep in a bag to re-apply sunscreen every two hours. nan
