First off, I did receive this product free of charge in exchange for a review. All thoughts and opinions expressed are my own. GLOWscreen is right! I mean, it says it right there on the squeeze tube, but I was still a bit startled at how luminous my skin was after applying a dime sized amount to my face and neck. I tried out the lighter of the two shades and I didn’t notice it pulling my already pale skin into a white cast or deepen it with the shimmer pigments. Personally, as someone with some texture and pitting from acne, I was NOT a fan of this alone on my face. Every single flaw on my face was basically given a spotlight. I would not wear this by itself, but it does leave skin looking naturally radiant when used under a powder. The texture of it is quite grippy, which kept my powder on pretty well. I didn’t notice any stinging in the eye area even though I did apply it very close. That’s always a major plus! However, and this is not something unknown to me with sunscreen, any hint of a zit that may have been brewing definitely came to a head the day after wear. Sunscreens tend to irritate my acne, this one was no exception. The inability to wear it alone aside, this is a pretty solid facial sunscreen in my opinion. I think it’s more suited to the body on me - I’ve tried it, it’s GORGEOUS. Decent, But Don’t Use Alone
