I love the texture and lightness but the product just doesn’t protect you from the sun well at all. There are much better products (at same price point!) out there that provide all day defense against sun damage. Made the mistake of taking this along as a trial during a weekend in California. Came home with mild sunburn on the face. I’ve had much longer sun exposure (up to 12 hours!) using other products (Lancôme and Dr. Brandt) and never had any redness in the face — and never had to reapply during the day! better products out there for all day protection
