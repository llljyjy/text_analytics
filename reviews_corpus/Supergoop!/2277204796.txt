This is my first time writing a review about a product on Sephora. I feel like it’s necessary for me to share my experience and spread the word about this sunscreen. This is by far the BEST sunscreen I have ever used! I deal with pretty sensitive reactive skin and I haven’t had any issues with this so far and I’ve been using it daily for about a month. Goes on so smooth and sinks right into your skin! Gives a beautiful healthy slightly dewy glow. Wears well under make up. I have only good things to say about it! I am seriously obsessed and happy to have finally found a sunscreen that works with my skin and I feel good about using. I even got my sister to start using it too and she feels the exact same way I do about it. Highly recommend!!! nan
