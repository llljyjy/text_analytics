I love this mist! It was gifted to me and I was reluctant at first because I was scared it would be too heavy. That is not the case at all! It is the perfect lightweight spray that leaves the skin looking hydrated. I love the fact that I donâ€™t have to get my hands lathered with product and it is the perfect on-the-go reset for the summer. Love this!
