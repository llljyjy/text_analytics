This was gifted by Supergoop! I’m always looking for a sunscreen that won’t break me out, and doesn’t have a sticky feeling, or make my makeup run, and this product meets all my needs! I also love that it’s a spray instead of a lotion. It’s mess free, and very easy to apply! I travel to the beach often so I will definitely be taking this with me! Mess free and easy to use!
