Unfortunately this product was very clogging to my pores, I am assuming due to it being so silicone based although my skin seems to handle other silicone products just fine so I am not sure! I got a ton of under the skin bumps on my chin after using this but with some skincare I managed to get rid of them after about 3 days! It’s a shame because I really liked the finish and it didn’t pill under makeup.. The texture was also a bit strange/unique. Hopefully it works for you! If you notice small bumps under the skin stop using it! Broke me out
