This sunscreen gifted by Supergoop is a game changer! I usually just use sunscreen integrated in my daily moisturizer. This does not break me out or make my makeup look weird. Thereâ€™s no flashback. You have to reapply after 40 minutes of sweating or being wet. I have not been in a situation to sweat or be wet but this container is compact and easy to bring with you! nan
