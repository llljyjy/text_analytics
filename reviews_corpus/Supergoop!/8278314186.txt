I was a bit skeptical about trying this product so here is my honest review: love it when using makeup because it blends soooo well with your foundation, etc and gives you that natural luminous glow plus itâ€™s dark ish pigment for all the babes who tan a bit during summer. Not a fan when using it as a sunscreen only because it makes you look way too oily. nan
