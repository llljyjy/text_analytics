Golden hour is a great addition to making this product more inclusive for ALL skin colors. As SUPERGOOP goes, this product is great. Wonderful SPF coverage and the wearability is over a few hours. I will say that if you have dryer skin, the product will begin to get patchy after a while, but itâ€™s a small price to pay for sun protection. Makes my complexion look super pretty and glowy as well! nan
