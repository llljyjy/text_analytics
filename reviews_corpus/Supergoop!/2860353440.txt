I absolutely love this sunscreen!!! I’ve seen several reviews where people say it’s sticky. Are you guys rubbing it in? And are you giving your moisturizer a couple minutes to settle before applying your sunscreen? That works for me!! I have applied it every couple of hours and it’s never sticky on me. I’m in L❤️VE!!
