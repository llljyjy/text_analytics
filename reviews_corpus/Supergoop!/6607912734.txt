This product is super interesting! The mister is super smooth and high quality. The sunscreen looks pretty on the skin-- no white cast, blends in easily. However, I noticed after an hour or two in the sun sweating, my makeup completely broke up on my face underneath this spray. My makeup almost never breaks up, even when sweating so this was odd. I would recommend wearing this with minimal makeup or long-wear makeup underneath! This was gifted to me by supergoop! Pretty, but not the best with makeup
