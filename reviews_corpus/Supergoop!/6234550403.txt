Got this to try as a reef-safe, clean sunscreen.  Not a terrible product.  A little slimy but dries ok.  That said it is NOT reef safe!  It has Homosalate 8%, Octocrylene 4%,both are on the banned list of ingredients.  Savethereef and Surfrider both have easy lists to access.  I canâ€™t understand how Supergoop writes that label and Sephora sells it with that label.  Do better! Not reef safe!
