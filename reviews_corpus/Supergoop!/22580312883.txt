one star because it’s clear sunscreen, half a star because its matte, and another half a star because it doesn’t stink. i also love that it’s spf 40! but other than that, this stuff ain’t it.. at least for me! it peels so much! with or without makeup! it just sits on top of the skin like another layer. ugh! to the back of the skincare cabinet it goes! i really wanted to love this product
