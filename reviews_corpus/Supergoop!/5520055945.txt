This was gifted by Supergoop! Overall, I enjoy this product! I will say, I donâ€™t like this on top of my makeup because it makes me a bit oily and you can see my pores. However, I love this on no makeup days, days at the beach, etc. It is a refreshing smell and I can tell it protects my skin! Love this!
