I got this in a Supergoop trial set when I was looking for a way to reapply my SPF over a full face of makeup. This was recommended to me and I thought it would be a better option than a powder because I have very dry skin. First of all the spray is so hard to control, spits big droplets at my face and makes my foundation splotchy, and worst of all it got ALL over my hair and made it look extremely greasy as if I hadn’t showered in a week, and I had JUST washed my hair and was on my way out the door. Honestly the hair thing alone made me never want to use this again, because the spray is so uncontrollable there’s no way I would be able to completely shield the front of my hair short of wearing a bonnet or something, which I shouldn’t have to do and can’t do when I’m out and about! So glad I got this in a small size with the trial set because I would have been so angry if I wasted money on the full product. nan
