Gifted by soopergoop.Received this as a gift from the brand for honest review I have been using this brand for quite a while. This spf lotion is what I expected. I have dry skin and it absorbs really well and is not greasy. After a long wear there was no breakout as I have pores on my skin. Packaging is so cute and easy to carry in a purse. Absorbs really well
