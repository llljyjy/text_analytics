I love this.. It’s definitely different than I expected but in a good way. It goes on and feels really smooth and makes my face a little shiny/glowy (but not too much) which I think looks pretty and natural. It might seem like an expensive amount to spend on a sunscreen but it’s honestly worth it to protect your face and a little goes a long way yes
