Hands down the best sunscreen out there! It goes so smoothly and easily on the face and doesnâ€™t leave a sticky white residue. It looks like a yellow balm, which is different from the usual sunscreens I am used to. I have tried many sunscreens from Dr Dennis Gross (which was great), Murad to drugstore brands like Neutrogena and this one beats them all. The best sunscreen I have tried!
