I love this product.  I use this on those days where I’m not putting on foundation but I want a little bit of coverage and definitely sun protection.  It starts out looking a little orange, but I’m about as pale as you can get, and surprisingly it blends in and looks pretty natural, even on my ghostly pale skin.  It keeps my skin matte and I feel it looks really great for a minimal makeup look.  I don’t think I’d ever wear this as a primer under makeup, but I also don’t feel like I need to wear makeup over it as it blurs well.  This is pretty much the only thing I wear for vacations now and I love that this is all I have to take for complexion products!  Definitely a fav I’ll continue to buy. Love this!
