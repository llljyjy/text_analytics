I really, really tried with this product, I wanted to love it, but I’m about halfway through the bottle and I’ve burned every single time I’ve used it. It pretty much does nothing except leave a slick feel on your skin. Might as well use baby oil. Don’t waste your money on this is you’re looking for actual sun protection. Doesn’t prevent sunburn AT ALL
