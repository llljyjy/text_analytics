I’m SO excited for this sunscreen! I love mineral sunscreens and the bakuchiol (bioretinol) is a huge plus. Sometimes I don’t have enough time to layer several skincare products in the morning, so this is a huge timesaver. It also contains collagen boosting peptides, and  grape seed and green tea extract. Camellia sinensis leaf extract is also one of my favorite ingredients, it makes my skin feel so smooth and hydrated without making my combination skin feel oily.I’ve used Supergoop! products for years and I can’t wait for long term results of the bakuchiol in this version! And SPF40: perfect for my day to day needs. I’m so excited for this version!
