So far, so good! I’ve never tried sunscreen oil so this is a great innovation coming from no other than Supergoop! I think it’s great for dry skin and saves time for someone that’s an avid skincare oil user, especially in the morning. For my combination skin, I usually don’t use oils too much but here in Colorado where the winters are cold and dry, this is great!! I had some dry patches from spending a weekend on the mountains in the cold winter air and this oil helped moisturize and restore my skin barrier pretty nicely. It gets absorbed pretty fast and feels lightweight on the skin. I would avoid applying on pimple areas though as I normally do with oils (although this product is non-comedogenic, another plus). Other than that I love the high SPF rating and innovative formula!*Complimentary from Supergoop for an honest review Great for dry skin!
