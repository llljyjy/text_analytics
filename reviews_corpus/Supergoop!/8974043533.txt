Multiple time user of this product. Absolutely love it. I have sensitive skin-- especially to creams and oils of any kind and I love this sunscreen. It is protective and high quality. Leaves a good finish-- not too matte and not oily. Have been using this product for a couple years now. Plus I like that it has ’blue light’ protection. Best sunscreen
