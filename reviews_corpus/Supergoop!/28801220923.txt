I will 100% be using this in summer! Although the spray comes out very like clumpy it’s almost like spraying hose it doesn’t apply evenly it’s hard to spray all over your face  . Also the smell is very potent which is expected with sunscreen but it made my eyes water and kind of burn a little, the pain went away after a couple seconds. Although I really do love the concept of this product if the spray was better I would be all for it. Gifted by Supergoop! it’s alright
