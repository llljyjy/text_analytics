This supergoop glowscreen is an ultimate must have.  It has Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin B5, sea lavender and cocoa peptides all known to be beneficial to the skin. This made my skin look radiant and smooth. I don’t have to even put make up in the morning when I use this because it made me look fresh and glowing. It also SPF 40, so it’s a multi-tasker primer.  This primer is also made of clean ingredients, cruelty-free and gluten-free which is a huge plus. The formula is non-sticky and very lightweight which is perfect for Cali weather. Overall, I love it and would definitely add in my skincare routine. Love my glow!
