The worst sunscreen I ever used. It’s very oily and gives an unnatural glow - looks like you put highlighter all over your face. The tinted formula looks yellow on fair skin and makes it difficult to apply it evenly without looking patchy. This sunscreen is shiny to wear by itself, but PILLS HORRIBLY under makeup.Disappointing all over… Horrible
