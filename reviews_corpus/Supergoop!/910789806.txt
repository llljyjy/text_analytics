I have finally found a sunscreen that I can wear on my face that A) doesn’t burn B) doesn’t dry out my skin C) doesn’t pill and flake and D) isn’t greasy! I actually look forward to using this in the morning. I apply it after my moisturizer and it goes on really smoothly and the texture reminds me of Dream Matte Mousse from the early 00’s which is fun and nostalgic. Finally!
