I have melasma (dark brown-grey patches all over my face), and this product provides top-notch protection against all the UV factors that can exacerbate my condition!  For me, mineral, zinc oxide based sunscreens provide superior protection against UVA rays, and they don’t absorb the rays and heat (which can trigger melasma) like chemical suncreens.  This particular sunscreen also is PA++++ (the best you can get with 4 + signs) for UV protection.  In addition, tinted physical sunblocks that use iron oxides for the tint provide protection against visible light (which is almost half of the light that we experience) and even blue light from computer devices.  This last part we all should be concerned with, but if you have melasma, it’s critical to get a sunscreen that has iron oxides in it!  This CC Screen provides all the protection I need AND 90% coverage for my melasma patches.  I imagine that finding a good color match is key (since this is full coverage and like a foundation), and I really lucked out here -- I’m half Caucasian / half Asian, and 226W is perfect on me -- and it’s not even orange!  It’s a lovely light golden yellow base, and it’s a better color match for me than any expensive foundation I’ve tried.  You just have to work in the product well, since it is a sunscreen first and foremost.  But once you do, the coverage looks so natural -- not greasy at all.  I wear this in the daytime, and I wear the Supergoop Tinted Mattescreen at night.  If you don’t want foundation like coverage, get the tinted Mattescreen (it’s a light neutral-beige, mousse-like texture). Holy Grail for Melasma / Hyperpigmentation
