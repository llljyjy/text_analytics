Long story short; Pairs well with my skin routine and works well under my foundation as a primer. No irritation and is an awesome primer. Makes skin feel nice. No smell, feels nice on the skin. Does its job. Nice matte finish and very easy on the skin :) Cons; cannot re-apply over makeup, makes my face cakey. I want to try the other products like the mist or brush to re-apply.Detailed review; I have combo skin and I am avid make-up user in Miami. I use a drunk elephant skin routine (Protini Polypeptide Cream, C-Firma Fresh Day Serum, B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum, Marula Oil) under this sunscreen primer and it works sooo well with the Lancôme Teint Idole Long Wear Foundation and Tarte Shape Tape concealer. I’ve also paired it with the Maybelline Fit Me foundation and works well, too! It goes on LOVELY on the skin and is a great primer. It feels like a matte film that dissolves into the skin after a minute. My foundation also has sunscreen, it pairs well. Its been nice to wear with my make-up routine. The only con is, I cannot re-apply it over my make-up because it gives it a cakey texture. The cost is very high for me but after using it daily (pea size goes a long way!) it has been a great bang for my buck. I purchased it in March of 2022 and still have some in my bottle in October of 2022! I don’t have to buy more for another month or so. No skin reaction at all! Nice matte finish. Buy it! :) BUY IT! great primer, too.
