The product itself is fine; I actually quite like it. It’s smooth and creamy, and it glides under my eyes very easily. The product blends nicely and goes on clear when you blend it in. It brightens up my under eyes and really makes them shine. My issue with the product is the packaging; well, the pump more specifically. It is very difficult to press down without pumping out too much product. Most of the time, it almost always pumps out way too much cream, and you end up wasting some of the cream because you don’t need much of it to cover your eye area. Supergoop, if you are reading this review, please change the packaging! I really wish this product came in one of those squeezing tubes, that way you have more control over the amount of cream you squeeze out. This product really is fantastic. It would be a shame for this product to be underrated all because of its packaging. Love the product—packaging...not so much
