Makes my moisturizer under it pill horribly and the glow it gives does not look natural. I have dry skin so I love glowy products but this just makes me looks sweaty. It was expensive so I will finish it up on boat/beach days when I don’t need to put anything over or under it and can wear it alone but I definitely won’t repurchase and don’t understand the hype. nan
