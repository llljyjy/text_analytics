The pros are it’s great for reapplying sunscreen without removing makeup. It helps my powders melt into my skin. It’s portable and the right amount of sunscreen. There is no worry of white cast. The cons are it makes my eyes water. It’s not really matte as it does leave a shine. The scent is strange and kinda potent. It tends to make the hairs around my face a bit stringy/oily so I have to make sure I pull my hair up. This was complimentary from Supergoop but I’ve actually purchased this on my own before twice. The cons don’t stop me from using it as I feel the pros outweigh the cons. I just have to shake really well, hold my breath, keep my eyes shut tight during and after for a few seconds after misting. I’d rather endure the few cons than take my makeup off and reapply a sunscreen. nan
