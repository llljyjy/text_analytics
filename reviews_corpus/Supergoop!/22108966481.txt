It is a new type skin care product. It’s my first time to try a product which is the combination of face oil and sunscreen. So far I like it. It’s easy to use and works well. It hydrated my skin and at same time I believe it is protecting my skin from the sun. It’s a good one to use in dry season like winter but now sure whether it will be too oily for summer.
