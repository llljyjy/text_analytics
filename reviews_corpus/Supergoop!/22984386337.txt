I’m picky with sunscreens, but this is my favorite! It’s got a smooth, silicone-like texture that dries matte and silky. No white caste at all. Good for dry skin (though I use a moisturizer underneath). I burn easily, and can sit in the sun for 2+ hours with this without burning. silicone texture, no white cast, good for dry skin
