The actual sunscreen seems great but until they change the packaging and the spray device this product is trash. I’ve tried the mini and now the full size and they both leak when carried on its side (like in a purse or bag). The spray nozzle gets clogged and it sprays out in globs and dribbles instead of any sort of mist. Don’t recommend this one. Leaks everywhere, nozzle clogs and dribbles
