I am complimented in this almost daily. And I wear it daily. I’m complimented on ZOOM CALLS in this stuff. It’s amazing, it’s such a soft and perfect glow, I never wear foundation and this evens my skin tone with the little bit of tint it has. It’s the perfect primer, I wear it as makeup at night as well. Just put a little blush over it! Some notes for wear: Make sure all your other products are dry before putting it on so it goes on evenly and smooth. This step is key for oily skin!I almost always put other sunscreen (waterproof) over this later in the day/for going outside. You CAN layer it, but really only 1-2 times before it becomes a bit too shiny. You’re GLOWING
