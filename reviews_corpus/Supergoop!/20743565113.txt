When I start a new bottle the product goes on to the skin very nicely. It is thick and it does have a peach tone so it is good for brightening the eye area. When the bottle has been open for a while and gets a bit older I do agree with other reviewers hear that it pills on the skin. Having said that, I like that it is a mineral sunscreen and I like how my make up sits on top of it. Hence I do continue to purchase it again and continue wearing it. nan
