I got this and Shiseido’s newer Urban Environment during the spring sale. Comparatively the Shiseido UE is much better but also costs more for the same size. I didn’t experience any white cast but this did leave me super shiny. It also stings when I start sweating and it drips down into my eyes. This also has a much stronger sunscreen smell, I don’t particularly mind but it’s noticeable. I use sunscreen on my morning runs and wash my face afterward so I don’t know how it works as a primer. For such a liquidy formula, it does seem to take longer to absorb however I didn’t experience any breakouts. All in all, I like it enough to use it but I won’t buy it again. I prefer the UE much more over this one, it smelled nice, more natural finish, didn’t sting my eyes and had a nice light nude tint. This is an okay sunscreen, but just not for me. Just okay
