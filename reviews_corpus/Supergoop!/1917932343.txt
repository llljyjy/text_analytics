I have dry skin and this works great for when I need some extra dew to my skin. I don’t use it to set my makeup but it is perfect for reapplying sunscreen throughout the day without disturbing my makeup. I actually find it to make my powders melt into my skin and make everything look much more natural. I’m so happy they brought this product back and in the large size. I also love that it is clean because many of the spray sunscreens by popular brands found at the drugstore have had massive recalls recently due to the presence of cancer-causing chemicals. Love it!
