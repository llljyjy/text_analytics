This product has given me exactly what I wanted. If you don’t want a glowy look, don’t buy this. I use this as my first step after cleansing, followed with moisturizer, then glow screen. It gives me the perfect dewy, natural look I’m going for. I have normal to dry skin. It has also helped even my skin tone. I’ve had acne through my mid-twenties and this is definitely helping me recover from that. Helps give me a dewy, natural finish!
