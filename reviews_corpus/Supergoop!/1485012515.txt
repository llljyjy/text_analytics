This is too greasy for my oily skin, but my husband that has dryer skin loves it! I originally bought a trial size, but he asked me to buy a bigger bottle for him. He has trouble finding sunscreens that melt into his facial hair/beard without leaving an awful white cast. This does the job :) Beard approved
