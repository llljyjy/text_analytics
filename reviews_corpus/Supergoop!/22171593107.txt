I have 2 bottles one a replacement but now I know that it’s just a terribly made delivery. I’ve used plenty of sprays with varying viscosity and this sprayer is not the proper one they need to be using. It’s stops working pretty quickly and becomes basically useless. Therefore wasted money. Worst sprayer ever
