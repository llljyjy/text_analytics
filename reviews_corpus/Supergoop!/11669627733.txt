I’ve been so excited to try this and it did not disappoint! It’s very lightweight and makes my skin feel silky smooth. It gives a nice glow underneath my makeup. I got a shade slightly darker than I would normally get but it blends in really nicely. I would highly recommend this to as a sunscreen or just light skin tint! BETTER THAN I EXPECTED!!
