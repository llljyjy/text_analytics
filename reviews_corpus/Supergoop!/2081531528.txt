Product is great, packaging is crap. Like others have said, the top breaks and leads to product getting all over the place and making a mess. Not only is it a mess, itâ€™s wasting product. I would recommend the actual product yes but not until they fix their packaging. They are using cheap packaging that breaks after you unscrew the top a few times. Product is great, packaging is crap.
