Another plant retinol aka Bakuchoi in the market , this time from cult favorite brand Supergoop . I will be honest my dumb self thought it’s a sunscreen but it’s actually retinol with spf ! Great to use during the day - however please apply sunscreen WYTH this or else you need to use a lot of this . nan
