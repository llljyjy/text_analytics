Textured like a primer,  this is really,  really weird... until you get used to it.  However,  if works like a dream,  and it doesn’t leave streaks on my black or dark clothing, or on my skin.  I can tell where it’s applied because the texture is so unique.  It also doesn’t have a super strong scent,  which is good for me. Fantabulous!
