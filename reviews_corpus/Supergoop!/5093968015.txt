Reapplying sunscreen has been a difficulty for me because I wear makeup and prefer not to reapply my whole look when needing to touch up on my sunscreen. I’ve been looking into another alternative and was excited to find out that Supergoop made an SPF spray which is perfect for not disrupting my makeup look! I love how easy it is to carry in my bag and that I can protect my skin from the sun, especially with summer coming up. This sunscreen does run a bit on the oilier side, so I recommend this for dry skin or if you’re looking for a dewy look. Also, be sure to cover your hair/ears when spraying since it is a mist and can spray unwanted areas. Definitely a must try product if you wanted an easy way to reapply SPF!This product was gifted by Supergoop but does not impact my review. Great for reapplying SPF but a bit oily!
