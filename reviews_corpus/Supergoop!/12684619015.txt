Iâ€™m very surprised by this Sunscreen. Let me start by saying this I am an oily gyal with beautiful brown skin. This sunscreen is a secret weapon for me. It does leave a slight cast on your face if you have darker skin, but that is ok. I love the MUFD HD Foundation but it never lasts on me; until NOW. I wear this under my foundation and it helps my make face last all day even through sweating. Protect your skin at all cost. Here is a picture after sweating. Protect yourself and and look good at the same time . My secret weapon!
