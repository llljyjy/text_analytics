I was super hyped to try this because I’ve heard like amazing things about goop sunscreens and this is my first goop product. Unfortunately I don’t think this one’s for my oily skin. It leaves me looks very skinny like I applied highlighter to my entire face and greasy feeling. The finish is also a bit heavy for me. I would still give goop another go tho like for their unseen spf. Makes you super shiny
