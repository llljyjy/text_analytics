I have been struggling with hormonal acne and recently really bumped up to Rx products and have much more flaky skin now. My skin texture is sensitive/dry all the time and this oil has been so wonderful for smoothing out any extra flakiness after applying my moisturizer to really lock everything in. It’s so nice that it doesn’t dry out my face further!! Drink of hydration for my dry skin
