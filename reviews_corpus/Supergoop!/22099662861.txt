$50 for 1oz of something you’re supposed to apply every 2 hours. You would use this up after a few days. I asked for a product without silicone as my skin doesn’t tolerate them in abundance, and this is what I was recommended. The container is cool and I like the portability but what is this price point? I used it one day and returned it because the recommended amount applied regularly would deplete this within a week. No bang for the buck.
