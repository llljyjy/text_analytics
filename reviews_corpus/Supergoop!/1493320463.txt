This product is gifted by Supergoop! in exchange for my honest review. I have never used a sunscreen oil and I am afraid that will make my skin greasy. Actually, this product is good! I have dry skin and this sunscreen gives me enough moisture as makeup primer. I love it has both ceramide and SFP40! nan
