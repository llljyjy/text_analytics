I love the way this sunscreen leaves a tanned and glowing finish on the skin. It looks great under make up and has been my go to to wear in the summer. The only downside is that it is a chemical SPF with some ingredients that can be toxic to the body and not protect from the sun as well and for that reason I would not buy it again. nan
