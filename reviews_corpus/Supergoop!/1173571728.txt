I was very excited to try this product as I had heard from my daughter how great the product is.   I was especialy excited to use it daily because of the 40 SPF.     The packaging is attractive and cheerful.   The bottle with dropper applicator is a generous size and should last a long time.    I was surprised the first time I used it, my skin immediately turned red.    I’m not sure how long it stayed red, but it did eventualy go away.   I tried it again 3 consecutive days with the same result.   I’m not sure if the red is a problem.   But I’ve decided not to use it because of the redness.   Which is to0 bad, it may be a great product.    I received this complimentary from Supergoop. Redness
