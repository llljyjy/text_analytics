Omg I love this!! I was hesitant to try chemical sunscreen because I heard mineral is better for your skin and that there’s not enough research on chemical sunscreen. But I wanted to try this out after reading so many good reviews. I bought the mini size to try it out and I’m in love with how it looks on my skin! Texture is silky and feels like primer. It’s invisible and not greasy. It’s easy to apply make up on top. This is going to be my new fav sunscreen :) nan
