Supergoop gifted me their Every. Single. Face. Watery Lotion SPF 50. It is a precision squeeze bottle so I donâ€™t end up using too much on my face. The top twists and clicks into place so this is great to keep in my purse for on the go reapplications. I like that it is water and sweat resistant as well. It blends and absorbs well without whitecast. nan
