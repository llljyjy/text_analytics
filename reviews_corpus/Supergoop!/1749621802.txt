I was gifted by Supergoop the EVERY SINGLE FACE Watery Lotion in exchange for my honest thoughts on the product…here goes! I’ve heard that this product was one of the best on the market for deeper skin tones and now that I’ve actually tried the product, I have to say…the girls were correct! This SPF melted beautifully into my skin and also didn’t seem to look weird or peak out under make up. Definitely a fan and brown girl approved! Brown girl friendly and VERY lightweight!
