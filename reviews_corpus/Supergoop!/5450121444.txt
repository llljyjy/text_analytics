I am absolutely in love with my Supergoop! Glowscreen SPF 40 in the shade ‘Golden Hour’. It is so hydrating, and leaves my skin with the most beautiful bronzed dewy finish. I even have my boyfriend hooked on it now - he asks to use it every day! My only note is that a little goes a long way with this product - it’s super pigmented! Supergoop! Glowscreen
