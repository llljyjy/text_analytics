When I walked in and asked where this was the employee said they dont carry anything like it, that shouldve warned me not to buy it. All but one bottle also had already expired. Took me 10 months to go through this, it does not work under any makeup, regardless of how I prepped my under eyes, I have normal skin - bit dry in the winter. The only way I could wear this was on no makeup days, and immediately after washing my face while damp. You have to stop blending at THE perfect time or it will pill up, and it looks awful midday no matter what. I found this looked the least awful in the summer, I have not one single positive to say about this product. Finished the bottle, NOT repurchasing
