I have tried the other Supergoop sunscreens so I went into this one knowing I would most likely enjoy it too. I have combination skin, mostly oily in the T-zone but I don’t like a super matte look. I love to look slightly dewy with a healthy complexion. This has the perfect sunkissed golden hue for my yellow toned skin, and personally I didn’t notice it was too dark/bronze on me. It gives a healthy, very subtle  glow specially on the high points of the face and it doesn’t make me extra oily during the day. It compliments my skin so well and I just love the formula. It’s so easy to blend and very light as like most of their other sunscreens. It goes well under my makeup, I love it! Perfect sun-kissed glow for my combo skin
