I’m not sure who wrote the standards for “clean“ beauty but this product does not meet my personal standards. I enjoyed using it, it goes on smoothly and you don’t need a large amount, but once I actually looked up the ingredients I realized I can’t continue to use this product. It is not reef-safe, as it contains Octocrylene (can cause brain deformities in fish larva and reproductive toxicity - imagine what it could do to humans applying it regularly on their skin - and there is evidence that it can bleach coral). It also contains Homosalate, which doesn’t break down easily and has been found on sea life and corals. Bummer. Questionable Ingredients
