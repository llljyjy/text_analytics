This sunscreen has the weirdest texture. I bought this tube as my first Supergoop! product. Not hating on the sunscreen, just not a fan of it’s texture. I don’t usually wear makeup and when I do, the face primer I use has a closer texture to face lotion. I think this would definitely work for those who wear makeup regularly bc it functions not only as a sunscreen but also as a primer. I could feel how this would allow for adherence to BB, CC cream, foundation, etc.Only 3 stars bc the texture wasn’t for me. Odd texture
