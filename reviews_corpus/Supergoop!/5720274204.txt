I wanted to like this sunscreen & Supergoop because of all the great reviews but it was so greasy. I used this for my trip to Hawaii in my body and it felt like it was sitting on my body and was not absorbing. It was so greasy that it gets on everything that I touched. The only good thing is that it gave me a good shine/glow tomy skin because of how greasy it was. I only used this in my body and it was already too oily for me I cannot imagine wearing this on my combo skin face. Yikes. It also has the typical sunscreen smell which I donâ€™t like. I also still get sunburn/sun allergy while wearing this. If you need an active outdoor sunscreen try Sun Bum!Great scent and fast absorbing! Very greasy
