This product is WAY overpriced, but it’s also pretty terrible. The ingredient list is amazing and probably the best they’ve done, but the product itself is pretty useless on the face. It just sits there and clogs your pores. I love a dewy finish and sunscreens are meant to just “sit there” so as to protect your face, but this is the heaviest sunscreen I’ve personally used before. People say it smells rancid, but it doesn’t. It weirdly enough smells like Sea Buckthorn oil, which I believe isn’t in this product? lol either way I actually love the smellAnyway, please don’t buy this. I got it for $12 with a gift card and I’m still returning it. useless and expensive
