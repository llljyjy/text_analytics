I want to like the Supergoop sunscreens but they all contain Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octocrylene, and Octisalate which are all known toxic hormone disruptors. Not sure why it’s marked as “clean” when these are some of the worst ingredients in sunscreen. Besides that, I love the variety of styles/finishes Toxic Hormone Disrupting Chemicals
