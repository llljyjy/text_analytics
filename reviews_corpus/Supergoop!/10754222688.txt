The texture is perfect to put under makeup and doesn’t pill or interfere with application. Works super well, I went on vacation and got severely burned on my body while my face was unbothered by the sun. My only problem is I think the Glow Screen is a bit too glowy, sometimes I feel like an iridescent disco ball with it on. I haven’t tried the regular version but I am sure it is less glowy and just as desirable formula-wise. Great Sunscreen, Beware the Glow
