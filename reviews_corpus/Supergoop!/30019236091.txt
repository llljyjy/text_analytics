Gifted by Supergoop. Amazing sunscreen. I have a oily skin and their mineral Matt sunscreen is my go to face sunscreen and this new product works amazing too but not as much as the matte one. Water consistency and very lightweight. Doesnâ€™t leave any white cast, works great with makeup but my face got oiler after few hours so I decided to use this on my shoulder and chest area and it works just fine. I can recommend
