Have I found the holy grail SPF? It truly seems like it. I’ve tried many. I’ve used many SPFs but none of them have made me actually remember to apply it daily. After trying the Glow Recipe one (and it causing me to break out) I reluctantly tried Supergoop again this one looked promising. After a week, it’s not breaking me out and makeup applies smoothly. Highly recommend!! this is it.
