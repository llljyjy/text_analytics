I’ve used Supergoop for some time now and I have to say this brand never disappoints. I’m a big believer in wearing sunscreen everyday but finding a sunscreen that works as a base for your makeup can be challenging. I was sent a Complimentary sunscreen from Supergoop, and it has been a life changer not only does it protect my skin but it’s also light weight, has SPF 50  and it’s quite hydrating. gifted by Supergoop!
