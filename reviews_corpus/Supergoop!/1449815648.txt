I have used this product for several years and swear by it! I’m very fair skinned with a slight redness on my chin and cheeks and this covers my worry lines on my forehead really well too. Love that it’s 40 SPF, is clean, not tested on animals and I wear it alone with a bit of blush sometimes! Granted, there are days I wish I had more coverage, but I layer this thick on those days. Purchased this size for a 3-week trip to London and it lasted the entire trip and then some! I used it every day too, incase you’re wondering how long it lasts; I’d say this size lasts 3 to 4 weeks - get the bigger tube if you are going travelling for more than one month! U can also wear your foundation on top of this as it is a primer (I don’t), but I’d skim test them on a small area to ensure the products are compatible! nan
