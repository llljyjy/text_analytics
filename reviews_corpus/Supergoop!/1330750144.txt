Was so excited to try this as I have yet to find a sunscreen that feels like nothing. Very disappointed to see the ingredients list! Alcohol is the 6th ingredient, lavender extract, linalool (aka fragrance), sage (fragrance)â€¦supergoop usually has good ingredients but this is not good. I wish they had omitted these. nan
