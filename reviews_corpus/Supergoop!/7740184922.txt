Not a fan… while it didn’t make me break out, the formula is very greasy and doesn’t absorb into the skin even after an extended amount of time—ot just kind of sits on top of the face. This makes reapplying throughout the day (the only reason I got this) tricky especially if you are wearing a mask since it just wipes off. The shape of the applicator is also not designed well for the crevices of your face (eg between nose and cheek). It also smears/lifts makeup if applied over makeup, unless you were to maybe dot it on your face vs swipe it (giving you much less coverage). I swear by the glow screen but I’m not sure what the purpose of this product is. nan
