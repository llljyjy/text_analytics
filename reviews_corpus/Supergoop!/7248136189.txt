This has been such a great step in my skincare routine daily. I spend a lot of time outside and always like to have my face be protected as much as possible. I donâ€™t like using normal sunscreens so I have been using this Sunscreen Oil. It is extremely easy to apply, if I am not going to be outside a ton I will just use a few drops with some moisturizer. If I am going to spend an extended amount of time outside I will apply a lot more to my face than normal and let it soak in. It gives me great protection. Helps keep my face hydrated. Very pleased with this oil. I received this product complimentary from Supergoop! Great protection for my face.
