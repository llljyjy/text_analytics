I absolutely LOVE Supergoop! as a brand and this new Daily SPF Oil I was gifted by Supergoop! did not disappoint. It sinks in to the skin within minutes and can be used as the last step in your skincare routine.  Even though itâ€™s an oil it does not have a heavy feel or leave a sheen on your skin. I just use a couple drops and press in to my face. I look forward to seeing how this layers underneath makeup, and I love that it has built in skincare benefits like ceramides, squalane, and hyaluronic acid! Beautiful SPF Oil
