The absolute heartbreak of the pimples I’m now getting, I’ve never really used sunscreen but tried play at disneyland so decided to try a few more supergoop, and just got this order on like the 13th I think Today’s the 18th and I have 3 new pimples, pretty sure it’s because it’s super oily even after I  . I’m gonna go ahead and return and try the matte.---* I didn’t see it literally says oil stick on it loll so could have been my fault but sheesh 3 !!!! To oily for me :/
