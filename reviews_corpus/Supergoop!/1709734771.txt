Supergoop Glowscreen SPF 40 is an awesome sunscreen! It lightweight and does not cause my skin to feel or look greasy. It has clean chemical sunscreen actives, no synthetic fragrance, is cruelty freeI, and vegan. I love products that have multiple functions and this sunscreen doubles as a highlighter! I tried the Sunrise - champagne shade and it blends with my skin tone beautifully. This sunscreen is for all skin types and I definitely recommend it. Wonderful Sunscreen
