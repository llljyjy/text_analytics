Protected & set with this double duty mist. Supergoop! (Re)Setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 is already one of my summer favorites.  I will be wearing this daily for spring & summer over my makeup. A high SPF is my go-to for skin protection from sun damage. This resetting and refreshing mist has an SPF of 40. It’s a fantastic multitasking face mist. I have been using it to set my make up & to refresh my UV protection during the day. My skin is dry so I love the glowy finish. Don’t forget to shake it before using it and close your eyes when spraying it. It is recommended to reapply this every two hours if you are outdoors. I love the light and fresh scent. It has soft hints of rosemary and mint which gives me a pick me up as well, especially in the afternoon. It is water and sweat resistant so it’s a good one to use if you do work outs outdoors like me.  gifted by Supergoop! Double duty win for me
