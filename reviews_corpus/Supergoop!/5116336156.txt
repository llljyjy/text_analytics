I have a really hard time with SPF reapplication because I hate the feeling of adding more lotion on top of an already done face. A spray like this one is an ideal option for me because it doesn’t disturb what makeup I already have on my face and is super easy to reapply. I don’t have to put my fingers all over my face or anything that could cause acne. Super convenient
