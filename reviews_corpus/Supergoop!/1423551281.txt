Love how this sunscreen just melts into my skin. Slight glow to it. With transition in the weather from Winter to Spring - my skin is starting to change as well. Iâ€™d like to use it more once Spring really is here to see how well my skin would react. No scents and blends in with no white cast. Gifted by Supergoop! nan
