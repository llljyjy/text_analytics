I was so excited to try this product given all the hype around it, but sadly it wasn’t for me. I found the glow aspect to be too intense to be worn on its own. I was especially sad when this product pilled on me on the first application. Mixed in with a foundation it can add a nice dewy look, but that’s the only way I see myself this product. Not for me
