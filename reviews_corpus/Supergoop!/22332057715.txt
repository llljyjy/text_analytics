I use Supergoop products and it was my go-to sunscreen. This reminds me of their regular sunscreen but with way more glow. If you are a greasy person, I probably wouldn’t recommend this for you, but I’m dry and it is fantastic. It’s not sticky and leaves a nice glow that isn’t glittery or shimmery. The light catches it just right for that beautiful reflection, which is something is dry people almost never get. It is hydrating and does well under my makeup. Smells like sunscreen, but not strong. Recommend! great sunscreen/highlighter for dry skin users!
