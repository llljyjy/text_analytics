Goes on smoothly. A little product goes a long way. It does manage to give you a glow without looking shiny or sparkly, which is great for a woman in her mid-30s looking for an everyday product. The description does say that it’s “tinted“, which I’m not sure I agree with. When you squeeze the product out of the bottle, it appears tinted, but once it goes on, it does not provide any cover. And, to clarify, I’m a person who doesn’t really wear makeup and likes the natural look. But, sometimes, I find myself reaching for an spf with more tint than what this glow screen provides. Glowy!
