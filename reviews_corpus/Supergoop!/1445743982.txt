I loveeee this sunscreen! I especially love that it’s SPF 50 and PA++++ It’s amazing under makeup (my makeup doesn’t slide around or feel heavy on top of it) feels weightless, no white cast, leaves a dewy/healthy effect when applied, but not oily at all. Basically everything I look for in a sunscreen. The only thing is I wish they had also had a jumbo option :) my favorite purchase! nan
