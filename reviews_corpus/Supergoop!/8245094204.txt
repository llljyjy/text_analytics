I love the concept but the smell omgg I can’t breathe when I put it on. Even if I spray it on my hands and then apply to my face. The smell is sooo strong. I had to return. I have dry skin and it did make my face look a little Greasy but I don’t mind it. If they make it again without the strong smell, I’d def buy. The smell is too strong!!
