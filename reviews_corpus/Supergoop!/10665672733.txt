This is my second product I use from supergoop and I love it. This formulation is watery as it says. But it absorbs into the skin so well, leaving your skin radiant hydrated. With out being sticky or greasy. Perfect for oils skin I love that it mixes well with other products for my face and doesnâ€™t peel like other products. No white cast. And the packaging is cute. I definitely recommend this spf. This was gifted by Supergoop. Love it, non greasy or sticky
