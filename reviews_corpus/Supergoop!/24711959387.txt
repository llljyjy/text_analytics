I’m such a huge fan of Supergoop! This daily dose mineral SPF 40 not only protects your skin from the harmful UV rays outside but it also gives your skin a boost of collagen. It’s 100% mineral sunscreen and it doesn’t leave any type of white residue behind. You can use this every single day whether it’s summer or winter. And it’s great for all skin types! A must have!!
