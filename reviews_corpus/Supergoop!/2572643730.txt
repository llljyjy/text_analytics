Absolutely love the glowscreen formulation. It is hydrating and also has just the right amount of tint for a sunscreen when you also want some coverage. I didn’t find it to be overly oily at all, and I opted to layer this with a little blush for more of a natural look. It has what I would consider to be a true dewy finish with some hydration built in. I typically will not use extra moisturizer if I’m planning on using this that same day otherwise I end up a little over oily in my t-zone. You can also built up the color a bit in areas like your cheeks or forehead if you want. I have VERY sensitive skin and this product did not cause me to break out. Would highly recommend! Great for sensitive skin, nice coverage
