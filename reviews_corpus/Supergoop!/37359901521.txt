I bought this sunscreen because I had seen good reviews and I needed a new sunscreen as summer is approaching. I’ve used it for about a week and started breaking out. At first I wasn’t sure what in my skincare caused this but I’m pretty sure it’s this sunscreen! Not to mention that I’ve also gotten more tan after one week from using this product, I don’t think the spf was affective enough on my skin. Most sunscreens I’ve used have never caused this so I’m not sure why this one is different. Sad that this product didn’t work for me. Broke me out!!
