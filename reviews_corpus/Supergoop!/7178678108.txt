I feel like this sunscreen is too good top be true and I always worry it’s not really working but it is. It feels like a lightweight summer moisturizer and not a a sunscreen-- it’s such a bonus it protects at spf50 level. I use the two finger rule for application and my skin feels amazing when I put it on. I reapply after maybe 3 or 4 hours at home and reapplied every 1-2 hours while on vacation in Palm springs where I spent 12 hours at the pool each day in the hot sun. No sunburn for pale, freckly me (which felt like a miracle)! Buy this!
