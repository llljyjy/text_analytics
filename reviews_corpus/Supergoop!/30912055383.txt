I recently tried the Glow Screen SPF 40 Sunscreen by Super Goop and I absolutely loved it. It is a great sunscreen with a light tint which gives the skin a glow. It is light weight, non sticky sunscreen which did not flake at all. It blends well in the skin alongwith makeup..I loved it will be reordering it. nan
