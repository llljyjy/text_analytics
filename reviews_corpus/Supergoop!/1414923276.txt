I received this complimentary from supergoop! I have  dry flaky skin especially in the wintertime so I love the idea of a spf oil. I’m also a new mom so I don’t have time any more for a robust skincare routine. This one has ceramides so it’s super hydrating. This spreads easily on my skin but I am using a lot less than if this was a moisturizer so I don’t know how effective the spf will be. So I like it but I’m cautiously optimistic about the effectiveness of the spf. Cautiously optimistic
