this is just okay. it’s pretty dewy, which is fine for me because I have dry skin. the alcohol smell is strong, but I didn’t find it drying. the major drawback is that you can’t put it around your eyes. I found that it ran into my eyes almost immediately, which I didn’t expect from a product advertised as a face lotion. just okay, not good around eyes
