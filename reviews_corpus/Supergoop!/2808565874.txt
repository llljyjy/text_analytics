This was gifted by Supergoop! I have always loved this brand. I love that this sunscreen feels like an on the go sunscreen. It fits perfectly in your bag and it’s such a good re apply sunscreen for throughout the day! I love that it’s not sticky or gives a white residue after using it. It does not feel heavy on the skin and feels light! It’s perfect to use throughout the whole day! I love it! Amazing!
