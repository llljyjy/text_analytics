I am very happy that gifted by Supergoop with this SPF spray. I always don’t know how to reapply sunscreen every 2 hours without messing up my makeup and this definitely solves it. It does have alcohol smells when I spray it on my face but it doesn’t dry my face and has a dewy finish after spray, I think it’s a little too oily for my face as I like a more matte finish but it definitely able to protect my skin while I was playing in Disney for the whole day. Good options for reapplying sunscreen
