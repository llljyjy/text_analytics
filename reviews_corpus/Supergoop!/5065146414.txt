Amazing! This is the first Supergoop! product I buy and try. I am absolutely in love with the way this feels on my skin, makes my skin look, primes my skin for make up, and all with an SPF of 40! It helps my make up stay absolutely intact all day long. I have now been using this for over one week. I usually put my make up on around 7:30 in the morning and I don’t remove my make up until near 8 PM at night. You would never know that I had my make up on for 13 hours because it looks exactly the same as when I applied it in the morning. It is truly unbelievable. I have received so many compliments about the complexion of my skin since I started using this product. It’s really amazing. AMAZING
