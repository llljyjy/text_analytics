I have extremely sensitive skin, rosacea and acne, which means it’s almost impossible for me to find products that work for me. I used my points to get a sample of this and it’s been working really well for me - no breakouts and this goes on perfectly clear. A little if this product goes a long way, so make sure you only use a little bit - otherwise it will be greasy and won’t absorb properly Amazing for non-white skin if you use it correctly
