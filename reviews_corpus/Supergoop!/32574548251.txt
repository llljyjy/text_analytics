This product is vegan, gluten-free, cruelty-free, and comes in recyclable packaging. The product is also reef-safe and synthetic fragrance-free. It’s lightweight, easy to spread, and doesn’t leave a white cast. It’s also very gentle on my skin, doesn’t cause any irritation or breakouts. However, it makes my skin feel a bit oily, and I don’t like the scent, either. Also, I noticed it contains alcohol and octocrylene, which I try to avoid. I probably won’t purchase this product.
