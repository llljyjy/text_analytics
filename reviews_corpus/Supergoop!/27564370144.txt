When I first tried this I was so confused with the texture. It made my skin feel very silky and smooth, which is not what I am used to with a sunscreen. This sunscreen texture is actually what makes me excited to use sunscreen everyday. Since using, I have not skipped a day using sunscreen. It also doesn’t make your skin look oily nor does it make it look dry. It’s perfect! nan
