Love the watery, gel like texture. Blends in seamlessly into the skin. Leaves a healthy glow skin like finish. Plays well with other products, no pilling. However, this product has a very strong alcohol like scent upon application which slightly burned my eyes even though I was not applying the sunscreen directly to the eye area. The alcohol scent then fades away to a VERY STRONG generic chemical sunscreen “trip to the water park” smell which I am not a fan of and seems to get stronger as the day goes on.HARD PASS if you’re sensitive to alcohol and/or the scent of chemical sunscreen. 2 stars for formulation, but I cannot get past the lingering scent of sunscreen. hard pass if you’re sensitive to alcohol/fragrance
