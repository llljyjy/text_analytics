I have been using Supergoop! Glowscreen SPF 40 - Sunrise as my exclusive sunscreen for several days and love it! It is very lightweight and doesnâ€™t even feel like I put sunscreen on. No dreaded white cast - in fact, it leaves a tinted, slight shimmer that is flattering on skin. It absorbs quickly and easily into skin. This is a new favorite! A new favorite!
