Have been using this sunscreen since the late summer or fall and probably getting close to finishing but somehow it keeps giving. This is the first sunscreen I’ve tried that is on the pricier side -- previously used drugstore ones like Sun Bum or Neutrogena. The product itself comes out transparent/clear and almost gel like. I do the recommended dime sized amount for my entire face and neck. It absorbs really well and isn’t noticeable throughout the day if I am going barefaced. It works well as a primer too and helps makeup glide on and stay put. Love this stuff
