This SPF mist was gifted to me by Supergoop! for my honest review. I like this mist but I have some critiques as well. This mist is light and applies nicely. I like the mister-- nice and fine, although it does spray a little wide. I have to be sure to cover my hair and clothes when applying. It’s not overly heavy or greasy like some spray SPFs I’ve used in the past but it does leave a glow but it’s nothing a light dusting of powder wouldn’t remedy. The biggest criticism I have of the mist is the smell. It smells very strongly of chemicals, which I’m sure is unavoidable given that it’s an SPF, however, for me it kind of takes away from any “refreshing“ qualities it has. Very nice but could be improved!
