I was pleasantly surprised when introduced to this product recently, I bought the mini version to keep in my purse in order to reapply spf throughout the day & also to touch up any areas where my foundation started wearing off. I’ve tried various applications & products but noticed that this tinted primer pills whenever I attempt to wear foundation over it. However, I do like the way this looks when used as a concealer over foundation, under my eyes and around my nose & mouth. I would recommend giving this product a try & I do plan on repurchasing. I am in my late 30’s and have drier skin, for the record. Like to use as concealer over foundation
