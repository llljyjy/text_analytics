I took this with me vacation to a bachelorette party in Austin. I’m from Seattle so I’m kind of sensitive to the sun and this saved me! The consistency is light but hydrating. I was wearing basic complexion makeup and. It looked flawless over this. This was gifted by Supergoop to review, now I want to try the glow. Perfect for my sensitive skin.
