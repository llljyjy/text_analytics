My new favorite SPF ! If you have dry skin you are going to love this new Supergoop Daily Dose Hydra-Ceramide Boost + SPF , this is their newest launch and it’s a “sunscreen oil“ ! It combines the power of ceramides, fatty acids & microbiome friendly prebiotics with broad spectrum UV protection in a nourishing lightweight oil. Its formulated to replenish the skin barrier, it will soothe , soften & provide lasting hydration all while protecting you from the sun !! I love this so much , it’s not a greasy oil, it sinks right in and makes my skin so soft! It has chemical filters , I do always prefer chemical spfs over mineral ones !! Gifted by Supergoop. New Fav!!
