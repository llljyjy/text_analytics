This is my favorite type of sunscreen texture and finish - it’s lightweight and feels very hydrating and dewy. I have VERY dry skin but this might be considered “greasy“ for others. I absolutely love the look and feel of this. Drawbacks - it has a strong sunscreen scent and the packaging is gimmicky/slightly annoying. Solid 4/5. This was gifted by Supergoop! nan
