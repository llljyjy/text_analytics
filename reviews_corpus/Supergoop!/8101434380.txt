Bought this after reading some instagram reviews and someone ended up buying it for me at sephora. Now normally I dont ever write reviews for Sephora products because the things i buy here I’ve tried and returned if I didn’t like but I can’t return this. Worst product I’ve ever tried, my eyes are stinging so bad right now as I’m writing this and I washed my face with a facial cleanser and rinsed my eyes out with water. My eyes aren’t even sensitive and this product was so greasy that it seeped into my eyes over time and left it stinging over makeup for hours. It’s very greasy and the grease doesnt settle in or mattify. DONT BUY THIS SPRAY SUNSCREEN ITS A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! nan
