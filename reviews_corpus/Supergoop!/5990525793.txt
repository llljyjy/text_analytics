Really enjoy the way this sunscreen looks on my skin. It’s perfect for running around doing errands. I’ll wear it before I go on a 30min-1hr run. I wore it on the bought when I was swimming and I got a little pink but that’s to be expected. It’s not a sport style sunscreen. Beautiful texture. Doesn’t feel like a sunscreen at all. nan
