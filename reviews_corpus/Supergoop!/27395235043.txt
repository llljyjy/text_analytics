Every.Single.Face is an amazing chemical sunscreen! I love that it has a very lightweight feel, and blends in nicely. It doesn’t leave a white cast and it doesn’t sting/irritate my eyes! Win win! It is fairly dewy and leans slightly greasy, but I think if applied in layers, it would help this. It does have a strong alcohol scent at first, but that goes away quickly. Overall, it feels great on my face and bonus that it’s spf 50! *complimentary from Supergoop.* No white cast and no eye sting!
