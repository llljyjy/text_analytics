I’ve been using this religiously for about a week now. Before this, I used the Dr Jart+ everyday sunfluid. I’ve tried some of the Korean brands as well. I figured I’d give this a go because I work in a hot kitchen and don’t like to feel overly greasy at any point in the day but I also want to wear my sunscreen. This has been awesome, no pilling, no excess grease, and most important for me, no breakouts. I have super reactive skin and it goes red or I can get hives pretty easily so trying new products is a crapshoot most of the time. This sits well on my skincare below with no issue. I have others I’ll use if I’m out hiking or swimming but for everyday wear, this is the one. Ps I have olive skin tone nan
