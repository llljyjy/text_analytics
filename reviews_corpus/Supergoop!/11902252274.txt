I really love Supergoop products! This is really nice overall. I’m kind of a grease ball after four hours of wear but that is normal for me. I blot and that seems fine. The glow is really gorgeous but I wouldn’t put this on as a highlighter like the products suggest if you want **extra** glow. It picked up my makeup. Solid sunscreen though, and it didn’t leave a white cast on my medium complexion. I got the shade Sunrise and it made me very glowy. If you are prone to being oily, I’d use something mattifying in the center of the face. Great Product, as Usual!
