[Gifted by Supergoop] This is a really unique formulation, creating a sunscreen in oil form. Since I have oily skin, I will say that I do not reach out for this as much as I would like to, but I like having this as an option within my SPF choices. It is easy to use and a good option for another layer of SPF protection. nan
