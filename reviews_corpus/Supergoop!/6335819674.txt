This is a noncomedogenic product meaning it will clog your pores. I am an oily girl but this product is worth it to me. I love the glow it gives me and the little bit of tint brightens my skin. I use a tiny dab of concealer on cheeks for my rosacea and set my face with a light layer of Laura mercier translucent powder. it gives my skin the hydration and glow and i make sure to follow up with a good skincare routine and chemical exfoliation. How you prep for this is everything. nan
