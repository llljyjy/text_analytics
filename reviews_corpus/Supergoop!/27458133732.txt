I liked this SPF Stick! I like the sensation it leaves on my skin and it does not feel that “gooey”, there are times that the product doesn’t go up as much as I try so that is my only issue, I love feeling glowy and healthy, it does works at it is supposed to so I will be buying again! Whenever I put makeup on it still looks dewey and I also reapply over it and does not make a mess. So for me it is a 9/10, my issues is physical, not from the product itself. Perfecto for a healthy and glowy look!
