I currently live in a state where we have somewhat warm to hot weather almost year round. The sun shines very bright for long hours of the day. For this reason I love trying out new types of sun screens. My favorite so far are light cream spf sun screens because they are gentle on my face. This product is very similar and long lasting as well great
