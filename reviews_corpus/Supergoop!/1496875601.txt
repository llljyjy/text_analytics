I’ve used only Japanese sunscreens for years. I’m running low on my usual so I decided to pick this one up when I was in-store shopping during the sale. I love this under make-up. I still will use it alone without make-up but this one is so good under make-up. I ordered a second bottle online during the sale and don’t see myself going back to my “usual” sunscreen when that bottle runs out. nan
