I’ve been using the original formula for the past 2 years! I’m so happy that they now have 2 shades available for their Glow Screen. Same benefits but with a glowy finish. This is perfect for those who have dry skin or if you like a radiant finish.  A little goes a long way. A nice makeup tip is to use this as your primer and follow with your favorite foundation or tinted moisturizer. Glowy! Summer skin!!!
