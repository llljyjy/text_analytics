I’m so excited to use this product more. I love ceramides and spf is an essential for everyday. This is the first spf oil I’ve head of and it absorbed nicely without feeling oily or tacky after. It is very similar to other ceramide skincare products I’ve tried. I think it will do reasonably well under makeup but might affect longwear so it’s something I’ll be using when I’m having a more casual day. Gifted by Supergoop! nan
