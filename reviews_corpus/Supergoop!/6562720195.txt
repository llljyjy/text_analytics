So I’m a physical sunscreen lover, but I decided to try this chemical sunscreen oil. It supposedly has an SPF of 40. With how little I’ve been using of it, because a little goes a long way, I wonder what SPF I’m really getting out of it. It’s a great moisturizing product otherwise. This was gifted by Supergoop.
