Supergoop is one of my favorites brands when it comes to Sunscreen. This one is so lightweight, watery lotion in consistency. Absorbs nicely and doesnâ€™t feel heavy or greasy. I love that it is just like a lotion, easy to apply and reapply. Plus the packaging is super cute, easy to carry in the handbag. Overall I am totally enjoying this! Love the Cute Packaging
