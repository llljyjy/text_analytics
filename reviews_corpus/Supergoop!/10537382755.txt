I love the invisible finish. No marks or residue. It applies like a primer or the Maybelline primer thatâ€™s like the blue packaging. Honestly love it and constantly wear it. But no greasy feeling or moving. Though I wear minimal makeup so not too sure how it works with makeup products. Holy Grail Sunscreen
