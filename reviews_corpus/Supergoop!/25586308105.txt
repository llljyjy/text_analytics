I can’t recommend this product. I truly feel I gave it a fair shot--I used it on drier days hiking in the Sierra Nevadas, cool days paddling in Pennsylvania, and in full humidity on the beach in Delaware. No matter the conditions, this sunscreen was unbearably sticky feeling. It felt like it left a residue on everything I touched and even after a shower it was still there. Long-lasting application is great, but when the product is this sticky it’s just plain uncomfortable. Too sticky
