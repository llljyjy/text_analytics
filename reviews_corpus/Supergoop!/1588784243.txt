Really wanted to love this, as I like the idea of it being a moisturizer and sunscreen in one with anti pollution and other benefits. I have combo sensitive acne prone skin, every time I use this I notice an extra little bump form on my skin by the end of the day and my skin seems to experience more redness compared when I use other sunscreens. Like others I  canâ€™t stand the smell. For the price there are definitely much better sunscreen options. Tried to make this work for 1/3 of the tub, but will use remainder on the body. No thank you
