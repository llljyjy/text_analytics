Supergoop is kind of the master of sunscreens, aren’t they?  So I was really excited to try this new Glowscreen SPF 40 they came out with! I mean, it has hyaluronic Acid and Niacinamide in it so that’s quite nice!I got the shade Golden Hour and it’s perfect for my medium skintone. It really does give you a nice glow! This is so perfect for the no-makeup days where you just want to be radiant in your natural and bare skin! It absorbs really quickly, there’s no reside and of course no white cast. It’s super comfortable to wear - just like a nice moisturizer. Love it! The glow is real!
