I received the Daily Dose Hydra-Ceramide Boost + SPF 40 PA+++ Sunscreen Oil as a gift from Super Goop. This product feels really lightweight and it give my skin a nice healthy glow . This is a great product if you have dry skin like my self.   With this product my skin is hydrated, but not sticky., absorbs very quickly and I can wear my cc cream or foundation right after and I love that has spf in it. nan
