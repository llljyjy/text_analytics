I was gifted this spf by supergoop and Iâ€™ve been on the hunt for a spray spf for awhile, I have tried other brands and they either dry out my skin or burn. This one did neither, although I am not a fan of the scent it worked the best so far. I will say this is very dewy and I already run pretty oily so this over make up is not my favorite but for a day out on the beach or outdoors  I could see myself grabbing this. nan
