Supergoop gifted me their Watery Lotion SPF 50 and I really like it.As the name says, the texture is on the watery side and hence distributes very effortlessly. It absorbs quickly and leaves a hint of a shine or a dewy finish on my combination skin.Overall a great every-day SPF with a high sun protection. great everyday SPF
