LOVE this powder!! I bought it as a powder to use when I need a touch up in the middle of the day but I’ve began to gravitate towards using it after I put on my foundation as a replacement to my other loose powders I used to use. Once you understand the way to use it I promise you it’ll be your most trustworthy powder! The SPF in it is so convenient too! Such a practical powder with great matte coverage
