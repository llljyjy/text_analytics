This is such a pretty sunscreen formula! It is, as it’s name suggests, so glowy! It’s almost too glowy to use all over my face on some days, in which case I like to use it as a highlighter on my cheekbones and nose. I’d say the formula is very lightweight and beautiful on the skin. I love a skincare makeup hybrid and I think a lot of people will really love this for a glowy base product/spf. So glowy!
