This is gifted by supergoop! It is my first time using a skin care oil. Skin oils are products that are not available to me in my skin care routine. This sunscreen is very innovative, hydrating and sun protection at the same time. It’s very light in texture, doesn’t weigh on the skin after use, it’s both moisturizing and sun protection, and I think it’s going to be my favorite product. nan
