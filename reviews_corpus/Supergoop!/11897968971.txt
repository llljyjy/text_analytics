This is a nice mineral SPF. It applies nicely and absorbs pretty quickly into my skin.  The packaging is cute.  It does come with a dropper this was my first time using a product with a dropper but itâ€™s pretty easy to use. Overall it did a good job and protected my skin from getting sunburnt. Good Sunscreen
