I liked this product when I first tried it, so I don’t know if they’ve changed the formula or what but I am now not a fan. You know how a dried clump forms in a pump product you haven’t used in a while? Well this forms one Every. Single. Day. Just like it says on the lid. So every morning I have to pry a clump out of the product before I can use it. I would guess a significant amount goes to waste because of that. This product also does not play well with others - especially hyaluranic acid. No matter how long I let my skin “dry“ after applying, this eye cream pills up. I end up having to wipe away pills with a damp wash cloth, which I am pretty sure renders applying an SPF product to my eyes useless. I wish SuperGoop would offer the old eye SPF product in the tube again. This one is unfortunately a hard pass for me. Goopy, Not in a Good Way
