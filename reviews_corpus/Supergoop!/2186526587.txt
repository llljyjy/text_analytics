I brought this with me on vacation to use after I applied my makeup for dinner. We walked to dinner every night when the sun was still out. I liked that I could spritz this in and know I was getting SPF coverage. I did feel like it smelt more like sunscreen than other supergoop products Iâ€™ve used! This product was gifted by supergoop! Great for on top of makeup
