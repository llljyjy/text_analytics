I have very sensitive and acne-prone skin and my skin tolerates this sunscreen well, I have been using this for a year now. I used to use the original Prism Sunscreen from Volition, but when Sephora stopped carrying that product last summer I switched to Supergoop Glowscreen. I love sunscreens that add a dewy or shimmering finish to my face to make my face glow. This sunscreen is very pretty. I have super fair skin (with a cool skin tone) and this sunscreen looks alright on my light skin, although it adds some orange tones to my skin so I have to make sure itâ€™s well blended around my jawline and onto my neck. I took off 1 star because I do wish they made a lighter color version for fair skin. My fav daily sunscreen!
