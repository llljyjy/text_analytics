I love this and use it almost daily. However, the packaging is terrible. There are tiny holes in the top of the bottle and the product oozes out the side when I squeeze the bottle. I want to order more, but don’t plan on it unless the packaging seems different. I have seen many others have the same problem. The daily moisturizer I love too and is nice that it’s in a jar. I like the squeeze bottle for the glow screen if it doesn’t get holes in it. nan
