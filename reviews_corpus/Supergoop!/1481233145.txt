Itâ€™s a good product but not for oily or combo skin. There is no scent, thanks goodness and it does leave my skin feeling super hydrated but shinning like a disco ball. The consistency is a but odd, like a cross between a cream & a jelly but it rubs in easily. Good product for those with dry skin. nan
