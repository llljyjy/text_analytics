It’s a great sunscreen that doesn’t pill and performs beautifully under makeup. Doesn’t irritate my dermatitis, BUT to avoid a greasy/metallic/“tin-man” situation, I’d suggest only applying this on cheeks, under eyes and on the forehead, and a regular spf everywhere else. Otherwise it’s a bit overwhelming, especially on the upper lip. nan
