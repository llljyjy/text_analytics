I received this SPF complimentary from Supergoop! In exchange for my honest review.  I can layer this lightweight sunscreen over my serums and under my makeup without any clumping or caking, which is a big plus.  There is no white cast and Iâ€™ve started wearing sunscreen even on days that I spend indoors because I need the blue light protection from screen time and Every. Single. Face. offers just that.  It does have a slight alcohol smell when applied, but it quickly dissipates and becomes odorless. Great for layering under makeup
