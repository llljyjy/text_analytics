I bought this during my trip to Seattle in August, because I didn’t bring sunscreen and also I heard good things about this sunscreen. Right upon application, it was so sticky! Not the kind of feeling you want when you’re walking for miles under the sun. Although the formula is smooth, the stickiness makes me want to pass this product. Unfortunately, I bought the larger size (1.5 fl oz) and will slowly try to use it all. I wish I didn’t buy this product and could return though. Sticky & Smells
