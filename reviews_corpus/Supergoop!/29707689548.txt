This is the most luxurious sunscreen I’ve ever used. It feels so nice on, it makes my skin feel so soft and I think it blurs my pores! It doesn’t leave a white cast and it won’t cause any other skincare to pill. I let my mother use some and she was blown away by the quality of this sunscreen too! If you aren’t sure if you want to buy this, at least buy the mini version just to try it, although you’ll probably end up purchasing the full size immediately after you try it! It’s that good! You won’t regret it! Luxurious Sunscreen
