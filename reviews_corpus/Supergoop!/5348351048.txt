FINALLY, I am so glad they have released a mineral version of my favorite sunscreen! I’ve been trying to avoid chemical sunscreens and I was so happy to find this on the Sephora website. I was anticipating it to have a white cast like most mineral sunscreens, but I am happy to report there is no white cast and it’s very easy to blend into the skin! It feels silky - a perfect sunscreen texture. So happy that Supergoop has released this, now they just need to release a mineral version of Handsceen and my life would be made, lol. nan
