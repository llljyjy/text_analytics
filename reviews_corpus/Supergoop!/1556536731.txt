I love that this spf 40 is so light weight and doesn’t have a white cast. It feels more like a thin tinted moisturizer and  gives a warm glow similar to a very soft liquid highlighter. I like that it makes my skin look better when I’m not wearing makeup without covering anything up. Definitely going to be my favorite for summer for pool days and when I’m going to outdoor events. Warm glow with no white cast
