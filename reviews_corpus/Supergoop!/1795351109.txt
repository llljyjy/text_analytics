I absolutely love this sunscreen. It blends in easily and since it is tinted it does not leave a white cast. The only problem is that itâ€™s almost a bit too dark for my fair skin tone. It makes me look like I have a light tan but blends in well overall. I would definitely recommend picking this up. Perfect for Summer
