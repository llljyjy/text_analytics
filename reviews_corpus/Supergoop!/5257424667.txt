New poolside bag must have!  I live in AZ with 100+ degree days and I spray the product on my face every 2 hours and havenâ€™t had any sun burns!! So easy to apply!! No rubbing in or running to the bathroom to wash hands. I do recommend wearing waterproof mascara since mine transferred a bit after applying. Overall great product! I also love that my friends and family can easily reapply with a quick spritz. Complimentary from Supergoop :) Poolside Must Have
