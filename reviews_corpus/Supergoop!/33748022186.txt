The Glowscreen is an awesome product for my normal skin that is free of blemishes. It absorbs easily into my skin and it adds a pearlescent sunkissed base for make-up and looks really good alone, too. My friend tried it on her dry skin and it was splotchy and did not provide a seamless look she was looking for, instead, it seemed to not absorb and sit on top of her skin. At the end of the day, my skin still had a faint pearly glow and between this and sunscreen on top, my face stayed protected in the Florida sun.  I will definitely be using this everyday on my routine and highly recommend it. nan
