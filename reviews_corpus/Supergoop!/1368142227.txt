I live this sunscreen. As a 38 year old woman, skin care has become important. I won’t leave the house without sunscreen on my face now. I usually use elta md mineral which I’ve loved but this glow screen is wonderful. It doesn’t burn or pill. I use my toner, glow recipe plum moisturizer and put this on top. It’s great for a dewy non makeup look. It’s great for confidence with no makeup days. I’ve even used my Charlotte tilsbury Hollywood glow on my cheeks with it which also adds to the pretty glow. I recommend this sunscreen. nan
