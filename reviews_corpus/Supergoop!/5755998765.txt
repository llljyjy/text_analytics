I’ve been using this daily moisturizer for about five months now. I have oily/combo skin which tends to be drier in the winter months. That being said, it’s a little too moisturizing when temps go over 40-degrees, and I can feel it on my face. The first couple of weeks, I did get a little bit of texture on my face, but some of it went away once my skin got used to this product. There is a slight floral/fresh scent that does dissapate once it begins absorbing, and it’s not greasy at all, which I appreciate. I do wish there was a smaller tub available, and as I know I won’t be able to use it in the spring and summer months, I worry about the SPF expiring sooner than I can finish the product. Oh, I also use a little cosmetic spatula to scoop a baby pea-size amount. Overall, I am content with this daily SPF, but have mixed feelings about repurchasing. Nice, but looking for something better
