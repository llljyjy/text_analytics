I bought this after testing it out on the back of my hand in store. Liked that it didnâ€™t leave a white cast or have an oily finish so I bought it. Went back to my car and put it on right away and was disgusted by how much residue was caked on my hand after applying on my entire face. I would say more ended up on my hand than on my face! Since I was still in the parking lot, I went back into the store and returned it for another sunscreen. Do not buy! Pills and leaves residue on fingers
