Got this as a sample. Live in CA. I use EltaMD sunscreen on my face, so never tried this on face. Using this on chest, neck, forearms when I go out with the girls, to a party or any social outdoor time. Beautiful glow & SPF combo!! Weekdays I use other white Zinc Oxide mineral body sunscreens. They leave a white cast or leave my skin matte or white-ish. This sunscreen is amazing for my body when I donâ€™t wanna get nasty aging on my forearms (yes forearms are majorly in sun), chest and neck. BODY ONLY Review
