I’ve used this product twice on my face. I followed the directions on the bottle and shook it before using it. First of all the spray basically squirted on to my face and was not much of a mist. After spraying the mist, some got on my hair and immediately turned it oily. I noticed it did make my makeup come off a little. I’m determined to make this product work because i love the idea of a sunscreen setting spray It’s OK
