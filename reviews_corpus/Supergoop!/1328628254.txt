I originally bought this to combine my sunscreen and vitamin c step into 1 step. But this sunscreen made my skin greasy and shiny and not in a glowing dewy way. My skin is not naturally oily. The pump is not well designed either. Sometimes when I use it, the product squirts everywhere. The liquid comes out looking separated even from the beginning. I like the concept of this product but itâ€™s too greasy for my skin. good concept but greasy formula
