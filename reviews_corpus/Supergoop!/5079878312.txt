I received this sunscreen for free in exchange for my honest opinion. This sunscreen is tinted and a little bit darker than my skin. I thought it would leave my skin tan, but it blended in nicely. It’s non-sticky and absorbs quickly. It leaves my skin hydrated and glowing. It doesn’t pill under my makeup. Nice spf
