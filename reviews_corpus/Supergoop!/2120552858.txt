I was hoping this would be “the one“ since it had so many great reviews. Unfortunately, I hated it. For me, it didn’t go on smoothly. I felt like I really had to rub it in, which isn’t great for mature skin. It was also just a little too matte for my liking. It played nicely with my makeup, but I felt like it dried me out a bit. The biggest downfall though is that it broke me out :( The very next day I had breakouts on my nose (?!) and chin. It took almost a week to clear those up. I’m so disappointed. Dry, Acne Prone Skin Beware!
