This is my first time using a sunscreen oil and I love it! It doesn’t feel oily on the skin at all and it absorbs super quickly. This is the perfect sunscreen to use in the winter because it doesn’t have a super high SPF. My skin feels super moisturized and nourished after I use it so it’s double the win!! complimentary from Supergoop Amazing!
