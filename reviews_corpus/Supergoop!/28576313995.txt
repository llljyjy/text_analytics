This was gifted to me by Supergoop for my honest reviews. I like moisturizing oils for my dry skin, and sunscreen is something I love and reapply throughout the day. This product is a combo of the two, I love how hydrating my skin feels with added sun protection. However, I am not a fan of the smell and just like other oils it takes a bit to be fully absorbed by the skin. I use this in the morning as the last step of my routine and before a tinted spf/bb cream (which I use as base for makeup). I love how it makes my skin extra glowing. I think if you like oil very much, you’d love this. Nevertheless, I would recommend to pick another Supergoop product if you’re primarily looking for sun protection (not ideal for layering). nan
