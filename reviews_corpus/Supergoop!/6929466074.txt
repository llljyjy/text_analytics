If you know anything about proper sunscreen application then you’d know this can only be used under a foundation that also contains SPF. Because of the silicone feeling in this sunscreen there is no way that someone is going to apply to right amount to get adequate coverage from this on its own because they would be an oily mess and acne prone skin would be at high risk for a breakout. Please don’t use this as a stand alone sunscreen thinking you’ll get decent coverage. You may not burn but you’re still risking sun damage. Only acceptable as a primer!
