I want so bad to love this sunscreen but it has been nothing but bad for my eyes. Especially while wearing contacts. At first this sunscreen seems fine but as the day goes on it feels as though it’s melted down. I can confirm it was a problem when I use my oil cleanser to wash my entire face and it stung my eyes. This is after trying the sunscreen three other different times. I don’t have this problem with the Unseen Sunscreen from Supergoop. I would definitely avoid putting this sunscreen near your eyes.
