This sunscreen has a really light gel-like consistency. It spreads really easily and absorbs into the skin quickly. I prefer using this sunscreen if I’m wearing makeup, because it is pretty shimmery/ highlighter like if you just wear it on it’s own. I think it’s a little too unnatural for my liking, but under makeup it’s a fantastic base! nan
