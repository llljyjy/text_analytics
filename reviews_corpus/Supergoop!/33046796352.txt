It’s very wet, but it goes on my skin great! It doesn’t sting, and it doesn’t look bad and make me look ghostly.I just ordered the “Value Size“ 18oz. 3x the volume for only double the price of the regular size. It came in 2 days and came perfect and intact with a sticker to keep the pump together. Great for face and body!
