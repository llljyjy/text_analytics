Love this sunscreen gifted by Supergoop! I’m such a fan of Supergoop and love all sunscreens that I’ve tried, this is no exception! It’s very light- weight and feels perfect on my combo/oily skin. It’s not greasy and doesn’t leave a white cast. I love the shape of the bottle, it’s different and fun and still a good siento throw in your purse or bag. This sits very well under makeup and I like the more liquid texture of it, not thick or goopy. Def recommend! Light-weight and great for combo/oily skin!
