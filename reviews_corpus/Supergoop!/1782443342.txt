I wanted to love this product. Everyone raves about it and I really had high hopes. I would say this will maybe work for someone that doesn’t wear makeup. This pilled on top of my drunk elephant protini which I refuse to change. I have other spf products that don’t pill on top of my skincare. And I ended up having to completely remove my makeup and start over. I tend to use silicone/sweat/water resistant foundations and this primer was not it under my makeup. I will be giving mine to someone who wears water based products. not for me
