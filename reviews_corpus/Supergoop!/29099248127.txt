I was so very Sceptical to use a spray sunscreen because the previous ones always had a strong alcohol scent and stickiness after. This one blew me off, super lightweight, doesn’t smell of alcohol, doesn’t ruin the makeup and no sticky residue after. and let me tell you, the sun protection is just as amazing. this will be my staple spf esp for traveling and topping up on makeup.
