I was devastated by this product. I, like many, got very excited by the hype I was seeing on tiktok about this sunscreen and decided I would try it. I did a trial test by wearing it on a day I would be on the sun and reapplied like the directions said and still got very sunburned. Not to mention the texture is awful and whatever is in this broke my skin out. not a fan
