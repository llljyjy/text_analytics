As someone who has a tan skin, i didn’t think sunscreen is necessary. But it became the most important part of my skincare routine after doing my research. So i went and tried all different sunscreens, over the years, but there’s nothing that can compare to this brand! First of all it’s been hard to find a sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white streak on my face. Second, this works wonders as a moisturizer and EVEN a primer for me! Which is a big plus, because i use foundation and powders (highlighter, bronzer all that stuff) and it’s important that this doesn’t make it cake up. Anyways, try it & see for yourselves! Amazing
