I’ve been using this product since May and I love it! It doesn’t pill, or dry out your skin. No white cast either. You can easily carry it in a small purse when you’re outside and use/re-use it anytime you need to. Please don’t discontinue this one. It’s very easy to apply as it just glides on pre-made face. It doesn’t mess up make up but actually gives a shiny glow to the face.I haven’t had any skin problems from using it. face Perfect!
