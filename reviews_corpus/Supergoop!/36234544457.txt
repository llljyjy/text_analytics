I do like this product because it hydrates my skin and I get to avoid that step of my skincare routine (I was a beginner), and even though it feels saturated at first, when it dries well it doesn’t feel that way and adds a very natural and pretty glow to your skin. The problem is that after a few retouches it becomes too much, and it’s pretty bad for oily skin like mine. I really like it but I wouldn’t buy again
