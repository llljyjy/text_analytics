This product i wanted to love because of the glow but man it was so disappointing! My skin color is more on the medium to medium dark now that it is sunny. It left my skin looking weird like white cast but glowy! The glow was beautiful but the way it blended on my skin was horrible. I tried it on my mom who is much lighter than I am and it blended beautifully on her! There should definitely be more color range since this can and canâ€™t work on certain skin colors. nan
