I love this sunscreen. You don’t need much to cover the whole face, so even the small bottle lasts a while. It’s clear, so it doesn’t leave a white tint. Going on it smells a little bit like sunscreen, but once dry it doesn’t smell like anything. Also love that it doesn’t leave a residue or stickiness, so putting on make up after this is super easy. nan
