I have mixed feelings about this product. I was alarmed when I first squeezed it out of the tube because it was a very tan shade which I wasn’t expecting and wasn’t sure about using on my very fair skin. The sunrise shade would’ve definitely worked better! However, I applied makeup on top of it and it looked fresh and glowy. I also got multiple compliments on how flawless and natural my makeup looked! I really like the formula and it didn’t irritate my skin at all. I will def keep using and feeling it out. Recommend!! Love so far!
