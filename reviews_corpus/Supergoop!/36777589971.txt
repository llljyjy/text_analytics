I received the (Re)Setting Mist complimentary from Supergoop! You can’t reapply sunscreen once you have makeup on and this product has literally come to save the day! I’m so happy I received this product. I love that it feel just like a setting spray but it has SPF in it. It is SPF 40. I love the smell, kind of a minty and fresh smell. It is also a matte finish which is great so you don’t look oily after applying! This will definitely be my go to this summer as i’m already loving it! Game Changer!
