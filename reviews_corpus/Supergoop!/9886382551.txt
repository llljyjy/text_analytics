With summer quickly approaching I have been looking for a good mist that I can spray on to set my makeup, so I decided to give this one a try! The fact that it has SPF in it was definitely a bonus. I love that I can easily throw this in my purse and spray it on multiple times a day. Itâ€™s super light and minty. I do recommend waiting a few seconds before opening your eyes just to prevent any burning since it is minty. Overall I find this so refreshing and will be using it a ton this summer. Gifted by Supergoop! I will be using this a ton!
