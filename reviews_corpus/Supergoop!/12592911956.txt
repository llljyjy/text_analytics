got a little one of these in the Sephora favorites sun safety set and am sad to say I finished the bottle because it really did work beautifully under makeup. really filled in all the pores and smoothed out your skin while giving a good amount of protection. my only complaint is that itâ€™s a bit too greasy for me and does make your skin look a little too dewy after an hour of makeup wear, but I also do have quite oily skin so could just be a personal problem. honestly do think I will be repurchasing soon amazing two in one product
