This is amazing!! I honestly didn’t think I would like it at first because my skin tends to get oily throughout the day, and I thought this would just make it worse. But honestly, after a few minutes of applying it, you can’t even feel it. This is the only SPF I’ve tried that I don’t dread putting on my face. I just went ahead and purchased the jumbo size during the sale, because it’s really that great!!! perfect SPF!!
