I received this gifted by Supergoop! to try out and i was super excited. I have been looking for a setting spray with sunscreen in it and I was SO happy to finally find this! The only issue (which I kinda expected) is that the spray is not as fine as I would like it. I feel like Iâ€™m not getting as full coverage as I want and I often forget to put sunscreen under my makeup. Love the concept just which it was thinner! Could be thinner
