Really wanted to like this since I love the Unseen one but this one just did not work for me. For reference I have pretty dry skin but a solid skincare routine that leaves my skin very moisturized. When I tried applying this as the last step it pilled all over my face like crazy!! I tried so many methods of just patting slowly and in small areas which definitely worked better but just took forever and didnâ€™t make sense to try and do every morning when rushing to work. I gave it a 2nd star because the glow it gives is seriously beautiful but the laborious process and pilling just did not do it for me. Pilling galore but beautiful glow </3
