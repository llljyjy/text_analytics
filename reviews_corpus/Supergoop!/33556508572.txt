I received this complimentary from Supergoop  in exchange for my honest review.  I have tried supergoop sunscreens before and thought they had a unique scent. This sunscreen is also unique but in a good way probably because it’s oil. I have combination skin so I wasn’t sure if I was going to like it but I love it. It leaves my skin feeling hydrating and not oily. I also love that it has ceramides as my skin loves them. nan
