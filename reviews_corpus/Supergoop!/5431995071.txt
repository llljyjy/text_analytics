I wanted to love this so much. I tried it a couple of times and it never looked/felt good. First time I used it over a water based moisturizer and it looked so splotchy and also like I dumped my face in highlighter (and not the nice dewy look but like Anastasia Beverly Hills highlighter palette all over my face). Second time I tried using it over an oil based moisturizer and same thing happened. I would rub it in for so long and my skin just wouldn’t absorb it. It would gather on parts of my face and turn orange. I’m wondering if it would work better if I used less, but that defeats the purpose of it since you’re supposed to apply sunscreen liberally. I’ll stick to the supergoop play sunscreen any day over this! wanted to love it, very disappointed
