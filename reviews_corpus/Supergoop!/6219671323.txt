I was hesitant to try this product again after so many years of not using it and personally not really loving the old formula. But I’m pleasantly surprised with it. It does dry as you apply so that maybe some of the “dryness” that people feel but if you need to blend an area a little better and it’s dried I just take water or a water based moisturizer on my finger and work that area. The water rehydrates the formula really well. You could prob even use a serum. I didn’t apply moisturizer before using this once and it was for sure harder to apply to bare skin. But overall I like the new formula. For having normal to dry skin. pleasantly surprised
