I received Supergoop  best selling, hydrating makeup primer with SPF 40 that leaves a dewy, glowy finish. I love using this specially the days I know I’m going to leave the house. This doesn’t leave any cast and is so moisturizing. The makeup sits well underneath and I love that it has a tint. Great primer with spf
