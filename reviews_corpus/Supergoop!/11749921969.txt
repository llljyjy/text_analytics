I love this product ! It gives a nice glow which is what I love. But the packaging sucks. This is the second time the base of the nozzle breaks/rips and starts oozing from the side. That’s the only complaint. Makes me not want to repurchase. I don’t have to deal with spilling with an expensive product like this. improve the packaging !
