I actually really love this. Normally I don’t even use a face wash because I never like them but my mother in law gave me this and it’s really great. I feel like it really cleans my skin and helps with my acne spots. It’s a little drying if you have dry skin but I’ve found as long as I moisturize really well after I use it I have no issues with it. Love!
