I’ve been using the product two times a week for the past few weeks and I can really see the difference in the overall texture of my skin. It feels smoother, less bumpy in areas and appears brighter. I also feel that some of my dark spots have lightened. I have found that my makeup products apply better after using this product! I also feel that my other skincare products seem to work better. I love the smell! It’s super clean and energizing.I would definitely be consistent in using this product 2x per week and follow with a creamy moisturizer, not a gel. I have combination skin and am often sensitive to many products & had no issues with this product at all. Great For All Skin Types
