Loved the packaging it’s very chic and classy. The product texture is okay but I wish is was a bit more grittier to feel like I’m really exfoliating without applying too much pressure. Doesn’t really have a scent.Best or most effective areas of treatment were around my nose, jawline, and forehead. However it seemed to irritate the corners of my mouth a bit.I liked how gentle it feels and how well it removed the blackheads around my t zone.Avoid mouth area and don’t use too much pressure when going in circular motions. Always moisturize afterwards.Anyone with oily, sensitive, or even dry skin. Lovely addition to resurface and soften skin
