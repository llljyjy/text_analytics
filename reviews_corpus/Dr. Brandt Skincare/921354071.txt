I received in FFF BOX I WAS VERY EXCITED TO TRY I READ LOTS OF GOOD REVIEWS. I don’t know if FFF Got these because someone spilled the Lavender into the Vat while making it, but I don’t understand how ANYONE CAN PUT SOMETHING THAT SMELLS LIKE THAT ON THEIR FACE! I opened container room a whiff almost died! Like a lavender Patchouli BOMB! my eyes watered and I shut it. I really wish more reviewers would discuss smell. I won’t. Buy a product unless I can see a good description of scent or UNSCENTED due to migraines. The most Unhelpful reviews are the ones that say (smells good)!  What does that mean? Is it minty citrusy musky floral? People really need to help us out and actually describe why the scent smells good and what it smells like. THANK YOU!! lavender BOMB! OMG! :(
