This is a great formula.  Don’t leave a white cast and smooths over my normal to dry skin easily.  But the packaging is horrific.   Please change the dispensing mechanism.  I’ll buy again if so.  But until then I’m going to finish the bottle as best I can and move into a sunscreen that dispenses easily.    Please please change the delivery. nan
