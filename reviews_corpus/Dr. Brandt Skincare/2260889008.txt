The product itself is great. No white cast, the texture is nice and moisturizing. BUT the packaging? It wasn’t well thought out. The consistency of the product is too thick to be in a bottle with a dropper. So much product will go to waste because you won’t be able to get it all out. Great sunscreen, wrong packaging
