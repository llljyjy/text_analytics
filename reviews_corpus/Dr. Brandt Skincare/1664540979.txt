This sunscreen was included in a Sephora favorites bundle and I was super excited to try it given all of the positive reviews. I’ve given it my best shot and it just doesn’t work for me. The dropper doesn’t have any suction. I literally have to turn the bottle upside down to pour the product out. The product itself is awful too. It is sooo sticky once applied. I have tried using it on top of my normal skincare (vitamin C serum & separate moisturizer) and by itself but it didn’t matter. My face remained tacky for hours afterwards. It never soaks in. The only way I’m able to use this is under makeup because I can set everything with powder. Otherwise, this is completely u wearable. I have dry/combination skin that’s unproblematic (no sensitivity, no breakouts) and I have been a religious sunscreen wearer for 10+ years. Like having Elmer’s glue on my face
