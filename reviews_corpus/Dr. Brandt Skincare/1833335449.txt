Glad i didnâ€™t pay full price for this.  Used only once on a perfectly clear face and skin broke out the next day with a bunch of white little pimples.  Horrible!  And did not see any mattifying effect during the day i had this on.  Very disapointing for a profuct this price.  I prefer other matrifying products Sephora carries and cost half the regular price. Waste of money and broke my skin
