This is an incredible exfoliator, I appreciate the finest particles that just smooth out my skin along with the chemical exfoliating ingredients. I love the way this seemed to transform & suddenly feel cooling and it has the most delicious lemony scent. My skin is incredibly soft after using & has improved texture & brightness the more I’ve been using! I try to use 2x per week as recommended! The two minute massage seems like a long time but it’s definitely worth it! I love this one! Incredibly soft & smooth skin & smells so good!
