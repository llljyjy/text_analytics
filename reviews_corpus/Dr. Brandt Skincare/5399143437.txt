The Dr.Brandt microdermabrasion age defying exfoliator is so nice. You get your skin wet with warm water. Then you get some of the product and gently massage the product into your skin for one to two minutes. Then you rinse well. This product buffs away dead skin. Gives you a smoother and brighter complexion. I would highly recommend this product! A must have!
