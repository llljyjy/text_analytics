I have been using this product for about a month and a half now and I feel like it truly does help me maintain my redness control. I use a few different anti redness products so I was excited to add this to my routine. The cream itself is not greasy at all but also not drying like some products can be. It does give off a slight cooling sensation when first applied. I have dry skin so this is a great cream to use under my more moisturizing creams. My only complaint with the product is that the packaging is not ideal. I dropped the container and the top of the container cracked and crumbled to pieces. Over all I will be purchasing again I just wish that the container can be improved, I donâ€™t think that top should be so weak to crumble. nan
