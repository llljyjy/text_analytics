NOW I am NOT big on physical exfoliators, I am SO nervous disrupt my skin barrier, I know that sounds weird because you can do the same with Chemical exfoliants, It’s just me. Anyway, This Microdermabrasion Scrub is SUPER GENTLE on my skin. My nerves subsided real quick, I gently scrubed away. There was a slight menthol feeling on my skin which was pleasant. The results, super SOFT, Smooth skin.  This Gem has helped My skin, no irritation, no dryness and my products, which have been sitting ON TOP of my skin lately with this weather change, fully absorb into my skin. I mean, I’ve only been using this for 2 weeks, 2x a week, but I Will definitely be keeping her in my routine to see more results! a must
