I received this product free in exchange for my honest review.This is a medium weight product with a very fine exfloiant in to make up its texture. This has a clean and inviting natural scent. Just a small amount goes a long ways. Be sure not to scrub to hard, the tiny exfloiants will do the job for you. I love this and its so easy to use. I do have some texture on my chin and this worked extremely well there with the tiny particles. This left my skin feeling renewed! It was so incredibly soft, supple and very moisturized that I was really shocked! This is not like the scrubs from back when but like how a scrub should always have been. I am impressed that the ingredients are 97% natural!! My skin looks radiant after I use it and is definitely cleaner that before I started using it. I have combination skin with some larger pores on nose and chin areas. I can see this is helping to exfloiant down in those bigger pores and the dirtier ones too. I have not had any issues or reactions whatsoever while using this. Game Changing Scrub!!
