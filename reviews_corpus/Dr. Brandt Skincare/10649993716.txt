I recieved this product complimentary from Trust in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this product a few times a week for the last month. What I’ve noticed is a better texture, my skin is clearer, and it leaves it so soft after using. I like the little beads in the texture. Once applied it almost feels like it pulsates on your skin which I love because it tells me that the product is working effectively. This is easily one of my new favorite products! Leaves your skin super soft
