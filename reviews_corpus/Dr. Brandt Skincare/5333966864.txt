Fantastic exfoliating product, honestly I have no complaints. Not rough on the skin and gives the perfect amount of exfoliation. Has a lemon smell and seems to ball up on your face as you rub it on. You only need a little bit and your face feels fantastic afterwards, very soft and clean without feeling stripped. Highly recommend, you wonâ€™t be disappointed! Fantastic Exfoliating Product
