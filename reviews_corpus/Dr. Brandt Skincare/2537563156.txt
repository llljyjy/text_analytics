I have dry skin with mild sensitivity. I would never use this as my go to AM cleanser. Using this in the PM as a second cleanser has been a game changer. I struggle with the occasional breakout and this helps bring my skin back to normal. Definitely willing to pay the $36 for it. Love this for breakouts!
