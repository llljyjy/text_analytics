LOVE this product and the glow it gives, and it works in the Australian sun for at least 45 minutes (but not more than 60) which is rare for sunscreen not made for and approved for Australia. This is moisturizing and gives a great glow!I will note I do NOT wear makeup outside of eyes and blush, I think this would pill with full coverage makeup though. Great sunscreen, lovely glow.
