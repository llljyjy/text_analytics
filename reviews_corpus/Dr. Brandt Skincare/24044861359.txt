This is pretty good! I got it in an Sephora favorites set so I got it for much cheaper. Not worth the money though. Doesn’t leave a white cast. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the dropper? Works fine. Just not worth it for like 60$ though. If you’ve got the money and you don’t care then go for it! But you can def find cheaper. Not worth the price
