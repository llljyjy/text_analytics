Love the sunscreen. Feels great on my skin and leaves no white cast. Regarding the dropper: I, too, thought mine was defective until I saw someone post about it and realized that I was doing it wrong. You have to squeeze the top of the dropper before putting it in the sunscreen. Then you put it in the sunscreen while still pinching the top, release it, and then squeeze the product on your finger/hand. I went from thinking that I had a defective dropper to realizing that I just wasnâ€™t using the product as intended. It works great now. This is my absolute favorite daily face sunscreen. The dropper might not actually be defective
