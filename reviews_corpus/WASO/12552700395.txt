I love this scrub mask! The product was simple to put on and it didn’t feel uncomfortable. I also liked that it turned almost into a wash as I removed it and my face felt very cool and clean afterwards. I have dry sensitive skin and so far my face didn’t feel irritated or more dry the next morning. I totally recommend! Best rejuvenating scrub mask!
