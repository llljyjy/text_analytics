I don’t typically reach for masks because I typically don’t notice much difference when I use it alongside my skincare tuitions, but this has to be the most moisturizing mask I have ever used! I use it somewhat sporadically but I have enjoyed every use. I also like that as an exfoliating mask it doesn’t have a bunch of abrasive bits that scratch your face. It feels like a nice soft scrub which I like. I will definitely be buying this again when I run out. nan
