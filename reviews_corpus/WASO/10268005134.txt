The first time I used this I was surprised on how refreshed my skin felt. The exfoliating beads are very gentle but do what they are supposed to. I have used this consistently since receiving it and my pores appear a little smaller to the eye but they are generally less noticeable around my nose especially under makeup (which was a problem area before). Beautiful packaging and well worth the money and the experience of a high end skincare company. nan
