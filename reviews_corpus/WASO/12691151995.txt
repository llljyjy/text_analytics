Immediately I was amazed by the packaging of this product and the fact that the ingredients do not include any harsh chemicals. Before trying the product my skin felt very textured and rough but after applying the product you can visibly see a difference. I tried it with the oil cleanser and the moisturizer to test if it would cause my skin to produce more oils than it normally does. At the end of the day there was no excess oil and even made it appear less oily than usual. The product feels smooth and not rough on the skin when first applied, and it didnâ€™t dry up my face after using! This product is definitely a must have! Wonderful
