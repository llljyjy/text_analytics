I was hesitant to use this serum because I haven’t used any vitamin c things for the past 2 years because I’ve been trying to figure out and manage my skin condition. I didn’t know how my skin would react to it but after patch testing it for a while I was so happy I wasn’t allergic to it or have any bad reactions. Yuzu is like one of my favorite fruits and I know how great the benefits are so I was super excited to use this. You have to shake it up before applying. It applies and gets absorbed into my skin well. It does have a very faint scent when it’s out of the tube but I don’t smell anything when applied. I don’t see any fragrance listed on the ingredient list so it could be the natural scent of the yuzu. I have noticed that I’m starting to get the glowy skin back that I used to have before my whole skin issue thing happened. Hopefully this will help brighten up and fade my acne scars with continued use. I have sensitive, combo skin type, rosacea, and seborrheic dermatitis. Love it so far
