after using this product for about a month let me just say it’s AMAZING. i use it every night as my last step on my skin routine & it leaves my face feeling sooo smooth & looking so hydrated. the texture of the mask doesn’t feel sticky or make you look oil which i love! i love how it moisturize my face especially since i have very dry skin. definitely recommend! MUST HAVE
