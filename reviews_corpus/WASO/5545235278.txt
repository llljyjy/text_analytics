I had low expectations trying this product because I have never found an acne spot treatment that actually works. This one as well does not do anything for my skin. I tried putting on incoming pimples or acne, I tried putting it on acne that is already at the surface of my skin, inflamed, etc. it really just didn’t do anything and I’m not exactly sure what it was supposed to do. I assume to calm acne but again, it did nothing. Would not recommend. Nothing, absolutely nothing
