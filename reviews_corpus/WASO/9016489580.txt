This mask is easy to apply and you only leave it on for 5 minutes, so it’s quick to do. My face did sting a little bit, but I didn’t have any allergic reaction to it. My skin can sometimes be sensitive but it didn’t get red or anything, so that was a great sign. It is recommended to use twice per week and I can say that it’s great at purifying my pores and making my skin clean and smooth. I tried it for two weeks and loved the result. I have continued using this mask at least twice per week and I love it. I definitely recommend it. I received this product free from Influenster to give my honest opinion. Loved how soft it make my skin feel!
