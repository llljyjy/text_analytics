I love moisturizing sleeping masks. Upon the first application it felt really nice and absorbed into the skin. It was a thinner consistency then Iâ€™m used to for sleeping masks, but no big deal. My skin felt really soft and hydrated in the morning. After a few days of use I started to get a bunch of tiny white heads on my cheeks, forehead and chin. I stopped using this as it was the newest product in my routine and the whiteheads went a way a few days later. I really liked the way my skin felt initially but unfortunately because I had a reaction I had to stop using it. *I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinions. All thoughts and opinions are my own. nan
