I have mixed feelings about this cleanser. I love it in theory. It’s super gentle on the skin, and it leaves my skin feeling super soft, but it’s honestly not the best at removing makeup. Its gentleness, I think, is a direct substitute for its ability to actually get the job done of removing makeup. I do not wear heavy makeup at all, and stick to blush and mascara most days, once in a while throwing on a tinted SPF moisturizer and not just SPF. Still I myself having to rewatch my face at least twice with this moisturizer. I have used a similar one before where you rub it on dry and it turns into an oil that removes makeup, and it worked wonders. This one takes a bit more work to tease out its purpose. I do think it’s still a good cleanser, especially if you don’t wear makeup, so I’m docking it just a star. Works, but not without effort
