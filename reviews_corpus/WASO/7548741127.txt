So this mask is awesome because it didn’t over dry  my face. I also love that even though it’s a face mask you can still rub in all the product in at the end before rinsing It off your face. The mask may throw you off because it comes out kind of like a clay mask but it doesn’t get dry and flaky like other clay masks. When you apply it, it feels pretty creamy. But overall yesss I would recommend this mask and so far I love this whole line. I did receive this item an exchange for a review but this is my honest opinion. nan
