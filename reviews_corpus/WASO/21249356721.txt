I was using clean and clear acne spot treatment prior to receiving this, comparing the two, unlike the clean and clear one, this waso acme treatment does NOT dry out your skin like most acne spot treatments do. Also like most, this doesnâ€™t have much of a scent to it. The texture is gel like, not crazy thick and certainly not liquidy. Although this may be intended to only be applied to pimples directly, I apply a small amount all over my face to get any upcoming pimples. I did see this works mainly on small pimples rather than the big underground annoying ones though. Love the design! So cute. Not harsh
