I don’t find myself reaching for this scrub mask as much as others but it isn’t bad and I’ll explain my pros and cons for it. I love that this mask only needs 5 minutes to sit so it works quickly. The texture is nice and creamy and the scent is also light. I love that it targets blackheads because blackheads are one of my biggest skin problems and they are emphasized if my skin isn’t freshly washed. This does a very good job at cleaning all of the oil and dirt out and leaving my skin looking refreshed. The reason why I don’t reach for this as much is because once I use it it does leave a cast of what feels like almost silicone on my skin and makes it feels as if I had not washed it off correctly. I am a texture person and I really don’t like putting stuff on my face because it makes me feel uncomfortable but of course I will do it to clean my skin however I would like for that feeling to leave once I have washed my face clean with water. It may be OK for others but for people who also have the same issue with hating the feeling of stuff being put on your face then this might not be the one for you. Other than that, this is a good product and well worth the money. Pros and cons of my personal preference
