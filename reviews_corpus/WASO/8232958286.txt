The acne gel is very gentle. It doesnt have heavy fragrance which is already a win for me. Its a clear, lightweight gel and doesnt feel sticky on my face. It dried down fast but not crusty just gentle on the skin. Woke up in the morning with my skin feeling and looking good, excited to add this to my routine. so gentle
