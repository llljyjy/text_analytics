I did receive this product in exchange for my honest opinion. One of the most gentle scrubs I’ve ever used that’s still effective. I have super sensitive skin so most scrubs break me out and I’ve been super hesitant to try any more. I was very happy with how smooth my skin felt after and I didn’t break out! I’m so excited to keep using this scrub nan
