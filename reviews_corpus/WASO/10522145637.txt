This is more of an oil based product than other vitamin C serums I have used, but it’s hydrating as well as giving a bit of a glow. Not as thick as the other c serums I have used (a very thin consistency) so it’s easy to apply but a little also goes a long way!  It can be easy to apply too much accidentally because of the consistency lol it took me a few days to figure out the right amount.  When I used too much it made me a bit greasy after a few hours but didn’t cause a breakout or anything like that! Different for a C serum but I like it!
