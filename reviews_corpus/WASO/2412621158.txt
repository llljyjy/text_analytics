I don’t generally lean towards purifying scrubs just because my skin is quite sensitive and I don’t want to irritate it. However, if you are going to use a scrub, this one has got to be one of the best ones that I have used. Since my skin is combination, I only put this in my tzone area (wherever it gets oily most). It’s nice that this product duals as both a mask and a scrub. When you let it sit on your skin, it has a very slight cooling feeling, and it doesn’t really dry down--there’s some tackiness to it (which I much prefer). When washing it off with water, you do feel the scrub but it’s super gentle and not abrasive at all. I really enjoy how light this exfoliation is! Super gentle!
