I have a dry skin type and surprisingly this mask doesn’t make me feel like the Sahara desert. It’s a fairly quick mask, leave on for five minutes a rinse off, but it is refreshing. My skin feels very smooth after I use it, but I always make sure to follow up with the wasp moisturizer after. Works for dry skin!
