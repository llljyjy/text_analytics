Im not a huge fan of scrubs as it is just because I do struggle with red sensitive skin on half my face (excluding my t zone, its really weird I know) and this made my redness worse after 1 use. It eventually calmed down but its no longer something Ill use on my red areas and maybe just focus this mask on my T-Zone. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin but if you have non red skin no matter your skin type you might really enjoy this. Good for non sensitive skin
