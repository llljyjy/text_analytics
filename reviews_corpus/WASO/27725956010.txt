I have crappy pores. Big ugly pores. I never had good experience with product required for pores. When I use this after the gel to oil cleanser, it snatches them right up! It grabs almost everything right out and whatever’s left, I use my little pumper popper but it’s so much softer and you don’t have to use some much pressure to get those stubborn ones. Recommend this product! PORES
