This product is soo good! Absolutely love how this mask exfoliates and hydrates at the same time! My skin looks amazing and I can definitely see a difference in how much it glows after one use. The consistency is like a clay but itâ€™s not heavy! Instead of drying your skin it glides really smoothly and it polished your skin leaving a healthy look! This mask feels good and refreshing. Tried it in a skin care sesh with my husband and we both really enjoyed it. This product is unscented and super easy to use! Skin tight clean and fresh
