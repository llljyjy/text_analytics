It has the most beautiful scent that isn’t at all overpowering. It’s a fun jelly texture that is instantly absorbed. It doesn’t feel as occlusive as you’d expect an overnight mask to feel. Goes great on top of moisturizer. I’ll get more use out of the come winter! It’s a bit hot for layering skincare right now! A fun product!
