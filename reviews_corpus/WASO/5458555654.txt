I received this product complimentary for review purposes. This product works very well on my sensitive skin. Other serums cause me to break out and this product does not. It goes on smooth and not too oily like other serums I have tried. It makes my skin glow and I love having it in my skincare routine prior to applying make up. The glow lasts even after putting make up over it. Glow-on shot serum
