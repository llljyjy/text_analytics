I was a bit uncertain about this product at first because I was worried it would be harsh, but I couldn’t have been more wrong! It was so gentle and soft on my face and left my skin feeling baby soft. I’ve always been a fan of clay masks because I love the smell and the earthy feel but some of them are a bit too harsh and cause tingling. This one didn’t. It felt like it cleared out my pores wonderfully and did a gentle, calm exfoliation even after just one use. I used it between once and twice a week and saw really great results within a month. It went really well with their new Waso moisturizer too!My favorite thing about this product is how clean and fresh it leaves your face feeling after each use. It really just feels like a normal, natural part of my routine already even though I haven’t used it for that long. A new staple for sure! My new favorite clay mask!
