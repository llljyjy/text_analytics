I received this product in exchange for my honest review from Influenster and Shiseido. Of all the Shiseido products, this one was my favorite! The packaging of these products are amazing! Very aesthetically pleasing for leaving on your bathroom counter. Like other masks that are drying and abrasive, this product is opposite. Super gentle formula with natural ingredients. I loved how soft my skin was after one application of this product. I would only use a mask once a week but with this mask being so gentle, I wouldnâ€™t hesitate to use two or three times a week if necessary. Would definitely buy again! Gentle Pore Eliminating Mask
