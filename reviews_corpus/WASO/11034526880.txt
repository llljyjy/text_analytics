This mask works wonders on my acne. I have dry skin, so I like to only use it a couple times a week, but whenever I do I notice my black/whiteheads become less inflamed and go away faster than if I leave them be. Its also a nice gentle exfoliate, which helps scrub away my dry bits. That being said, given it’s a clay based mask I notice I do dry out more after use, but that can be easily rectified with my serums and moisturizer. It has practically no fragrance so sensitive skin users shouldn’t have to worry about any adverse reaction on that front. I also like how this mask only takes five minutes to set. I don’t have much free time, so masking was usually my ’treat myself’ weekend occasion. With this mask I can easily do it before bed, or in the shower in the morning. Bottom line, I’d absolutely recommend this product. nan
