I am very happy with this treatment which removes make-up and deeply cleanses. This gel-in-oil cleanser is really pleasant on the skin when removing make-up. The skin is instantly softer and more supple, my skin is deeply cleansed, it is radiant. This gel illuminates impurities, excess sebum and makeup. My mascara which is waterproof did not resist it, and I had no trouble getting it off in a few seconds! I really recommend this gel in oil, make-up remover and cleanser. Its texture is non-sticky, and turns into a silky oil. I recommend I love it
