One of the things that I disliked about this mask is that it dries too quick and when i have to remove it (while scrubbing the skin) it doesn’t feel like it’s doing something . It is more of a mask than a scrub as it says. But beside that, I really do like and cam tell the difference once I started using it. Obviously, using this mask with the other products from the same brand does help a lot to the skin to recover. nan
