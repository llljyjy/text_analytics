I love using oil based cleansers as a first step but this just didn’t do it for me. I usually don’t wear heavy makeup but when I did I had to use this product twice, followed by another cleanser and i STILL had makeup coming off. It also leaves a residue if you don’t follow it with another cleanser. It just didn’t remove makeup as well as other oil cleansers do. nan
