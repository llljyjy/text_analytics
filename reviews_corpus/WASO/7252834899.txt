I only use this on my nose area since I have the most pores there. The texture is thick but feels smooth and luxurious on the skin. It applies very easily and isnâ€™t messy. There is a slight herbal scent to it, but nothing overpowering. Not sure if it reduced the size of my pores but I can definitely tell that my nose felt a lot more smooth and soft. Love so far
