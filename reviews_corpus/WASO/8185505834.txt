I got this product for free to review. Wow my skin feels nice! This claims to be richly moisturizing and help even out skin tone! After one use, I agree. I used all three products in the Waso Line: the cleanser, mask, and moisturizer and I’ve been impressed with all three. This moisturizer smells very light but applied very rich and left my sking looking dewy and bright. Love the ingredients in it too. Minus some acne on my forehead, my skin looks beautiful in the unfiltered photo below. I’d honestly recommend the whole collection of you struggle with especially dry skin nan
