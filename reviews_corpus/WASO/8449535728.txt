The mask was really easy to apply and I didn’t need as much product as I thought I would, even though it’s pretty thick. Five minutes isn’t a super long wait time and I had no issues rinsing it off once the timer was done. The mask smelled nice, almost like fancy sunscreen, and my skin was SO smooth after I rinsed and dried off. I LOVE it! I did receive this product for free in exchange for my honest review!
