I received this from Influenster and I like how gentle the scrub is. I’d say it’s best for more sensitive skin since it’s not so rough. I tend to leave on any mask longer than the directions say. I honestly didn’t feel a difference with the texture of my skin. It doesn’t have any strong or harsh smell to it. I’d rather just use my vanity planet exfoliating brush head and a normal cleanser to exfoliate. I haven’t had a great exfoliating cleanser that makes my skin smooth how I like. It Was Ok
