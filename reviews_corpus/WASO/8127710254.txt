I recieved this product complimentary in exchange of my honest review. This scrub not only smells great, it feels minty fresh on the skin. The exfoliants are very gentle as well. This scrub left my skin feeling soft and clean after using it. This is my now go-to product for self care days & I have incorporated it into my cleansing routine. A go-to for self care!
