I’ve never been big on face masks because I have extremely sensitive skin but since I loved the moisturizer so much I had to try it and now I do it twice a week! It’s a game changer. It’s so creamy and easy to apply, it doesn’t dry like other ones do and all you have to do is rub it in and rinse when ready. Your skin feels like a dream.. so soft and so healthy. Love love love. Try it. It's amazing!
