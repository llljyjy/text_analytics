I really liked this tinted moisturizer! It was my first time using one, & it provided a positive experience. It goes on white like regular sunscreen, but the orange beads blend, leaving more of an even, blurred effect on the skin. I love that it does not leave the white cast some sunscreens do. It works perfectly on my skin tone, but I am taking one star away out of concern that it would be too orange for someone with cool highlights or lighter skin than mine, & too light for someone with darker skin than mine. They may need to think of a shade range for the beads since making it a tinted moisturizer brings the makeup aspect into the sunscreen. I took this with me to Miami, as it was a great size for traveling. It does not make you feel greasy, and I would say it probably gives you a normal amount of hydration, enough to not make you oily throughout the day but not too moisturizing. I would only use this during the day, since you have to wash it off or it will rub off, & it is somewhat of a makeup product. It is not the product for you if you want richer hydration, which I am used to as well. Tinted Moisturizer
