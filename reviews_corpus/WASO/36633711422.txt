It is part of my skincare routine, I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this product. I have not had much success with spot clear treatments in the past but this one seemed to do the trick. Just a small amount in the morning and at night was enough to have a significant impact. The formula was also not as irritating as others Iâ€™ve used which was a huge benefit.Totally recommend this product. Bye-bye Acne!
