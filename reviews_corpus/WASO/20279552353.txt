I love everything about this product. It smells amazing, and the fact its a thinner serum I feel lets it sink into my skin much better. My skin is brighter and has more of a glow to it. And it has never felt as moisturizered since I added this to my routine. And the price is reasonable for what you get especially since you donâ€™t have to used a lot which makes it go a long way. One of the best for any brightening routine!
