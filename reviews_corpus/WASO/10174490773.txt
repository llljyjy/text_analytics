I loved that this product was very hydrating and canceled out the dullness on my face. The bottle for the product was small and great for travel. I used it in the morning before going about my day and my face stayed moisturized ALL DAY. I normally get dry patches at some point but with this product my face never came close to dry. I also love that it’s not overly oily. I definitely recommend if you’re interested in this. A new must have in my routine
