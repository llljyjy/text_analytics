I get really bad acne when my hormones are all over the place and I’ve been using this pretty much Everyday on my acne spots and it calms my skin down, makes that area of my face less red and the pimple slowly gets smaller. After using it for a month I noticed that my skin had way less acne than it usually did around the time my hormones are messed up! It’s also great that you can use this product above makeup! And yes it does not dry your skin out, just the pimple!! Another fav acne treatment
