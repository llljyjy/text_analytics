It’s winter time so I’m not outside as much as I should be. Getting vitamin c on my skin means I’m giving myself that glow up that a light tan would give. Plus, at thirty, I’m trying to get ahead of those fine lines and wrinkles so this product is definitely helping with that. and it’s fragrance free. So huge win there! I used this after I washed my face and before SPF and moisturizer. Glow up girl
