I do think it works to bring my acne down. I used it on two zits - one big and one small - it did wonders on the small one and shrunk in it just one night, the bigger one it had a harder time with, but it still worked eventually.  I usually use tretinoin, and I don’t think it compares to that, but for what it is it’s good. nan
