The first thing I love about the product is it doesnâ€™t have the harsh chemical scent like other brand. I had some inflamed pimples and decided to try the product on them. It worked pretty well on calming down the inflammation and redness. Very impressed with the product and definitely recommend to anyone with the same problem as I have. nan
