Honestly, this serum might just be my new face lotion. The oil doesn’t feel sticky or too oily and you don’t need a lot of it to apply on your face. A simple swabs on my fingers were able to cover my entire face and stay moisturized. My skin feels so soft & different. I use this whenever I take a shower to give me that after shower glow and because I feel it sets in my face a lot better. Im not much of a oil serum user but this really got along with my sensitive skin greatly. I would rebuy this too if I ever ran out. GREAT STUFF! AMAZING PRODUCT
