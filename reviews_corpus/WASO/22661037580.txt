I love how clean my skin feels after using this mask. This product  leaves my skin very soft and smooth. Iâ€™m not a huge fan of clay mask because usually it dries my skin but this one really surprised me because my skin looks so good after using it.This mask is very gentle with my dry skin but still does such a good job exfoliating it.The texture Is creamy but very easy to spread and also to remove. Good
