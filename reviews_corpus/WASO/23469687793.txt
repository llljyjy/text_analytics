It was alright! I didn’t like the smell much and it was a weird thin but also crunchy consistency (I’m not sure how else to put it). It felt nice but it also didn’t feel like it did a whole lot. That being said, I do think people who have nicer skin would like it more than I did. I’ll likely be passing it only my 12 year old sister for that reason. I think people w/ clearer skin would like it more?
