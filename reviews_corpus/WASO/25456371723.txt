When I received this moisturizer, my skin was very dry. This moisturizer has brought moisture back into my skin and is very creamy and smooth. It doesnâ€™t clog my pores and has a lovely scent. Now that my skin is much more oily, I became a bit hesitant about using moisturizer but this one does not make my skin feel oily at all! It keeps my skin feeling moisturized but not oily and I can use it in the morning and night with no worries. In the summer when my skin tends to get more sweaty, certain moisturizers make me break out but not this one. I love this moisturizer and it will definitely stay in my skin care routine for a while!
