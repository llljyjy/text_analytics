This eye product is okay. I didn’t think it was anything spectacular. I also noticed I got dry skin/tiny bumps around my eyes. Not sure if it was related to this. It feels good going on, nice and smooth. But I wasn’t a fan of the dispense method because I would always get way more than needed. Overall, just an eh product! Received this product for free for my honest opinion. Semi awakening
