I got this from an app called influenster in exchange for my honest review. I loved the product it made my face feel clean and fresh. I usually love scrubs so when I got this product I was confused on why it had to stay like a mask but I instantly loved it especially if you use it with there moisturizer amazing combo left my face natural and glowy hydrated but not oily face. I will be purchasing this product once I finish mine Loved it
