I wasn’t sure how my skin was going to react to a serum, especially one containing Vitamin-C. I’ve been using this serum as my nighttime moisturizer, on top of my retinol. My face has been glowing since I’ve been using it. I’m thoroughly impressed, especially since this isn’t a product I would have even considered. It’s been kind to my skin (I have very sensitive skin, acne prone, rosacea) & I will make it a permanent part of my skincare routine. Definitely surprised me
