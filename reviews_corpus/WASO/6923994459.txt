This Shiseido yuzu-C eye essence is very lightweight and it brightens the eyes a bit. There is a subtle glow that looks really natural. It is a gel like consistency with some smallyuzu particles that melt once you work it into your skin.Feels gentle yet energizing! Letâ€™s not forget the minimalistic packaging! Best product!
