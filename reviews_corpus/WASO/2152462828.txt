Overall I really like this product. Pros- not an overpowering scent, great consistency, and love the packaging. I hate sticking my fingers into product so I love that this is a squeeze bottle. Only con I found was that I didnâ€™t notice too much of a difference? Will follow through with it and hope to see a difference eventually! Good eye cream!
