Giving this product 4 stars, but definitely would give it 5 soon. I’ve given it 4 because I have only been using it for a little over a week so far, but with that being said it is such a great product! I use it every morning and I definitely feel like my eyes are much brighter, much more awake, and ready for the day. I want to continue to use it for longer to see how it continues to work, but I definitely think it’s something I’d purchase and include in my skincare routine! Has a great consistency almost jelly like. It also doesn’t have any weird scent to it. Becoming a staple in my routine!
