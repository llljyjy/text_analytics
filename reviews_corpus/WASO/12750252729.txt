Love the packaging! Super cute and sturdy, believe it’s also natural packaging. Has a lovely creamy texture along with the smaller abrasive bits in it obviously. Removes dead skin and I felt glowy after. Has a weird smell when using, almost like cooked peas or baby food. It’s not bad and still definitely worth it nan
