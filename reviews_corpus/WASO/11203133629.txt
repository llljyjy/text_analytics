I received this free to try from Influenster and I will definitely be buying this when I run out. It’s the perfect amount of adaptive tint without being obvious. I do wish it didn’t transfer as much as it does but otherwise it’s absolutely perfect. A great oil control finish and it doesn’t make me break out. Exactly what I was looking for
