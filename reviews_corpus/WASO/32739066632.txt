Iâ€™d highly Vermette recommend this product! I feel as if I am always trying to find a new moisturizer that works for me and my skin. I have sensitive skin and very dry eczema. This moisturizer is very light and goes on easy. As far as I could tell it did not irritate my sensitive skin. Works with my sensitive skin!
