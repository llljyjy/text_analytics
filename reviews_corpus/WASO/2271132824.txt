I got this free from Influenster. I like how soft and smooth it makes my skin feel. However I don’t like the twist off top, feels kind of tedious having to twist it off rather than easily pulling it open. It’s also just a good mask, nothing really mind blowing. I feel like I have other masks that smooth out my skin even more than this one. nan
