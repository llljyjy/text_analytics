This is one of the few skincare products I saw results with within a week of using! My redness is almost gone and my skin has a more even tone overall! I expected this serum to feel heavy and oily and not sink in very well but I was pleasantly surprised! It feels like a lightweight oil if that makes sense and absorbs nicely into the skin. HOWEVER, Shisedo is not cruelty-free so I canâ€™t see myself purchasing from them unfortunately. Redness gone! But not cruelty-free D:
