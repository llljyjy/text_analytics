I have mixed feelings about this cleanser. I already have oily skin so I don’t like to use oily products because it just makes my skin worse. However, while this left my skin feeling oily it did a great job at removing my makeup. So it would be a up to you rather you would like to spend your money on this product or not. I would recommend it because it does what it’s supposed to do, I just don’t like that it leaves your face feeling like a actual oil slick. nan
