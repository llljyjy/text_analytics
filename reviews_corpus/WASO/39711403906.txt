I enjoy trying new products and seeing what I like. I wore this particular product to an outdoor concert in the summer. I was super excited to try it. Before the concert even started it was peeling off my face think like Elmer’s glue on your hand. When it’s not hot the product does fine but it really doesn’t stand up to the heat. nan
