When I read this was an oil, I was a bit skeptical because oils don’t do well on my skin. However, this product is the perfect boost of vitamin c! It’s VERY lightweight and it leaves your skin feeling very hydrated and soft. It’s lightweight like an oil but performs like a serum if that makes any sense. You can use it as it or pair it with your moisturizer. Perfect for any season Perfect balance
