The formula was very thin and watery, so I wasn’t sure what to expect, but once it touched my face, it was very hydrating and smooth. A little goes a long way, so I see this bottle lasting a while. I like how it soft it made my face feel and the lovely dewy glow it left. Since it’s winter I put on a moisturizer afterwards, but I could see myself using it without moisturizer in the summer. Love the lightness of it and I would recommend. nan
