LOVE this mask! I haven’t really noticed a change in my clogged pores (just started 2 weeks ago maybe I haven’t used it long enough) so that’s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Though I haven’t saw a difference in my pores this is still a VERY good mask. It isn’t rough on the skin, It makes my face feel unbelievably soft after and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry or stripped like other clay mask usually do. I Highly recommend this mask as a once or twice a week refresher! GREAT MASK
