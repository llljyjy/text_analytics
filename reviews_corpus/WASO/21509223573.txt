my mother has used shiseido for over 20 years and never understood the hype she gave the brand until i tried this. i have dry skin and this just made my skin look healthy and it made it feel so moisturized. the texture of the sleeping mask is AMAZING literally. it feels so refreshing on the skin and for the scent, it has a scent but it’s a good type of scent… not too strong. the acne treatment has actually made some of my acne scars less visible. i would 100% recommend shiseido products. nan
