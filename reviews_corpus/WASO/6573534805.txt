I received this product on a complimentary basis through Influenster in order to test it. First of all, I  ove the frosted glass packaging and the eye dropper was a nice aesthetic choice. However, in practicality, I felt like the eye dropper made it more difficult to apply the serum than necessary & could get kind of messy. I enjoyed the light yuzu/citrus scent, but I am okay with scented skincare and those with more sensitive skin might not appreciate that. I have noticed some difference in the brightness of my skin since using and, overall, I plan to use the product until gone. Good, not great
