This is an oil serum— an oil & serum in one. This unique product has two layers, described as a “versatile bi-phase formula”. Make sure to use as instructed and SHAKE WELL before use to get its full intended benefits. It’s supposed to give a hydrating glow and sit well under makeup. Can’t offer 5 stars bc the ingredients aren’t of the highest quality IMO (compared to many other serums and oils I regularly use) and could be better. I started getting slight irritation/redness and dryness around my nose and it’s very likely it’s from this product since the issue subsided after discontinuing use. I still think this could be a great product for those without sensitivity issues. 3.5 stars
