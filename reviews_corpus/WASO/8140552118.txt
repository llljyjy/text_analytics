The WASO Koshirice Acne Calming Treatment is a good product. I use it on the trouble areas of my face which are my chin, where I tend to get blemishes, and my nose, where you can see tiny dark sebum spots in my pores. I like that the Koshihikari Rice is a premium rice sourced from a family-owned farm in Hyogo. Its extract helps target sebum oxidation- a major cause of breakouts. So itâ€™s especially perfect for the sebum on my nose. Nice Acne Treatment
