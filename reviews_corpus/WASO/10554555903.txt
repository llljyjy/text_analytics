I love to use this cleanser when I double cleanse. It doesn’t strip too much moisture out of my face vs others. The only thing is that I feel like I need a lot of product and it doesn’t not help to get off makeup. I had a waterproof mascara on and it did not want to come off at all. I still could see my makeup as well after using this. Which is why I started to double cleanse. So I wouldn’t rely on this to remove makeup. As a cleanser yes it is nice. nan
