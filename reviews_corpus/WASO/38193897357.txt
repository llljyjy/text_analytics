I wasn’t looking for a new cleanser, but I think I just found it. This is such a cool product. I’ve never seen a gel to oil product. It helps remove your makeup and moisturizes your face at the same time. I’ve always had dry skin after cleansing, but this made it soft and moisturized! Super impressed with this product. nan
