I have used many salicylic acid skin care items and they always dried out my skin. Like the others, this dried my skin a bit but was not irritating. You definitely do need to make sure you properly hydrate your face before using this. I use it right when I come out of the shower and it has not been an issue. My acne takes a few days to clear up but it has definitely been helping with the sebum build up in my pores. I would recommend this for anyone who has combination skin and prone to breakouts in the oily spots. Works!
