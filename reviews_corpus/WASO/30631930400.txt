I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. This is an acne calming treatment and I’ve read so many good reviews about it. For me personally, I’ve been clear from acne lately so it doesn’t make sense for me to try this on my skin without acne. When I did have a single zit recently, I was able to try it and I liked that it was light and not too sticky on my skin. If I do have a breakout, I intend to use this product! Looks like a good product!
