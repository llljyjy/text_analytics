I like it but I don’t love it. I had a pimple on my chin that I used this on and it seems like it got rid of the redness and a bit of the swelling. But I can’t really tell if it’s really from the product or if the pimple was just going on its own. I did like that it wasn’t super drying where it made my pimple crack. I think I will continue to use this product and see how it is. Give it a try!
