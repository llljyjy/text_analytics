This mask is great. It even helps with my redness on my cheeks. I like to use it, directions are simple. Apply then wait 5 minutes, and gently rub while removing. My nose has large pores and this mask definitely helps cleanse the pores and reduce their size. I love that it doesnâ€™t have too much physical exfoliants because we know those cause micro-tears in your skin which leads to aging. Definitely recommend. Lovely self-care mask
