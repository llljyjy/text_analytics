Spot treatments are a must in my skincare routine. I tend to get just a few scattered pimples every few weeks. Since Iâ€™m used to using a spot treatment, I was able to compare this to the one I usually use and it performed just as well! I found it to be slightly more hydrating too. Anytime I see a pimple getting ready to pop up, I apply this to the area and usually the pimple never gets larger and just goes away. If you have a larger red pimple, this will also help decrease redness and inflammation. Say bye to picking pimples!
