Of the Shikulime items I received, this mask was my personal favorite. I really enjoyed this mask for its purifying, exfoliating, and blackhead reduction aspects. While it’s a clay exfoliating mask, I didn’t find this product to be drying or overly abrasive. I’ve really enjoyed using this mask and would definitely purchase it for future use.
