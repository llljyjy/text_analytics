I wish they would be honest and at least let people decide for themselves…they describe this as fragrance free yet it is loaded with (natural) fragrance: orange oil, lavender oil, sage oil. These are just as damaging to skin as “parfum”. I see this all the time where they tout a product as fragrance free and then come to find out it’s actually loaded with fragrance. It’s dishonest. nan
