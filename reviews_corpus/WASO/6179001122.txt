I loveeeee the consistency of this acne treatment- it’s almost like a gel primer and it glides on really smoothly- that’s why a little goes a long way. With the amount I first squeezed out (the one pictured above) I was able to apply that 80% of my blemishes- and I’m dealing with postpartum hormones so I have a LOT.. It dried pretty quickly and isn’t oily or sticky or anything which is great. AND I love that it can even be used to treat blemishes OVER your makeup so I can reapply during the day. I can definitely see myself buying this over and over. I’m obsessed Helps my acne so much!
