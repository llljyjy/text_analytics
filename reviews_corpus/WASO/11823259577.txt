this cleansing gel leaves your skin very soft and clean, apart from being a cleanser it removes makeup which is very good.  It does not contain odor and is transparent.  I honestly had an acne breakout after using it but I can’t be sure it’s this product and not something hormonal and it coincided.  I will let my skin recover to continue giving it a chance nan
