I received these products for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review.The pour purifying scrub It’s a purifying mineral clay mask for us dry skin!! Finally a good clay mask that that exfoliates and clean pores but doesn’t make my skin dry or hurt!! I took a nice bubble bath and putted on for around five minutes and messaged a bit, and it managed to cleaned all (yes, I mean all!!!) the blackheads around my nose area! And it gives a overall beautiful smooth skin. Amazing
