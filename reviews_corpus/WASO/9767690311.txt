So this isn’t my first rodeo with pore purifying masks. I do have larger pores on my nose and thesurrounding area that I am self conscious about. Iused this because they were starting to lookclogged. My skin doesn’t feel dried out or stiff afterusing this like with other masks that claim to do thesame. I would recommend for sensitive skin as wellbecause it didn’t make me red or irritate my skin like most products do. Better than other masks I've used
