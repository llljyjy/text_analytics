This left my skin a bit wet since it is a mask but it was very refreshing. The gel is very soothing/cooling and reduces inflammation well. I felt my skin had been completely rejuvenated and washed out while using it. It also did not have a heavy texture. Worked as a serum and moisturizer all in one. I definitely recommend.
