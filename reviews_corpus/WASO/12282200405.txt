I really enjoy using this mask. It’s a clay mask, but it’s not drying. So you get the benefits of the clay, without completely stripping your skin of moisture. I’m not a big fan of the physical exfoliants I’m the mask, but as long as I’m careful while applying and removing it, then it’s fine. Lovely
