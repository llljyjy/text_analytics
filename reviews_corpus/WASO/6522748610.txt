I received this moisturizer from Shiseido and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I like that this moisturizer has spf, and I think the tint is a great concept. The issue is, I do not see this working well for those with both extremely light, tan and darker skin tones at all. If you were to use this as a sunscreen and use the tablespoon directed for your face for full SPF value, it ends up looking like a mask of color and it never really blends in entirely. They definitely should have offered this in multiple skin tone options as I still can see this leaving a cast on those that I mentioned. I liked the texture and the almost cream to powder dry down but the tint did not work for me. I canâ€™t see myself repurchasing or using this as a daily spf. Great concept, poor execution
