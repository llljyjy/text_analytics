Love love love the packaging and the texture inside. This is the most beautiful and interesting sleeping mask I’ve ever had. The outside packaging is very minimalistic, while the inside texture is super light and cool on skin. It has the yellow tiny spot like gold, I guess they’re the vitamin c, and they will melt down when you apply on your skin. My skin feel new, smooth and refresh in the next morning. Wonderful sleeping mask
