I really love trying new things because sometimes they become a permanent staple in your routine, I just had a baby a few months ago and it’s been hard to keep up with myself. But adding this into my routine has never been easier. I love that I can use it instead of a moisturizer or when I’m feeling it I can use it with.. make sure you shake well before use it separates. The only thing I wish I knew before I used this is that it’s kind of oily but it’s not terrible I use it before bed and it’s great! I would definitely buy this yuzu serum again and again. My skin feel so soft and hydrated when I wake up. Happy I got to try this because I would have never thought I needed to. Must try
