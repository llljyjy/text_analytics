I received this product complimentary by Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This gel to oil cleanser is gentle enough for sensitive skin but also takes makeup off easily. It melts as soon as you start working it into the skin. I wanted to note I love how packaging is environmentally friendly and use with recycled materials. Easy to squeeze tube for minimal mess. Makeup removal made easy
