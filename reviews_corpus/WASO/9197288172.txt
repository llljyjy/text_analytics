I love trying face masks! I think this is ok. I love clay masks for my oily/combo skin. Doesn’t dry down like some clay masks which I’m not sure how I feel about. I feel like it’s not enough scrub to be labeled a scrub- doesn’t feel very exfoliating. A little amount goes a long way though so will last awhile! nan
