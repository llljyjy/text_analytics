It works alright! As other reviewers have mentioned, it doesn’t necessarily dry your acne out. It helps a bit with redness and inflammation, but it doesn’t completely get rid of your acne. I personally prefer pimple patches, but Im giving it 4 stars because I wonder if I’d see better results if I used it more often throughout the day (says you can use it 2-3 a day, even over makeup). nan
