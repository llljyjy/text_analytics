Ilove how the little beads disappear whenrubbing the mask in, leave a cool feeling tothe skin. Doesn’t rub off when I’msleeping( I’m a side/stomach sleeper)when i wake up i can tell the difference inmy skin from the night before. It’s moreglowing and plumped. Definitelyrecommend if u had a long day w makeup. nan
