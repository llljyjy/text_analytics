The Waso shikulime gel to oil cleanser was good not but great as a makeup remover when it came to removing tough eye makeup. This does hav safflower and grape seed oil which does dissolve makeup and sebum while providing moisture. Shikuwasa, supports skin’s moisture barrier to promote a healthy look. The texture is really nice, there’s barely a scent. It doesn’t foam up once water is mixed with it. But it does remove  face makeup. nan
