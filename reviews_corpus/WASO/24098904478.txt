I really enjoy this mask. I don’t do masks a lot but this one is super easy and relaxing. The scent is light and clean. It’s not rough or too texturing, just enough “scrub“ in it to thoroughly cleanse the skin. My pores were definitely cleaned out after this mask. It also replenished the glow to my skin and left my skin feeling baby smooth. I followed with the moisturizer from this line, which ended up pairing so well together. I am very pleased with this mask. nan
