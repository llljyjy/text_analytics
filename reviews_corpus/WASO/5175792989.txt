I enjoyed this vitamin C, I think it has been helping my skin. I do get hormonal acne near my menstrual period so I would have a good few weeks with my skin until then and restart the journey over. This vitamin C can be a little tacky but if you pat it in your face it works better than rubbing. No smell and did not irritate my skin at all. Good Vitamin C
