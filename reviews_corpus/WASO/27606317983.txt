My favorite and most exciting products are definitely from Shiseido. They sent me their 1) Gel-to-oil Cleanser 2) Pore Purifying Scrub Mask and 3) Mega Hydrating Moisturizer. It’s so nice to have a cleanser that doesn’t dry out my skin! The exfoliation of the scrub mask feels so good. The moisturizer feels so clean, not too oily. My mom gave me a Shiseido brush when I was little, so this brand is nostalgic for me. That might sound cheesy but I mean it! She was maybe more excited than me about this :) I love their products, and that applies to their new line! I will continue to keep these in my routine (which usually consists of just water and whatever else Influenster sends me… cue nervous laughter). Must-have
