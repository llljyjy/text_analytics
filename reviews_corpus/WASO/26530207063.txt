This is a duo vitamin c serum and face oil. Personally, I’m not a big fan of the oil and I would have gotten this just for the vitamin c serum. The smell is beautiful, fruity and sweet so I have nothing against that. The oil and serum does separate easily so you have to shake it every time you use the product. I do like the brightening power though, and when blended into the skin its not as oily as I expected but I still feel some oil. This hasn’t made my skin break out though, but I probably wouldn’t purchase this again. Love the Vitamin C Serum, not the oil
