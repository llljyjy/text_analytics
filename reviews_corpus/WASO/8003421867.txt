I’ve been loving this mask lately. I’ve used it as a daytime and nighttime moisturizer and recommend it for both. I have combination skin and it does a good job of moisturizing the oily areas without creating more oil. Pleasant smell and I love the texture, especially the little flakes dissolving. nan
