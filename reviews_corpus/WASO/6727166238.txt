#ShiseidoSkincare #complimentary @WASOBeauty @Influenster I have received these items for free from @shiseido & #influenster in exchange for my honest review.I was sent the Waso 🍋skincare collection to try out & they are Vitamin C Yuzu 💛 enriched facial glow serum & a Yuzu Vitamin C eye serum.I’ve been using these products for an entire week and so far I really like how they feel on my skin. 🍋 The facial serum is dual layered so it contains an oil and a base that need to be shaken up and mixed very well together before application.  You can most definitely feel the vitamin C in this it kinda feels like an acid serum but much gentler. I Can see it brightening over time and helping with ageing and wrinkles because of the Vitamin C. It feels slightly oily on the skin but overall is a very comfortable serum to wear. but overall I did enjoy these products & the quality and quantity you receive. Shiseido has always made good quality skincare and this was definitely in line with their quality. #skincare #skincarereview #vitamincserum #brightenskin #asianskincare Feels nice & brightens helps with wrinkles
