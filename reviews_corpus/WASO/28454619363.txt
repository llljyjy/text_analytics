I get acne pretty regularly and I try to use almost anything to combat it. So when I received this product, I was curious to try it out and hoped it would work. To my surprise, it works really well for me! Typically, acne treatments like this don’t really work and my acne bumps turn into bigger white heads. This products actually helps reduce the inflammation and keep most of my acne from turning into white heads! I know I’ll keep using this product! First acne treatment to really work for me!
