I can definitely feel my skin softer and cleaner after using this product, but not dry at all, this is definitely my favorite pore purifying for now on, I used to use a type of clay for my skin, but always felt very dry after using it. This product gently exfoliate and made my skin feels cleaner and with a nice glow. I like the fact about the package being made of sugarcane and some recycling products, and still looks charming and simple. Clean and glowing skin
