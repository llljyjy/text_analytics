This serum is a hybrid between oil and ampule, in my opinion. It visibly separates. The very top layer looks like an oil, so the serum requires gentle shaking to mix two layers together. Otherwise once the serum applied on the skin, it would be too oily or greasy. The scent is a mix of alcohol denat and citrus. There is indeed alcohol denat in the ingredients’ list. I don’t mind alcohol denat in this serum because it applied nicely with dewy finish on my combination skin without causing any irritation. Since the finish that it gives is on a more nourishing side, I believe this serum is best to use during fall & winter. Especially right now while the weather starts to get colder and drier, while there is AC running at home. My skin enjoys it as well in the morning as in the evening. Love hybrid oil & ampule in one
