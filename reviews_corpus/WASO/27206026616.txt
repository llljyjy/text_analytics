I received this product complimentary from Influenster in return for my honest review. I tested this out on my forehead because that was a problem area for me and I wanted it cleared up because my vacation was coming up. So I applied on my forehead every day for a few days before I left for my trip and this cleared my forehead up. I like that the product didnâ€™t agitate my pores. The only recommendation I have is that if you apply it to a part of your face prone to dryness apply a light moisturizer to that spot in the morning. Good for my oily skin
