Not sure how the full size packaging is like, but the sample size tube had a bit of a learning curve to it since the product is as thin as water. After experimenting how much to squeeze to get the amount I want, the product gave the glow that it promised. This also has the best scent from a Vitamin C serum of all the ones I’ve tried so far (either chemically, scent free, or funky). It doesn’t smell like artificial oranges, but has a soapy light clean fragrance. It applies like the most watery serum and under moisturizer and some CC cream I can tell there is a subtle hydrated glow. nan
