I think the first couple of days I used it I got a couple of pimples. Once my skin got used to it after those two days, it really has been glowing. No smell, it’s almost like putting water on your face, but you feel it, especially after a face wash/cleanse! I got compliments and everything. I use this with Good Molecules toner and discoloration serum. Don’t forget to put on SPF yall! I really love Sephora’s brand of skincare and makeup, and they’re slept on. I love it and can afford it
