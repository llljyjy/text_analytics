If I could give these no stars, I would. I usually purchase the bamboo exfoliating wipes. However they have been sold out for awhile now. The grapefruit one did have the same exfoliating tiny dots on the wipes, with the same texture as the bamboo one, it looks like they have now changed these ones also, along with the charcoal one. I’m not sure why Sephora would change a product that everyone loves for a inferior version of the product. Anyways, it looks like the bamboo one will be changed soon as well. I think a product update alert to your consumers would be nice. Even you’re looking for the previous version, do not buy these. Oh and the scent on the grapefruit one has also changed, more artificial smelling. Two thumbs down!!! THEY Changes the formula AND wipes
