I have a much more expensive dermaplaner that I paid $80 for and the refills cost $28 for 7 blades. I’m not going to use it anymore because this is better. Not only is it less expensive, it allows more precise control, each blade can be used a few times, and it removes hair in a single pass unlike my other tool which often requires a few passes over cheekbone hallows or jawline. Can’t say enough good things! I just hope they never stop selling the refills. I’m going to stock up just in case. Better than more expensive tools!
