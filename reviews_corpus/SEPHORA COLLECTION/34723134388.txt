It’s hard to see on a pic, so no pic, but I really love the effect of this product! Interestingly, for me it’s more about tightening and improvement of fine wrinkles appearance - I saw that after using it for only a few days! No changes to dark spots for me personally, and mine are not that visible to begin with. Maybe a slight evening of the skin tone, but I’d say it’s not that significant for now. nan
