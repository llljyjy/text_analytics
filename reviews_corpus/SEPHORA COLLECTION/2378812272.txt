This is such a good cleanser! Absolutely love it. I got aging (near 40 yo) mix (greasy and dry) sensitive skin. No perfume at all (the smell is the actual product smell without camouflage... so yeah, it’s not a fruity-floral smell as the industry makes us think it’s good, no surprise here!) and no perfume is perfect for my kind of skin. Have had no breakouts since I started using it... and it’s kind of a miracle really! Si happy to have found m’y cleanser at this price! Way to go Sephora! Thanks a lot! Holy Grail
