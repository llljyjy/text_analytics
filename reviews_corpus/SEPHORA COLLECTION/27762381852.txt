I received a sample size of this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. Normally anything with vitamin c breaks me out but this serum didnâ€™t. I noticed improved hydration with my skin after a couple weeks of use. Overall I liked this serum but the consistency is so thin that it just pours out of the tube. That is the only negative. Great serum for sensitive skin
