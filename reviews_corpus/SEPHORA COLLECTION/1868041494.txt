I like the ingredients and the scent is ok but the product itself is a bit sticky on its own. It does absorb quickly but would prefer it not be so sticky. I prefer it mixed into a moisturizer when I apply it rather than on its own. I received this product as a free sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. nan
