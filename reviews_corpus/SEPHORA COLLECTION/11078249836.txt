I did not expect much of the product because it’s not a product I usually use, however, when I put it under my eyes I could see my veins constrict a little and I think the hydration and firmness helped it subside a little bit. Very light on the skin and very firming. The only thing I don’t like is the smell! Has a very strong smell to it. But overall pretty happy with it. nan
