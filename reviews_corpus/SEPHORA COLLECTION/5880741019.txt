I was thoroughly surprised by this product! My skin is fairly sensitive to vitamin c but I like to use it every other day or so. I was looking for something to help even my skin tone and add brightness while I take a break from my Caudalie serum and this has been amazing! It hasnâ€™t broken me out once and I already see a huge difference after just a couple weeks of use! Highly recommend especially for the price! nan
