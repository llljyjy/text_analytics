I love the Sephora brightening eye cream. The cream has a nice consistency that allows it to be smoothly applied to the skin, and absorbed. Hydration lasts all day, and you can definitely tell a difference in the skin beneath your eyes after consistent use over one week. I highly recommend this item! Love this eye cream.
