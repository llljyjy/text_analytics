This tool gives you a glow you didn’t even know you had. Yes it’s a bit weird the first time, but it’s so satisfying to watch the peach fuzz fall away. I love that it also exfoliates away dead skin. Watch how-to videos and be very, very gentle. Oh and I don’t recommend using it on the brow bone. I got an ingrown hair that was hard to get rid of. Doesn’t seem to happen on the rest of the face. You need to start shaving your face.
