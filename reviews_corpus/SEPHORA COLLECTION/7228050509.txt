I am really impressed with this product. Itâ€™s vegan and cruelty free which is a major plus. I love that it is unscented and formulated with clean ingredients. The 13% AHA, BHA and PHA is awesome for helping with my blemishes and fine lines. I have seen a big difference since I started using it. My skin honestly looks better than it has in a long time. The product is super easy to use too. I have been using once a week and leave it on for about 10 mins and then rinse. The packaging is super cute too! The best part though is the price. Such a steal! Great Product!!
