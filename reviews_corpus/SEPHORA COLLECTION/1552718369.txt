I’ve only been using it for a short time. It’s so hydrating!  I apply it usually at bedtime but you can use it in the morning as well.  It soaks into the skin nicely.  I like that it is clean, vegan and  it hydrates my skin well. I do see positive results as the skin under my eyes look moist and refreshed. I’m curious to see if it will help to diminish my dark circles when using it longer.  I love when quality doesn’t have to be expensive. So far I’m loving this. Hydrating!
