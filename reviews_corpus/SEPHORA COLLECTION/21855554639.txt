I was in the market for a new moisturizer, but one with ingredients that made sense. Some companies either overdo it or don’t have the exact formula I want. This is a good moisturizer to layer on top of your essences or serum, because it is mostly made of oils and squalane. It smells earthy, like a plant. It’s not bothersome, but I do want to mention that there is fragrance in its ingredients closer toward the end of the list. It has a whipped butter consistency and easily absorbs. It is not greasy, and for a Sephora sold product, the price tag was under $20 USD for 1.69 ounces. Since there are no acids in it, it is ideal for use during either night or day. I am happy with this purchase! Keep in mind, this is a basic moisturizer with natural oils and squalane - so it is a friendly additive to your existing skincare routine. Some products aren’t meant to mix with others due to ultra potent ingredients or irritants. Glad this isn’t one of them. Loved it
