All the 5 stars are for the serum. I saw a huge difference in my overall complexion after a week of usage. I used twice a day initially and then brought it down to once a day now. I use the targeted pore serum in the evenings. I like to use a roller for application and top it with almond oil My skin is generally clear but had some blemishes and uneven tone. I normally do not use make up. The serum helped to even out those patches and brightened up my dull face well. I used the toner only once and didnâ€™t like it as I found it drying. I am going to try it after a couple of months. Awesome!
