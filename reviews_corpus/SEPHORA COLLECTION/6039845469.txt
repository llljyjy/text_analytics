For the price, you’re getting a lot of product, which is nice. Unfortunately, the cream didn’t do me any good, in fact, it was making my eye area even more dry. I would wake up the next day and notice my eyelids are super patchy, dry skin, which isn’t normal to me at all. Love the affordability but the product didn’t work for me. nan
