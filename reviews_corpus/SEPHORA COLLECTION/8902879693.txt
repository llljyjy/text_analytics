I was excited to try this product because I have been a big fan of the Ren Glow Tonic in the past and figured this was a good dupe. I also like that this is a clean beauty/vegan brand  It is hard to see results quickly with this type of product though. I didn’t really notice a difference in my skin, if anything I actually broke out. t didn’t work super well for my skin unfortunately. nan
