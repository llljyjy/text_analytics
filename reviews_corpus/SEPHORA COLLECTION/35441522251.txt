This product leaves my skin so smooth! It’s not sticky like other serums I’ve used before and I feel like it actually has helped my skin! Also the fact that it doesn’t have a huge overpowering smell is such an added bonus! I struggle with big pores around my cheeks and I love what this product has done for them. Love it!
