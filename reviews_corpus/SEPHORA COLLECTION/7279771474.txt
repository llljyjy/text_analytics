I have very dry, flaky skin that is also incredibly sensitive. Giving this product 4 stars because I think it would be awesome for most people, but given how sensitive my skin is, my face was red and unhappy all day after trying. Wishing it had of been better for me but I think itâ€™s a great alternative to expensive products for others! nan
