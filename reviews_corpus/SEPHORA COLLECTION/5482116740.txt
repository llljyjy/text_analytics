I had an awful sunburn this past week so I grabbed this because it had great reviews and it was only $5,… I have to say, I’m really glad I bought it! This Watermelon Mask was super refreshing! It has two parts to it, one for your face and one for your décolleté. Each sheet mask has 2 rough protective layers to it on both sides, so be sure to carefully remove those as you apply it… The texture of this mask is unlike other sheet masks I’ve used, it’s thin but it has somewhat of a jelly texture to it. The scent is subtly watermelon, not overly sweet or artificial. I left this mask on for roughly 20 minutes and then removed the sheets, massaging the excess serum into my skin. I noticed my sunburn stopped peeling after using this mask and my skin felt less angry and itchy! This was a pleasant experience and I am so happy this Sephora product brought me some relief… Would buy again! Read the instructions ;)
