So, I was lucky to receive a free sample/ travel sized serum in my fall vox box to try these skin care products and found my new go-to skin cleansers from belief and glow serum by sephora. But the thing that really impressed me the most has to be the glow serum! It has seriously helped my skin the last few weeks. Being a mom to younger kids (one on also on the spectrum), wife, and full time college student, I am seriously sleep deprived, stressed, and donâ€™t have as much time for self care like I used to, so my skin has really taken a hit and this stuff has helped be a major pick me up. It makes my skin have a more healthy glow and more soft to the touch to where its not so rough and bummpy fewling, while also evening out the appearance of a few scars from pimples and piercings that are more noticeable on my fair skin . I use it every a.m. before I do anything else beauty wise and also makes a great makeup primer, leaving your skin looking renewed dewy, hydrated and fresh. A staple in my a.m. routine
