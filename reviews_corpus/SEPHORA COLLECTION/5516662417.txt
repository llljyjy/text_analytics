First of all, I love the fact that this moisturizer is certified Clean At Sephora, which means it is formulated with mostly natural-origin ingredients. I’m a big fan of prebiotics in skin care so I’m always on a hunt for a good and affordable option and this moisturizer did not disappoint. It’s great at improving skin hydration while nourishing and soothing the skin at the same time. Great clean and affordable moisturizer!
