This razor is so nice. Worth the money. I compared it with the tweezerman which I also purchased from Sephora. The tweezerman is just like the razors at the beauty store for a dollar. This is SO much better than both of those. Very soft and smooth and not scratchy on the skin at all and the blades are very easy to replace. It comes with extra blades, too. It is very well made and intuitive, I just looked around and pressed on a little plastic piece and the blade slid right up. And easily goes back down and locks into place. I love the feel of the metal handle, too. All in all, five stars. Great Purchase
