extremely cute packaging! the scent is also great- smells like vacation and a tropical bevvy. The color is super subtle like next to nothing but that doesn’t bother me because it’s a great everyday balm you can toss in your bag whenever your lips are chapped. Not too thick or oily/ perfect amount of being smooth. nan
