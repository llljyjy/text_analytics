This is a really nice eye cream for the price. It is rich but not greasy and a little goes a long way, with a generous size to really test for results. While it has not made a major impact on my circles, I think it has improved the color (darkness). Iâ€™ve been using it for less than one month though, so I will continue using and hoping for results. Nice Eye Cream.
