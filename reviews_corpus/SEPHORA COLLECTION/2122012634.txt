I have been really enjoying the Sephora Hyaluronic Brightening Eye Cream! This product is vegan + clean at Sephora, which I love, since I am leaning more into clean beauty products/brands. This eye cream is lightweight in texture, absorbs easily into skin and has worked well under makeup. It doesn’t settle into fine lines or mess up the concealer. I have seen improvement in my dark circles and overall hydration under my eyes. I also like that the product is affordable, because quality doesn’t have to be expensive! Definitely a must purchase! Smooth & hydrating eye cream!
