This pore serum initially had me a little apprehensive as it was so inexpensive, I was a bit skeptical of how a store brand could even compare to the high end treatments and serums but rest assured this small treatment- had me impressed by the end of the week. It was nothing massive or dramatic but I did notice less fine lines and although it didnâ€™t drastically shrink it reduce my pores, it made my skin look more matte and lessened the appearance of any excessive pores or texture. Definitely adding this to my repertoire of skincare faves! New Must-Have!
