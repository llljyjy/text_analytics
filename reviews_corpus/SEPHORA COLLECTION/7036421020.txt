I am absolutely loving the Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator! This moisturizer is very gentle and lightweight, so I think it is perfect for those of us with sensitive skin. Unlike other gentle products, this one actually provides a great amount of moisture that lasts all day. I apply in the morning and my skin does not feel dry or greasy throughout the day, it is very balanced. The product also works really well under makeup. This product proves that quality does not have to be expensive. Great quality product at an affordable price!
