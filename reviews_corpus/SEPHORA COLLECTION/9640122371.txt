I’ve always been skeptical and wary of razors for shaving face, but after reading the reviews on here, I decided to try it - and boy was it good! I’m so happy I purchased this, and the price was very reasonable too. I like how easy it can be picked apart for cleaning in between shaving sessions. Replacement razors are included as well. first time face shaving - amazing!
