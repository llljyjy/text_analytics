Pick up for myself while my daughter was shopping.  My lips felt parched and I had switched bags so my usual lip balm was home. I thought it was a Sephora product must be good and worth the price tag. Boy was I wrong.  First it had a tint which I didn’t realize. Made me look like I was wearing a cheap play makeup I maybe worn when I was 7. I hoped it would quench WRONG. Did the opposite went on like a crayon. Dry. Dragged across my lips. A hint of Watermelon, mostly a scent - again not the fruity quench I had hoped.  SO DISAPPOINTED. I wanted to March right back to the store and return it but unfortunately we had a time crunch. In an effort to give it a second chance I had it in my car and used it running errands say twice - still hated it! AND it CHAPPED MY LIPS. Going in the trash.  Don’t waste your money.  Shame on you Sephora.  Shame on you. Sticking with my Burt’s Bees Pomegranate. Waste of money Chapped my lips!
