A great makeup removing balm for step 1 in a double cleanse. I have dry, very sensitive skin and this is my go-to balm because it doesn’t contain fragrance. I’ve tried other cleansing oils and balms, and usually end up with irritation with regular use because of all the fragrance in them. The texture on this one is pretty thick, so takes a few more seconds to work it into your skin than the Farmacy version. But I’m so happy that it doesn’t strip my skin or irritate my eyes. HIGHLY recommend for people with sensitive skin that struggle to find products that don’t cause redness and reactions. Great for sensitive skin!
