I already own the full size bottle, but received this in a sample size from Influenster. It’s a nice lightweight serum, no sticky or oily feeling. I used it more for the “glow” hydrated look vs brightening as I didn’t see much result in that aspect. Great as a step before makeup application for dry/combo skin. nan
