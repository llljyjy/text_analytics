This product seems thicker, heavier and waxier than other balms I’ve tried. I did try it for a week but my eyes were often left stinging and there was a residue that wouldn’t come off, even after rinsing. Maybe it would be better for dry skin but did not work for my oily skin. It did seem to do a decent job of removing make up but I returned it and went back to favs- Clinique and ELF. Not great for me
