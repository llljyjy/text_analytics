Isn’t a peel off mask as advertised. The mask doesn’t even dry completely, which is pretty disappointing considering it’s literally advertised as a peeling mask. The pictures also make the packaging look bigger than it is. However it left my skin glowing and fresh. Really recommend if you have dryer skin. nan
