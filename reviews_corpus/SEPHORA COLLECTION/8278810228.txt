These are a great alternative to disposable tissue, my only question is how long will they last. I’ve had these for 7 months, use one or two a week and wash them with mild makeup brush soap. Each wash they get fuzzier and fuzzier, like the cotton is breaking down. BUT….for being 7months old and just now showing signs of breakdown, I’ll say these are a great option.
