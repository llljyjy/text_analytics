I’ve been using this as my moisturizer before my makeup as skin prep and omg it leaves my skin so healthy and glowy! It’s so smooth and hydrating! I love how my makeup applies after! Even wearing it alone leaves my skin looking youthful and healthy! I love how affordable it is, vegan & cruelty free! nan
