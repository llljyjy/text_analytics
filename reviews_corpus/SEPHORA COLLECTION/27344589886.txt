This is the perfect first step in my double cleansing routine. It removes my makeup nicely without leaving behind any greasy residue! I have fairly sensitive eyes so I love that this is unscented and fragrance-fre! So far Iâ€™ve had no eye irritation at all with this balm (even when removing waterproof makeup)! And the color & texture of this balm it so beautiful, it adds a little fun to my skincare routine! Works great
