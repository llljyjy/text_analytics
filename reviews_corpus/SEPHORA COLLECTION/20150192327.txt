It is a nice moisturizer but it didn’t improve my dark circles or iron out my wrinkles. I am in my 40’s and recently started to notice the age in my face. Ugh! But I am trying out some of the items at this store and have found better. If someone gifted it to me I wouldn’t refuse it but I wouldn’t buy it again. nan
