Ehh, reviews are kinda deceiving. Used for over two months and saw no changes, didn’t even make my under eyes hydrated. Also, everytime I did my makeup my eyes would start watering like crazy. Then I realized my eyes kept watering like crazy through out the day. It was THIS eye cream. I changed my eye cream to the inkey list bright-i and the watering went away. So weird. Don’t recommend. Cheaper options are better and do more. below average
