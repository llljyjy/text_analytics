The Sephora Collection proves that quality skincare does not have to be expensive! I am loving this clean skin gel. The texture is smooth and easy to apply. I like that my skin feels clean and fresh after I use this product.  I have sensitive skin and this hasnâ€™t bothered or irritated my skin. I love that it is 98% ingredients from natural origin. Overall, I would purchase this product. Wow Sephora has Done It Again!
