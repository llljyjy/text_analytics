I have largely been using this on my face, although I have tried a whole-body massage a few times. It really does feel nice. The short side with the ’v’ is great for moving over cheekbones or jawline, and the smooth flat areas work well for applying a little pressure. I should really use this more often! Easy to hold, feels great
