I got the coconut water scented minis. The scent is wonderful, not too strong and not the “fake“ coconut smell. They are definitely cleansing, not exfoliating. I would use this to remove makeup. Feels great on my skin, very refreshing. Note that the mini size is VERY small, the shape of a deck of cards but not as thick. However, at the time I purchased, the minis were a (very slightly) better price per wipe ($0.30 per wipe vs $0.32 for the large size). I would consider buying these again, they were great to add to my cart in order to get free shipping. Refreshing mini coconut water cleansing wipes
