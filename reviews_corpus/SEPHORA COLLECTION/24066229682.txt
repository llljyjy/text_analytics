This is my first skincare product with kombucha. I didn’t think that was topical and good for dark spots, but turns out it is! I’ve been enjoying the texture and look of this product on my skin. I just wish it had a added fragrance (natural of course, since Sephora is clean and vegan!). But so far so good. Kombucha Skincare
