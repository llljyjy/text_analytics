I’ve been applying it for two days only... and... I LOVE IT.I have VERY sensitive eyelid, bumpy, burning, dark in color.I tried a LOT of product, Exzederm, Toleriane La Roche Posay, Bioderma Atoderm for eyelid, hydrocortisone prescriptions ETC.but it wasn’t helpful, they BURNED a lot.I always had teary eyes when applying any of those I mentionned before. I LOVE the Sephora one, really cooling, hydrating effect when I apply it. It doesn’t burn my eyelid nor my eyes! My eyelid skin already seems more healthy. nan
