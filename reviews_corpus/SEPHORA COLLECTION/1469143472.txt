I was actually really surprised with this product. The sample is a good amount and tried it for at least two weeks everyday. It is a watery consistency. I would drip it onto my skin directly and spread it evenly with my fingers in the morning. I would consider buying this product after using this sample I got from influenster. 4 stars is a great rating for me since Iâ€™m picky and think that most products are the same. It takes a lot for me to give 5 stars for anything. Surprised!
