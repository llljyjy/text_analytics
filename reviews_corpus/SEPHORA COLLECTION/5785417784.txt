This is a pretty generic facial cleansing brush. I was sent this for an honest review.This brush was gentle and was easy to hold as the handle is long and skinny. I did not use this to remove makeup because I double cleanse with an oil cleanser first, but it lathered up my second cleanser nicely.Overall, if you are looking for this type of brush to add into your routine, itâ€™s a good option! However, I prefer silicone brushes for hygienic purposes, so I personally will not continue using this. nan
