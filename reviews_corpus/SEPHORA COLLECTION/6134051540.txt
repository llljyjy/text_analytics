I am a black women with brown skin. For 3 days now, I have been using this eye cream. My routine is applying in the morning and at bedtime. I have terrible dark circles which are aging me. I have notice a huge difference already within 3 days. I also use The Ordinary Caffeine drops under my eye before applying this cream. I believe together these products work great. For  2 years I was using The Ordinary Caffeine drops by itself and it did not work. Only 3 days of use and the results are shocking
