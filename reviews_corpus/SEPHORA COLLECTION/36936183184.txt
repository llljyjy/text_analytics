This is my go to exfoliant. After using this product for a couple of months, my skin looks more clear and even. This product helped reduce those little pimple/bumps on my forehead. It can leave the skin feeling dry, so I recommend using a good moisturizer and a HA serum once the product is absorbed by the skin. A must have in my skincare routine
