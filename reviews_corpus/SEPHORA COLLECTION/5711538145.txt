Quality doesn’t have to be expensive. This Sephora cleanser is very affordable and does its job really well! Also, it is a part of “Vegan and Clean” line at Sephora, which makes me more confident in using it! Overall a very good product especially for its price. It is suitable for any skin type and I’m satisfied how it works for daily cleansing. It’s lid is sealed to make sure no one ever opened or used the product which adds some security to it! nan
