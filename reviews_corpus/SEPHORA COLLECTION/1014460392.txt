this, like all the other eye masks I got from Sephora, are great. Good value, does what it’s supposed to do, in less time - 5 minutes instead of the 10-15 with other eye masks. Costs a little less than some brands (and loads less than other brands), so it’s worth having a stash. This, like the coffee and pomegranate masks, will be on constant replenish! works great for the price and in less time
