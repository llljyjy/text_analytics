I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.- good for lazy days when you dread splashing water on your face, the brush eases you into it- odd, but I find I need to use more product to get it to lather compared to lathering with my hands- 2 bristles came off the first week of using- although this brush is soft on the face, it should not be used in the eye contours. I tried that and it feels rough on the eye lids since the area is delicate so won’t be able to remove eye makeup with this- I like this cleansing brush more for washing off face masks because masks are typically thicker in consistency so you can get a nice little massaging action going- I wouldn’t consider this a must-have but it’s a nice budget friendly alternative to some of the electronic face brushes out there. I get the most use out of it by using the brush to work up a lather with my cleanser, then jump in the shower to wash it off as I shampoo etc., to conserve time and water. Enjoying this for mask wash-off
