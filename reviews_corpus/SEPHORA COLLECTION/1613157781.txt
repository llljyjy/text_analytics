I am very happy to report that, after having used this morning and night for the last three (3) days, I have absolutely noticed a difference in how oily my skin gets throughout the day - both with and without makeup! According to the claims, it may take a few weeks of use to see a reduction in the appearance of my pores, but that would just be icing on the cake since I was most intrigued by the mattifying properties! I look forward to pairing this with more and more foundations to see if it can keep my more hydrating foundations glowy and not greasy in my t-zone. Such a great product, regardless of price!
