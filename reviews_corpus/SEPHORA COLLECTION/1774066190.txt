I love this case and still use it but I have a few complaints. I threw it into my black purse and it was stained black along the edges. It is also somewhat fragile when opening the little compartments. I thought I broke it the first time using it. I now keep it on my nightstand instead of traveling with it because I’m afraid it will break apart while I’m away from the house. You can definitely get sturdier pill cases on Amazon for cheaper as well. It’s a cute pink color initially but now mine is half stained black from putting it in a purse that was years old. nan
