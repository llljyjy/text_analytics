I wanted to try this product to target my fine lines in my foreheads and around my eyes. I have been using this product for a few days and haven’t noticed a huge difference. It does leave my skin looking hydrated and glowy, but the anti-aging effects haven’t been noticeable. I really like the way it smells though! Plus, the ingredients are clean and vegan! I’ll keep using this to hopefully see effects long term! nan
