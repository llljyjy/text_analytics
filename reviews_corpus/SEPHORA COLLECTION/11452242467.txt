Consider the size and what you’re going to be using it for. It was too big for my face and neck. The shape didn’t work well either. It appears to be glass, not obsidian. I was disappointed, so I bought a jade one somewhere else and it works great. This one would probably work well for arms, legs and less curvy areas of your body. Not user friendly for me
