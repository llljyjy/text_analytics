First time trying something from the Sephora Collection and didn’t know if all the incentivized reviews were trustworthy. I’ve actually found it to be a great product! Substantial protection without any residue or greasiness. Completely scent free = easy to wear all day. No breakouts. I’ve even noticed some brightening effect. Ditching a star for the packaging; this seems like it’ll last for a while so it’d be great if offered in a tube or a jar with pump. great cream!
