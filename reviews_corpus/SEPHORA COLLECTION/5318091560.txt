I still can’t believe how good this cream turned out to be, especially for this price. I have dry, aging skin and I’m also using tretinoin, so I have some extreme dryness to combat. I typically have to layer serums, a night cream, and a night time mask, just for my skin to feel halfway hydrated by morning. I ran across this cream when searching for night creams, because I desperately wanted to pare down my routine (but didn’t have much hope). Full disclosure, when I read in the reviews that some folks found it greasy, it made me want to give it a try! I NEED greasy! LOL! Anyway, it arrived and I tried it with zero expectations. Applied it over my essence, serums, and tretinoin; no mask or additional creams so I could see how it really performed. The next morning I was shook. My skin was dewy, moisturized, and didn’t feel dehydrated for once. Thinking it must be a fluke, I tried it that same way night after night, and had the same result. This works better for me than ALL of the +$100-200 nighttime creams I’ve tried and I haven’t had to use any of my overnight masks since I discovered this product. If you have dry skin, I highly recommend giving it a go. Oily folks may find it to be too heavy but combo skin may find it beneficial in their dry areas. This is definitely a night cream, as it is somewhat occlusive once it absorbs and dries down, but that is what I look for in a sleeping cream. I’ll buy this as long as Sephora keeps making it…PLEASE don’t discontinue this cream!! Totally Shook!
