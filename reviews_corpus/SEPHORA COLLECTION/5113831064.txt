Really love how this moisturizer sits on my skin , doesn’t feel heavy and clogging. I hate when a moisturizer makes my skin feel like it can’t breathe and this is lovely! Very lightweight and cream consistency. Been paying more attention to buying cleaner products and this is clean and vegan and very affordable! Definitely check it out! I love Clean and affordable skincare!
