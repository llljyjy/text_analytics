I’m always looking for ways to minimize and clear out my pores. If I don’t stay up on exfoliants my pores literally look like strawberry pits lOl, it’s awful. Thankfully this helps me out in that department. I’ve definitely noticed clearer and clean pores. The texture on my chin feels a lot smoother too. This is also a great primer before my makeup especially for a matte finish. Skin doesn’t look oily barefaced either! You get a lot of skin benefits for a fair and affordable price IMO. Bye Clogged Pores!!Peace!
