WOW!! This eye cream is exactly what I’ve been looking for for way too long at this point. I have very noticeable bags under my eyes, especially after a long night of studying for midterms and finals (which happens more often than not), and I’ve tried so many different products to get rid of the puffiness (to no avail). This eye cream, however, is a different story. I didn’t have high expectations of it since it’s so affordable, but it ended up being the one product that gave me visible improvements on my eye bags (see the picture for reference). For context, my skin is sensitive and oily for the most part and sensitive-combination-oily during the drier winter months, but this cream was so lightweight that it didn’t feel greasy or heavy at all. It’s so moisturizing, and the best part, it’s clean AND unscented. I don’t usually write reviews, but I just had to for this one!! If you’re like me and you’ve been trying to find a product that works for wayyyyy too long, BUY THIS EYE CREAM!! this stuff actually WORKS!
