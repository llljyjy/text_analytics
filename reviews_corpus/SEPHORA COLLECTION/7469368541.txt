This is the perfect neutral face wash. I love that it is unscented and made with clean vegan ingredients. My face feels clean and healthy after washing it with this. It has an amazing price point and is still very effective which is awesome. I have very oily skin and this face wash is perfect for cleansing my just enough without stripping me of my oils completely. Great basic cleanser!
