Would give ZERO stars if possible - absolutely no difference before and after use. Contacted Sephora: because I tried it (single use), I would not get a refund. I understand that there is nothing to return with a single-use, but what a disappointment in supporting the integrity and quality in your brand, especially when this is the first product of Sephora that Iâ€™ve ever tried. Waste of $4+tax Zero stars - save your money
