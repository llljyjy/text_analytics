As a licensed esthetician, I cannot recommend the use of a cleansing brush as a regular part of a skincare routine. They don’t effectively clean the facial epidermis and wind up spreading dirt around and retaining it in the bristles. This one doesn’t even have a replaceable brush head! You can regularly clean the brush all you want, but the bristles will eventually wear out and you still won’t get all of the bacteria out. I appreciate the effort but not a fan. nan
