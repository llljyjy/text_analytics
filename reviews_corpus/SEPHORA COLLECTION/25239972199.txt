I have been using this product nightly for 2 weeks.  My skin type is dry and sensitive.This is a fragrance-free face cream with a thick, almost whipped consistency. It applies very smoothly to the skin and seems to be absorbed nearly completely without much residue,  I didn’t experience any irritation, including in the eye area where I tend to develop bumps when experiencing adverse reactions. I’m impressed with the quality of this cream compared to its affordable price. There are good drugstore face creams out there, but finding a rich cream suitable for dry skin that is also fragrance free is very difficult! This is a certified “Clean at Sephora“ product, and that does include the requirement that fragrance be below 1% of the total formula.Overall, I’m impressed with this cream! My usual favorite cream for this time of year is $38, so I plan to repurchase this one in the future. Impressive for the price
