I didn’t see any improvement to the skin. In fact I bought a second cream to use because this one felt like nothing. I use this one to hydrate my lips and lips contour before bed now, just so I don’t feel like it was a complete waste of money. Still doesn’t feel like it’s doing anything. I do not recommend it.
