This is a clear serum with Vitamin C and E, that you should apply after you’ve washed your face. It helps with clarity and brightness, especially when paired with a moisturizer (and don’t forget SPF!) It absorbs very quickly, and has a slight acidic scent to it, but not unpleasant. I got this as a sample from Influenster! Add to your routine for clarifying glow!
