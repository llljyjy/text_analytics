Sephora Collection gifted me to this product, but the opinions are completely my own based on my experience. I have extremely sensitive skin so I only applied the cleanser through out my t zone and forehead and it helped wonnnnnnnders!! Although it leaves a drying feeling after so using moisturizer right after is important with the product. nan
