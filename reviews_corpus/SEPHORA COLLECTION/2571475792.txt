Please be VERY careful when switching out the blades on this Sephora Collection Metal Facial Razor. A week ago I was trying to get the old razor out which was extremely hard to do, it was stuck; I kept trying to get the blade out and cut my thumb REALLY bad, I had to get 6 stitches!!!. Please everyone, use extreme caution when doing this. I am scarred for life, canâ€™t even get myself to even look at this razor after that incident. DANGEROUS !!!
