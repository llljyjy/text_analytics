I received this brush for free from Sephora in exchange for an honest review. It works... fine? I’m not sure I really understand the purpose of this. I double cleanse with an oil cleanser and then a water-based cleanser and tried this with both since it calls itself a “makeup remover and cleansing brush.“ It did not work well with the oil at all. Just messy. It works better with the gel and cream water-based cleansers. The bristles are extremely soft and it doesn’t seem to be too hard to clean. But I do think storage is an issue with this. Where do you keep it? Just laying on the counter? Do I have to add a new cup to my counterspace just for this to dry out? I frankly have more questions than use for this particular product. I was an avid user of mechanical brushes for years so I do understand the use of a good cleansing brush, but this one just baffles me. If you've always wanted a toothbrush for your face
