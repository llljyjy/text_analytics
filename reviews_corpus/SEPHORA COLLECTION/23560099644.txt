Super soft bristles that seem gentle enough to exfoliate without damaging the skin barrier. I tend to not use physical tools like this in my skincare routine, but it definitely feels like it could be safe to use when needed, especially if used to remove a lot of make up!  If youâ€™re someone who likes using tools like this, I would recommend you try this out. nan
