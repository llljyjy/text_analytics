I love this eye cream! I apply day and night and definitely think my skin looks a bit smoother and less dark spots:) It is worth especially for the price. Obviously take my advice with caution, if you want BIG change and results you need to go bigger with stronger more expensive products. If youâ€™re in you mid twenties and want a good product to maintain your bellow eyes skin tight and fresh for a reasonable price - this is the product for you:) nan
