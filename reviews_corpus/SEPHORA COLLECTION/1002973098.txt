Being almost 40, I am always looking for new anti-aging products to try.  I love the price of this serum because one thing I have leaned over the years is quality doesn’t have to be expensive.  I also love that this serum is vegan and has clean ingredients. This serum goes on really nicely, sinks into the skin very well and feels like I’m really pampering myself. Beautiful and affordable serum
