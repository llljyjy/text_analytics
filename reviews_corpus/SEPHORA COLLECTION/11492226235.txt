This cleanser is honestly your average cleansing balm in terms of removing makeup, I noticed it doesn’t do amazingly in taking off waterproof makeup.I will say after using it, my skin feels decently hydrated and not at all stripped of moisture, so that’s a plus.The texture is a different story, however. It smells buttery to begin but once massaged into the skin, it feels waxy and a little oily. I would recommend this to people with skin on the drier side, but honestly better cleansers exist out there. Mediocre cleanser, odd texture.
