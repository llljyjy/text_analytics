I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review. I struggle with acne and this has worked wonders on me so far! It does not dry out my face like other exfoliants have in the past. I cleanse my face with this twice a week and it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and so smooth. It is truly a hidden gem at an awesome price. Smoothness galore!
