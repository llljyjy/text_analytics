This lip balm is so cute, from the packaging to the compact size! It has a watermelon candy scent but isn’t overpowering. This glides right over the lips and makes them feel so smooth. There is also a very subtle pink tint. It’s also really affordable at only $7. It’s not the most hydrating for me, but I use it during the day when I want a bit of color nan
