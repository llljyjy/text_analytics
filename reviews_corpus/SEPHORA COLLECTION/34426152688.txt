Under hyped item. I genuinely love this cleansing balm to double cleanse! Not to mention, it really gets all my makeup off! Especially my waterproof makeup (very impressive)! Make sure you warm the product up in your hands so that the heat form your hands melts it down before washing your face. My face feels so fresh and clean just after using it! Itâ€™s definitely not abrasive on the skin (for me at least). Seeing a few reviews complaining about the item, I highly suggest you go to your local Sephora and ask for a sample before buying it!
