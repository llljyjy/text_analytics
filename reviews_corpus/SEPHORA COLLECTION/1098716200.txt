I saw instant results from using this mask, just after the first time. Which I must say, when it comes to most skincare products in general is very hard to come by. This mask gave my skin a healthy radiance to it, made my skin look brighter, and helped with reducing the appearance of my enlarged pores in certain areas of my face as well. It also made my skin look smooth and plump too. However, best of all, it does not irritate my skin like crazy like most chemical peels do. It does go on with a bit of a cooing sensation (nothing major) and it rinses off very nicely without any leftover residue at all. I currently do own 2 bottles of this stuff and most definitely plan to keep buying it for sure! As, this product is definitely one that no matter if you are a teenager or a grown adult, you should definitely pick up and add to your skincare regimen today! Just Get it-Your Skin Will Love It!
