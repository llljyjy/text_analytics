I’m thrilled with this lip balm! I have the watermelon and the scent is very mild, which I like. It applies smoothly and feels soft and moisturizing. It also gives just a hint of color. I feel it’s a great product and good price for for a clean ingredient product in sustainable packaging. Great lip balm
