I’m not a fan of the new formula either. I was using the previous version 3.0 nourishing oils moisturizer and loved it. I was excited to try this because it is fragrance free, but sadly this falls flat for me. It feels greasy on my face and does not feel like it moisturizes very well (its the only change in my routine) as I’m noticing dry red patches coming up around my mouth and chin. I wish the old formula was still available. Not a fan of new formula
