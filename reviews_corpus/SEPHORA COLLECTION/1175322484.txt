This was recommended to me by a Sephora employee several years ago and I’ve used it ever since! I absolutely love this moisturizer. I occasionally try out others when I get a gift or sample, but none are as wonderful as this one. And it’s incredibly affordable. I can’t recommend this enough. It goes perfectly under my spf and primer and doesn’t leave my skin feeling oily or dry. Highly Recommend!
