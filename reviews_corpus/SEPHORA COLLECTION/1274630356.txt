I think the Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid it really nice. It feels lightweight and has the consistency of a lotion. Spreads easily and absorbs quickly. It feels quite hydrating and moisturizing and the moisture and hydration lasts. Plus, itâ€™s super affordable, vegan, and clean at Sephora. Affordable and effective
