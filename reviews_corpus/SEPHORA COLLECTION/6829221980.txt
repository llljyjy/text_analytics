Zero stars, crap. Did a terrible job removing waterproof mascara. The mascara barely budged, just caused some raccoon eyes. My under eyes ended up red from the rubbing as nothing was coming off. Ended up having to run to Shoppers Drug Mart to get some micellar water. I bought these specifically for a trip as it’s hard to find travel size micellar water, and the Sephora counter woman recommended this. Don’t waste your money.
