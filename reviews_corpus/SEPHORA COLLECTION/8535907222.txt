This isn’t typically an item I would use on my skin. If you use a cleanser with a thinner viscosity, it would slip through the bristles. A more creamy cleanser would be better suited. I prefer chemical exfoliation to manual so I’m not the ideal candidate for an item like this, I was gifted this item from Sephora. nan
