I’ve been using this cleanser for about 2 weeks so far. I had been using Cetaphil for a long time previously but I decided I wanted my cleanser to work a little harder for me which is exactly what this one has done. My skin is much smoother, and my breakouts have already lessened big time. A little goes a long way, you really don’t need very much at a time which is great since there’s only the one size of tube. The bottle does warn that the active ingredients can cause sun sensitivity so be sure to use some SPF if you’re heading outside. I personally have been outside in the sun everyday since using this, with SPF, and haven’t had any issues with sensitivity or sunburns. If you’re looking for a cleanser that will put in some work without emptying your wallet, this is a great one to try. I’m glad I decided to try this one first before jumping into a super expensive cleanser assuming more money means more better, which this cleanser proves definitely isn’t true.
