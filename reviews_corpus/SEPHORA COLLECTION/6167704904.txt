I love Sephora products because they work so well and are super affordable. I wanted to try this cleanser because I have been experiencing some major postpartum breakouts. I have sensitive skin and react to certain scents so the fact that this is unscented was a major bonus! My face felt soooo clean after using this product! It actually felt like I had double cleansed. I’m not crazy about the cap as it’s a little hard to open at times but the formula is amazing! I’m very impressed. Feels like a double cleanse
