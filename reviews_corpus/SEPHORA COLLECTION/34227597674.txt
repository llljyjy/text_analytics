I was gifted this cleanser from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review of it! This is a nice cleanser that gets the job done! I always prefer gentle cleansers as my face can get sensitive. It is a good product to use with the vegan makeup remover and cleaning brush too! I also really like that this is has clean ingredients. Nice Cleanser !
