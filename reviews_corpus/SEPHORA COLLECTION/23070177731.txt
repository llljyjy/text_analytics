I love a good dupe (because quality doesn’t have to be expensive!) so I was so excited to give this a try. I have HUGE congested pores, which drive me crazy (especially at the middle of the day when my makeup has settled into them!).  I’ve tried a lot of crazy expensive name brand products  (sold at Sephora!) withi ttle to no results,  but it looks like Sephora has definitely been taking notes, because this is a holy grail products...I can’t believe the improvement in my pores. This one has earned a place in my daily skincare regime. Definitely a keeper!
