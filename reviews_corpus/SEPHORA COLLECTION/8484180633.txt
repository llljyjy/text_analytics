Okay, let me break this down because a few thoughts:- Do not expect for this to give you a ‘super clean’ feeling. It’s not suppose to. You might feel like you’re rubbing gel on your face. I use to use aloe Vera in my routine long ago and it feels like that.- This feel especially made for those days your skin is sensitive and the dry skin type people.- This does not have a scent. It is a simple, very gentle cleanser without all the bells and whistles. Gently gets the job done
