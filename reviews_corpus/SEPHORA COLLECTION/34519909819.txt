I really love how nourishing it is on my skin. It has a really nice feel to it too and it lasts quite a while surprisingly. If you don’t have a moisturizer or you need a cheap substitute, this would be the one. It makes me feel really good. I just don’t like how small it is for the price I paid. I honestly really love it
