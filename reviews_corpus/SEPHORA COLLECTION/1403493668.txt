It’s the best gua sha I’ve ever had. Great size, easy to use, but as other reviewers pointed out, it’s also SUPER fragile. If you drop it even once, it’s game over. I’m on my second because my first shattered, but hoping I won’t have to replace it again because I really do love it otherwise. Amazing, but steer clear if you're clumsy!
