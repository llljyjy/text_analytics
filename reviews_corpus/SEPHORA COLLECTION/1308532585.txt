I have previously purchased several of the the 3-in 1 Extractor Tools for myself and others.  It was black and angled at the small end.  It was great and worked very well.  This one is flat.  It’s awful and doesn’t work nearly as well.  I wish Sephora would bring the black kind back!!!  This one is more like the one I got at Ulta, which I promptly returned and came back to Sephora to get the black one. So Disappointed!
