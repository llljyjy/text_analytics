i have dry skin and most cleansers leave my face feeling really tight after…almost like it’s desperate for moisture BUT i will say that this one did the exact opposite which i appreciated soooo much like anyone with dry skin like me NEEDS this!!! i have other sephora collection products like the 24h foundation and eyeliners and they always perform for such a good price great price great product
