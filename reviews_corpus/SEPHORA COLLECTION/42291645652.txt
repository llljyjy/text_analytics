I think the product lives up to its price, the packaging wasnâ€™t the best but not bad for $3.50. The product wasted away faster than anticipated, whenever i would put it on the product would be pushed to the side and all of the grains would be harsh against my lips. I think that I would have liked the product much better in a tub instead of in a lip balm container. Overall, not the best, but not too bad. Peppermint Lip Balm And Scrub
