For the past few months, I’ve used this facial cleansing brush with a variety of products, including masks and foaming exfoliators, etc. It’s easy to use, totally non-abrasive, and I’ve found it gentle enough to use as an eye makeup removing tool, although I typically just use mascara and brow pencils. I kinda would like for it to have a larger head, but it’s a nice addition to my daily and weekly cleansing. It’s definitely super soft and durable and a nice alternative to more expensive brushes. nan
