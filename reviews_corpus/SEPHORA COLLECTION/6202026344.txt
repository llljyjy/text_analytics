I was so excited to try this inexpensive hydrating cream! I first noticed that it’s just a bit thicker than a gel. The cream is super moisturizing but doesn’t feel very thick. The only downside to this product is that it smells so terrible. Kind of like a mechanic shop… like an old tire. It’s barely tolerable, but if you’re super scent sensitive I wouldn’t recommend it. I know it’s a bonus that it doesn’t have the added fragrance but it’s not something that I want to smell every day… nan
