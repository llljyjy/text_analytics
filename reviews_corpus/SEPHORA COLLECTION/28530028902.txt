I swear by this stuff. I was using the Ole H pore sauna scrub before I decided to try this and I have to say, I used up my OH and am now exclusively using this as my physical scrub. I love the fine texture of it and the way it makes my skin feel. I scrub for a minute and then let it sit on my skin for 2 minutes like an express mask and I love the result every single time! The price and what you get canâ€™t be beat. Love these kind of finds! You have to try it!!
