If I could give zero, I would. I used to love the SC lip balms. But the “clean formula” introduced almond oil with no warning, causing an allergic reaction in my partner. I didn’t think to check a product I have been using for years. They also ‘went clean’ by getting rid of the compostable packing and moving to harder plastics!? This causes MORE environmental harm and packaging waste. If I had known this change was coming I would have stocked up on the old formula. I will be returning my product as soon as I can. Formula Change. Allergens not listed.
