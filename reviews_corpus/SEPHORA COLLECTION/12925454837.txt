I received this product #complimentary from Sephora and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I was honestly a bit skeptical about this product because I’ve tried expensive brands before and they always broke me out when it comes to vitamin c. This is the gentlest vitamin c serum I’ve ever used. I think I would be more likely to buy this one in the wintertime since vitamin c can make you more sensitive to the sun and because I could use the brightening effect more in the winter time. I like the texture of this serum too because it doesn’t peel like some serums. Pleasantly Surprised
