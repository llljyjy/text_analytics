I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review. This has been a great facial roller so far & it has become one of my go-to essentials in my daily routine! Not only is the color absolutely beautiful, it makes me excited for my skin-care routine! I toss my roller in the fridge & use it before bed. It rolls with such ease & it slows me to relax & unwind along with de-stress while getting rid of puffiness! I love the soothing & cooling affect! I highly recommend! Give your skin-care routine a new, little happy to look forward to! Add a new, little happy to your skin-care routine!
