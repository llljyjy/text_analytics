Getting my first chin and jaw fuzzies and it’s not fun ladies! I bought this one before I invested in an expensive one and I’m glad I did. It was very easy to use and my face felt smooth as a babies butt when I was done. I used it right after a hot steamy bath and applying my night cream, and then reapplied my night cream when I was done, I was done in 10 minutes.  I am not a graceful human being and I don’t think there’s anyway I could’ve really hurt myself, being careful. I gave four stars instead of five because the blades are a little dull and seem like they won’t last long. However, I also don’t feel like I will slice myself by accident with these.Hey Sephora, please make in a smaller size for eyebrows! Your eyebrow taming kit has one, but the blade is too dull to be useful. Happy I bought this!
