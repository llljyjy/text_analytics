This cleanser is gentle enough to use morning and night - as someone with oily acne prone skin, changing cleansers and facial products can be scary but the quality that sephora offers is unmatched. This gently exfoliates without drying my skin out or causing breakouts. The pores in my t-zone have also significantly reduced in size! Works well on acne prone skin
