The texture of this cleansing balm is on the thicker side. Upon application, I can feel the heaviness of the product as I massage it on my face. Despite being heavy, this cleansing balm emulsifies very well. As I add warm water on my skin, this emulsifies immediately removing my make-up, sunscreen and dirt on my face. This removes waterproof products really well too. I canâ€™t believe that this only costs $12! I will definitely purchase another tub! Great for waterproof makeup
