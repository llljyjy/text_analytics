I like this eye mask a lot. It’s quite hydrating and fun to apply. I love putting these masks in the fridge for an extra wake me up. This isn’t left on the face for very long so it isn’t going to brighten any dark circles or do anything for you in the long run. Overall, this is nice to use. It does leave a pink tint to your skin from the coloring on the mask but it goes away easily. And for the price, you can’t go wrong! hydrating and fun to use
