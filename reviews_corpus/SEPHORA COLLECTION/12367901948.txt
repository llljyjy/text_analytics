Honestly I’m a fan of these; unsure why Everyone is so fussy.  I use them after a dog walk or the gym, if I’m delayed getting to the shower.  The eye holes are off >> you will have to manage that/the fabric.  But it’s for 1 minute ... Mine were moist: I left the plastic wrapping inside the package in place, and also intend to throw these in the fridge. Good Buy at Low Cost
