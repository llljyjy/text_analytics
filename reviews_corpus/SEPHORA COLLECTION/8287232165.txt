This is certified clean at Sephora. It is also vegan. I know that good quality items don’t need to be expensive but this left the feeling of residue on my skin. Seems a little heavy/intense for my everyday routine. Keep in mind my skin is on the oilier side. Overall not too bad but not my favorite moisturizer I’ve used. Packaging was nice. I like the little pink lid. nan
