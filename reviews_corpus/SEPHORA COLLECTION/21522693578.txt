Okay I’ve tried this for a few days and I feel like I really like it. As with some unscented products, this almost has a light plastic-y scent, which I don’t love. But I know so many prefer unscented. A little goes a long way, it goes on smoothly and evenly and is easy to rinse. My pet  peeve with a lot of gel cleansers is how long they take to rinse. This one comes off well. I also like how hydrated and ✨clean✨ my skin feels after. Great product, great price. Nice and clean.
