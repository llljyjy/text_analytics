This product is proof that quality doesn’t have to be expensive! The product is vegan and clean and didn’t cause my skin to have any reactions when I started using it. This is truly amazing because I have very sensitive skin that often breaks out when I try new products. I’ve been using the product for a bit now and I like it! Hasn’t revolutionized my skin by any means but it’s good! Good product! Very gentle
