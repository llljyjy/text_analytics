Such an amazing lip balm!!! Have this placed on my counter in the kitchen for easy access and it’s definitely become a staple product! It glides on so smoothly, hydrates my lips for hours, isn’t heavy or waxy, and smells like candy! Also really appreciate that it adds a hint of color but not so much tint that you need a mirror to apply!! nan
