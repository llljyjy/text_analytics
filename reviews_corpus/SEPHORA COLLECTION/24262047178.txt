I have used makeup remover wipes for all of my life and I’m so mad that I didn’t try this melting cleansing balm BEFOREHAND! I will never use makeup removers again! First starting off, I love how I barely have to use any. Secondly, I love how it makes my face feels soft after using it. Super simple to use, very easy and effective. Not bad for only $12 especially with knowing it’s going to last me a long time! So mad I didn't know about this balm before!
