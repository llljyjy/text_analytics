I am so glad I found this product from the Sephora Collection line. This is a quality serum that helps even out my skin, especially my acne spots on chin. I’ve been using it for a few weeks and definitely noticed that they are lighter. I also love the price as I don’t think quality skincare should always be expensive. Lightened my acne scars!
