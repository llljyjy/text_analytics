Do not buy! Ugh I’m so disappointed. The reviews are so misleading. The balm stays on your face, even after cleansing twice! As I write this review I still have balm stuck in my eyes after rinsing them multiple times. Not worth it, save your money and buy something else. Do. Not. Buy!! doesn’t come off face
