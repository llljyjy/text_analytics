Speaking as someone who as always struggled with blemishes and combination skin, I LOVE this product! I use it once a week and I love the way it makes my skin feel and look! It does dry my skin out a bit, but thatâ€™s usually the case with peels for me and it is winter. I always just apply a moisturizer afterward. THIS PEEL.
