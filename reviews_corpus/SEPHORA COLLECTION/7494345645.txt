I tend to wake up with puffy eyes in the morning as most of us do and this eye cream has become the perfect fix! The caffeine & hyaluronic make it perfect for day time use. I find it hydrating which is great for the winter since I get really dry skin around my eyes. Love that it has clean ingredients I can trust and recognize. Itâ€™s a simple formula that get the job done, the best kind if you ask me. So much more affordable than most eye creams on the market. Definitely will be repurchasing!
