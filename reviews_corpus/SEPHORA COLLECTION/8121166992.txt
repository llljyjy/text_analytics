As soon as I applied the product onto my face I instantly felt the thick layer of moisture it came with. I used it in the morning and applied my sunscreen after and it wore good up until mid day when I touched my jawline and Product was peeling. Maybe because of the sunscreen so will try without. Other than that my face was still very hydrated through my day. I also used it with no makeup. SUPER hydrated
