I have been using this serum that I received for free, to test it and give my opinion on it, I have only been using it for a short time and all I have to say is that I like the way it feels on the skin, it does not leave it sticky, not greasy, it absorbs quickly and does not dry out the skin. skin and over sinreduces skin blemishes I still don’t know why I’ve only been using it for a week, but I will continue to use it and will update my review as soon as I’m done using it Good
