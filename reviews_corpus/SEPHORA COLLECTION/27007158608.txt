TINY BUT MIGHTY. When I ordered my first bottle of this vitamin tonic, I got the Vitamin E in the green bottle. I did somehow manage to get it half off and only paid $3 for it so was worth the gamble. I chuckled at the size of the bottle when I first saw it. There is a reason these stock photos have no size comparison. ITS TINY… Shockingly tiny. I was a little disappointed by the size. But I used it once in the morning and at night. The bottle got me through a month. Not bad. I still have about a third left actually. I just got this (Vit C). I wanted something to help the healing process for this spout of adult acne I have going, yet still leave me glowing. I’m going to do the Vitamin C in my morning routine to make me glow and the vitamin E in the evening to hydrate and refreshed. I think pairing the two will make my skin and me happy. nan
