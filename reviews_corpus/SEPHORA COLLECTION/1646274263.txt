I received this product for free from Influenster and Sephora in exchange for my honest review.This is not a product that I would personally use on my face due to the ingredients. I have rosacea and overall sensitive skin.  this has many essential oils, fragrance and lemon extracts - this just screams irritation for me.  I’ll use this up on my neck or hands but I won’t be testing this on my face. meh
