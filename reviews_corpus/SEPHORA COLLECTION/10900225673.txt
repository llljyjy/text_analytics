I really enjoyed adding this to my skin care routine! It was easy application. It tingled my skin when I applied it…my skin is very sensitive, so the tingling lasted a little longer than I would have liked, but it wasn’t bad. I have already seen a decrease in my dark spots and have a clearer complexion. nan
