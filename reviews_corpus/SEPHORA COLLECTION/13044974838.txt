if you your skin to smell like coffee for two days, this works great! it feels fine, and works as intended, but the smell of coffee stuck to my skin for two days. i only got the smell off by using an electric facial brush and three uses of my cleanser. if youâ€™re going to buy one of these, just the the pomegranate one. the smell isnt worth the result
