If you LOVED the 3 ingredient moisturizer, donâ€™t bother with this. The old formula worked so well for my acne scars and kept acne at bay. This new formula is terrible. It pills easily with or without makeup. It feels like it is sliding off my face, and my face breaks out horribly now. Please bring back the original 3 ingredient moisturizer. Not Close to the 3.0
