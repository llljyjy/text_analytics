I bought this product previously and LOVED it. However this content extremely disappointing, something changed drastically. This formula is sticky and feels sticky when applied to my face. When I opened it the first several wipes were dried up. It still removes makeup but I didnâ€™t feel instant hydration, See an immediate glow, or feel like my face was revitalized as it had in the past. Disappointing, but scent remained savory and fragrant. Sticky
