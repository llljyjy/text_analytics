Okay, let me first start by saying, “WOW“ is the first word that comes to mind when I started using this product. It has not only did it’s job in helping me remove make up but has left my skin FLAWLESS. It is seriously the best product i have added to my skincare routine in the last 3 years. It is non-drying, non-irritating and so easy to use. You don’t even need a lot of product for it to take everything off. 10,000/10! I am sooo thankful to have been gifted this product. It is also super affordable! 10,000/10!!!!
