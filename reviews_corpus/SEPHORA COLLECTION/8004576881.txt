I was pretty skeptical about this new skincare line when I first heard about it. Upon trying this moisturizer I’m so happy to report that I am pleasantly surprised. Not only is it a clean beauty item, it also works really great. My skin is hydrated and moisturized. It feels great under makeup and doesn’t make me too greasy. All in all, I would purchase this again. So hydrating!
