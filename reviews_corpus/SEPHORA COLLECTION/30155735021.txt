I had been curious about the Sephora brand skincare and let me tell you guys it did not disappoint! This moisturizer was super nourishing and rich. I love how it didn’t break my oily/acne prone skin but instead gave me the perfect amount of hydration. I also really appreciate the price point and how the product feels like a higher end moisturizer. One of my absolute favorite things about this product was that it is unscented because my skin typically get irritated with heavily scented products. Definitely recommend if you’re in the market for a new moisturizer! nan
