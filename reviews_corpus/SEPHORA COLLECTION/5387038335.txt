So I used the old version of this product for the last year or two because I’m poor and it was actually really good, so I was concerned when they changed it into this. It’s fine. I don’t think it’s AS rich as the old version, I think they replaced the base oil that the ingredients are suspended in, if my memory is correct (it’s usually not). But I’d say the difference is pretty marginal and I will be buying this again until I get out of life-crippling debt. Maybe even afterwards, we’ll see. good for the price, liked the old one better
