If I could leave zero stars for this, I would. Bought this chapstick about a year ago and was SO in love with its coconut-y scent and moisturizing effect. It almost was like using coconut oil on my lips but in chapstick form. Well I recently ran out so I went to purchase another and the new formula is HORRIBLE. It tastes and smells like play-do/crayons. It is AWFUL and I’m quite sad about it to be honest. This product was by far my favorite chapstick I’ve ever owned. It gave me tropical vacation vibes and it is really disappointing that such an amazing product doesn’t exist anymore. DO NOT BUY!!
