I have been looking for a new moisturizer that doesn’t break the bank but hydrates my skin all day and all night. This product is it!!! It is totally affordable and shows that great quality doesn’t have to be expensive! I absolutely love the texture of this product. It feels like whipped cream for my face! It applies so smooth and a little goes a long way. The icing on the cake is that fact that this product is certified clean at Sephora!! I will be for sure buying again! Whipped Cream Moisturizer
