I have been using the comforting cream for a few days and I have been able to see changes in my skin, it looks more hydrated, my skin is brighter and healthier.  I love that in addition to not being tested on animals, 93% of the ingredients are of natural origin and the packaging is made of a high percentage of recycled plastic. In addition to taking care of our skin, we are taking care of the planet and I love that.  I am using this cream both in my day and night routine I love it
