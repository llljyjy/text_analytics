This undereye cream is so smooth and creamy, I love it! It glides on so easily and feels refreshing on my undereyes.  I like to use it on my T Zone too for extra moisture during the day!  The best part is that its vegan and clean which is not usually available for more affordable products.  This cream reminds me of the IT Cosmetics Confidence in an Eye Cream with how smooth and creamy it is so it would be a good dupe for that! Good Dupe for Confidence in an Eye Cream
