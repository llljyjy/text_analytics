Luckily these don’t have a strong smell, especially since i don’t like coffee. They brightened my under eyes super quickly, and the effect also spread to my upper cheeks, so it’s like a mini sheet mask for the face. The product is slightly slippery and I used them while getting ready in the morning so they migrated a little. I wouldn’t hesitate to repurchase them and use them when I’m sitting in one place. I like how they are a clean product and biodegradable. I hope more companies follow suit, since having an intensive beauty regimen shouldn’t harm the planet. instantly brighten
