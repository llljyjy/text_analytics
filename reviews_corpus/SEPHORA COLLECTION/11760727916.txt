This moisturizer is AMAZING! I wash my face with my cleanser, sometimes I tone, then I’ll go in with a serum, eye cream, and then this moisturizer!!! It is sooo good and even better that it’s Clean at Sephora. I have dry skin and this moisturizer is perfect and it’s a perfect price for the amount of product you receive! Perfect!!!
