I liked the price point of this for the ingredients, but unfortunately this definitely broke me out! I applied it nightly to my cheeks before my moisturizer and would wake up with little bumps of acne. I didn’t change anything else in my routine, so it had to be this :/ I feel like I did notice one of my red spots fading a bit but because of the breakouts I won’t be continuing using this. If you don’t have acne-prone skin you might like this! Alright…
