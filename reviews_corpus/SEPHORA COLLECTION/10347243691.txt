The serum is unscented, not oily, gentle, and absorbs quickly into skin. Plus, I don’t have to put a lot on my skin because it spreads so easily. I like applying the serum every morning and evening on my face and neck. After a week of using it, I can tell that it really helps to even out my complexion and lighten up my dark spots. Small changes, but a definite improvement. I think, with more prolonged use, the changes would be more noticeable. I’m inspired that it is Vegan and made with Natural ingredients. I also like that  the bottle is made with 40% recycled glass and the packing comes from sustainably managed forests.  Even the ink is made from natural, sustainable sources. Talk about a commitment to protecting our environment. Lighten up my dark spots.
