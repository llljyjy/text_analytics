I have to be honest, I got this product for free for my review. I am still going to be honest because I am very thorough in skincare and any product I put on my face. I have gone through not only Western skincare products but also Asian skincare products, and high-end expensive brands to drugstore products. Basically, I like to think I know my stuff when it comes to skincare.Alright, now for the important aspects of this review. Is it worth it? In my opinion, yes! For the price point it’s very good, and it does its job. I have dry skin and it is hard to manage in the wintertime, and I wanted to see how the peel mask would hold up. Keep in mind that you should not be using this every day, even if you do not have dry skin because improper use can damage your skin. I recommend doing once a week first. These are still chemicals you’re putting on your face! This product works phenomenally when you make sure you’re moisturized well (which you should be doing with any AHA-BHA-PHA or chemical exfoliant anyway). It gives me such a nice dewy look right after, and if you make sure to routinely use it, the long-term results are worth it. Even my housemates knew I was different, and we see each other every day! Overall, for the price point and results? This is great. I recommend this to anyone who would want to try a stronger chemical exfoliant but do not want to spend a lot of money for one on the off-chance they don’t like it. I would start recommending this to my friends who want to try to get into skincare exfoliants as well! From a dry sensitive skincare enthusiast...
