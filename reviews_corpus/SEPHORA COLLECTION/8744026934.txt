It’s a LOT bigger than I expected. I thought it wouldn’t be good to reach small areas, but the little ’teeth’ / rigged edges really help target miniscule / specific areas! definitely a lot better than I expected, especially at this price point! It’s also rigid/stone like. Not sure why I thought it would be of a soft texture. If you’re looking for a gua sha for its purpose, then this is it. All the other stones do the exact same thing for 5 x the price point, don’t get fooled. DEFINITELY AN AMAZING BUY! So glad I purchased it!
