These harsh winter months have been really tough on my skin. This nourishing moisturizer is everything I was looking for to fix my dry, flaky skin. It goes on thick and feels very moisturizing but does not leave any oily residue on the skin. It’s so nice that quality does not have to mean expensive! It’s also certified clean which makes me feel good about putting it on my face. Perfect for dry winter skin
