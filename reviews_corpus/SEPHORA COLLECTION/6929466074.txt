I bought this never having dermaplaned before. There were many ways this could have ended badly if I didnâ€™t have a quality razor. This one did a great job. Glass over skin without nicks or cuts. I was able to use it three times before I switched it out for a new blade. Cleaning the blade and switching them out is easy but you should still be careful when using something so sharp. The razor has a good wait in the handle making it not feel flimsy. Cuts great even when you have a very short weeks worth of growth after first shave. Love that you can buy refill razors. Definitely worth it. Great for a first timer!!
