This lip balm comes in the very cute cardboard packaging that you would assume is just an outer box. When you twist the top off it reveals the beautiful tinted balm inside. I got the color Lychee, which is a very pretty peachy tint. The balm is very hydrating, smoothing, and softening! It makes my lips feel so soft, smooth, full, and plump. It even makes my lips look fuller and plumper. I love the hint of color because it makes my complexion look healthier. The price is super affordable for such a nice and luxurious feeling balm! This is comparable to higher end tinted lip balms! Amazing Balm!
