I genuinely can’t believe how well this takes my makeup off! I tend to find even after I remove all my makeup I’ll still wake up with mascara under my eyes, but with this, there’s nothing, it removes 100% of the makeup. I remove most of my makeup with micellar water first, then use this to make sure it’s all off and it leaves my skin feeling so soft! If your looking for a good affordable makeup remover/cleanser, this is it!!! Buy This!!!
