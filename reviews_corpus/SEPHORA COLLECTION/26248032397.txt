I love this stuff. It is filled with vitamin C and E. Making it so great for your skin. The ingredients are 97% from natural origins. You use it after washing your face, dry it, and spread evenly over your face and neck. It definitely left my skin feeling really good, and even better after using for a few days. Amazing!!
