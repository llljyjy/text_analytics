I really liked this product, I have been using it for a few days now, and find it to be very hydrating. I think itâ€™s too early to see results, but I do like that it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. The serum is very light in texture and weight,  I absolutely love that the product is vegan and has clean ingredients. Affordable, Vegan & Clean!
