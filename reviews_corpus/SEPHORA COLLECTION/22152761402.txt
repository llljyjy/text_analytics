I received a free sample of this with my latest order at Sephora. I’ve tried a lot of Sephora branded products and while most are not bad, I usually find them kinda of basic, they’re basically a cheaper, yet still overpriced alternative to the high-end brands at the store. However... this serum felt surprisingly amazing on the skin. I’ve only used it a few times, but it felt amazing, smooth, and I could still feel that it probably had enough vitamin C in it. I can’t speak on any medium or long-term effects yet, but my initial impressions were good enough as to where I seriously thought about buying this serum and I’ll definitely be getting it at some point, probably after I use up my current Vit C products, or even sooner, if I can’t wait... I have sensitive, dry to combo skin and I loved it! Initial Impressions: Surprisingly Nice & Smooth
