I really like using this product! It’s pretty runny and has a liquid texture which I’m not really a fan of, especially because too much can run onto my clothes or off my face if I’m not careful. It does absorb pretty well, doesn’t leave any weird oily feeling on my face, and the smell is pleasant. The other thing I don’t like about it is that there’s not much glow. I feel like it’s only glowy before it completely absorbs into your skin. Great serum but has some flaws
