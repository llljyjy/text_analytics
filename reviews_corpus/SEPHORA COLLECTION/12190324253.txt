This is a great and gentle cleanser. I use it day and night as per of my skin care routine alongside the cleansing brush. I do feel it has helped with clearing up breakouts due to wearing face masks and menstrual cycles. My only con is that when wearing makeup, this cleanser needs backup whether it be face wipes or micellar water etc. Great option for gentle everyday cleanser!
