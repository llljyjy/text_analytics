This lip balm is AMAZING!! I’m always looking for a good chapstick & this stuff is more than good! It is so moisturizing & nourishing & stays on your lips for quite a while so you’re not constantly reapplying. It’s got a very light hint of Coconut to it that’s not overbearing & for $7!? Thats a steal! I love this stuff! Definitely recommend it especially for people with chapped lips! It’ll fix ya right up & it’s so affordable! nan
