I thought the Sephora PBT moisturizer is perfect for my nighttime skin routine! I love that itâ€™s certified clean at Sephora. My skin in the winter time and especially after a shower can be super dried out but I love how thick the consistency is and how it seems to actually moisturize my skin! Great quality for the price!! I look forward to an SPF option for my daytime skin routine! Great for Dry Skin!
