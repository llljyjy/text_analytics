I’ve got few dark sport at the end of last summer (remember to use sunscreen ladies!) and I think this serum is a must have going into summer season! Along with the sunscreen, it should keep my skin beautiful :) I love the new clean beauty products like from Sephora, it’s very affordable and the quality is same as well known expensive brands. I love that it’s unscented, too. Nice product
