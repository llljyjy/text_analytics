I’ve used the targeting pore serum for a week now and although I haven’t seen any major differences, I have faith it is working. I’ve always struggled with big pores on my nose, and I think that the PHA+BHA will be helpful. I’m looking forward to continue using this project and will try to update this. Also, I have sensitive skin and I have had no irritation! It goes on very smooth and I use it before I moisturize. Non-irritating! Hoping it helps
