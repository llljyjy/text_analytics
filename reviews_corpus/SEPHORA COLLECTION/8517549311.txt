Love this! Not too potent, but leaves me glowy the next day. Easy to apply, doesn’t smell, and easy to rinse off. Price is great - Sephora Collection products are severely underrated. I use it twice a week and I’ve noticed my skin is brighter and some of my acne scars have been fading substantially. BUY IT
