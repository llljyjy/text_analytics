This eye cream is everything I wanted! It has no discernible scent, a little goes a long way, and it is extremely moisturizing without making my under eye area appear oily. I like that the packaging isn’t bulky like other eye creams I’ve tried. It’s also very inexpensive! This is going to be my new go-to eye cream. nan
