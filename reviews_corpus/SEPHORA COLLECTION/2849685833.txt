I was looking for a new, affordable day-time moisturizer and decided to try this and I love it! It’s lightweight and doesn’t clog my pores or make me hot, some moisturizers tend to be heavy on my face and make me sweat, yuck. This one is also vegan which is a huge plus. The packaging is very convenient, love that I can squeeze it out versus having to use my fingers to scoop it out and it’s pink, love! Great Affordable Moisturizer
