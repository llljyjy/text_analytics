I have always used makeup wipes for makeup removal. More recently I started using micellar water. Wipes were good; micellar water was better. I started using this melting cleansing balm and it is the best! It goes on smoothly and takes off my makeup quickly.  I have not tried it on my eyes yet as I have an infection and haven’t been wearing eye makeup.  I double cleanse by washing my face afterwards.  My skin feels soft and smooth. I use a PHA toner afterwards and there’s barely any residue on the cotton pad.  Great price too! I’m so glad I tried this! Cleansing Game Changer!
