Very hydrating and rich in texture perfect for my sensitive acne prone skin. Fragrance free moisturizer that leave skin radiant the next day. Compared ingredients to the Drunk elephant whipped face cream and I found the Sephora collection cream has the better ingredients on the top of its list. Didn’t break me out and I would recommend a acne serum underneath to prevent future breakouts and this cream on top to protect skin barrier. I’ve noticed my necklines were fading. Definitely worth the purchase don’t sleep on the Sephora collection very worth the hype. excellent night cream for sensitive skin
