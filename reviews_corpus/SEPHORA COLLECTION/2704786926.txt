First of all, Sephora collection is *probably* my favorite brand at Sephora. All of the products are super affordable and very comparable to the higher end products. BUT the even better thing about SC is that the products are vegan and CLEAN BEAUTY! I normally don’t use eye creams because they can be one of the most expensive skincare products but I’m so glad the SC eye creams are very affordable. This one is hydrating for sure. My under eyes are naturally bright so I haven’t noticed that but it may work for others! I also love that it doesn’t irritate my under eyes. Affordable, but *chef’s kiss*
