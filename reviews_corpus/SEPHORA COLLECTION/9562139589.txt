I’ve mostly used these reusable pads for toner and they’ve been great. I don’t have much experience using these to remove makeup other than mascara but haven’t had any issues with the mascara staining so far.My only complaint is that the bag doesn’t stay closed in the washing machine so I tie it. nan
