I’ve always been a bit skeptical of cleansing brushes and tools, but gave this one a go as I received it for free in exchange for an honest review. I didn’t mind the experience of using this one (used with a cleansing balm for my first cleanse), but can’t say I’m enticed to incorporate it into my routine regularly. The bristles are very soft and sensitive-skin friendly, and the silicone section felt like a nice massage across my face. It is not overly abrasive which was my main concern, however I am still a bit wary of how hygienic these tools are with repeated use. Overall I didn’t mind this brush at all, but do not see it staying in my skincare routine. nan
