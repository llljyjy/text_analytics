If I could give this product 10 stars, I would!! It’s the only product that healed my skin barrier. It’s perfect for those who are going for that “glass skin” look. I only use it in the evening bc my skin tends to get oily if I deviate from my usual ‘just cleanser and moisturizer’ routine in the morning. It’s super lightweight, no fragrance, and a little goes a long way, so it should last you a few months holy grail for glass skin
