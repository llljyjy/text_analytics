This is such a great vitamin c serum if your skin can handle it!! I’m beginning to understand my skin just doesn’t do well with vitamin C serum. Every vitamin C that I use always makes me break out. But this particular formula is outstanding! It absorbs so quickly into the skin and leaves no greasy or oily residue which is a big key factor. You get the glow without the grease. If my skin could tolerate vitamin C I would re-purchase this 1 million times over. Not to mention it’s part of the clean beauty standard. A win-win win all around Yes!!
