i’ve used this for about a week and it does its job. it’s nothing fancy and i like to use it to wash off my makeup and skincare before i go in with another wash to get my skin squeaky clean. i wouldn’t use this on its own, but i think it’s a good product to add to an existing routine for good measure. nan
