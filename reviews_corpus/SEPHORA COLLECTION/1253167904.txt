It’s great that this product is clean, vegan & fragrance-free.  That being said, I can’t say that I’ve noticed a significant difference after a couple of weeks. I haven’t had any breakouts or reactions. The consistency is good -- not too thick so that it absorbs quickly, but not so thin that it’s runny that it gets in your eyes. It’s very affordable, which is also a good thing. We shall see...
