Lots of reviews about the smell and size of the product. Yes, this product has an odd smell - like plasticky? But I can move past that and recognize that this is a great hydrating moisturizer that leaves a beautiful glowy finish to the skin. At first, I was shocked by how small the container was, but soon found that a little goes a long way. Love using on no makeup days, and also find the consistency to be perfect when mixed with a tinted glow drop or foundation. Great moisturizer, aside from the smell ;)
