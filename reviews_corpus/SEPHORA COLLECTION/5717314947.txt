I’ve been usingbthis moisturizer for a few weeks now and it really works. It’s thick yet goes on very light without leaving a residue. I love that it’s certified clean at Sephora. I do wish it had a scent but it doesn’t.  I live in an area where our winters are super harsh and my skin gets super dry. After using this I can say that it’s helped immensely! Helps my dry skin immensely
