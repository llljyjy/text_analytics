This has to be my favorite serum to date! I’ll be honest I didn’t expect much from it, but wow was in for a shock & pleasant surprise. I love that it’s unscented which makes it sensitive skin friendly, the look of my dark spots and overall skin has reduced the look and pigmentation, my skin and look of it is brighter, nourished and hydrated. Even when I’m wearing makeup or skin rings it wears so well underneath, it’s not sticky, it applies perfectly smooth and absorbs just as well. This serum is a game changer! I’m getting another bottle. Don’t sleep on it Game Changer! Must Have!
