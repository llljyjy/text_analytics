I really like this eye cream as an affordable option and an alternative to higher end products. Although an eye cream isn’t necessary to a routine, I lone including one as an extra self-care step. I love that it’s unscented for my eye region, and the hyaluronic acid and caffeine help so much with puffiness and dark circles for me. I have combination skin and I feel like this cream really hydrates and brightens my under eye area. This is also vegan and clean at Sephora, so something helpful if you’re looking for a good new option. I think the quality is great for the price and is comparable to other higher end products but way more affordable. I like to use this as part of my daily lymphatic drainage massage as well for my eye region. nan
