I have been using this cleanser daily after my oil cleanser. It does a wonderful job at removing makeup residue. It’s surprising to me because for the price I didn’t expect much. But clearly cleansers don’t have to be expensive. This cleanser does what it claims and I would definitely repurchase. I especially love that it’s vegan and clean meaning I don’t have to worry about it being harsh chemicals or tested on animals. This is a great product and I h iui highly recommend it. You don't need to break the bank for clean skin
