I’ve been a huge fan of Sephora Collection Skincare for over 4 years now. What I love is that quality doesn’t have to be expensive. The Clean Skin Gel is my favorite cleanser! It’s fragrance free and lathers up so nicely. It cleanses and tones the skin, without stripping the skin of its naturalness. It’s also Vegan & Clean at Sephora. I will definitely be repurchasing once I run out! For $10, you can’t beat the price and your skin will thank you later for it. Clean Skincare & Affordable? Yes Please!
