Let me start off by saying the product itself is okay. Not exceptional, but it’s fine. The problem comes from the dispenser bottle. It squirts out haphazardly in EVERY direction. I thought I could manage this by cupping my hand around the pump—until today, when this GRAPEFRUIT serum squirted THROUGH MY FINGERS and DRENCHED MY EYE from a gentle pump nearly 2ft away. I flushed my eye but it’s still tingling. Please avoid this. If you must buy it, switch it to a different dispenser. A Lawsuit Waiting to Happen
