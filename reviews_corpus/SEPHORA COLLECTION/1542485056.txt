Like your lips but BETTER. If you loathe shiny lips, you will LOVE THIS BALM because it’s a soft matte finish without being drying AT ALL. The Cherry color is just darker than my own lip color so it’s absolute perfection for those low makeup days, and I even layer it over my Chanel red lipliner to blend it out but keep it matte. I would give this 10 stars if I could. I also have the Dragonfruit one, and it’s a bit too sheer, too blue for me; for someone very fair the Dragonfruit one might be the right tint to amp up their lip color, but it’s too light for me. This Cherry one is absolute perfection: I have 2 of them and will buy more. PLEASE NEVER DISCONTINUE THIS.To people who are complaining that it’s not a scrub, YOU NEED TO READ THE DESCRIPTION before purchasing. The ones that are scrubs are labeled as scrubs on the packaging and the ones that are lip balms are labeled as such.I also have the lip scrubs and they’re very good quality! They’re pretty solid, so they don’t melt all over your lips as you swipe it across your lips over and over - you can get a real good scrub on! I have the scrub in Coconut AND vanilla and they’re both also very good.Incredibly happy with these amazing products! Your lip color on steroids
