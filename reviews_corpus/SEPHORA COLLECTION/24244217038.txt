I have been super impressed with the Sephora Collection Clean Lip Balm.  Now sits at my desk to use throughout the day. I wear a mask at work, and this has helped my lips from drying out. It is so moisturizing and hydrating. Shade Luchee is a sheer color and awesome scent. Leaves my lips feeling nourished all day. Excellent price at $7! New favorite balm!
