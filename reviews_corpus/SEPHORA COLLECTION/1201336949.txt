I have been incorporated this serum into my morning and evening routine for 2 weeks, I like how it made my skin feel. I applied it after my toner and before my moisturizer, I notice some of my dark spots did lightening up a little bit, obviously I will have to use longer to see any long lasting effects, but I will definitely keep purchasing and my skin is loving it so far! nan
