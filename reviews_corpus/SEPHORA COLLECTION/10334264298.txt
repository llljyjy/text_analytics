I tend to have extremely sensitive skin so finding masks I love is difficult. I didn’t have any burning issues or sensitivities while applying this product. I was surprised how well the formula worked for me! The fact it’s vegan and cruelty-free is a must for me. I think this will be my new go-to! Feels Great
