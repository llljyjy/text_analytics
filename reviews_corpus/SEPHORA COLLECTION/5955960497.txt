I bought this because I can’t use Retinol, but want similar results... Including improvement in pores and mild acne. I was pleasantly surprised at the texture; unlike anything I’d used before. It’s a thick milk-like texture, more reminiscent of a runny lotion, though it applies and absorbs like a dream.I applied for the first time in the middle of a *horrible* cold which had left my skin depleted and fragile, so I was amazed at just how moisturized and nourished my skin felt *immediately* upon application -- & I’m no stranger to moisturizers. It’s just a treat to work with, like skin-love in a bottle, and so gentle that I can easily layer it with other actives. If anything, it seems to reverse any potential irritation.(My current PM routine is Glycolic Acid Toner, Salicylic Acid, and this. In the AM, I apply w/ Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, and SPF -- a perfect base for makeup.) No pilling. Even on top of multiple serums/products. And while it’s fragrance free, there is a SLIGHT powder-y scent to it -- which is typical of Bakuchiol. Don’t let its gentleness deceive -- it’s effective as well. Though I’ve only been using it for two weeks, I’ve noticed an immense improvement in my skin’s texture, tone, and even fine lines. I wasn’t too sure how effective it had been targeting the latter, until I reviewed Before photos. The proof is in the pics! I’ve not yet noticed an improvement in my pores or sebaceous filaments, though I’ve noticed a great improvement in the *texture* of my pores. In all, this has become my favourite product to use -- if only because it’s so versatile, nourishing, and easy to incorporate into an extensive routine. My only gripe would be the packaging -- which feels flimsy compared to the heavy quality of the bottle itself. Which did come full, FYI. I’d say if you’re on the hunt for a Retinol alternative, or even if your skin just needs a dose of TLC -- look no further. This will do the trick & your skin will thank you. A Star of Them All
