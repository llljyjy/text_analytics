The hemp one is great, especially for the price. Yes, the pump is demonic, but if you just cup your hand when you use it, it doesn’t go everywhere. I feel like my somewhat breakout-prone skin is calmer and clearer since using this. Might not be for everyone, but I’m re-purchasing! Very nice serum, bad packaging
