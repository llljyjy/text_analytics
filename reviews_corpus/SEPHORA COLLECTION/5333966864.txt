I love that this is an affordable but quality face wash. Is non scented with 98% ingredients from natural origins that cleanses and tones with prebiotics and is a clean vegan product found at Sephora. Does a good job getting all the grease and dirt off without drying my skin out. Minimal suds but helps to balance my combination skin. Overall I enjoy and recommend. Good Wash
