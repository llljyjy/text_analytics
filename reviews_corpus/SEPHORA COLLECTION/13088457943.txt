I normally would give this product 5 stars but this last time I used it, it stung my face. I do not like to use any products that feel like they are hurting my skin. That being said, it smells amazing and still did leave my skin feeling radiant. I would love this product more if it was completely derived of natural ingredients instead of only 95%. nan
