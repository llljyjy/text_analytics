The Sephora Moisturizing lip balm is absolutely phenomenal! I bought the watermelon flavor and it tastes and smells amazing! It has a slight tint, creating that supple, hydrated lip glow. This is a product I would recommend to everyone who needs a great every day lip balm. Also love the fact that it is packaged in eco-friendly materials! Definitely purchasing more flavors! The best lip balm!
