I was really disappointed with this serum. I had high hopes based on prior good reviews. I’ve been using the product for a month and don’t see any difference. The dropper in the bottle is every poor and it’s very difficult to get the product out. It has a strange consistency as well. Was really hoping for a good affordable Sephora alternative to retinol :( Skip this, bottle dropper and outcomes poor
