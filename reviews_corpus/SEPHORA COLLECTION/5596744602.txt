This is a wonderful toner. My skin is usually combo but lately it’s been oily all over and I was getting little clogged pores. I wanted something to clarify a little more but without being stripping. This did exactly that. My skin has been clear and extra glowy. I recommend applying it with your hands and not a cotton pad. For some reason when I used a cotton pad it made me a little red and my skin seemed more dry. I haven’t had that reaction at all when just using my hands. perfect for sensitve oily skin
