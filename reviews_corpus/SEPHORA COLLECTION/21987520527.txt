Sephora Collection gifted me this product in exchange for my honest opinion. I loved how smooth this mask made my skin feel afterwards, but it is a little intense for sensitive skin. Would not recommend if your skin is too sensitive for strong mask peels. I loved it, but I know friends who wouldnâ€™t be able to handle a more intense skin care product. Great but Intense for Super Sensitive Skin
