i got the lychee one, like all the other comments the pump does suck. it will splash out of your hand and go everywhere but it also has a lot of fragrance and when i mean a lot, it’s #9 on the list out of 18 i believe (if i counted currently) and also contains alcohol. i haven’t noticed a change in my skin so far but if you’re actually looking for something to change your skin, go to the inkey list. i just found their cleanser and it transformed my face. nan
