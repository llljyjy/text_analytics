I actually don’t want to say how much I enjoy these so I can stock up on more of them! I’ve never been great with skincare routines, but have been trying to do better, especially during the dry autumn/winters here. I really enjoy these - I like to use them after a shower a few times a week. The moisture isn’t crazy - they are only intended for a minute or so - but they stave off the worst of the dryness this time of year. After use, I squeeze out any extra product and use that on my neck/arms. The fitting isn’t terrible for me - the mouth cutouts tend to be a little lower than what I need but it’s no big deal to work around that; actually, it can be downright funny! Using 2-3/week, I’m so happy to use these - I don’t have to commit a bunch of time (which is why I never got into skincare routines anyway), and even when they are full price, the bulk of 14 makes them economically-friendly. At that 2-3/week, I would have to spend $300-700+ a year on masks if I relied only on more moisturizing but more expensive masks, and these are a fraction of that cost. These are good if you don’t have the time or cash for the more heavy-hitting products, are like me where the motto is, “what skincare routine?“, and would be handy for travel. If you’re looking for heavy moisturizing, these would probably not cut it - I see them more as a maintenance-level product and they are lovely for that! Skincare routine? Nah. Minute mask? Sure!
