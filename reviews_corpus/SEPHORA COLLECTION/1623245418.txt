I rarely hate something enough to give it one star...but there’s always a first. I love sheet masks and use a variety of brands. This is probably one of the worst sheet mask I’ve ever used. The size of the sheet mask is just strange. I have an averaged size face, but this sheet mask only covers 3/4 of my cheek. The eye holes are surprisingly small. I truly don’t think their R&D department actually used them on a human face before selling it. Sadly, the mask dries out very quickly too. such a disappointment nan
