I use this all the time, especially as the makeup person for a local dance academy. They are great with dual sides, one as a wipe the other as an exfoliate. This purchase was for my great niece who has just started using makeup. I included them in her “Welcome to Sephora” gift box which was packed full (14lbs) of Sephora samples . Perfectly Perfect
