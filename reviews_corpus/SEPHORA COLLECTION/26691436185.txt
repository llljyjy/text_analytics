This is a great treatment. Put it on lightly once a week (increase to two if you want to over time) and wash off after about 15min. It did a great job reducing spots just overnight so I can only imagine how my face will look after just a month or two. I’m a big fan. Didn’t irritate my skin either and I’m very sensitive.*I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review. No irritation on sensitive skin
