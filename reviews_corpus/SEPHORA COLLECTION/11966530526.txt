This moisturizer is a dry skin dream because it’s so creamy and thick! One thing I love that this product is that it’s part of the clean sephora collection and its VEGAN!  I have been getting so many compliments on how glowy my skin looks and I am convinced its from this! I also noticed that it’s helping clear some of my scars. I pair this product with the under eye cream and my makeup lays so nicely that I don’t even need a primer. I honestly would recommend this product especially because of how affordable and good quality it is! Clean formula perfect for acne prone skin
