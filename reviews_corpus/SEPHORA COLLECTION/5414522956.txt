I received a sample in my voxbox and I appreciate a vitamin C serum that isn’t super orange or tacky, it’s not irritating at all. however, I’m not sure if it’s that effective. It is very watery and runny so the sample packaging isn’t too friendly but I’m going to continue using it and wait for results. Has yet to impress
