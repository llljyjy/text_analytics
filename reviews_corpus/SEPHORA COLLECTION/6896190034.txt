The 8hr hydration Lip Balm from Sephora is a steal at just 7$. It’s super hydrating and keeps my lips moisturized all day. I got the Cherry lip balm and it’s a flattering color on me . I don’t need lipstick when i use this. The only problem I faced was the scent is a little too strong for my taste. I would prefer unscented lip balms. Overall am happy with the color, the hydration and price . Moisturized lips with a hint of color
