high quality (and versatile) product for a reasonable price! i like using it layered on top of my morning moisturizer for a “glowy“ look when i am not wearing makeup. it is also my go-to makeup primer (i prefer it over the fenty/tarte primers that i used to use). the makeup sticks very well, and you still have a glowy look after using foundation/concealer. i have very sensitive skin and this has not caused any irritation or breakouts. there’s not visible glitter/shimmer in the product (it’s an opaque white colour), which is what i was worried about when i read the reviews. new morning routine staple!
