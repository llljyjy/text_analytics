I personally love this product! The consistency is great and it doesn’t feel overly tacky like some serums I’ve used. I love that it’s fairly inexpensive, it’s vegan and cruelty free which is a big green flag. I have seen a reduction on my dark spots on my face since i’ve started using this product! i have very uneven skin and quite a few dark spots on my face and it has lightened at least half of my issue areas! definitely recommend to get! Very Good for the price!!
