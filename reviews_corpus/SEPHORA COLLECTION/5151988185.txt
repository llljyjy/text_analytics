I’ve been using this lip balm from the Sephora collection and so far it’s very nice on my lips, it’s moisturizing and very hydrating, I put it on at night before going to bed, before I start working out to keep my lips nourished while I’m at it, and right when im starting my makeup routine, and it just leaves my lips so soft and beautiful, It gives a beautiful glow to them as well and I would highly recommend it Beautiful lip balm with great formula
