Best lip mask I’ve found. I got the vanilla and when I first opened it was liquidy. People, just close the cap and shake it and squeeze the tube to mix it. It doesn’t stay liquidy. It healed my cracked lips over night and made them plump and soft. A little goes a long way. It may feel a little sticky but you’re going to bed. It’s well worth the $5. Just get it. nan
