I’m already a fan of these lip balms and the new litchi variant is so cute! Although I was hoping it had a more noticeable coral color but it’s virtually clear on me (maybe because I have pigmented lips). Very moisturizing though as you can see, and super comfortable to wear. Love that they are so affordable too! nan
