Great facial cleanser for the price! It is vegan and a clean product. I love that it cleanses and tones all in one product. The size is very generous and the foam is just balanced without stripping the skin. This is ideal for sensitive skin because it doesnâ€™t have any fragrance and includes aloe. nan
