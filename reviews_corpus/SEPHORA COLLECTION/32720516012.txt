I LOVE the overnight glow mask so sad they don’t sell it separately but altogether these products work wonders I have very very sensitive skin and they were not too strong for me my skin felt so soft the next day. I took off a star because I have to buy this kit again to get the overnight glow mask but it’s well worth it plus you don’t need to use alot so although it’s a small amount it’ll last awhile. A must have! love the glow!
