Used this razor only once with the original blade. The product is defective and a complete waste of your money, especially if you’re like me and didn’t find out until after the 60-day window when trying to replace the blade. Used everything from tweezers to pliers to try to get it out. Customer service will refuse to rectify this issue + be extremely unreasonable and brash. Even though the item is practically brand new. I even purchased the replacement blades along with it, more money down the drain. The razor is entirely useless now. Extremely disappointed with Sephora with the amount of money I frequently spend with this company and lack of solutions. This item is garbage and needs to be taken off the site until the product design is corrected. Wish I could give it zero stars. Better ways to waste your $. Beyond disappointed.
