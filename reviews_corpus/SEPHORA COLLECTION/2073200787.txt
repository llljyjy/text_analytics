This mask was below average. I only purchased it on a whim and probably won’t be buying it again. It did feel nice on the face, but left a lot of residue after taking it off which supposedly you can “rub in.“ Plus the smell was so perfume-y it took away from the relaxation while using it! Very strong perfume-y smell
