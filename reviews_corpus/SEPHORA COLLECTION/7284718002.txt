I have gone through multiple bottles of this moisturizer. I love that itâ€™s clean, vegan and inexpensive for an incredible product. I have very dry skin and the my skin soaks this right up, leaving me moisturized and dewy. It sits so well under makeup & sinks in fast. Truly love this product so much & cant recommend it enough!!! dry skin dream
