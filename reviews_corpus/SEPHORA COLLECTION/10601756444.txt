For the price and amount you get compared to other cleansing balms, this is great! Like others have said, it’s thicker and not as smooth, but it certainly still melts down my makeup, and is perfect for my first cleanse. I always have take a tiny bit more and target my eye area again to get my mascara and eyeliner completely off, but I’ve had to do that with more expensive cleansing balms I’ve tried as well, so this is a wonderful way for me to save money! It’s at least worth a shot if you’re looking for cheaper alternatives like I was. Gets the job done!
