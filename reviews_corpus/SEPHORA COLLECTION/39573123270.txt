I tried this product a few weeks ago. I’d been meaning to try it for a while since I get dark circles/puffiness if I don’t sleep well. Once I finally tried these, even though I used it as directed, it didn’t help at all- I still had dark purple circles and puffy eyes. I might try one of the other kinds since they’re pretty cheap, but I’m not sure seeing as this one barely helped. Eh
