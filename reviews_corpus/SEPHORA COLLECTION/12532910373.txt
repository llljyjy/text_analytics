Wow I have been on the fence to do this for a long time and I’m so happy I bit the bullet and purchased this. After I watched a few how to videos I gave it a try and it turned out really well. I have been self conscious for awhile about how much peach fuzz was all over my face.  I’d read about other benefits to using one of these ( exfoliation and allows serums to sink in more effectively) I picked this one because it had good reviews, was more environmentally friendly than disposable options and it looked like a good one.For the price I think it’s a great value (it comes with refills) and It has a good package to store the tool in. 100% reccomend First time user
