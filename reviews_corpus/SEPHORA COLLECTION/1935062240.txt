I recently got 2 bamboo reusable rounds and loved how they felt and removed makeup well. They were a bit pricey so I was hoping to find something of reasonably similar quality at a lower price. Not so much. These don’t feel as nice, they stain more easily, and get misshapen after washing. I don’t hate ’em, just wish I’d sucked it up and gotten more of the better quality ones. They're okay?
