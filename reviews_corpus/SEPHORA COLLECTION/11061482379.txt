I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this cleanser! I used it for a few days because that’s when I usually notice if it’ll break me out, or irritate my skin. But it didn’t! I actually really like it. I love the ingredients list because it’s clean and most cleansers I’m not even sure what I’m reading! Also I appreciate that Sephora products are going clean! It’s 98% from NATURAL ingredients! Sephora products are always a great more affordable price! I love finding hiding gems among Sephora products. I think I found a go to face wash! Great cleanser!
