Sephora Collection send me this product for free in exchange for my honest review. no dry or skin tighting feel after washing, very smooth texture, no harsh microbeads, no bad chemicals or smells, no skin irritation what do ever with this product and i’ve used it 3 times so far. My face feels really smooth and soft after and my pores are clean, the tube is big so you’re getting so much product and super affordable for $10.00! soft and clean
