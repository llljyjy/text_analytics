I received this sample in exchange for my honest review. I didn’t like how runny it was but it did feel nice on the skin. Felt like it absorbed in quickly and I was able to move on to my other steps of my routine quickly. I felt like my skin overall looked smoother after using for a while and didn’t cause any breakouts or anything like that. Liked it
