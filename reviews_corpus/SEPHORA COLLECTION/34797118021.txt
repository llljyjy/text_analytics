I wasn’t sure what to expect when I chose this face serum. I used up my vitamin C oil (CEO Glow) and I really didn’t even notice a difference after using the entire bottle. I decided to go with this serum to try it out. I have to say, after using it twice I already notice a difference. It actually does leave your skin with a dewy glow! It absorbs quickly into your skin and a little amount goes a long way. I’m very happy with this product. It even has a very slight scent to it that I really like. I might check out more of the Sephora products available because I’m impressed by this one. This may be my new go-to face serum I’ll be sure to have on hand :) Glowy Great!
