I got this mask from a friend for my birthday and I love it! The mask is jelly-like and sticks on so nicely ! Out of the package, it is sandwiched between two rigid papers that you have to peel off. It smells so good and it feels cooling. Iâ€™ve never done a mask for my decoulate and it is so relaxing ! Game changer. Will definitely buy more to keep in the fridge. Love Love Love
