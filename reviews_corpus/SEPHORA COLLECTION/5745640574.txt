Good starting off... but then they stained so quickly, made my skin break out (no other changes in my routine), didn’t fully clean my face like disposable ones did and generally just irritated my skin. Saddd because I love eco-friendly solutions to waste but these are just not it. Don’t waste your money Not it :(
