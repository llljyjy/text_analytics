I love the whole Sephora Collection skincare line, and this is no exception! This has a great texture - it’s not too emollient, greasy, or sticky and just leaves my skin dewy and plump. I love that it has no fragrance, and just sticks to the important and necessary actives and ingredients to make it function - I cannot tell you how annoyed I get with products that put fragrances in their skincare! If this Bakuchiol is an active that works for you (like it does for me), I think you’ll be really pleased with this reasonably priced, perfectly packaged (dark glass) product! another win from Sephora Collection
