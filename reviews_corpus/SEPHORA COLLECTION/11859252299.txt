I am definitely a lip balm enthusiast and this one in particular has made it onto my top 3 favorites list! It is super moisturizing, it smells AMAZING, the application is super smooth, and I love that the packaging isn’t bulky! A lot of times I find certain lip balms can be sort of clumpy on the lips, but I didn’t have that issue with this one! I personally am not vegan, but really like that this is an inclusive product that those who are vegan are able to use! Super Smooth
