I love this product. I have noticed that it has helped my dark spots on my skin. I usually use it on my face for my acne scars or on my bikini line!! Sometimes on my under arms as well! I really love how it’s vegan and clean as well! It doesn’t break the bank either so that’s great!! My favorite part is that is fragrance free so it doesn’t irritate my skin. Love!
