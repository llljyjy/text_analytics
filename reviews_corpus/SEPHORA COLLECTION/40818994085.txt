I received this product for free from Influenster and Sephora collection in exchange for my honest review. I like that this product has a light fresh scent and the consistency is very liquidy almost like water. The serum absorbed into my skin very quickly and really did leave a beautiful glow to my skin. My other skin care and makeup went over this serum so well and it helped my skin feel hydrated even after applying a full face of makeup. I will definitely be purchasing the full size product because I feel like itâ€™s a great product at a very reasonable price. I loved this serum. ðŸ’–
