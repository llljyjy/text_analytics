The texture of this mask is almost whipped, its very different. I’m not sure I like it.  I have used it a couple times and the main thing I’m disappointed about is the smell. There is NO TRACE of grapefruit. It smells kind of like Christmas to me if that makes any sense. I was looking forward to a bright, nice grapefruit smell when using this so that was a bummer. But it’s a big size for the price. No citrus smell at all
