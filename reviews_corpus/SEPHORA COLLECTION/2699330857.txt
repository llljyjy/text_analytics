I had been using the Khiels Avocado eye cream before this but wanted to try something more hydrating. I do believe I found it! this feels really nice under the eyes and I notice a bit of plumpness. I naturally have lines under my eyes but I do find this aids in what I was looking for which was the hydration factor. very hydrating!
