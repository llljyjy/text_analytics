This is a really lovely gel cleanser. It lathers nicely and cleanses thoroughly. It does not leave my skin tight or stripped of moisture. I use this as a morning cleanser or as the 2nd step in my double cleaning routine. Bonus- itâ€™s affordable! I highly recommend giving this one a try! Lovely affordable cleanser
