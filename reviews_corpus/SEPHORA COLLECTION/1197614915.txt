I’m always on the lookout for new skincare & when I saw this one I was really intrigued. I’ve been wanting to try a bakuchiol serum as an alternative to retinol. This did not disappoint! It’s a medium weight serum that sinks into the skin beautifully.  I’ve already noticed an improvement in the look of my skin.  My skin looks a bit brighter & the tone is more even.  Some fine lines on my forehead have started to soften as well.  I have blemish prone skin & this didn’t cause any breakouts or irritation.  It’s really nice to find a high quality product that isn’t expensive & lives up to its claims.  I also love that it’s a vegan product and part of the Clean at Sephora lineup.  All around this is a great product if you’re looking for a gentle anti aging serum that won’t break the bank. Awesome Gentle Serum
