I received a sample size complimentary through Influenster. I would say the Sephora serum is an okay product, definitely not my favorite. The consistency is a little weird compared to other serums I use it does well with keeping your face hydrated. I just prefer the serum I already use more over this one. Just doesnâ€™t keep my face glowing and refreshed like other serums. Face Serum
