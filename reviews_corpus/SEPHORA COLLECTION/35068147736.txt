I got this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review. I have combination oily skin and decided to try this peel mask once a week. I started to see some of my large pores reduce in size after the first 2 weeks. I finally starting to use it 2x a week then noticed my dark spots and blemishes went down quicker than other products I’ve used before!! I’m truly impressed with the ingredients and texture of this product nan
