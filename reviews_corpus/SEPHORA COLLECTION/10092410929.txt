after using for a week i kinda didnâ€™t see a big difference in my under eyes as i would of liked but i saw a slight difference which was a little bit brighter under the eye & it felt very hydrating as well. i did appreciate the no fragrance to the product but it did smell like plastic probably from the packaging decent
