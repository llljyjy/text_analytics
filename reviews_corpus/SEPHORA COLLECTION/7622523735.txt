My first impression Of this product was that I love the packaging. The scent smells very clean and fresh, not too strong and not too subtle either. The texture is very watery and tacky so I like to put it on before putting on makeup to act as a “primer”. My skin type is oily so when using this product it didn’t make my skin too oily. It made it feel hydrated and glowy. I’ve noticed my skin has gotten more glowy but in a good way. The product ingredients are good for me. I would buy this in the future and recommend trying it out for yourself. Love it!
