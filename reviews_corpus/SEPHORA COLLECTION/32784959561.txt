Love this mask! I use it all the time, and wake up with soft, hydrated lips. It smells amazing, and the vanilla scent is really subtle, which I love because it’s not overwhelming while I’m trying to sleep like some brands are. My only problem with this product is that it’s more watery then I would prefer, and because of this it occasionally slides around instead of just staying where I apply it. Other then that I love it, and still definitely a good buy. Love this Mask, a Little Bit Watery, but Great
