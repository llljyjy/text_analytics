I was recommended this product when I wanted to find a dupe for the Caudlie item I had been using for the dryness on my face. This product has not only helped with my dryness, but it also leaves your skin glowy (not greasy looking). I don’t wear makeup, but if you’re doing a natural day, put this under your moisturizer and suncreen and you will be looking fantastic. Buy if you want glowy skin and less dryness
