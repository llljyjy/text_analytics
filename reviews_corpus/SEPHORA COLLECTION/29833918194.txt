This product was gifted for a review! I am a huge skincare junkie and always looking for new brands and products to try. I do have to say, I like the way this mask is formulated. My skin is pretty sensitive and cannot handle AHA/BHA on for a very long time. I usually treat most AHA/BHA products as a wash off product but since this one is instructed to wash off, it worked nicely! nan
