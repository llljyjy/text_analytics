I honestly haven’t noticed a difference with this :( I guess it moisturizes fine, soaks into the skin within a couple minutes but does not brighten these tired nurses eyes! I think it’s probably a good eye cream if you’re just looking for a bit of extra hydration but in my opinion, it’s not good for anything else unfortunately, there are other products that actually make a noticeable difference to dark circles and de-puffing so I’ll be sticking to those! Nothing special
