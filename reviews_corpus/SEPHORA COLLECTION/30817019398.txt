Iâ€™ve recently adapted a more plant-forward lifestyle and was looking for a vegan skincare line. I have super sensitive skin, so it was important to find a clean brand... without breaking the bank! I loved this bakuchiol serum as part of my nighttime routine - it reduced some of the lines especially under my eyes. Great vegan line!
