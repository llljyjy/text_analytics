I am so disappointed I love coconut so I had to try everything they make coconut and this is bad. The package is cute I love it but definitely not worth what’s inside I’m sad to say this is like chapsticks makes my lips super dry and chapped. I am not returning tho I just threw it out or give it to my mom. I hope the formula changes soon not sure…
