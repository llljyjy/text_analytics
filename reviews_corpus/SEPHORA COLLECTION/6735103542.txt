This is my first time using lip balm from Sephora brand. I wouldn’t say it’s the best lip balm, there are couple other brands that I like more. This one is kind of chalky and I don’t think it does the job its supposed to do.  Has a light smell. It gives your lips nice pinkish color, but I don’t think I would repurchase it. nan
