This is a good affordable (and eco-friendly!) moisturizer! I have combination skin with an oily T-zone and I have come to realize that when I use products geared towards dry skin- ESPECIALLY when hyaluronic acid is the key ingredient- my oils are almost nonexistent! The texture of this is creamy but not in a super thick way, it’s very lightweight and goes into the skin and doesn’t leave a slick trace behind at all! My favorite thing about this product is actually how green it is! It’s vegan, but I love that over 40% of the plastic used in the tube itself is recycled and the cardboard packaging is sustainably sourced! Another plus is that it’s unscented! I’ve been keeping this in my purse since this winter has been really harsh on my skin and I truly love the results it’s given so far! All for an affordable and definitely worth it $17! Affordable, clean, green and it works!
