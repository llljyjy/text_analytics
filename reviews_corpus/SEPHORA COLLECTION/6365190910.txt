Such a great moisturizer for everyday, I’ve been using it in the morning before makeup. It’s not very thick, it’s creamy and smooth and gives you the right amount of moisture. I have dry - normal skin and it works well for me. Personally the only thing I dislike is the smell. It is unscented but it doesn’t smell great. Great for everyday
