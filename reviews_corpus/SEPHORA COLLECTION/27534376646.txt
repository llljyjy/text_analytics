This serum got a very watery consistency, it absorbs fast and feels comfortable. I use it at night before bed by itself, not following with any other product (my skin type is oily). It leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized enough. This serum is very gentle, so the longer I use it the clearer my skin gets. It definitely adds glow, slowly exfoliates and makes skin tone look even. Iâ€™ve tried a sample and purchased a full size already! Glowy skin
