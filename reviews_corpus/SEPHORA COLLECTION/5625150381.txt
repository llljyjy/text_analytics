I have super sensitive skin, that does get oily, and this cleanser is really great to use morning or evening. It contains probiotics which is calming, to my skin in particular. Cost-effective, & fragrance free which is great. Only thing I kind of wish is that it lathers a tad bit more. But I do love it! Good find! Would re- purchase and recommend! ✌️ Super gentle and effective for sensitive skin
