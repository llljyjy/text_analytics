I definitely wanted to love this especially with the affordability of this product. Unfortunately it is more like rubbing slime on my face than a melting cleansing balm. It is very thick and didnâ€™t even take off my non waterproof mascara. Definitely disappointing as I was hoping this could replace my other stuff but this was sadly a miss. wanted to love this
