Hydration, glowing skin, feeling good! I really enjoyed using this serum. My face has been craving a quality vitamin c serum that absorbs nicely and I think I found a winner!It did not leave my skin sticky and thankfully did not have a gross, long lasting smell like others have that Iâ€™ve tried.Yay for this product and I will be buying it in the full size! Love!
