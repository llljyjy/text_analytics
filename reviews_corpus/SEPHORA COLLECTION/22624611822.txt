I have been using Targeted Pores Serum from Sephora for a while now and I can confidently say all high quality products don’t have to be expensive.This serum comes in small glass bottle with a dropper which makes application easy. It is also fragrance free which a big pros for people sensitive to fragrances. The serum is neither too thick nor thin. It gets absorbed into the skin well leaving it moisturised and glowly. Used it twice a day with moisturizer and I definitely see my pores shrunk. My skin looks healthy even and pores less visible. Looking forward to see my skin even toned with no pores which I believe I’ll see soon. Visible reduction in pores
