The rollerball stays cold even if I donâ€™t put this in the fridge and it feels wonderful first thing in the morning before I do my skin care. The textured end is great for releasing tension in my sinus areas and I also have been using it to give my lips a bit of a plumping effect before putting on balm as prep for lipstick. Perfectly for a bit of self-care
