Pretty good! It is not super irritating and has this cooling feeling even after you wash it off. I use it once a week and I think is a good way to get the deep icky stuff out of my skin from wearing makeup all week, giving this great deep clean feeling. I also have super dry skin and this is one of the few resurfacing type masks that doesnâ€™t dry my skin out super bad. I will for sure buy again once I run out! great mask, will buy again
