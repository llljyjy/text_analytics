This serum is great! I applied it as my first layer after cleansing daily and the consistency was hydrating and smoothing for my face. I notice that my dark spots have faded away quite a bit, and I have been using this only for a few weeks. I would recommend trying this to target hyperpigmentation along with other products you may already have in your routine. nan
