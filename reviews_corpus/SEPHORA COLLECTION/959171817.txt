I am so impressed! I have been using Kiehls for a long time but it was not always giving enough hydration. This cream feels light on the skin but also your skin feels happy and not tight. I use it only at night about 2x a week because I also use tretinoin on other nights. I cannot comment how it wears during the day or under makeup because I have never used it this way. I am very happy with this cream, especially considering the price... I mean...it is nothing fancy but does exactly what I need it to do.  I will be repurchasing. Impressed!
