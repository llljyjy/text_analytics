I love trying clean, inexpensive products, and trying the Targeted Pores Serum from the Sephora Collection was no disappointment. After several uses, my skin feels clear, soft, and my pores are noticeably smaller. This goes to show that you donâ€™t have to pay a lot of money for a quality product. nan
