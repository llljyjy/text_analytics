I recently got to try Sephora’s new Nourishing Moisturizer and I’m glad I have this because I honestly probably would’ve never tried it. It’s really moisturizing but doesn’t leave me too oily/greasy which was something I was nervous about. The fragrance isn’t strong which is great because certain ones irritate me. nan
