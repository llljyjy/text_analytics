I have had extremely sensitive skin my entire life, add to that 2 years ago I was diagnosed with rosacea. So it’s even worse now! I gave this Sephora Nourishing Moisturizer with Prebiotics a try and it is my new standard! I have had no negative reaction at all and tons of positive! It is moisturizing without clogging. After using this, my skin feels so happy!! For the reviewers that said it is not moisturizing enough for them - I find that this works good for me when I use a different moisturizer twice a week. I can’t use the other moisturizer all the time or else I’ll break out with acne, and this one alone was not enough moisture. So what I do is use this regularly and one or two days a week I’ll use another moisturizer when I go to bed at night. All fixed! Now I’m just perfect. Hope this helps someone. FABULOUS!!
