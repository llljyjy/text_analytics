The best sheet mask from Sephora Collection. I usually tan easy but when I’ve forgotten to reapply sunscreen and unfortunately burn, this is the best to have on hand to put on after getting out of the shower. Each time I’ve taken the chest part off it’s been bone dry because my skin has absorbed it all so it’s definitely have helped in putting off peeling and doesn’t make putting makeup on after a day out in the sun feel like a miserable chore. Pro tip - keep in the fridge for some extra relief. Stock up before the summer
