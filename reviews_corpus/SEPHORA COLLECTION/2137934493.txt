Clean skin gel is a nice clean feeling face wash! It doesn’t leave any residue after I wash my face and it doesn’t dry out my skin either. It takes off my makeup easily and is great for everyday skincare especially when I’m on the go. Price point is also nice for the value and probiotics! Easy face wash that takes off makeup!
