I’ve used regular leg shaving razors on my face and they made me break out in terrible acne and I’ve tried those hyped up Tinkle razors and they didn’t actually remove my peach fuzz, so I was skeptical of the Sephora brand ones, but the Sephora razors are amazing.  These remove all of my peach fuzz and slough off any dead/dry skin that I have on my face and do not break me out at all.  You just have to be very careful with them and use the right pressure and angles or they can definitely cut into your skin. Love these
