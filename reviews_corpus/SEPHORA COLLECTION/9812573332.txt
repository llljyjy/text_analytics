Like many of the review say, the packaging for this is not good. The pump is hard to push down so you end up doing it too hard & getting the product all over. I usually cup my hand to avoid wasting any product. This serum itself is so good! I really hope they just change the packaging but keep the product itself. It is very light & doesnâ€™t leave my skin feeling too weighed down. I have acne prone, dry skin & I love it! Great product, terrible packaging.
