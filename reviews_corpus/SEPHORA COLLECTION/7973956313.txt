I have been using this for over a week and I have been loving it. It applies nicely onto my dry skin, is fast absorbing, and doesn’t it doesn’t have a strong smell. I have also noticed how this product is slowly clearing up my skin. It’s also amazing how this product is vegan and at an affordable price. I’m excited to see the long term results! Loving it!
