This was my first quartz roller and, initially, I didnâ€™t know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised though! For the price and size of the product, I really like it! The smaller size actually fits better to the contours of my face and I very much enjoy using this as part of my daily routine. Simple, useful, effective
