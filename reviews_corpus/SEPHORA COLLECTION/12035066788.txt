i’m usually not an eye cream person unless it has retinol. i’ve heard caffeine does well for the under eyes too so i’m giving this one a chance. it’s hard to tell if it’s working, eye creams are one of those products where you don’t exactly know if it’s making a difference or not, you just gotta hope you for the best for your future. i would mind this one, especially for the price point. it’s nice to have in your routine, but not a must. nan
