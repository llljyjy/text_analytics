I’ve recently been struggling with acne scars on my face and decided to give this serum a try. After about a week of use, I’ve noticed a huge difference, my face looks and feels so much brighter! I especially love that this serum is vegan, Clean at Sephora, and affordable, remember that quality does NOT have to be expensive! This serum is definitely a new staple in my skincare routine, 10/10 product! nan
