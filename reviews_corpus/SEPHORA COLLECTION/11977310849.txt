I have dark spots on my cheeks, chin, and forehead so I really like using this serum as a last step in my night routine. I haven’t noticed a difference yet since I’ve only been using this for a week, but it is really moisturizing and doesn’t make me breakout like a lot of products do plus it’s a good price. Excited to see the results over time! nan
