I received the Ultra Glow Serum: Glow + Strengthen Vitamin C Serum complimentary for my honest review. I have combination skin and I love a good serum. I’ve started using them more and more as I get older. I like that this one has vitamin E and C in the ingredients. The scent is very light and not fragrant at all. After using it my skin felt moisturized. I’m sure that after a while you should see some change in your skin, but the texture is a little runny for my liking. It runs through my fingers when I try to put it on. Ultra Glow Serum: Glow + Strengthen Vitamin C
