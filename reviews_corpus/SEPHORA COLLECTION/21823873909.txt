Received as a free gift from sophora collection in exchange of my honest review. It’s very gentle gel which cleanses so well and does not dry out my skin or leave it oily. It lathers very well, cleans super clean, rinses easily and has a nice subtle scent. My face is so smooth and SOFT to the touch and my skin look healthy. Quality doesn’t have to be expensive, this is great cleanser as such affordable price. gentle cleanser
