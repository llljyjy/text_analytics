I have been using these masks for years and I absolutely loved them for a fun extra step in my skincare routine. However, the last couple times Iâ€™ve tried them (coconut and watermelon), my face started stinging and turning red immediately upon putting on the mask. Not sure if they changed the formula, but super disappointed that a long-time fav no longer works for me :( nan
