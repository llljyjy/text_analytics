This vegan serum is really good at hydrating your skin while reducing the appearance of lines. My complexion looks considerably more youthful and smoother. Plus, this serum evens out my skin tone. I think this formulation works best if you use a few drops on completely dry skin. Itâ€™s priced really well, and a little goes a long way! Anti Aging and Incredibly Hydrating!
