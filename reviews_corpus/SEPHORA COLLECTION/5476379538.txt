Sad to say I will be returning these to the store for a different wipe.  The rose wipes smell awful. I’ve purchased various “flavors“ of these over the years and have never had this issue before.  The wipes themselves have always been one of my favorite Sepora products.Perhaps there was a change in for formula? This only applies to the Rose variety
