This serum was very effective in reducing my dark spots and hyperpigmentation from my acne scars. In a few weeks it really made a difference. My spots are noticeably lighter. It has a nice milky consistency that feels smooth on the skin. I feel a little tingle whenever I use it but it’s not too strong just makes me feel like it’s those enzymes working! Great for dark skin and hyperpigmentation
