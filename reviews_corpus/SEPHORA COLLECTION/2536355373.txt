Purchase both the matcha and grapefruit masks. As someone very sensitive to scent, both were light and didn’t linger on the skin after. That’s about where the positives end. The Matcha mask-meant to help purify skin and pores-left my skin feeling like there was a heavy wax on it after washing off. An hour later it hadn’t settled into my skin and I had to wash my face again from scratch to get it to somewhat come off. Maybe that’s what you want to happen with a moisturizing mask, but not one meant to clean excess junk out of your skin. Didn’t want to try the grapefruit after that experience and took them back to Sephora Don’t believe the hype matcha+grapefruit versions
