I’ve been using this product twice a day for about a week and a half now. I feel like I need to use it a little bit longer to truly notice some change. But I love the consistency that it gives. It looks milky almost, it goes on very smoothly. Directions say to use on dry skin but I personally use while my face is slightly moist because I want it to soak into my skin.I love that it’s vegan and CLEAN because I’m always concerned about what product I’m putting on my face. And the price point is very reasonable! You don’t need to spend an outrageous about for quality products! Overall I’d use again
