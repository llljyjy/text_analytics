I use this cream every time I dermaplane my face. It works perfectly! I now have a smooth face with minimal blemishes and dark spots. Do wash this off somewhat quickly though, especially if you have sensitive skin. The first few times that I used this, I didnâ€™t wash it off fast enough and ended up breaking out. Otherwise wonderful though! Wonderful Hydration Shot!
