I really like this lip balm for an affordable option! It leaves my lips nice & soft. It has a waxier texture so it stays on for a really long time! The only thing Iâ€™m not loving is that the cardboard tube gets damaged/dirty pretty easily. Even removing the seal tore off a lot of the pretty design. Such a bummer for an otherwise great product! great other than packaging!
