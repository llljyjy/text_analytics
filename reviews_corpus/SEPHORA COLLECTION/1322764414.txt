I have a few supplement cases and this is my favorite for everyday use. It’s not clunky and fits in smaller purses. It comes with multiple compartments that it allows me to carry my daily essentials. The color is pretty and it doesn’t get dirty easily. The tabs stay lock while still remaining easy to open. I’ve brought it with me on trips and it works great but keep in mind it does not hold much so don’t expect it to carry everything all the time. Great for Daily Essentials
