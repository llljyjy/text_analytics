Obsessed with this lip balm. It’s the perfect color that is pigmented enough, but doesn’t compromise the balm effect. It’s hydrating and is super affordable at only $7. Great to throw into your purse and the packaging is cute, too. Only downside is it requires reapplication, but it’s a balm so it’s expected. Easy for on-the-go!
