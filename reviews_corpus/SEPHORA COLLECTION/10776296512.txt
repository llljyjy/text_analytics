This is my first sephora collection product and it did not disappoint.  I always look for the “clean at sephora“ label when shopping and this one is also clean.  It is made with 98% natural ingredients.   There is no scent.  It is a nice, thorough,  gentle clean.  This gel is thin but powerful.   It works great. Super gentle clean!
