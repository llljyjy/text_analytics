THIS IS A QUALITY PRODUCT, WITHOUT THE COST OF A QUALITY PRODUCT IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. I WISH THIS PRODUCT HAD A SMALL FRAGRANCE, BUT I DON’T MIND THAT IT DOESN’T. I HAVE USED THIS A FEW TIMES AND I CAN ALREADY FEEL IT WORKING. I PREFER TO USE THIS AT NIGHT. IT MAKES MY SKIN A LITTLE MORE SENSITIVE, SO IT IS BEST TO WEAR SUNSCREEN (WHICH WILL ALSO PREVENT YOU DARK MARKS FROM GETTING WORSE). I ENJOY THE PRODUCT TEXTURE AND I PLAN TO RE-PURCHASE. nan
