This product was 100% worth every penny. The serum is nice and thick going on, but it easily smooths out and isn’t heavy. I love that it’s made with clean ingredients and vegan. Even the packaging is sustainable! I’m always afraid inexpensive things will be poor quality, but this serum is high quality. Perfect for treating dark spots! I’d highly recommend! nan
