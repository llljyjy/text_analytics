I love buying Sephora products because they are so affordable. This one in particular has some amazing ingredients which are known yo work on dark spots. I so wanted to try this serum because I have HIP. Even though Iâ€™ve only been using it for two weeks, I see a difference on my dark spots or sun spots on my forehead. I love that his formula is Vegan, Clean. Scented or perfume free! It did not irritate my skin at all. I recommend. affordable and effective
