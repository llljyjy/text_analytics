This product was compatible with my dry, sensitive skin. I am not sure if my skin glows (from the vitamin c), but I definitely feel the effects of the vitamin e giving my face more of a lush feel. The texture of this oil is also great, it absorbs into the skin and doesnâ€™t leave an oily residue. nan
