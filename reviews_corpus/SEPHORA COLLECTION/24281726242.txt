I am surprised this product is not popular. It’s amazing. When I bought this, I wasn’t expecting much from it. It was an inexpensive product and thought I would just try it out. But it shows results after just one use. I apply it at night and in the morning my skin is very smooth and ‘porcelain’ like. I have a very dry and textured skin and I was pleasantly surprised at the results. I have only been using it for 4 days so I cannot comment on the ‘anti-blemish’ claim, but it definitely firms up the skin and makes it smooth. I absolutely love this. As mentioned in other reviews the pump is not that smooth. It squirts out the serum. However, after using it a couple of times you get used to it and learn to work with it. Honestly, at this price point it doesn’t matter to me at all. I will probably update once I finish the bottle and see if blemishes have reduced. I not surprised to see this out of stock but I hope Sephora re-stocks it soon and keeps the price low. A surprisingly good product at this price point!
