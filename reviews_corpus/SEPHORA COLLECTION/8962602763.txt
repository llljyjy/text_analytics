This was a good serum for traveling when I didn’t want to risk my luxury vitamin C products. I’m thankful to Influencer for providing a free sample to test and review and after enjoying the product, this would be a good option for someone just getting into skincare. It was fragrance free and gentle on my skin. Lightweight so ideal for all skin types - even oily. Because I was only provided a sample, I cannot comment on longterm effects; however, buyers beware of vitamin C serums sold in clear glass containers as light affects the efficacy and shelf life of vit c.
