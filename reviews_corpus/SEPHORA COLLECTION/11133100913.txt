This is my first time trying a Sephora branded serum and I’m impressed. It has a really nice texture that absorbs nicely into my skin. It also has a pleasant scent to it. The price is pretty affordable too. I haven’t used it for really long to know exactly how well my pores shrink. However, I can tell a slight difference from when I started using this. nan
