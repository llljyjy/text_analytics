This may be a different opinion compared to the many others who have bought this face wash, but I didn’t love it. I have repurchased it twice because it is a good simple face wash for sensitive skin, but after using other face washes I don’t like how this one washes my skin. It doesn’t lather much and doesn’t give me that “clean” feeling that i love after i’ve washed my face. It has a slimey texture, but honestly the product does what it needs to do and works well. I just have other face cleansers that I prefer more. Not My Favourite
