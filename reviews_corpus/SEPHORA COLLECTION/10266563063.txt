Love these! SO hydrating (I have dry skin, and I’ve been beaching all summer long) and doesn’t break me out afterwards. It smells great, works well with dry skin. I do genuinely think it helped me stave off a mild sunburn once. I started putting these in my bag for every vacation, and as gifts for my friends :) I def recommend, especially for the price point! def recommend, especially for the price
