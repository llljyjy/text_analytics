i bought this as an afterthought in line bc the price was great and it smelled delicious. ive been using it for about 4 months (and still haven’t run out.) i noticed recently that my acne scars and hyperpigmentation have lightened up SO much, and i was confused bc i wasn’t actively using anything to target it… then i realized it was this!! i love that there’s no alcohol so it doesn’t dry my skin out, and that it never stings even though there’s fragrance. a great $6 investment <3 will repurchase passion fruit B3 ❤️
