I have sensitive skin and this hasn’t broken me out so far, It’s really lightweight like a slightly thicker water and It really works wonders. It’s great for oily skin, I love the feel and the glow with out looking oily especially I’ve noticed my T Zone is not as oily. I really recommend this product. I usually use this morning and night because I apply my moisturizer above it. This is a vegan clean product and you can find it on sephora !! Love it
