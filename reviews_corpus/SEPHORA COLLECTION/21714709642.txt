A lovely addition to the facial and body massage tools I’ve been enjoying trying out on myself and my partner as we have various aches and pains with having to sit around working on our computers day in day out. This facial tool had been on my radar for a while and I grabbed it as soon as I saw this go on sale and it is really a great 2 in 1 facial massage delight. You can easily use this before or after any part of your skincare routine or as a stand alone tool just to get the tension out of the face. Massage tools come pretty expensive so I can’t even knock this for being a little squeaky (as metal on metal would be) as it has just the right amount of heft to it to feel like it is doing something without having to press down on the skin. Great relaxing tool
