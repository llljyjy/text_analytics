I like this product. I feel it does a good job but of course you have to double cleanse. It is not the best at removing mascara but many cleansing oils or balms still leave you a little or residue so you need to go with a second cleanser. Overall, good price and good amount of products. I wouldnâ€™t buy it again because there are many options to try out and it was not amazing. Good for the price
