Okay so here is the rundown on this product: If you’re looking for a luxurious cleansing balm that breaks down makeup really well and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and clean after one cleanse, this isn’t the product for you. HOWEVER, for the price along with the amount of product you get, it is a decent product. I use it to remove my makeup after a night out and always follow with a second cleanse. My skin feels very clean and makeup free after! Does it have a nice smell and feel luxurious on my face? No. But it’s honestly a great bang for your buck and I’ll probably buy it again because it hasn’t broken me out! Overall rating: 4/5 Not AMAZING, but GOOD!
