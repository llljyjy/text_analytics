I have oily, acne prone, sensitive skin. I have been using only this cleanser for a week and I’m very happy with it. It’s short period of time but you can see how my skin is slowly clearing out. Consistency is very smooth and very gentle on the skin, doesn’t dry the skin and leave it very smooth and moisturized. And it’s only $10, you can’t beat it! Worth it
