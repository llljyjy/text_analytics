So I was really excited to try this cleanser because I have never used a gel cleanser before. At first, it was going pretty well. I mean nothing too crazy. However, after continuous use, my skin started to have a negative reaction to it and it broke my skin out along my left side of my face including my eyelid. Itâ€™s unfortunate because I really wanted to like it, but I had to stop using it for that reason. I posted a before and after picture to show what happened. Not For Sensitive Skin
