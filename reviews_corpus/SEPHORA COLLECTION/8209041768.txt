I wish I could give this a 0 star review. I have used this lip balm religiously for years. I recently ran out and went to buy more (4 to be exact). When I opened it I realized the formula had been changed and itâ€™s horrendous. It does not go on smoothly, it does not moisturize my lips the same way and to boot is has a disgusting taste. A complete waste of my money. Bring back the old formula. Do not buy this product! Waste of money!
