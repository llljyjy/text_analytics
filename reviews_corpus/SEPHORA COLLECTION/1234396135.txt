I bought this on a whim as an aside to some other products, not thinking too much about it other than knowing how much I like Sephora Collection quality (and the price tag!)... turned out to be the star item in my order! I recently had an infection on top of my nose that left some hyperpigmentation and scarring, and with each use of this cream it gets a little lighter. It also leaves my skin butter soft, got rid of a bunch of milia and uneven texture along my jawline from another bad product, and overall it just works! I’ve been using it every other day without any issue and feel like my skin is now “maintained“ if you will. Give it a try! Really helps!
