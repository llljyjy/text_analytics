I have been buying this eye cream for years. It was thick, and moisturized all day. When I washed my face at 10:00pm after putting this on at 6:00am, I could feel it coming off because it stayed on so long. They have changed the formula and packaging from the full white container and it is a HUGE difference. The cream is now very thin. It absorbs well, fine, but it doesnâ€™t feel like its moisturizing a fraction as much as the last cream..What happened, Sephora? This used to be my favourite product. I will now be looking for a new eye cream that actually moisturizes. NEW FORMULA?!!
