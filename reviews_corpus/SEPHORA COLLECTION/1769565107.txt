So I have dark circles with the majority of it being in the inner corner with purple undertones. I haven’t been getting lots of restful sleep so you can imagine they’ve been extra dark recently.  I started using this eye cream 2x a day after my moisturizer. Since starting this eye cream I’ve noticed more of a moisturized, plumped, glowy and overall brighter effect. It sits well under my makeup and helps with concealer creasing. I rate it an 8.5/10. Moisturizing, plumping, glowy and overall brighter
