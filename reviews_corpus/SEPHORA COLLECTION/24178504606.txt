I bought it during spring sale event, and not regretting it, was using FAB collagen cream and skin was feeling tight and dry  sometimes (not always).this really is a nice moisturizer and  affordable too, i  have combination skin so till now in this weather its not oily at all....canâ€™t say will be the same in summer too..but will recommend to someone with combo skin. nice, affordable moisturizer
