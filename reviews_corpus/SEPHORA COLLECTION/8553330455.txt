It seems like good serum but I haven’t been able to enjoy its benefits. My skin is really dehydrated and dry. When I use this product, it feels like it quenches the thirst of my skin as it gets absorbed well and it’s not overly sticky.Unfortunately, I find myself not reaching for this serum because it is such a hassle to use!!! It’s like the dispensing pump has its own mind : it ramdomly decides when it’s gonna work (which is like after pumping 10x or more) and if it’s working, the liquid just flies around everywhere, so a lot of product loss!!! It’s really annoying, I guess you get what your paid for... which is a shame because it seems like it could really be a good product. I hope they eventually change the packaging, but I guess it won’t be this cheap then. Anyway, I won’t bother repurchase this. You'll definitely have a raging fit using this
