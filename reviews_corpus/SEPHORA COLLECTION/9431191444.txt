I’ve never had cooling wands before so I can’t compare to other alternatives but these are so pretty and they feel so good on my face. I put them in the fridge and they are cold enough to massage my face for a quite a while. Only thing I will say is that I am very careful with them bc I’m scared to drop them bc they feel a bit delicate so pretty, fun shape
