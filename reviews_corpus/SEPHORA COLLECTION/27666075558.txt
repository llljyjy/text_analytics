Living in MN in the winter is definitely a struggle for my skin. I’m super careful what I put in my face since my skin is super sensitive. After trying this cleansing twice a day I’ve noticed a difference right away. My skin is super soft and not dry at all. I love that it’s super affordable . I also love the ingredients   Natural Prebiotics and Natural Aloe Vera. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great cleanser. Best Gel Cleanser
