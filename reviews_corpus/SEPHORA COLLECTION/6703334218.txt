I have been searching for the perfect eye cream and I think this is the one! I love the consistency and texture of this product, it like a gel/cream and is very light compared to other brands I have used. The quality is amazing for this price, especially with it being vegan and clean at Sephora! The container is a lot smaller than I expected, but a tiny bit goes a long way. Much better than paying over twice the price for a high end brand. Small but mighty!
