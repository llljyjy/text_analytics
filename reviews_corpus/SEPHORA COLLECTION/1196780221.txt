These are a great way to reduce consumption of traditional cotton pads. So far, these have done a great job. They’re about 75% larger than most cotton pads so you get more surface area. I use different areas of each pad for make up remover, micro water and then toner. I go through a pad a day, so at the end of the week I throw it in the mesh bag, launder it, and then start anew. My pads do have some permanent stains from eye makeup removal, but they are laundered, so it’s more of a superficial thing. Definitely wash the pads before your first use. I’m so glad I got these, after a few weeks, I’ve saved money and so long as these continue to perform as well as they do, I don’t see myself going back to traditional disposable cotton pads.
