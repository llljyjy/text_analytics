Sephora gifted me this product to try out and I have loved using it. This cleanser feels so good on the skin and leaves my skin so clean and glowy. It gently exfoliates my skin while not irritating it. I really do love this cleanser and for the price, it is truly amazing. Highly recommend. LOVE this cleanser!
