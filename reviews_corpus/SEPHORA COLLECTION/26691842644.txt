This nourishing moisturizer is really thick and rich cream but it’s very lightweight.. This cream makes my dry and sensitive skin feels hydrated without feeling greasy or oily.. It’s not matte not also shiny but I kinda feel like with just a little light reflect on your skin it will create a little glow to make you look fresh and feel  beautiful.. This product is also fragrance free,  vegan and clean.. I’ve been using this for one week now and so far no irritation.. Great for my Dry and sensitive skin!
