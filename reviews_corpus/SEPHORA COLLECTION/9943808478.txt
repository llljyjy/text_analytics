First thing to note (not mentioned on the box) is that it doesnâ€™t say how often to use. I have sensitive combo skin, and I recommend a light layer once a week. I think over time, I could increase to 2x but for now sticking with one. Noticing a visible difference after a few weeks! Great mask, hard to beat the price
