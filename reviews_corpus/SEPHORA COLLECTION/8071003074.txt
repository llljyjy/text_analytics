I am not a fan of the clarisonic or other harsh brushes like this.  Finger tips work fine, there is no need to cause micro tears in the skin by using brushes like this or washes with scrubby beads.  This is a no go for me.  I received it free, and itâ€™s still in the box, unopened No need to scrub the face this harshly
