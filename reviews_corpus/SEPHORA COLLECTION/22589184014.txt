I assumed it would be a great buy but it was horribly dry. After 3 tries, I looked up ways to add some life back to them and even then there was no hope. It was a great try by Sephora but this one was a flop. I’ll still give it two stars because doctoring it with other hydration things are fun..but the product itself is dry and didn’t hydrate at all. In short, sis can not stand on her own. SIS CANNOT STAND ON HER OWN.
