This is the most beautiful lip balm I’ve had in quite some time. It gives just a nice color added to your natural lips, and it’s definitely very nourishing to add on top of it! It’s super affordable for anyone at a nice price of $7, and they have a variety of different shades! Be sure to check this out if you’re in need of a balm that nourishes and makes your lips look great! Going to keep this in my bag for everyday use! nan
