It felt really sturdy on and felt promising, unfortunately when you rip it off theres not much of a pull (which is good if you have sensitive skin and don’t want it to necessarily snag your skin) but because it doesn’t have a pull it doesn’t take much out. Yes it kinda worked in the end, however there wasn’t much on the strip when I looked, if anything a bunch of raised little white spots were on my nose after. So although it definitely worked by raising them out, I had to manually try to squeeze the rest out and wash my face but it felt like they just got stuck raised underneath since they weren’t exactly all pulled out. I’m not mad though, because I only got it to score free shipping, but I’ll probably look for a different cheapie next time. not the best but not the worst
