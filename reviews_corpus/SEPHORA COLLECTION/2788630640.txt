My first ever review, because this product deserves it!! So light (but very moisturizing still), absorbs instantly and leave a somewhat matte/dewy effect that last all day. I tend to breakout instantly when my skin doesn’t like something, and so far no reactions whatsoever. And the price point…. Can’t be beat!! I’ve always used much more expensive creams but decided to try to save some money on skincare and have this a try! No regrets!! amazing product
