This product has definitely changed my skincare regimen! I’ve been needing anti aging skincare products to add to my skincare because I’ve been noticing some fine lines on my forehead. I’ve used this for about a few days now and there are a few things I love about this product. Firstly, the texture is very milky and nice which I love because I know my face is hydrated. Secondly, this is a vegan and clean product and super inexpensive. Thirdly, this product does work! I’ve been seeing less fine lines on my forehead after a couple uses. My new love
