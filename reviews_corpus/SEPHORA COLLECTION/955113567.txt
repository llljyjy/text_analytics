I haven’t used a facial massage product before and wanted to give this a try since my face can be puffy in the morning sometimes. I don’t care for the shape on my face for massage, feels like maybe it’s too big, too much hardness. I thought about returning but I tried it on the back of my neck for massage - I really liked that and can see using it on my husband to give him a back massage or working out any soreness/tightness on my body. Better use on body for me
