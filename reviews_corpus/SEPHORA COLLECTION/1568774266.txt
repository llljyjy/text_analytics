This cleanser leaves my skin deeply cleansed but not stripped which is very important for me since my skin is more on a dry side.  I like to keep in the shower and use it in my PM routine to make sure everything is removed makeup dirt pollution... a little goes a long way. Combo and oily skin can use this in the morning as well. Affordable and I love the tube packaging. Deep cleansing!
