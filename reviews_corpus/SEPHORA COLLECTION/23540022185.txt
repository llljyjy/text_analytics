I’m so excited to try sephora collection skin care as it’s my first time using it. This is received free by Sephora collection. To be honest, it didn’t pass my expectations. I thought this would be a serum that’ll gives you glow and pore minimizing but as of now I haven’t notice any change at all. It also stings whenever i put them on, not good for sensitive skin. Clean but stings!
