I love this mask. It smells like grapefruit and does itâ€™s job. I use this once a week to brighten my skin and give it a little pep during winter months. It goes on light. It has tiny scrubbers in it as well. Your face will tingle a smidge and feel a cool sensation. Once done your face will feel squeaky clean without feeling dry and my skin is dry right now. Good mask and budget friendly my second tube
