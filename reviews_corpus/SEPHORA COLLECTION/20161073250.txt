I read several reviews for different facial razors and this one is the best rated.  It’s a bit more of an investment up front, but the quality is worth it.  I had never shaved my face before and wanted to try as I have quite a bit of peach fuzz in front of my ear and down my jaw.  This was an easy tool to use and I liked the weight of the metal.  As other reviewers said, hold at a 45 degree angle to the face.  Don’t go over an area too many times as this can leave your skin red and irritated.  Recommend! Good Quality & Value
