Nourishing moisturizer is exactly that!! My skin is extremely sensitive and I have a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn’t exasperate the sensitivity. I haven’t had any negative reactions or active breakouts with this product. I feel so supple and plump afterwards too! Would reccomend. Supple and plump
