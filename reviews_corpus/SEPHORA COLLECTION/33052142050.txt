i received this product complimentary from influenster. i really want to love this product but perhaps it’s the packaging from the sample size received that i dislike because it comes out so fast and wastes product. very runny and thin which isn’t necessarily a bad thing with proper packaging but my sensitive skin also feels kinda greasy after using it. not sure if it’s where in my routine i apply it that makes it greasy but it is nice if you want a simple serum. i probably won’t be repurchasing. it's alright
