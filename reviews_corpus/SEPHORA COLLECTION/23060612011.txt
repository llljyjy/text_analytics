This cream is super lightweight yet very very hydrating!! I’ve never tried anything from Sephora collection and I’m glad this is the first thing I’ve picked up from them :). I’ve tried $80 eye creams that don’t do squat and I pretty much just thought eye cream was a scam UNTIL I tried this one. I’ve been using it for a month and my under eye are is noticeably brighter ( I wish I took pictures but I didn’t have that much faith!! ). Would recommend! I'm a picky gorl but this? chefs kiss.
