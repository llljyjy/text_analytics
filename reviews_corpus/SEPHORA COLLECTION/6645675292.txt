I experience pilling regardless of the product I use before this. I have a pretty simple nighttime routine: gentle toner, hyaluronic acid and retinol. I regularly use FAB ultra repair cream and versed dew point gel-cream, and used to use Cera Ve. None of those have had any pilling ever with the other products but this one ALWAYS pills.  I am probably going to return it. On a positive note it has a good consistency and is gentle and I don’t think I have experienced acne from it, but o can’t stand the pilling pills like crazy!
