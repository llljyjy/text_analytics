Not good for oily skin or someone who wear foundation. It doesn’t emulsify very well and it leaves a film no matter how much I rinse. I was hoping it was similar to The Farmacy cleansing balm but it’s not even close. Definitely don’t recommend for anyone who wants a makeup remover with oily skin Leaves a film, doesn’t emulsify completely
