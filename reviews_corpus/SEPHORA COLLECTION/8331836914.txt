It took some time to see results and I’m really happy that I stayed with it. I’ve been using the grande lash serum for my lashes and I got the common side effect of redness around the skin of my eyes. It got really bad so I decided to use this to see if it’ll help restore and brighten the delicate skin around my eyes and it worked! It’s very gentle, and considering how damaged the skin barrier around my eyes was, i’m thankful I didn’t get a reaction from this cream. It significantly reduced the redness and I’m waiting for it to come back in stock so I can order my second one. Give it a try, you’ll should see results in a couple weeks (coming from my experience)! nan
