If I was just rating the cherry lip balm, it would be an easy 5 stars! Obsessed. The colour gives your lips this perfect cherry flush and the formula is super comfortable and hydrating. Love the scent. However, I also purchased the watermelon and it has almost no tint at all, which was a bummer. And the rose “lip scrub“ (be sure to read the bottom of each tube to know what you are getting) is, in no universe, a lip scrub. I actually don’t understand why it’s labelled as such because it’s really just a balm with some itty bitty grains in it--you don’t even feel them. Hopefully this helps you order what you want with confidence! Mixed success depending on the colour
