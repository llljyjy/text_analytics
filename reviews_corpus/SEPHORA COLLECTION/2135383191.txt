This is a nice and gentle exfoliater. You only feel the scrubbing from the stick when you put it on. This product REALLY shines after the exfoliation. It’s SO creamy and moisturizing. The last few months I’ve been on a lip binge and who’d have thought this inexpensive product would be the best of them all! The only thing that really comes close to Laniege. WOW, Impressed.
