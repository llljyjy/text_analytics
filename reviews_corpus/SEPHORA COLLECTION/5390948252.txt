I’m a woman of color with melanin production/combination of sun damage/aging skin I really need something to help me with all these new spots appearing on my face. But I wanted to go with something natural and not irritating or harsh on the skin as I’m trying to recover not add to a problem. What drew me to this serum is again it’s a unscented serum, formulated with a three percent concentration of enzymes and kombucha, that targets and reduces the look of dark spots and pigmentation. First time trying kombucha in skincare so I can’t wait to see the full results! This formula is also Clean and Vegan. This product is found at an amazing price for what it really is. Quality never has to be expensive with the Sephora Skincare Brand! nan
