It’s very ok. I think the people who love this haven’t tried Korean cleansing balms. This balm is sticky and doesn’t melt into an oil. It does an ok job at cleaning. I don’t like the scent or the texture. I hope I can get a refund. I will say it’s a lot of product for not a lot of money. Dulls in comparison to K beauty
