This resurfacing peel mask worked on my sensitive skin. I am typically allergic to a lot of things but I was NOT allergic to this. It does have a light scent to it. It leaves your face feeling a little sticky but of course you wash it off. I am excited to see results over time. I like that you can twist the dispenser to “off“ or “on“. The only thing is that I wish the packaging felt a bit more high-end. nan
