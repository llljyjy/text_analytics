I’m a big fan of Sephora collection makeup items but had yet to try their skincare until this. Y’ALL don’t sleep on this!! It’s so affordable, unscented and clean + vegan. I have very dry skin and this toner left my skin glowing, gorgeous and fresh. This is one I will be buying again and again. I can’t wait to try other skincare products from the Sephora Collection. Affordable, quality, skincare by Sephora
