The Sephora Melting Cleansing Balm is awesome. It is heavy though. It is a different texture than other cleansing balms I have used. This balm definitely requires you to use water and emulsify it. It does remove all my makeup and pollution from the day. I feel clean and moisturized after. It has a pleasant scent and has a very light fragrance.  Thereâ€™s a lot in the package and a little goes a long way with this so it is budget friendly. I recommend it! Double Cleanse Clean
