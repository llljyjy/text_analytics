I am obsessed with coconut so I was so excited to try these. The wipes themselves are OK. Standard makeup wipes, nothing too special. I always get the value size because you get the most wipes. Packaging is awful. Each time I’ve bought the value size, the plastic part on the bag completely falls off. I haven’t had that problem with the small size. So I have to assume it’s a manufacturing error. Please fix this! Value size has a problem with the packaging
