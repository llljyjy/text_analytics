All 3 of these products are amazing. The cleanser has a very rosy scent that I personally love. If you’re scent-averse, I wouldn’t recommend this. The lather is just perfect - a Clear gel that suds just enough to not feel too much or too little. Once I wash it off, my combo skin feels clean, but not crazy tight or anything. The moisturizer is truly a matter moisturizer. There’s no shine or grease, but you can feel the moisture in your skin instantly. The exfoliator is incredibly - a pea size goes a huge way. the scrub is very tangible but not painful. Has a slight smell as well, but nothing I mind personally.I would buy this repeatedly but the tiny size of the moisturizer and exfoliator is a little off putting. It’s still an amazing set for the price though, and I’ve bought the face wash individually a couple times now. As for clarifying, it does a pretty good job. I don’t have major acne so I didn’t notice a huge change but I could feel the cleaning and exfoliation at work each time. nan
