I received this sample size product for free in exchange for an honest review. I found that this product was a bit watery/runny on application. The scent was gentle and not too overpowering which I liked. I did feel that it moisturized my skin and was gentle, but other than that I didnâ€™t notice too much of a difference as far as clearing up dark spots or evening skin tone. Maybe that is due to the fact that I was only able to use it for about a week. Overall not too bad when compared with other Vitamin C serums. A bit Watery
