A decent cleanser for everyday use. I do double cleanse- I use an oil based makeup remover first but then follow up with this Clean Skin Gel cleanser from Sephora. It isn’t MINDBLOWING, but for the price it does the job.  I do like that all the ingredients are clean, and I love that the product is fragrance free (although it does have that “unscented“ scent - if you know what I’m talking about). Affordable daily cleanser
