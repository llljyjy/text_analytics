I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review.The Resurfacing Peel Mask is an incredible product for the price! Exfoliation has always been a must in my skincare routine as I struggle with regular milia. I love that I didn’t experience any irritation after application and my skin continuously felt smooth after each use. I follow up with a good moisturizer and my skin is GLOWING. Can’t wait to see the results after long-term use! Glowing skin
