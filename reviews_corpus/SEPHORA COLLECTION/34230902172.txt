Pretty effective at making my skin smooth and reducing the depth of my fine lines. The texture looked weird when I first used it but it isn’t an issue, the cream eventually melts in your skin in a minute. The cream feels like playdough in the jar lol. Matte finish. My skin doesn’t feel dry after use. I have sensitive skin and got no irritation. This cream has a smooth and soft texture when you rub it in. It rubs in easily. Pretty good for it’s price. I couldn’t find “peptides“ in the ingredients or maybe it goes by a different name in the list.If this is causing your “breakout“ please know that it takes 4-6 weeks for pimple to develop so the actual cause of your breakouts, is most likely a habit/product that you used a month ago. I’ve tried a bunch of sample moisturizers from other expensive brands and this $24 cream outperforms or is just as good as many of them imo. I’ve been using it daily for about 3 weeks and there’s still a lot of product left in the jar. Makes my skin plump :)
