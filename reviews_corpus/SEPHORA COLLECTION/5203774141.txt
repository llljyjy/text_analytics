I was pleasantly surprised after receiving this product (gifted). I have very sensitive skin that typically results in dermatitis after applying eye creams. However, this was NOT the case with this eye cream. It’s a lightweight formula that is ultra hydrating (more gel like than creamy). It has only been a week of use and I am already noticing a difference- I definitely look less tired lol. I can’t wait to continue to use this product and hope to see further improvements in my under eye area. Love a clean and affordable skincare product! nan
