Awesome niacinamide toner!!  I love combining this on a cotton pad with Thayer’s alcohol-free toner and it makes my pores almost nonexistent!!  I’ve been using niacinamide regularly for a while now and it’s been great for my skin but I wanted to add it to my morning routine and this has worked out perfectly.  It’s gentle with 5% niacinamide and the relatively simple list of ingredients doesn’t conflict with anything I already have going.  The texture is lightweight and watery.  It sinks in quickly and really reduces the appearance of my pores.  Highly recommended. Reduces the appearance of my pores
