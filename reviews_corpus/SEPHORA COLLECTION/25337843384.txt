When I first started using this product I don’t know if I “got it.“ It’s a super simple thick cream. However, when I took a short trip to Colorado where is was colder and drier, this moisturizer saved my life. I think this will be my new go-to for when my skin barrier is compromised. I love how it’s thick, but doesn’t sit on top of my skin or leave a weird residue. Great basic moisturizer for restoring skin barrier
