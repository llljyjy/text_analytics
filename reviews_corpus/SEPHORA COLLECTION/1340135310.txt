I bought a couple of these to give guests when they stay over, as a nice addition to the morning. While they feel fantastic on your face, I donâ€™t know that they make a huge difference on puffiness and under eye hydrating more than the standard skincare routine. I recommend keeping a set of these in the fridge and applying them cold to the area to help reduce puffiness, if that is what you are after for the purpose. nan
