I received the serum complimentary from Influenster I have very oily skin so I only use a very very little bit of it it came out really really fast so I only use very small size like a dot on your finger. But overall it made my skin feel very soft it’s has a light texture to it it’s not like sticky slimy more of a watery Feel it smells good not to strong of a scent. Okay
