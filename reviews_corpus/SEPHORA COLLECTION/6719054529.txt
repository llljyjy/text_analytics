Firstly I am in my 50’s so I usually use high end skincare products. This anti-aging serum was just okay compared to what I usually use. On the plus side, it’s vegan and Clean at Sephora. It goes on smoothly, smells earthy and didn’t irritate my eyes or skin. I used it for over a week and it didn’t work as well as my more expensive serum. This might be good for someone younger who is preventing wrinkles and fine lines, but someone who already has them, it doesn’t diminish them. It’s okay
