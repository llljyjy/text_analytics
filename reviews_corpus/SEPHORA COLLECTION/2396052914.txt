Excellent product. The handle has a really nice weight in the hand and makes it easy to control. t is much easier to use than the disposable plastic kind. It doesn’t remove the same amount of skin as a professional dermaplaning does, but I don’t think that’s a reasonable expectation from a home product. The blades are easy to replace; I found the refills very easily on the Sephora website. Excellent
