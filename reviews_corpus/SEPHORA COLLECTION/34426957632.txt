I was super disappointed with this product. Bought this to give my feet a pampering  and they are made for only people with tiny feet. So they did not get over my heels which was the entire reason for buying. None the less I used them for the part of my feet they reached over and while they made my feet in thise areas feel soft for a couple of hours as soon as the lotion had fully absorbed you could not tell I had even used it. I have tried many foot masks from various companies and this one is by far the worst one I have tried yet. So disappointing coming from Sephora. Small and doesn't work
