It’s okay for how affordable it is, but I don’t like it’s texture, it’s kind of goopy and sticky and I feel like it doesn’t really “melt” and emulsify on your skin. It seems to do a fine job getting make up of, but I really dislike the texture compared to other cleansing balms. It at lease dissolves and washes away very nicely with water. I’ll use it up but won’t be repurchasing. affordable, but only okay
