I was tired of buying plastic razors on Amazon to have them go dull after 2 uses. The plastic waste was also pretty annoying, so I gave this one a chance. The handle is substantial and the razor is really sharp and is still great after a few uses. I love that is more sustainable than the alternatives, and the refill pack is only $10 for 3. buy it!
