First of all - I love these lip masks. The price point and the quality make this a must have lip product! Each of the flavors have their own set of problems they target. I have been using the vanilla and strawberry lip masks for about 8 - 10 months now and they have their pros and cons. Strawberry is nourishing and the thickest formula of the three but it smells bad and the taste lingers for a while after waking up and I usually avoid applying this during the day because of the scent and taste.Vanilla smells good - like play dough and doesn’t have a taste. It sits on my lips and just protects them while also adding a nice glossy layer of shine as it’s more of a  liquid formula. Coconut balances both the flavors out and is currently my favorite of the three. It has a very light coconut scent and doesn’t have a taste. It’s also not as thick of a formula as strawberry and not as thin as vanilla. It protects my lips for a few hours and is quite soothing.Lastly, these are great glossy lip masks that are fun to have in my travel bag or on my desk. I like to reapply often through the day and these are pretty big for lip masks and long lasting. I’m a huge fan of Laneige lip masks and these may not compare to them and do not last through the night for me as Laneige does, but they are a great go to option for switching things up.
