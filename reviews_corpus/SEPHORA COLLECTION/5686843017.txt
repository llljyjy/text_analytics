Sephora changed and ruined my all time favorite lip balm! Please bring back the old version! I don’t care if this version is clean-I’m not going to wear it if it smells, tastes, and looks AWFUL! Not to mention you get less product for the same price! Guess I’ll have to find a new balm unless you PLEASE change it back! What used to be smooth and shiny is now dull and sticky, just AWFUL nan
