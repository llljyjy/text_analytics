Sephora Collection gifted me to this product, but the opinions are completely my own based on my experience. This is a must-have after too much holiday indulging… or January indulging. It is perfect to store in the freezer and use in the morning if you need some extra help depuffing. I love that it has two ends so that you’re really able to comfortably roll underneath your eyes with the smaller roller while being able to use the larger end in places you may not need to be as gentle. I use it in both morning and evening for a little extra pampering :) The shade of blue is really pretty in person and lifts my mood, as well. works like a charm
