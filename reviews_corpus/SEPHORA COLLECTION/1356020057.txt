As far as I can tell, this is every bit as good as Clinique Take the Day Off, Farmacy Green Clean, and Drunk Elephant Slaai. I’ve tried them all. And if you tried the Sephora oil-balm and hated it, this is *not* the same. Really gets makeup and SPF fully loose and doesn’t leave a greasy film after a second cleanse. If you’re looking to save money on anything in your routine, this is perfect. If you’re not looking to save money, this is still perfect. Better than a dupe!
