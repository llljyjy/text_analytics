I love majority of vitamin C products, but this did next to nothing for my skin. It didn’t make my skin glow in any different way, and it felt kind of sticky on my face. I’ve used other serums like L’Oreal and other big drugstore brands as well as high end brands, and this just was not my favorite. It definitely did it for the first couple of minutes of me wearing it, but it definitely wore off very quickly. I think it needs to have a little bit more longevity and actually work. Doesn’t last long, but does work a little.
