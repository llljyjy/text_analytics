I was recommended this product by a staff member, when I came in asking about retinol. I wanted to start and wasn’t sure which one. Being a newbie I was advised to start my “sensitive” skin on this prior to a full retinol use. Great advice. My skin gobbled up the Bak in a positive, feeling refreshed daily look, sort of way. No reaction, no smell, no residual tacky or dry feeling post use. I’ve now moved to a retinol, but recommended this to friends first trying out too. nan
