I don’t know what it is but I didn’t like it. It felt like something I’d buy for my little sister to play pretend. There are soooo many face serums, so this one can go sit in the back. Honestly, I threw it in the trash after trying it several weeks. It just felt too watery/a little sticky, and like a placebo product or 8 yr old’s play product. nah, skip it sis
