I Received a sample size of this product complimentary for my honest review. I have used this serum about a handful of times and I really enjoy it. It has a nice light, fresh scent. It’s a pretty liquidy formula that absorbs really nicely into my skin. It doesn’t feel sticky or anything after and pairs nicely with my moisturizer. The one star deduction is because I don’t know if it makes a long term difference in my skin but I would recommend this product and will likely buy it in the future! nan
