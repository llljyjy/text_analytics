I have 47 year old dry skin and wear a full face of makeup most days. I am very impressed that this cleanser is able to remove all of my makeup, including eye makeup and mascara, in a single cleanse without the need to double-cleanse. Little if any traces of makeup are left behind. It is not at all drying or stripping to my skin, as Iâ€™ve tested that by waiting 20 minutes after washing my face to see if my skin felt tight. It did not. It starts out as a gel and with water, lathers into a silky substantial cream. I love that it has no added fragrance ingredients. This is my new go-to cleanser.
