For a while, I’ve been looking for a product to minimize the pores on my nose and cheeks! A little goes a long way with this serum and although my face did not feel significantly different, I can attest that the pores do not look as big as they did prior to treatment. Although I did not get the mattifying effect of the serum, I still felt that it targeted pores as stated and love that it’s scent free, so I can layer on products without mixing the fragrances! Pores minimized after a few days!
