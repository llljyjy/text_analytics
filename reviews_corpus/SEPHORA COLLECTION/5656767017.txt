I picked this lip balm in the lychee and so far I like it. This applies super smooth onto the lips. I would say that this has more of that silky lip balm feel that’s not super thick. It’s hydrating but not the most hydrating balm I’ve tried. I also think the packaging is a little flimsy. All in all it’s cute, but it doesn’t top my favorite lip care products.
