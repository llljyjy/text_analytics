I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review. I’m not giving this the full 5 stars yet bc I haven’t been able to incorporate it into my skincare routine as long as I would have liked but I’ve used this and it feels extremely gentle on my skin. I do breakout pretty frequently and have to be careful about the products I use so when I use something that doesn’t suit my skin, I break out within the day. My skin reacted great to this. No breakout, no sensitivity, no itchiness. I’m excited to continue using it to see better results! Really gentle!
