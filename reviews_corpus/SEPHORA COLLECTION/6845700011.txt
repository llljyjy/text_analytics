I am 27 and have had problem skin since age 13 - unrelenting acne that worsens with hormonal changes, dry, oily, you name it. I am always on the verge of starting Accutane because no product has really helped. BUT after a week of using this toner, I have genuinely noticed that it has even my skin toned and reduced breakouts. I’ve left like.. all of maybe 3 reviews on Sephora in my life and this product definitely deserves one. I love how my skin looks soft, smooth and even. I’m genuinely impressed and surprised with how well it works. Genuinely surprised at how good it is
