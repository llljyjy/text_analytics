began using this because other lip masks could cost upwards of $20 and it seemed impractical to me - i love this one so much! the vanilla has to be my favorite scent but strawberry smells pretty nice too. i apply this nightly as a part of my skincare routine, and i wake up with moisturized and slightly plumped lips! i read other reviewers and notice that they tend to misinterpret the product. itâ€™s an overnight mask, not to be used during the day. anyways, i highly recommend this not just as a dupe for laneige or ilia lip masks, but i actually prefer this over theirs! fave!
