I don’t often leave reviews, but this product actually worked, and I enjoy using it so I have to say something!I got this mask initially as a “Oh well guess I’ll try something other than lip balm“ for my near-constantly dry lips. I wore it to bed, seriously underestimating, and woke up the next day with legitimately smooth lips! As for the taste, it’s unlike most vanilla flavored things. I’m a vanilla fiend, so when I say this was some of the best “tasting“ lip product I’ve ever tried, I fully mean it. the flavor reminds me of baked goods, or how a cupcake tastes, something with vanilla extract. Basically, I wish I could eat it..! 10/10 would absolutely buy again. tl;dr - a deep conditioning lip product that works best overnight, actually tastes great, lip gloss-like consistency "Tastes" AMAZING and works AMAZING
