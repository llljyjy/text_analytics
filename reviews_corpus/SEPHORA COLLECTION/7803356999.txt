This is a thin consistency serum. I like that it’s unscented! I wanted to try bakuchiol as an anti aging alternative to retinol around the eyes because retinol irritates that spot. But this serum was fine and didn’t irritate my under eyes. I don’t see a difference yet but these are long term use products. I like this consistency better than the Bakuchiol lotion from The Ordinary Nice consistency
