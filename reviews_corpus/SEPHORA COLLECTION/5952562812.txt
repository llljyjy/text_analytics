I really like these probably the best under eye masks iv ever used that actually show some result after you take them off and for the price point it’s a good deal. The only thing I don’t like is what is up with the quality control? I’m currently wearing one thick mask and one like almost non existent thin one on the other side, the masks are never consistent in quality. If Sephora could fix that it would definitely be 5 stars. nan
