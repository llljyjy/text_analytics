This is the most amazing lip balm that I have felt in a long time! It literally feels like butter on your lips. The lip balm is super hydrating and leaves my lips feeling super soft and smooth. I also love the fact that they offer a hint of color that is perfect for everyday or for a mid day pick me up! This lip balm is a clean lip balm, which I love.  These are only  $7, so they are a wonderful price point for all to experience. Bonus the packaging is super cute and fun! These are a 10 for me. I have the shade Lychee. Clean Hydrated Lips
