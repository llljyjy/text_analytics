This is my first Gua ShaIf your on the fence and a beginner, just get it. This is my new favorite tool. I use the v shape on the end for my chin, eye brows and cheek bones, right center of the eyes on forehead is amazing.I have been using the other textured side and flat edges on sore muscles in my arms and legs, relaxing after a long day at work.I’m just new and I’m sure when I get the techniques down I will see even more benefits! All round I am so happy with this purchase, definitely making me feel zen if anything else. Great size too, easy to hold! ditch the rollers, get this instead
