I love the other Sephora wipes and use them regularly. I accidentally purchased 9 packages of this biodegradable version, and when I tried them, I new, right away, they were different. First of all, the smell was horrible. AWFUL. I buy the grapefruit in the original version and love it... version has an odd smell that made me nauseous. It could actually be the cloth fabric itself that smelled bad. Speaking of the cloth fabric, it, too, is awful... there is no smooth side. But, worst of all, I had to use SEVERAL of these to get the make-up off, and with the original version, it takes just 1. This product is definitely a miss. All 9 packages were returned. Not good...
