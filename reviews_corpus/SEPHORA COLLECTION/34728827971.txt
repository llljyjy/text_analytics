This is my first try with a silicone scrubber.  My old Clarisonic Mia is on its last leg, and is honestly too harsh for my more sensitive and fragile, older skin.  I am thinking of investing in a vibrating silcone scrubber, but wanted to try out an affordable manual version first. As soft as these silicone “bristles“ are, I am shocked at how polished and soft my skin is after each use. It’s remarkable to get such results without abrading the skin with a bristle brush - my skin is so relieved!  I haven’t decided how it is working for deep cleansing pores; That may be where the vibrating version comes in.  I CAN say that it is superior to just using my handsto wash with, and I believe the gentle treatment is causing my skin to behave better, generally. I'm so glad I gave this a shot!
