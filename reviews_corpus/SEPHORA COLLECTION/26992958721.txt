I bought this cause I wasn’t about to blow 20 bucks on a lip mask and it turned out to be a perfect dupe, if not better. It lasted longer than the Laneige one (meaning when I woke up it was still on) and it softened and moisturized my lips like it said it would. I’m not reapplying chapstick as much as I usually do because of it. Which is rare given that it’s winter in NY right now and I have very dry skin. Also, it’s clean which is even better. Laneige Dupe
