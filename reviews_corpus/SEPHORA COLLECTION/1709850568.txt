atural and super gentle alternative for retinol. It feels really silky and moisturizing and does all the things retinol does. A winner! Ladies, quality doesnâ€™t have to be expensive!Plus I love that they have vegan and Clean products like this at Sephora.  This is a 100% natural serum that smooths out the smile (and frown!) lines plus adds hydration all for less than $30. The ingredients are top notch. Quality doesn't have to be expensive!
