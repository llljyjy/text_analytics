My lips are super dry and uncomfortable from having electric heating my apartment. I decided to go the “higher end“ route, getting this lip mask and even a lip balm from Sephora. Yeah, if I could go back in time, I would warn myself not waste the money. This “mask“ is useless. I tried it for a week, every night, making it part of my bedtime routine. It smells okay, but it’s super sticky like a lip gloss, no matter how little you put on. It kinda just sat on my lips most of the night, which was equally uncomfortable because I was worried about getting it on my pillow. Anyways, woke up in the morning, the mask is absorbed. My lips are still absolutely dry and uncomfortable. If I could, I would give this zero stars because it’s really useless. It did nothing for me. So, yeah, will NOT buy again. I'd give zero stars if I could.
