I recently received this product from Sephora and have been testing it out for the last two weeks. I love that the texture of the serum, it goes on the skin very smoothly and layers well with my other serums. No pilling! I’ve applied this on my hands and face. I haven’t noticed much changes on my face yet, but there’s been some fading on my hands where the darkest spots I have are. I will continue to use and hopefully see even more results in my face. As mentioned this product was gifted but I will likely purchase in the future Dark spots be gone!!
