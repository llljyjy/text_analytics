If you struggle with maskne like I did for a long time, this product will be your holy grail skincare product that you will fall in love with! This product helps to gently exfoliate the skin to help get rid of acne and leave you with brighter and smoother skin. It also really helps with hyperpigmentation so if you suffer with either, you need this to be a part of your skincare routine.I use this twice a week since it is a strong product and make sure I use it at night and apply sunscreen religiously the day after. Overall, this product is amazing and a game changer for your skin! Amazing for maskne and dull skin!
