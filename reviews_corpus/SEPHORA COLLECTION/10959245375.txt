This serum has a lightweight, watery consistency and a gorgeous, fresh scent that reminds me of aloe, cucumbers, and seaweed. I was pleasantly surprised with this product. It’s made with great ingredients. It’s super lightweight and hydrating and leaves my skin looking radiant. Definitelyrecommended. Hydrating
