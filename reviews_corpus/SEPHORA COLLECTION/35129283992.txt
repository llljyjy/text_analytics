Okay yes 10/10 can say now that I have found a new favorite magic potion for my skin. I live isn’t he south so it’s always hot and I’m sweating but this doesn’t make my skin oily, shiny or greasy- it’s more like a natural glow and my skin feels so hydrated. My pores are almost microscopic and I can barely see them and my skin feels so smooth!!! Magic
