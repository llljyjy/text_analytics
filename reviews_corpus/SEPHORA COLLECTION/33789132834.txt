Overall, this foot mask was really amazing. I have dry skin on my feet. It did the job by soothing and hydrating my feet. Before using, I recommend exfoliating your feet with any body scrub or tool just to get the best results. Put on some lotion after and my feet have stayed soft for weeks with only one mask.
