I loved this case until it broke only 3 months after purchase with very minimal use!! The plastic cover to the large compartment snapped. It still holds my pills for now until I can find a better one. VERY disappointed in Sephora for putting their name on such a cheap product.... Cheap design with a Sephora logo. WASTE OF MONEY!!
