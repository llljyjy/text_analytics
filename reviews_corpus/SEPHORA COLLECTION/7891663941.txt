Accidentally posted my review for this cleanser under the hydrator, so I wanted to share my thoughts here! I’ve been looking for a vegan and clean cleanser for months but didn’t want to break the bank-and this one is absolutely perfect. I have sensitive skin and most cleansers either break me out or leave my skin too stripped. This is gentle enough for use 2x a day and gets off all of my makeup. And the price is perfect Perfect daily cleanser
