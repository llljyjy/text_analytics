This lip balm is such a gorgeous color! I love that it’s more than 90% natural ingredients, because nowadays, I try to only use clean beauty. I would say this is very similar to the Fresh sugar lip balm, which is a good thing because I love that balm. I will opt for this one now though because it’s only $7 versus $20+, both leave my lips super soft and nourished. I love how this also gives a beautiful wash of color, I got the shade cherry and it’s like a pretty raspberry-cherry color on me. So compact too so it fits in my tiniest bag! great price
