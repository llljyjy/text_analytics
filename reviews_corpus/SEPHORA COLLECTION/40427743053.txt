I guess this is OK for the sale price. The tints are nice and I actually really loved the scent of this and also the cherry one, but it lasted for about 10 minutes. For a lip balm I expected it to have somewhat lasting moisture for mildly chapped lips. Packaging is cute but not functional to be thrown around in your bag or car, itâ€™s like cardboardy and feels like it could easily be ruined. Meh.
