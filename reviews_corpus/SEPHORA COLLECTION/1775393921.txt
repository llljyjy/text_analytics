I’ve been using this serum in my daily morning and night routine for a few days and I haven’t really noticed a difference yet. There’s no scent and the consistency is super lightweight once absorbed into your skin. I’m going to keep using this serum and hope to see some difference by the time I finish the product. Another thing I like about this product is how inexpensive it is since it’s part of the Sephora collection, plus it’s vegan and clean at Sephora! nan
