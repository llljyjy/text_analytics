The Sephora Ultra Glow Serum: Glow + Strengthen Vitamin C which is perfect for the season since my skin does  feel dull at this time of the year. It absorbs easily on the skin and feels lightweight. Smells great too! However, due to the size of the product - I have not noticed whether it did anything for my skin. Maybe if I use it longer, I can see if there is any significant changes. Have Not Seen Changes Yet
