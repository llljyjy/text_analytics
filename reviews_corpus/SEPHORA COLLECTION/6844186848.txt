I have sensitive combo skin which makes me prone to break outs and allergic reactions, which makes it quite difficult to find a good nourishing product. On top of that, add dehydration in winter, and Houston, we got a real problem. I love love the texture of this moisturizer: it is quite lightweight, but once it soaks in, skin feels well-cared for. Also, it is certified clean at Sephora which means no irritants for the skin. Iâ€™ve been using as my night time moisturizer, and ever since I did, I wake up with a plump, well-restored skin. This product is a real gem, especiallly in winter. Perfect for winter
