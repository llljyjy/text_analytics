I was given the opportunity to be gifted the Ultra Glow Toner by Sephora in exchange for my honest review of the product. For starters, I really loved that this product was not only affordable but vegan and clean. Nowadays, it is hard to find a great quality product at an affordable price. As someone who has sensitive skin, this was perfect for my skin. After using the toner, I noticed how much brighter my skin looked. It is also unscented and provides a clean and fresh smell. I would recommend giving it a try for about a week or so to see how it works for your skin! Must try!!
