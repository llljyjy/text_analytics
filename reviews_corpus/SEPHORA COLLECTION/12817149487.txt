I love this lip balm. Not only is it affordable but it glides on ur lips so smooth. It doesn’t get all over the place and doesn’t clump up like alot of other lip products. I have the coconut one and it smells so good. It’s not an overpowering smell either. 10/10 recommend and I’ll defiantly be purchasing more of these Great lip balm
