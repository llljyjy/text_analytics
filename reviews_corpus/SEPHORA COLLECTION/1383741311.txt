Iâ€™ve been using this moisturizer for the past couple weeks. I do enjoy that that this product is vegan and clean at Sephora. This is a nice daytime moisturizer and did well under makeup. I could see myself using this more during the summer months. During winter months in NY, I tend to reach for more thicker moisturizer. This is nice for the price though! nan
