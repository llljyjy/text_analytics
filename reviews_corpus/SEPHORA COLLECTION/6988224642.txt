The Sephora Collection Resurfacing Peel Mask is SUCH a great product! I have very sensitive skin, so a lot of masks tend to irritate/inflame my skin. However, this product is very gentle and soothing on the skin. I particularly wanted to use this because I get a lot of blackheads and pores around my nose area. However, after even one use, I saw a noticeable difference with my black heads. This is a great product for reducing the appearance of blackheads, and I canâ€™t wait to use it more.Plus most skincare tends to be more expensive, but this one is only $18. Great product and great price range!!! Great for reducing blackheads!!!
