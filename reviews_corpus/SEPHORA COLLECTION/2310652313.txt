I haven’t used a gel cleanser like this in a while, so it took a little getting used to. When I first started with it it felt like it was sitting on top of my skin and not really penetrating, so i soon learned i needed to activate it a bit in my hands first and then really focus on any problem areas on my face. Overall, I have noticed an improvement in my face and skin tone, and this product hasn’t exacerbated my adult-acne prone skin. Love that it’s so affordable, and is vegan and clean :) Clean Skin, Affordable Price
