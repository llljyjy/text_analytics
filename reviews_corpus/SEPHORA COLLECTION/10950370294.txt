Getting into skincare has been so much easier now that there are more affordable options that work just as well as the high-end ones! For context, I have acne-prone, combo/oily skin. It recommends to use twice a day, but I have been using it once a day to test how my skin would react. I put 3-4 drops into my palm, warm it up between my hands then lightly pat it on my face after cleansing. There is little to no scent from this serum - there is maybe the smallest tinge of what I think is the kombucha, but it goes away very quickly. It does not leave my skin feeling sticky and it absorbed into my skin quickly. I’ve only tried it for about a week (and only once a day), so I’ve yet to really see any difference in my dark spots, but I don’t get any adverse reactions so I have no problem testing it out for longer and with the 2 times a day regimen. I’m really happy Sephora is coming out with more products for their personal brand! So Far So Good!
