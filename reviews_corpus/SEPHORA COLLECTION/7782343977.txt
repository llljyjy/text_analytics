First of all, for me it is very important to mention that I am a fan of the Sephora brand, since its makeup and skin care products have a very high quality and are very affordable.  the pore serum helped me a lot to hide the pores of my skin, it has no fragrance, the consistency is very liquid and it absorbs quite well. nan
