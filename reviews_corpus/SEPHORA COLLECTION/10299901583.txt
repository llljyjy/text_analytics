I’m obsessed with this Sephora Brightening eye cream. It goes on so smooth and really hydrated my under eye area. Even after applying my concealer, my eye area looks hydrated and plumped. I have yet to see it to fix my dark circles as I have only been using it for a week now but so far I’m happy with the results :) nan
