The targeted dark spots serum is very affordable and it is effective. So I did not know this before but kombucha from black tea is known to brighten and even your skin tone. So that helped as well as the papaya in this product. The papaya is used to exfoliate your skin. I didn’t have too many dark spots on my skin but the ones I did have are mostly gone. The other great thing about this product is that it’s made from 93% natural ingredients They also use recycled glass for the bottle that it comes in. They even went so far as to use cardboard from sustainably managed force and ink from vegetables. I would definitely recommend this product. Get those dark spots everyone!
