love love love! I smells and taste so good, very small so it fits into any tiny bag. Super moisturizing however I was hoping for a slight red lip stain but there was none. Still 10/10. I’ve already used half of it. It in 28 years this is the FIRST lip moisturizer I’ve used more than 8 times. Will buy other flavors soon. Half used already :)
