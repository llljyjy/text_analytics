I tried this because I liked their previous cleansing oil and cleansing oil in balm, both which are no longer for sale.I didn’t really like the texture when applying, but I didn’t think much of it because it’s meant to be removed.After washing with warm water, it still felt filmy even though it says specifically it won’t, but I still didn’t think much of it because I was using it in a double cleanse, as I will wash again with a water-based cleanser.After finishing the double “cleanse“, it did not feel clean at all. I had to double cleanse again, after using the water-based cleanser again, before my face felt close to normal. So 5x cleansing, which is ridiculous. This is the only product I’ve tried from this store that I wanted to return, but of course now I can’t because of the shortened return window. I did try adding jojoba oil when applying this and it seems to wash away much easier now (only double cleansing once). So at least not a total waste of money, I guess. Extremely disappointing
