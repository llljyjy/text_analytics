This is definitely on the runnier/watery end of serums. The sample I received was in tube form and I always had trouble dispensing without making a mess; I can see how the full size dropper would make things much easier. After 2 weeks of use, I havenâ€™t noticed any major differences nor have I noticed anything bad. It may or may not work for your skin type. Worth a try, especially at the price point
