I love that this moisturizer is certified as clean! It’s nice that this is fragrance free since I’m not the hugest fan of scented moisturizers. I usually have super dry and flaky skin and I have really seen improvements in dryness. I don’t have as many dry patches any more. I love that this doesn’t feel very oily and heavy on the skin as well. It absorbs really nicely after application. Awesome Moisturizer
