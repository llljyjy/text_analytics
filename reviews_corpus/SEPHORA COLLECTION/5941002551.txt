Have only been using for roughly a month or so, but love the true glow that it gives to my skin! Iâ€™ve definitely noticed a reduction in the dullness of my skin that lasts beyond washing my face. Only downside is it has a somewhat thicker consistency so it feels more like an oil than a serum, and can make sometimes make my pores more noticeable. Provides a glow that lasts even after washing off
