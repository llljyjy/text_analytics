This is a solid moisturizer if you’re looking for a rich cream at a reasonable price. It’s super hydrating without feeling heavy or greasy on my combination skin. My skin feels juicy and plump in the morning after I use this. It’s not a holy grail but definitely a good basic moisturizer. Good but not a holy grail
