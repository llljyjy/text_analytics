I’m not a big fan of masks, but I really loved these! I used them on a girls trip and was pleasantly surprised by the results. After a full day of walking, we returned to the hotel and applied our masks. We really enjoyed the scent, sweet but not too strong. It was recommended that we leave them on longer than the suggested 5 minutes and I’m glad we did. Our skin was noticeably smoother and super moisturized. I’ll definitely get these again! A pleasant surprise!
