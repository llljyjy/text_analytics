I have oily skin with hormonal acne with leaves acne scars behind. I wanted to try an affordable, but effective product. I was excited about the two main ingredients kombucha and enzymes. I’m on week two and I seen a slight change of my marks fading, but nothing dramatic. Can’t wait to update in the next two weeks. nan
