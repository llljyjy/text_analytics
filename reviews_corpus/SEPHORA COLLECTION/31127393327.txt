In lieu of using retinol to treat dark spots on my skin, I was interested in trying this vegan serum instead. I was happily surprised that I like it even more than retinol products I have used in the past. My marks are starting to fade and my skin looks much brighter, which just goes to show that quality products donâ€™t have to be super expensive at all! Better for my dark marks!
