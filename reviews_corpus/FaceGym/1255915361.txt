by face gym. i really enjoy using my new red ball to help tone my face. i regularly use my jade roller and my gua sha to help sculpt my jawline and cheekbones, but it never occurred to me that there were other tools to help me strengthen other parts of my face. love incorporating this into my routine! nan
