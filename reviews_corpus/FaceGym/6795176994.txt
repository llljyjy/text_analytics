I enjoyed this more than I expected! The 5 min routine day and night was a little much for me but it inspired me to start incorporating some facial massage and gua sha back into my routine! The face ball did nothing for me. The skincare products I loved! All of them! Cleanser smells great, gently exfoliates with papaya extract. Facial oil was lovely and light. Moisturizer was lightweight but felt super moisturizing! Very happy with these products! Enjoyed these products!
