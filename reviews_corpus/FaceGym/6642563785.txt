This product was awesome, but itâ€™s definitely one of those products that make your skin worse before it gets better. I started breaking out the first week after using this but after about 2 weeks, my skin finally started to clear and looked pretty transformed! My skin texture in particular looks so much better and it improved the appearance of my pores. My only advice is to just stay consistent and the results will make it worth it I swear Stay consistent!
