I have a lot of stress and anxiety and clench my jaw a lot, as well as suffer from tension headaches (probably from frowning so much! lol). I loved the idea of having something to ease that tension a bit, but I wasn’t expecting it to be this effective. I like that the packaging comes with a QR code that you can scan to watch a tutorial and follow along so you understand the basics. I also like how portable this is—it’s about the size of a large orange and easy to store, so you can take it on the go or when traveling. It’s easy to clean, too, and super affordable for what it is.Gifted by FaceGym. Really helps with my face muscle tension
