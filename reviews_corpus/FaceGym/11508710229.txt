I loved this product as a trial size..until I received the 1.7OZ I bought. The first one didn’t come with a lid. The second one came with foil on top, with product already on it. Upon trying to open and close the lid, more product oozed out. I’m sorry, but for $95 they need to come up with a better lid system for this. I’ll be returning this as well. I’m not down for wasting product for the price it cost me. Not worth product oozing out for the price point
