I hold a lot of tension in my forehead and it usually results in a headache. At first I thought maybe this was a tiny bit gimmicky but I am pleasantly surprised. I have been using this for a week and feel like it’s help with releasing a lot of tension. I actually feel like it’s even helped me with my expression lines being less tense. It feels very soothing as well. The ball seems to stay fairly cool and the smooth surface helps a lot. It’s really easy to use and the routine doesn’t take long. I paired this with another FG tool and feel like it’s helping a lot. Gifted by FaceGym Helps with tension.
