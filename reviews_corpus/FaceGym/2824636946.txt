I really wanted to like this product as I’ve been getting more into investing in beauty tools but I sadly just wasn’t a fan of this one. Another frustrating part of this product is that the directions on the box say to start with damp skin. You need to use it first on dry skin because the dampness dissolves the needles. While I received this as a free product, if I would’ve paid for it I would’ve been super upset that this basically ruined the first use. I also just didn’t see a difference in my skin after two (basically just one) uses of this. There’s a lot of other amazing looking products from Skin Gym that I still want to test out but this one is a pass for me. Not worth the price tag
