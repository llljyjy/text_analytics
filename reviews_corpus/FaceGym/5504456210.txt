This cream is on the thick side and I have combination skin. So, I would not be drawn to something like this but I have to say I like it and it doesnâ€™t feel heavy on my skin. I like that this is a night cream. It gives my skin a boost of hydration and my skin loves it. I really like this moisturizer.
