This is my first time using a roller and I have been missing out! Also, the fact that each roller is packaged separately for 1 time use is a huge plus from a hygiene standpoint.  I was nervous that it might be too painful, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I definitely feel it, but I got used to it pretty quickly and really loved how the crystalized serum absorbed into my skin.  I saw results right away with my skin looking plump and hydrated, but it was the second week where I started to see a softening in my complexion.  I have some dark spots that I am focusing on so I spent some extra time rolling over those areas and although I haven’t seen a huge difference yet, I can tell that they are responding, so I’m excited to see a brighter and lighter complexion with consistent use.
