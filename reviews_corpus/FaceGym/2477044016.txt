I was gifted this hydrating roller from Face Gym. I was excited to try it out and experience the spa-like facial tool from the comfort of my own home.  I was slightly disappointed at the overall experience and having to replace a roller every use would get quite pricey. I also didn’t feel like the “needle” effect lasted more than a couple seconds. However the serum inside the roller is a neat concept and did slightly hydrate my skin. Overall I don’t recommend this product. nan
