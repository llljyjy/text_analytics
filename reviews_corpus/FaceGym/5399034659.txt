This is microneedling for people afraid of microneedling! The roller isn’t painful at all, and is gentle on the skin. There was some slight redness after using that went away quickly. I used my favorite peptide serum after rolling and my skin looked so much plumper and firmer! Much cheaper than going to the derm’s and no down time. Awesome option for ppl scared of DIY microneedling
