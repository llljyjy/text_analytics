I adore this. It did clarify some areas of my skin that I was really concerned and I wanted to improve. I also had the hormonal acne and I was left out with dark spots and after using this product they had clarified a bit more. I cannot wait for them to completely disappear. My skin is a bit sensitive but mo irritation while using this. Also a bit of this product goes a long way . It does not contains a strong scent which I absolutely love. Great toner to have
