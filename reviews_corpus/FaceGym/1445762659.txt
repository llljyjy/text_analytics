I received this complimentary from FaceGym in exchange for my honest review.  I though I was generally unimpressed by hydrating serums- but this one is SPECIAL!  It works extremely well with the “face plucking” tutorials, which are also just a fun relaxing exercise.  The serum mixture can be thinned to your desired consistency.  After a few uses I am seeing some brightening of spots left from blemishes as well as a general all over glow. Glow Getter!
