Iâ€™ve been to FaceGym in NY a few times and fell in love with everything about it. I am mixed with everything under the sun and have always had problems finding anything that works with my skin and all the changes it goes through over the years. They recommended the Youth Reformer Firming Vitamin C Oil Serum and Supreme Restructure Collagen-Boosting Cermide Cream and both worked wonders!I recently moved to SF and my skin became extra dry, almost like fish scales. I ran out of my serum but its pretty expensive so decided to see if this worked just as well since it also has vitamin C and is firming. Left my skin dry as it was and didnt have the same glow or lift as the serum, sadly. I specificly give new items some time to see if itll eventually work especially before and after my period as my skin changes so much during that time but it still isnt helping at all even with the other lotions ive added onto my regime. I might return it unfortunalely. Hopefully FaceGyms other little less costly serums work as good as the Youth Reformer Serum does! Probably great for skin that's NOT dry!
