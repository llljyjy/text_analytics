I’m hesitant about at home micro needling because of issues with contamination on your face. I do appreciate that each roller is in sterile packaging to keep the experience clean. At the same time it is expensive for one roller each, but still cheaper than a med spa. It doesn’t hurt and it’s a great base for your skincare routine. I would suggest using these a week before an event in case of adverse reactions. Just wish the rollers had a sterile process to be reusable to reduce waste. Gifted by Face Gym Nice Sterile Packaging
