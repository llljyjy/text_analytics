I love this product! I have been using the hydrating active roller and really enjoy it. It’s not  painful and isn’t near as aggressive as my BeautyBio one so I can use it more often. I also like that the micro needles are made of active ingredients. My skin felt smooth, hydrated and the products I applied after absorbed better. My skin didn’t feel sensitive the next day at all. I’m impressed! Next I want to try the other two. Really like this microneedle tool!
