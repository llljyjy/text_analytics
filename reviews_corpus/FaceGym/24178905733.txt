This device  does what it claims it will do.  After treatments my skin looks plump, energized and just renewed. It’s a noticeable difference if it’s done correctly. I do however wish the kit came with more juice as i go through it pretty fast. I’m so glad I was able to try it but as for recommending it…i would advise buyers about the ongoing cost. You will have to purchase liquid for it to work correctly which are spendy.  Also I was worried this would be painful but I had no pain from treatments. My face just feels like it has a little sunburn after for a bit. I’m satisfied with the results but not sure yet  if I will purchase refills of the serum to continue with treatments.
