I literally don’t think I can live without this anymore, I didn’t know how much I needed it until I had it. I wake up with the most swollen face (looks like I’ve been stung by a bee) and it’s the weirdest thing when I have family around coz I have to explain that it’s just my sleep face. The facegym has helped to depuff my face, to release pressure from my tense facial muscles that sometimes cause me to grind my teeth and clench my jaws. I’m still learning different methods of usage but I love how easy it is to use, easy to clean and easy to store. It’s a must have! Plus who doesn’t want a chiseled face, lol.
