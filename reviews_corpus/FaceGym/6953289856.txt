This is a lightweight  do it all sort of product! It has all of my favorites for a great day serum like vitamin c, niacidimide, and micro algae that all work to brighten and minimize dark spots and the appearance of pores. This moisturizer also has lifting technology which is new to me. So far I am really enjoying it. It’s a bit light for the winter months for me, but come spring summer it’ll be my go to! Gifted by FaceGym. Does it all!
