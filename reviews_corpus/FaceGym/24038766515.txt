I received this face sculpt knit complimentary from face gym. I love the concept and it’s fun to try. There’s a QR code and a video tutorial that you can follow along. I wish there is an easier printed version as for learning. I also like their products and ingredients, the only downside is it’s a little bit expensive. Interesting Idea
