I was gifted by FaceGym their Hyaluronic Acid Roller, and this was the perfect beginnerâ€™s microneedling tool for me. I followed the directions as shown in the tutorial which was very easy and informative. When I first started the rolling motion, I noticed it left a whitish residue, could see a bit of redness, but it did not hurt the way I had pictured in my mind. I made sure my skin was taut and rolled slowly. After applying serum and did the second round, my skin immediately felt deeply hydrated and could visibly see a plumping effect. I actually enjoyed the way it felt on my skin like it was a massage. Overall, I loved this foolproof, non-invasive, convenient, and safest way to get microneedling benefits without the side effects. I saw the MOST improvement on my neck area. Saw great improvement in my neck area
