This product was gifted by FaceGym.  The cream has a nice thick texture that feels super smooth and light on my skin. It’s fast absorbing, while leaving my skin smooth, soft and plump. Since it’s a rich cream I use it at night as the last step in my skincare routine. I love that this cream not plumps and hydrates my skin. Added bonus, it’s anti-aging! nan
