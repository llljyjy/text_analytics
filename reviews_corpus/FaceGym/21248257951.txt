I received Face Ball Tension Release Tool gifted by FaceGym and it’s really gentler on the face, also helps relive stress headaches. I’m definitely going to add this into my routine and would love to see how it sculpts my cheeks in the coming days. It’s so much fun and relaxing to use. It works really great!
