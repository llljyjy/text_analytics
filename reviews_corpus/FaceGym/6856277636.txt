This is a really fun idea. Maybe for a younger person with less time obligations. As a mom of two toddlers I found it hard to practice the whole routine but my kids loved the ball :) I would not use the set except for the cream. I loved the cream! It is thick and moisturizing but goes on soooooo easy, unlike most creams with those characteristics. Overall this would be a great gift for a teen or young adult just learning and exploring about the importance of skincare! The cream is the best part!
