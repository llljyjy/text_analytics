What they don’t tell you is that you need to replace the microneedle attachments, which comes at $20 a pop together with the serum. So your $250 outlay only gets you 3 shots. I got pretty good results after a few trials, as this has a bit of learning curve but I don’t have enough left to test some more to see if it’s worth buying more. nan
