This is a really nice and different type of product, and I like that it combines toner essence and even serum. The texture of this product is more of a runny serum than a liquid which makes it really nourishing and leaves a slight tingle on the skin and helps the skin brighten and glow. I received this product complimentary from FaceGym. must have!
