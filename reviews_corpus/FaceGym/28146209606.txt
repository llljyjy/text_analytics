Be sure to wash your hands first before applying! I am so impressed with the ingredients such as the Bio-Lifting Complex and Niacinamide to give my skin a smooth and  firmer look and the Marine Bioferments help protect the skin barrier, while tightening the look of my skin. I have seen a difference in my skin on my face  within the one week I have been using it. The packing of the dropper is ideal as a little product goes a long way. It gives an even application! I use two drops in the morning and one at night after I cleanse. It absorbs seamlessly into and does not make me look or feel greasy. I feel an immediate plump after using it.  Ultimately, my skin feels smoother and feels moisturized. I am able to layer my other skincare on top of this serum without pilling. I recommend giving this product a try! Holy Hydration!
