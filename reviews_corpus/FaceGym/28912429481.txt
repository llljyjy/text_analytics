This product is amazing This cleanser is so good! I was nervous to try something new, because my skin is so sensitive. This one does not irritate my skin at all. It does exactly what it claims to do. It removes all my makeup and leaves my skin clean and hydrated, which dryness is another one of my issues. I definitely recommend this and will be reordering when I run out!Gifted nan
