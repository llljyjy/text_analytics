I received this product complimentary from FaceGym in return for my honest review.  For a regular product I would definitely be sceptical, since the claims seemed insane and too true to believe. But, the insane trust in the product and the fact that it allowed for a lot of “DO IT YOURSELF“ within skincare (aren’t we all just little scientists) truly made me try it. It 100% did make my skin smoother and more radiant looking. I woke up with actual bright skin- and some of the prior PIE from my cheek scars also faded. If for nothing else, I would definitely recommend trying this for the little scientist in you! WORTH A TRY!
