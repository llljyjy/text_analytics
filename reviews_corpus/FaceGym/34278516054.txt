I am very excited to add this to my permanent night time skincare routine. I have been trying it out for a few nights and I’m pleased with how my skin looks and feels in the morning. It’s very smooth and soothing to the skin, while also being very hydrating. I do have oily skin and I have not had any breakouts which is a good sign. I usually apply this serum right after my cleanser but before moisturizer. Love this serum! Love this serum!
