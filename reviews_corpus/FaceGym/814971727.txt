What a fun little kit! A great way to reset and relax. For the price of one facial, you can de-stress and self-care your way to a better skin and well-being, again and again in the comfort of your home. The face ball is made from PVC and free from harmful chemicals such as phthalates, latex, lead, and BPA. Cleanse your face first before using the face ball but make sure your face is dry. Then follow-up with the Supreme Restructure Firming EGF Collagen Boosting Moisturizer. This has been so great for reducing facial bloating and puffiness. FYI the container comes with a QR code with how-to instruction. Major stress reliever!!
