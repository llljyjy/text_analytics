Hands down my favorite facial oil I’ve ever gotten my hands on. I love the packaging, bottle, and love love the dropper. The oil itself is pure magic. My skin feels so nice since I started using this oil. It’s great for dry skin and the winter months especially.  Complimentary from FaceGym. Great stuff
