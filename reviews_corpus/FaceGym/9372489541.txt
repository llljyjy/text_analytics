I purchased this to help relieve extreme tension in my neck and face. I suffer from a condition known as Synkinesis which results in very tight facial muscles that restrict movement on one side of the face. Whether you are purchasing for cosmetic reasons or more of a medical based reason such as myself- I think you will find this tool to be extremely beneficial in reducing tension in the face and neck, it’s the best tool I’ve found so far to help provide relief. Fantastic for relieving facial/neck tension
