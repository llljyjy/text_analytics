So, I honestly wasn’t entirely sure about this ball at first. I scanned the QR code and followed the video tutorial and really enjoyed using the FaceGym ball! I carry tension in my jaw, so this really helped and I will try to use this more frequently. It’s simple and doesn’t take much time or effort. Clever ball and guide and it can be used anytime anywhere! Kindly gifted by FaceGym. Clever little face ball!
