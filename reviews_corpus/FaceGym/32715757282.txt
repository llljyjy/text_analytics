The Electro-Lite cleanser features a formulation of gel to foam. The cleansing action of this product is aided by Exfoliating Biotech Enzyme and Hydroclay, which work together to cleanse and tone the skin’s texture. Red Clover Extract shrinks pores for a smooth complexion and a relaxing combination of Magnesium and Calcium Electrolytes with Bio-compatible Glycolipid cleanses, hydrates, and restores the skin’s top layer at an ideal non-stripping pH level of 5.5.I’ve also heard great things about this cleanser from Sephora, and I’m excited to see the results after a few weeks.*Gifted by FaceGym nan
