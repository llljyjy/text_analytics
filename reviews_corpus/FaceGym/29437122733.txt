This is my first time trying microneedling with vitamin treatment. It’s relatively easy to use and very effective in exfoliating the skin and gives it a natural glow. However, it is quite expensive considering you’ll have to purchase additional ampoule refills.  I received this set complimentary from Facegym. nan
