I have been using this roller for 2 weeks twice/day after cleansing, and have definitely noticed a difference in how long my (chronically dry) skin stays hydrated for. I am thinking the micro channels created by the micro-needling roller itself have contributed to a higher level of skincare absorption, which has translated into firmer, more hydrated skin. My face glows now! All in all, the results are noticeable with regular use – so you can bet I’ll be replenishing when this roller device’s life has come to an end. Highlight recommend for all my other fellow dry skin types out there! Helps Other Skincare Products Penetrate Better
