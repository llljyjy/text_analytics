This is such a great cleanser for your face. I absolutely love when cleansers donâ€™t just clean your face but also have extra skin benefits. This cleanser did a good job of cleansing my face. I go ahead and remove my makeup prior to washing my face but it worked well with getting the extra things left on my face. I really enjoyed the foam it produced and the brightening effect it gave my skin. This was gifted by FaceGym. Clean it!
