This was definitely an interesting set! I’ve used Gua Sha’s in the past but this was new. I will say the clear bag it came in (and white duster bag that came in) are really cute and something I’ll use in my daily life. I really liked the cleanser and felt like it did a good job cleansing without stripping my face. The moisturizer I liked but I feel like it would be better for those with dry skin compared to combo or oily. It had more a consistency better suited for that. The oily wasn’t my favorite as it was a tiny bit greasy but it did absorb really well once worked into the skin. The ball was interesting. I really liked using it on my chest and neck as I felt like it did a good job with lymph drainage and massage but it was quite awkward on my face. I scanned the helpful QR code on the packaging which brought up a YouTube video showing me how to use it but it still felt awkward. Overall I like the skin care. Definitely interesting!
