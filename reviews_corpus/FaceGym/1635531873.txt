I recently received this Brightening Active roller which was #giftedbyfacegym. I used it in the evening and found that it was quick and painless. I cosmetically needle twice a week and this roller was more gentle that the .30 needles I typically use. I woke to some brightening and my skin felt soft. I don’t typically use my roller and Vitamin C at the same time, but could see how someone new to rolling would benefit from this.  Opening the channels in the skin is great for product absorbtion. I don’t like the fact that the rollers are thrown away after one use. That seems really wasteful. I wish there was a more envirnonmentally friendly way of creating the rollers. Unique Tool
