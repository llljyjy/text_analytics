I received this complimentary from Face Gym and it is a very special serum. It makes my skin look really good and it goes on smoothly. It’s like a water serum to me. Not greasy and I feel it starting to work right away. This is the first time I fell in love with a product so fast. It makes my skin look more even toned and it feels smooth and clean. I use it in the morning and night after I use my cleanser. I even skip my toner. Then I use my moisturizer last. Sometimes I use my Face scrub first but with this product I really don’t need the scrub very often. Incredible Serum
