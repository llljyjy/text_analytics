This was gifted by FaceGym. I have had the chance to give it a go on my neck and jaw specifically.  I’m a new mom and I’m so sore from carrying my baby. This ball is great for relieving tension and just taking a moment for yourself to unclench all of those muscles. The fact that it helps rejuvenate my skincare routine is a bonus!
