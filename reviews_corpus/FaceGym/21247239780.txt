i was looking for something as an alternative to botox since i recently read terrible things about muscle atrophy when using it and this seemed like the perfecttt thing. it feels SO great to release tension and it really feels like itâ€™s working. my skin feels plump yet drained when done - love it so much!!! in loveee
