I’m surprised by results. Just wow. First of all, it’s pretty easy in use, easy to put needles and glycolic acid. I was very careful, my face got really red and got itchy, but it disappeared quickly. As a result the skin has become more even, younger looking, skin looks like I got a lift, I’m really pleased. I have a lot of mimic wrinkles and fine lines and I feel like it helps to reduce them or at least visibly makes them disappear. Worth it
