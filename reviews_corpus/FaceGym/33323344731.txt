I’m going to give a super honest and genuine review. I was gifted this complimentary from face gym. I was super excited to try this product as it appears high end and there’s been lots of hype about this brand. I followed all instructions and was incredibly disappointed. It feels like absolutely nothing is transferring onto your face. During the dry roll I felt my face and nothing had gotten onto it. The amount of actual “tiny bits of infused product” that they say is in there is definitely not evident. Then it’s hard to tell once you add your own serum if any product from the roller is coming on your face. The roller as is looks very nice, but as an actual face product does not work at all and is definitely not worth the price. I would not recommend this at all. do not recommend
