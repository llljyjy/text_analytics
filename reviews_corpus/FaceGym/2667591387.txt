This tool is a game changer. If youâ€™re doing gua sha or face fitness as part of your skincare routine. You will need to try this. It is so easy to use with versatile edges to achieve so many techniques. (Check out QR code on the pouch, helps a ton) It feels cleaner than the jade/crystal stone in my opinion.. also it is WAY easier to clean! I got this gifted by FaceGym but all thoughts are my own. Game changer for guasha routine
