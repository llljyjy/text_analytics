*gifted by FaceGym for my honest review! I’ve never tried ‘microneedling’ before so I was hesitant to use this but I’m glad I did because I loved the way it felt on my skin and made my skin look! I started using this roller once a week (PM skincare routine). The steps I followed are CLEANSE, then use this roller on my dry skin (gently holding skin taut), apply SERUM, then use the roller again, and finish with my fave MOISTURIZER. It felt like a deep massage everytime I used it! The results I got after using this is definitely noticeable! My face looks way more plumped! Love that the roller is also disposable so it’s definitely hygienic! Intimidating at first but it works!
