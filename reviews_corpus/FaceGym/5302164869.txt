I was gifted by FaceGym their Face Sculpt Set and I am loving it! The Electro-lite Enzyme Brightening Cleanser is so gentle on the skin and a you can really see a difference after using it! The Face Coach Lifting Oil makes your skin plump and moisturized so you can easily use the Face Ball Tension Release Ball to lift and stretch the tension you have in your face! The ball is great for sinuses and helping your skin to relax at the end of the day! After I use the ball I finish with the Supreme Restructure Collagen Boosting Cream and I wake up the next day with glowing, refreshed and smooth skin! nan
