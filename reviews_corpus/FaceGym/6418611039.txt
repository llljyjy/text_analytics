*complimentary from face gym.I’ve been using both the hydrating and brightening rollers for a few weeks and definitely feel like my skin is healthy. I’ve been experiencing a lot of breakouts these past couple of months and using these Facegym rollers seems like it’s offsetting it’s normal cycle! Love it so much and am glad that I have the opportunity to experience it without going in! Offsetting my normal skin cycle!
