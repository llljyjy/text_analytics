The FACESHOT is an amazing at-home device that gives you expert results. Itâ€™s a really unique system that combines microneedling with a serum treatment. The needles and ampules are one-time use only as well as individually sealed. It is fairly easy to set up and use. There are 4 speed settings and the included microneedle cartridges are .25 mm. This really helps to improve the overall appearance and texture of the skin. It makes skin brighter, smoother, and softer. A charging cable, 3 ampoules, and 3 microneedle cartridges are included. nan
