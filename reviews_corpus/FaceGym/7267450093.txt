This tool helps so much to scuplt my face, remove inflamation and depuffs. I love to keep it in the fridge and use first thing in the morning to get the circulation flowing in my face. I also love the many different edges it has and how it can be used from the jawline to the under eyes. I definitely recommend and will be picking one up as a gift for a friend. Full disclosure, this was gifted by FaceGym in exchange for an honest review. nan
