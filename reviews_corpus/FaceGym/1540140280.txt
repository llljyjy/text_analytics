A great product for acne prone, congested skin. This has helped me keep my skin fresh, bright, and clearer. It assists with diminishing breakouts.Thanks to its rich viscous texture it helps with plumping and nourishing the skin. I found this to be sufficient in lieu of serum in warmer weather.However, keep in mind that this formula is very active. I had to resort to using every other day due to redness.All in all it is a great product Great for oily skin
