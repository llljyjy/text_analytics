Someday i hope to get one of their famous facials, but for now i have this cleanser and I love it. It’s a wonderful gentle cleanser that works super well morning or night, is great for post work out sweat and end of day grease. I do recommend if you wear dark eye make up or stubborn lipstain, you may want to use an oil cleanser or make up remover first, but this cleanser does work if you double up the amount around the eyes. it doesn’t sting my skin and is so gentle, it definitely doesn’t have strong acids which is great for when my skin barrier is broken I love Face Gym
