I was looking for something to give my dull lack luster skin with sun spots a more natural glow and definitely feel I found it in the new gifted by Face Gym Brightening Active Roller. It comes with a handle and two roller heads in the package and I used it once a week applying by rolling horizontally and vertically across my face for about a total of 10 minutes as it says to do. I was really excited about this product because not only is it a micro needling tool it combines potent crystalized active ingredients that are delivered into the skin through those 3,000 tiny microneedles. I have to say that Iâ€™m impressed with the ingredients of vitamin c, tranexamic acid, and licorice rice extract which definitely have left my skin glowing and brighter! My skin also looks and feels plumper too which I love! Brighter skin made easy!
