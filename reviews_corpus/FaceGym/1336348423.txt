Recently, FaceGym gifted me their intriguing product: the Face Ball to honestly review. The idea of their Face Ball is very interesting. The FaceGym Face Ball is said to help relieve tension, improve muscle tone, and stimulate circulation with use. The exercises that the QR code include, or what they call “ball stretches,“ are supposed to act as a warm-up session for the face while boosting lymphatic drainage to prep the skin for a training workout followed by the application of heavier creams or serums.Honestly, I didn’t see any immediate visible changes nor did I expect to since this is a “workout.“ I did find that the Face Ball was easy to use and the instructions were easy to follow. While the Face Ball itself has a nice texture and is easy to maneuver around the face to complete the recommended exercises, I did find it a little on the larger side for my hands/face and probably could have used a slightly smaller size.Also, I didn’t notice a difference in the absorption of products such as heavier creams or serums either but it’s hard to say after a few uses because essentially this is a facial workout and it’s hard to expect immediate results from any workout in general.Overall, it’s a really interesting product/concept and I don’t really expect any visible results for a while so I will continue to use the FaceGym Face Ball and hope for any results. I would recommend this product for someone looking to try something new or wanting to add something fun to their skincare routine. Interesting product and concept
