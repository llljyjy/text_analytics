This FaceGym gua sha is made of high quality stainless steel, which helps prevent bacterial buildup and long term tool damage. Let me also add that this tool is heavy and sturdy! They conveniently added a QR code tutorial located on their ecofriendly pouch which allows proper usage and tips/tricks with using their gua sha  if you feel like you’re not using the tool correctly. The gua sha tool has 5-6 different “shapes“ for each part of your face. Literally no face left out, so those tutorials come in extra handy!  Can’t wait to see some major changes in the future! *complimentary from FaceGym* nan
