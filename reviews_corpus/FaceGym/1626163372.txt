This was gifted by FaceGym. I was a bit nervous trying the micro rollers, but I can say I will continue to use this in my beauty routine. I noticed brighter skin, and it helped my hyperpigmentation spot! It is a little prickly but it’s nice because we can control the pressure we apply. My face was a bit red for an hour or two after the treatment, but the following week my skin was wonderful! I love that the handle is reusable and I’ll have to gift my sister one of these so she can have this glow too! nan
