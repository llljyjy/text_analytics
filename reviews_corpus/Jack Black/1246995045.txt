I have been searching for a lip balm with SPF that was also super hydrating, and this is the one! Others in this category are great at protecting but still really drying, and this little beauty is my lip moisturizer of choice over all others. Itâ€™s AMAZING overnight, leaves lips super moisturized. It has zero taste or smell (the Shea option, not sure about others). I only wish these came in color and I would snap all of those up too! BEST BALM EVER!!
