TLDR at the end! Long review incoming!Let me start by saying I have the driest lips of anybody I know. They get so dry that sometimes my top lip literally loses feeling because it’s just a layer of dead or dehydrated skin. I have tried probably 80 different brands in the last few years trying to find a balm that works to hydrate these languished lips without also breaking out the area around my mouth (particularly when I was wearing a mask constantly, but also because I’m a Face Sleeper™.) This balm works wonders for me. It’s the best thing I’ve used in years. The *scent* is really beautiful and the finish is fine, although I’d prefer if it was slightly glossier (but that’s a nitpick.)The reason I believe this isn’t quite a holy grail is because the sunscreen taste is absolutely undeniable. A lot of other reviews mention that it isn’t bad, which is curious to me because I find it approaching a level I consider to be overwhelming. It’s also especially curious because you can’t SMELL it! It’s only in the taste. However, I still absolutely recommend it if you have dry lips that nothing seems to work on. This really has made me feel so much more confident not having a Crusty Lip™ TLDR: if you don’t mind a pretty strong sunscreen taste, this is literally the best lip balm I’ve ever used as far as functionality is concerned. Approaching Holy Grail, but Sunscreen Taste
