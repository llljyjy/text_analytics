I have been using this product for probably 8 years at this point. It is my absolute holy grail. I’ve tried as many scents as possible and love the shea and grapefruit best! I am a chronic lip picker and biter, to the point of bleeding, and the feeling of scabs and dry lips from this habit is what continues the cycle for me. With this lip balm my lips ACTUALLY heal. It’s thick and has really long staying power too meaning you don’t need to reapply like crazy to keep your lips feeling soft. I am a chronic chapstick user, I’ve tried fresh, vaseline, drugstore, basically everything, and year after year I still come back to this. I give it as gifts all the time and turn everyone I know onto it. Plus I’m a broke college student so the fact that it’s a little pricey for a chapstick and I keep coming back has to say something! Even my chapstick hating girlfriend has one that she loves and uses. I have one for my purse, by my bed, my car, bathroom, etc., and it really is just the best. Do yourself a favor and try it ah!!!!!! HOLY GRAIL LIP BALM
