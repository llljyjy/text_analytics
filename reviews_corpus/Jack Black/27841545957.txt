At first, I thought this was way too thick and left a weird cast, BUT because it is so moisturizing you only need a really thin layer and it lasts for hours! If you find it is too thick when you first try it, start with a layer you think might be TOO thin, spread and layer as needed.(Tried the shea butter & E.) Very hydrating & lasts so long!
