Amazing. I received two little sample packets. It’s worth noting, I do not have acne prone skin at all. I have completely blemish free skin that doesn’t even produce it’s own oil anymore thanks to a round on accutane years ago. But, I do have acne scars. And I recall when I did have acne, salicylic face washed would “shrink“ my scars overnight sometimes. SO, I gave this a go at the risk of my already dry skin becoming dryer. Not the case. I slathered this thick cream on at night before bed, and woke up to my skin LITERALLY feeling beyond soft, and INSANELY shiny/glowy. Woah. What a product. Instant love. I have my eyes on the full tube. I think i’d use it every other night, though. I don't even have acne but..
