My husband has tried a few different skincare products, but this brand seems to accommodate him best. He works heavy bridge building, so he comes home covered in concrete, mud, and sweat everyday. Jack Black is the ONLY product line that actually cleanses his skin. In fact, even with all the dirt and grime his skin is still better than mine! And when he doesnâ€™t have his products to use, it shows in his skin instantly! A favorite for years now! He always goes back to this.
