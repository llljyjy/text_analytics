I have had intensely dry lips in winter for years. To the point of cracking and bleeding. I had tried everything - Vaseline, lanolin, aquaphor, every lip balm and chap stick on the market. This has worked best. Iâ€™ve purchased probably 8 tubes so far. I have used some up completely, and I also keep them all over my apartment and in my purse. I will never stop buying these! The blackberry is my favorite in summer, and I like the shea butter one in winter. Highly recommend! nan
