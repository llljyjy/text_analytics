This is an awesome lip balm. Other SPF lip balms I’ve used leave white cast, aren’t hydrating enough, or don’t stay on for very long. This lip balm is great to use during the day along with my other SPF products and is very hydrating. I live somewhere where temperatures get up to 120 degrees and being able to have a lip balm in a tube like this is a huge benefit. I know it won’t melt and make a mess in my hiking pack or car if I accidentally leave it in the heat. Lip SPF is so underrated and so important. nan
