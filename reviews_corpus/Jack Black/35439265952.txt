Now this is what I call a great lip treatment! It’s just my kind of thing - natural ingredients, decent SPF, compact, not too expensive and a unique minty flavor. The spf25 is protective enough for the hot/sunny Florida climate I’m exposed to every day, and it smells and tastes refreshing! This works better than other lip balms/treatments that are double and triple the price. Oh and did I mention it actually works?! One very minor gripe is the tube it comes in (always got to cut in half to get the last of it out) but that’s so minor you can forget I just mentioned it!
