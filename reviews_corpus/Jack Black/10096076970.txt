This is by far my favorite lip balm. It is very hydrating and nourishing without being sticky. It’s definitely a bit of a thicker formulation but I personally really like that. And there is SPF! I couldn’t ask for more. I am planning on buying several more so I can stock them at work and in every purse I own. The best.
