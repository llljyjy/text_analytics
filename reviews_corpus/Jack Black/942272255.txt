So I will admit up front that I am a sucker for traditionally “girlie“ lip glosses; the fruitier, the better. That said, I’m perpetually in search of a lip balm that’s moisturizing and comfortable; one that’s not too sticky and doesn’t eventually dry out. I’m also ridiculously susceptible to packaging: Sleek tubes, doe-footed wands, maybe even shimmer.I never would have gravitated toward this line, but after another product left my lips dry and peeling, I started researching, and Jack Black’s lip balms were highly recommended. I ordered the Natural Mint and loved it -- it’s soothing, but not greasy; the smell is pleasant but fades almost immediately, so it’s unobtrusive. I have since ordered a value set that includes other flavors, and they’re all great. While I still love my more glamorous lip products (NARS, Dior, Fresh), this balm is one that I always have on hand -- on the kitchen counter, end table, vanity, and purse. A Holy Grail Balm
