This eye cream has a nice creamy texture and is super lightweight. I feel like it melts right into the skin without a greasy feeling. I feel that even though it’s lightweight it still leaves my skin feeling moisturize throughout the day. I find that this eye balm works great under makeup and doesn’t cause my concealer to move. I haven’t seen any changes in my skin since wearing but it is also to early to tell. Great product!
