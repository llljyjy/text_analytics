I got this once I started going to the gym more and just quickly wanted to do a quick ‘face wash’ in the gym after my workout. It got the job done for me to be able to finish errands throughout the day without feeling grimey. I’m more oily, so the fact that this is milky just let’s me put on sunscreen and I’m hydrated enough. There’s no scent to this. The texture is like runny, creamy milk- I know, odd that yeah. You don’t need lots depending on what you’re removing. I only use sunscreen and I’m getting rid of the sweat so that’s as far as I am using this product. Sometimes my friends and I get drunk and we paint our eyelids Euphoria style and this has always gotten off the make up! I would use a cotton pad and drop like 2-5 (depending on desired saturation) and just rub the pad so the product gets absorbed by the pad and just gently rub around. I clean around my eyes, it hasn’t gotten me irritated yet. Leaves me feeling very refreshed and ready for sunscreen or facial spray. Depends how spicy I’m feeling Gentle and effective. Non eye irritating
