This was my first ever Drunk Elephant product and I understand the hype now! I used this product last night, after doing my night time skincare and woke up with my skin thriving. I had some active pimples on my chin and decided to use this to see what it will do. I woke up the next morning and my pimples were so much smaller and dried out! My skin also looks brighter and even. This product was only used once and I already see an improve! Just make sure to hydrate your skin afterwards because it did dry out my skin a bit. However, I truly recommend this product! Overnight Results!
