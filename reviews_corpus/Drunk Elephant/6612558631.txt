I really love how clean this retinol formula is! It’s perfect for those with dry skin since it has Marula oil and ceramides and I like that it lists the actual percentage of retinol since some retinols don’t list that important piece of information. I gave this to my mom to try since she has been use a 0.3% retinol and was trying to increase the strength she uses. She mixes 2-3 drops with moisturizer at night and the fact that this comes in an oil vehicle, my mom said her skin is a lot softer and it looks more glowy than before! Only thing is I’m skeptical to use it myself because I have acne prone skin that breaks out immediately from Marula oil nan
