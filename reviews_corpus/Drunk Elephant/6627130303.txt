This has to be the worst cleansing balm I’ve ever used. I would give it zero stars if I could—but since I can’t, I guess the one star will be for the packaging. I like that there is a magnetic applicator. I wish I had tried this when I first got it because then I could have returned it. This is THE GREASIEST cleansing balm I’ve ever tried and I had a tacky film left on my face after rinsing it off, which took several passes of water just to get the balm off before I could go in with my regular cleanser. Anyway, I’m shocked that this has 4-stars. Most positive reviews must be incentivized because there’s no way even someone with the driest of skin would like this (I have normal leaning dry skin) LOL Do yourself a favor and get the ELF Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm for $11 OR if you must get something from Sephora, get the Farmacy Green Clean. Avoid this one at all costs. WORST EVER
