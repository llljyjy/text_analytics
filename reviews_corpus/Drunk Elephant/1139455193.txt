I’m loving this retinol oil so far! I’ve been using this everyday for 2 weeks and my skin really likes it. I have highly reactive dry sensitive skin that is recovering from another product and this oil has been helping with the recovery. My skin has been super dry recently, between having Invisalign and wearing an n95 for work, and this has been helping improve moisture, glow and diminishing the flaky skin around my mouth. A previous product from another brand I was using had made my forehead dry and wrinkly and this oil + their lala moisturizer has been saving my skin. Thankfully, I don’t notice a smell like others have but I have more of an aversion to perfumed skincare products. I definitely recommend to try this! nan
