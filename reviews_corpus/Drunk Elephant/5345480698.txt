I received  this product from Influenster for my honest opinion. After using it the past few weeks I am pleased with it but not overwhelmed.  It is a bit pricey.  It is more of a night cream in my opinion because it is thick.  Would I purchase it again? Probably not. However if you like the ingredient list, look for unscented products then this could be for you! Decent face cream
