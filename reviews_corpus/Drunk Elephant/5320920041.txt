This was my first time using a Drunk Elephant product and it’s wonderful! I’ve always heard amazing things about this brand, but didn’t have the heart to spend copious amounts of money on a single product. Now I understand why they are a little pricey… this eye cream is hydrating and so smooth on my skin. I’m turning 30 next month and really want to focus on anti-aging products. This Packaging is efficient and I can throw it in my makeup bag or purse for overnight trips. I’m a fan of Drunk Elephant now! * I got this complimentary of Influenster and Drunk Elephant for my honest review. Love this!
