This moisturizer is the best for sensitive and acne prone skin. I love how it glides smoothly without making skin look oily. A little amount goes a long way! Also love that it does not have any fragrance, makes it the best night time skin care routine product! My skin feel really soft and plump in the mornings. I use this along with the Drunk Elephant night serum. Love it
