This gives me a nice glow and subtle tan, I mix it in with my sunscreen, the elta md one, but the color is very subtle. I’m quite fair, but I have to use 2-3 drops for a noticeable color change. I like it, but I’m not sure it’s worth the price, especially for only 1 oz. Nice subtle bronze, but spendy for the amount
