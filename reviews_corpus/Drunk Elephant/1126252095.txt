This product has high quality packaging (I liked mixing it myself and that it then isn’t sitting on a shelf breaking down before you start using). It goes on nicely, the strong odor is weird but fades quickly, and it absorbs quickly, and, for me, worked well under makeup. I definitely didn’t notice any change in my skin after ~1 month of diligent daily use. I know it might take longer. I did feel like my skin has been a bit more hydrated but I think that is the seasonal change from early the late spring that coincided with my trying this and the cranked up humidity of the warmer months here in the southeast. I’m not going to return; I’ll definitely use it up and will update if my assessment changes. My derm did recommended this and I do think it is one of the well intentioned, best formulated ones out there. But based on my research on vitamin C (yes, a fab antioxidant and great in a petri dish but really challenging to get into skin in a functional form and pretty humble empirical backing in actual people) and the price point, I won’t be adding this to my routine and hoping for subtle, long-term benefits in years to come just because my skin tolerates it well. I might try one of the cheaper vitamin C serum that Dr. Dray has said are as good (although she is not a vit C promoter given scant in vivo evidence of efficacy). If someone were to supply me with this for free, I would use it! And maybe it will be one of those things where when I stop using it, I will realize it was doing something and then I’ll update :) Feels fine but didn't notice any difference
