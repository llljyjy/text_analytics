This is the first time having retinol in an oil. I’m use to it being in a serum or cream. My skin has a tendency to get oily throughout the day/night so I mixed this with a cream. I felt as though this product is nice mild retinol treatment, which is nice. You can notice your skin does develop a glow after a few uses. I would say the price is right for the amount you get especially when you take in account you’re only using a few drops at a time. Different but good!
