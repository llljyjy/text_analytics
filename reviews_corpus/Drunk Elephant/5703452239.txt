I got a sample size of this and thought I would try it for fun. I put it on and omg.. it stung quite a bit. I only left it on for maybe 5-8 mins and then decided I didn’t want to risk it so I washed it off and put Marula oil on after like the instructions suggest. Next day, my skin is sooooo smooth I just can’t believe it. I’m someone who uses chemical exfoliants but have never noticed such a difference. Crazy good stuff, I will be buying the full size product. shocking
