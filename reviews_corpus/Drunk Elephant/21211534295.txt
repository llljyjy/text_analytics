I don’t have much of a skincare routine so I was excited to get this and try it out. I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and have noticed a difference in my face. I feel like it’s overall smoother and I can tell that’s it’s starting to get brighter. I use 2 drops and mix it with my moisturizer for a more even application. I can’t wait to continue to use this to see if my face improves even more! The packaging is also cute. I loved the neon box! nan
