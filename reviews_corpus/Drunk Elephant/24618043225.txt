Have been using for over a month. Cannot really see any difference. It is initially greasy but gets better in 15-20 mins. The serum is runny, and it sticks to my palm and half of one pump goes waste each time.  At this point, Neither do I like it nor dislike it. I don’t think I’ll but another bottle once I finish the current one. nan
