These bars far surpassed my expectations! I use the light bar first to remove makeup and follow up with the brown to exfoliate and its been working wonderfully. They clean off (non waterproof) makeup/ sweat/ sunscreen sufficiently and have never left my skin feeling dry or stripped which is saying a lot to me because soap BARS are notorious for this. I started using them 5/8 and now reordering on 8/14, they arenâ€™t gone yet but getting close, been using twice a day. Honestly for the price and convenient size I would never order full size, they last so long and they fit nicely in the leftover soap tins from LUSH that I keep them in. Impressive little bars !
