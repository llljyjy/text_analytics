This is the best gentle, yet effective retinol I have ever tried. It actually convinced me to try more drunk elephant products. I use baby facial once a week, take a day break with just moisturizing products (the Marula oil) then this retinol the rest of the week. Highly recommend. Especially for people with tiny bumps or textured skin. Gentle and Highly Effective
