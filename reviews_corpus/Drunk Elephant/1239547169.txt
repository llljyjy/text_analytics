This is perfect set to try out before taking a plunge on the full sizes. I fell in love with the serum after a week of use. Iâ€™m still seeing if I love the moisturizer or not. But the serum is amazing. I purchased the serum full size and very happy with it. Did not disappoint me. Very light weigh. No weird smell. My skin felt super soft and supple. nan
