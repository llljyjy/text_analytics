I have used this product for years and it was a favorite of mine. The change in formula to the self-mixing is awful. It is extremely runny and sprays everywhere when it hits my hand if I’m not careful about the angle. Also it has acquired buildup on the nozzle where it comes out of, which is a hard, grainy white substance and I have to scrape that off every few weeks. I can’t say that I’m definitely seeing the same results as before either. I can’t recommend the new formula. New formula is a bust
