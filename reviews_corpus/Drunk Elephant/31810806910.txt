First of all, the twist-to-close top is life changing and pure genius! Perfect for traveling as you donâ€™t have to worry about an accidental spill that occurs with most traditional pumps. The product itself is exactly what I look for with an eye cream. It is very moisturizing around my eye area, without irritation. The smell is very minimal and kinda has a mild nutty scent. This is my first time trying a Drunk Elephant product and I definitely see what all the hype is about! nan
