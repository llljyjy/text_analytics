This cream is great, and I’ve used it for a long time.. but the price tag is outrageous. I had issues with the last 2 jars I bought: the pump was not dispensing, and I opened up the jars to reveal there was more than plenty product inside. It was upsetting to reveal a full jar of product, and knowing if I didn’t pry it open.. it would’ve been thrown away. I don’t trust D.E. after having this experience multiple times. The price is too much, and I am much happier with the Skinfix cream; the Pacifica Youth Lotus is also great, for a tight budget. Nice cream, nice formula, but poor packaging + outrageous price - 2 stars. Huge fan to meh.
