I absolutely LOVE this oil. I was already a big fan of DE Marula oil but I never would have thought it could be even better with retinol! Iâ€™ve tried using retinols to lighten my acne scaring in the past but it can be so intimidating. This was the perfect beginner retinol for me. It has lightened and brightened my skin without any irritation. I mix a few drops in with the Lala Retro moisturizer and it moisturizes the skin in such a heavenly way. My skin has never looked so youthful. This is definitely a new staple product in my skin care routine. Great Beginner Retinol!
