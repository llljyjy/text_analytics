I loved the previous formula, had no problem with keeping it refrigerated. This new formula is super watery & the packaging is terrible. I am wasting so much product bc it’s dripping out. This morning when I used it the top completely stuck, so much product has leaked out I can’t even close it. Not worth it if all the product is just leaking all over my bathroom cabinet. Why?
