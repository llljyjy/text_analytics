Have been using for about 6 weeks now and I quite like it. I wasn’t sure where to put this in my routine because I already use another stronger retinol product nightly, so I put 2 drops in my daytime moisturizer. I haven’t noticed anything in terms of results but I’m sure that’s because I have already been using retinol for the last 6 years or so. This didn’t cause any dryness or irritation for me, and it didn’t make my skin feel oily. I also didn’t experience any breakouts or skin purging, but you may if this is your first retinol. I don’t think I’ll be repurchasing this but only because I already have my HG retinol. No dryness, sensitivity or purging here.
