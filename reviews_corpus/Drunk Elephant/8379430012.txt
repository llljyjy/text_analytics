I have been using this product for the past 3 years, and it has truly worked for me. I first started with the other moisturizer by Drunk Elephant (with the real packaging), but it wasnâ€™t hydrating enough for my dry skin. I use this twice a day, only wash my face once, and it has prevented me from breakouts and consistent acne. I still have to use a skin salve in super dry spots, but overall it is a great product. For those with extra dry skin like me, I still recommend using a hydrating serum before applying the cream. Years later, still use it!
