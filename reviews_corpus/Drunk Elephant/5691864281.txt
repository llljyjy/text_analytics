I previously loved this product. I used some cheaper vitamin C products for a year or two but continued to want this one again. I was not aware of new self mixing system. I loved the concept but am disappointed with the consistency- very watery . I believe I mixed it correctly. It’s a rush to get it on your face before it drips off your fingers it’s so thin. I won’t buy it again sadly although I did feel the older product did help brighten my aging dry skin! nan
