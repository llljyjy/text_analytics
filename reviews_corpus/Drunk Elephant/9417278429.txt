I love this product! I have been using makeup wipes forever and found them to be very drying, and I heard that makeup remover balms are better for your skin so I decided to try this. I have found a little amount goes a long way, and this product seems to just melt all of my makeup off. It leaves my skin feeling more hydrated than if I had used a makeup wipe. I’ve not experienced any breakouts or eye irritation/sensitivity due to this product. I have found this product works best if you warm it up between your fingers before applying it. My only complaint would be that because it is an oil-based balm it doesn’t mix well with water, so the only way I’ve found to effectively remove the makeup is by using a washrag. However, I’ve never noticed any staining on my rags after being washed. Love this product!!!
