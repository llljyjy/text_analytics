I’ve tried using less expensive micellar waters, cleansing oils, and balms. This is worth the money. A little bit goes a long way. It is gentle on my sensitive skin (I don’t use the Bamboo Booster), and it literally melts off my makeup and sunscreen. Plus, it just feels luxurious at the end of a long day. You get what you pay for!
