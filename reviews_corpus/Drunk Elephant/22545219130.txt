Not a holy holy grail, but I don’t hate it. It’s gotten me over the hump of retinol adjusting and my skin does feel supply, dewy, and nice when using! Nothing offensive about smell or texture, but product gauging can be difficult. Takes a while to rub in the white cast if too much is used (and I’m white AF to start with!)Overall great moisturizer for the day and a staple in my routine. nan
