I received this DE eye balm free from Influenster. I’m in love with how moisturizing and nourishing this eye cream is! The texture is super creamy and feels oh so good on the skin. Because it’s wonderfully thick it does take a minute or two to completely absorb. I usually have to use 2 different eye products to get this kind of hydration and moisture. I love using this cream after a restless night because it helps perk up my eye area. This formula is definitely a winner! The packaging is also a winner! I love the twist top and pump. A half a pump gives me the perfect amount for both my eyes. The only con is the price tag. Is it worth it? If I’m being 100% honest no it’s not. Will I purchase it? Only if I can get it on sale. Super Moisturizing
