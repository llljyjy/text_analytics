I recieved this complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I have to say this is my newfound holy grail product and I am sooo glad I got to try it out! It comes in super cute recyclable packaging that was almost too pretty to open. The product itself is formulated with vegan retinol and marula oil, as well as a couple other wonderfully clean ingredients. I love that the retinol is not only vegan, but it is also the most gentle, yet effective, retinol I have ever used on my sensitive, fair skin! I have red hair and freckles, and I have noticed a big change in my freckles and sun damage. My freckles have lightened and my hyperpigmentation has smoothed out significantly. I have been using this nightly for the past 4 weeks and I will absolutely be purchasing more once I run out. Another amazing thing aboit this prouct though is that it only takes 2 to 3 drops to completely cover my entire face. I usually use 1 additional drop for my neck and decollete’ area as well. The benefits of using this product have been endless and I really can’t say enough good things about it. It hydrates my combination skin thouroughly, but doesn’t leave a greasy residue like a lot of facial oils I’ve tried have. My skin looks brightened and refreshed and the few fine lines I have are plumped and unnoticable... even at 40 years old! If you get a chance to, I would highly suggest picking this up and trying it out for yourself. Oh, and did I mention it helps with breakouts and acne scars too! This product does it all! Not a nad price point for all clean ingredients and the endless benefits it has for your skin. I will be recommending this to everyone I know! Holy grail facial oil!!
