Love this! Perfect if you need to bronze up your current foundation for summer. I hate having to buy a new expensive foundation/tinted moisturizer for the summer when I get darker on my body. So I just mix a little bit of this in with my foundation (it’s very pigmented don’t need much). I haven’t tried it yet on my body mixed with moisturizer but I would imagine it looks great too beautiful and perfect for summer/vacations
