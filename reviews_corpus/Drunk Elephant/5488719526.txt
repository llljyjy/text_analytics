I think this would be good for people who don’t already use a retinol or are looking to work their way up to using a 1%. Skin didn’t feel dry or flakey, my skin didn’t purge but I’ve been using a stronger retinol for a couple years now. Over all good retinol for people that are interested without it being super irritating on the skin! great for beginners!
