I never write reviews, but I live this product so much I had to share. I bought the product after trying Tatcha Violet C serum as I wasn’t impressed with it. The Drunk Elephant C-Firma has definitely brightened my skin and made my skin tone more even. My dark spots have faded a bit but I’ve only been using it for 2 weeks and look forward to the results after longer use. I highly recommend giving it a try. nan
