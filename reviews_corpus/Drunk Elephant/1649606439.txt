I might be one of the few who doesn’t like this cream. I was expecting something really amazing with all the reviews but was very underwhelmed. First it’s way thicker than I expected it to be. It almost has a goopy texture. I’m use to more of a lotion texture. For the price? Absolutely not. I will stick with my Clinique dramatically different lotion which I actually prefer. Not my favourite.
