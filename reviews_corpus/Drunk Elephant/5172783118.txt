I was kinda shocked that this was a retinol in oil form! Definitely new to me as all the retinol I’ve used has been a cream or serum. I do really like the way it feels on my skin but I’m super oily so I’ve been using it at night and not during the day. Love the way it feels on my skin but haven’t used it enough to see a huge difference yet, will keep using! really like it so far!
