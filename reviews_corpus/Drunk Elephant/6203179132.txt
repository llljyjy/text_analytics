I’ve use this product for a few weeks and really enjoy the moisture It provides to my under eye area. The container is really nice and makes it easy to apply. It’s nice to apply & doesn’t feel thick/heavy. I have sensitive skin and this does not affect my skin in any negative way. I recommend it for anyone looking for under eye cream. Great eye balm
