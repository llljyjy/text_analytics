WHY mess with this once-perfect product?! I’ve purchased this so many times and loved it. This time though, the spoon is no longer magnetic...okay not a big deal. But the product is so much more solid/hard to scrape out, even more difficult to get on skin, and doesn’t come off as cleanly as before. So, so sad. WHY
