Beautiful packaging though I’m not sure it’s the best for efficacy of the product being that it is a retinol I believe it should be in a sealed bottle but being that it’s a oil I think it was produced this way for efficiency purposes, my skin definitely feels smoother and glowy . Looking forward to seeing more results overtime as a product like this does take time to see full results Smells pleasant (can irritate skin ) USE WITH SPF. Highly recommended easily accessible to many . Use as directed Gorgeous Oil
