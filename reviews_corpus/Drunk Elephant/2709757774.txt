I’m a huge DE fan and have tried the other 2 eye products despite the very rational advice that a specific eye cream is not needed. Didn’t notice much of a difference using the other two and have not replaced them, instead I’m just using Protini + B-Hydra mixed together all over my face.  But with the weather changing this fall, the skin around my eyes was feeling constantly irritated and I wanted to try something with a little more oomph there.  I ordered this last week and coming back now to order a backup to get me through the winter.  It’s much heavier than the other 2 eye products, so would not be great for some skin types.  But for me, with late 40s, oily/combo skin, it has completely banished that dry, irritated feeling so I’m a happy camper. Great heavier eye cream for cooler weather
