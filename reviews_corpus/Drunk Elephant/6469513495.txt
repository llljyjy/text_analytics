I genuinely love this product. A bit expensive but SO worth it. I struggle with PCOS breakouts and large pores. I swear I had overnight results using this. I woke up and my skin looked so refreshed, not blemish free but my skin looked healthy and had a glow to it that I havenâ€™t seen in awhile. I love the design of the bottle and the light scent. I will definitely be purchasing again. So good
