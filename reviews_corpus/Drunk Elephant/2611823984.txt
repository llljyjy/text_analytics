I received this item for free in exchange for my honest feedback. I have fairly dry skin and this was a great moisturizer! I loved how thick and creamy it was and that it never felt greasy on my face. I feel like this would be the perfect moisturizer for the winter months when my skin is more prone to dryness. A winter must have!
