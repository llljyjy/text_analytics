Great product! Not at all drying. I do tend to wear a full face and, I use this as a pre cleanse. It is pricey, but its worth it in comparison to similar luxury products which I have found too drying or contain fragrance. People tend to forget youâ€™re paying for the benefits of cruelty free skin care and everything else DE does. Its also woman owned. 4 stars because its not great at removing eye make up lol but as I mentioned, great as a pre cleanse. nan
