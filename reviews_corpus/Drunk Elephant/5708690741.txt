I didnâ€™t love this product as much is I hoped I would. I have fairly dry skin in the winter months and this was recommended to help with that. I really didnt find it helped at all and it didnt glide on the skin nicely so I felt I needed to use a lot of it to cover my entire face and neck. For the price I didnt think it was worth it (compared to other more affordable serums I have tried). Perhaps this is better for more long term purposes. I do like the packaging and that the smell is very minimal/non existent. Didnt love, didnt hate
