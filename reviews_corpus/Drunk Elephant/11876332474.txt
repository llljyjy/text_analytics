I’ve really enjoyed this eye cream so far. First and foremost, it has great ingredients (ceramides, etc.) and is fragrance free. I also think the packaging is clever and unique. To open, you rotate the top of the product and the pump raises up. The eye cream itself is on the heavier side (which I welcome) and very moisturizing. One pump provides enough product to use under both eyes and on each brow bone. I gave the product 4 stars because I don’t think there’s anything necessarily in this product specifically for your eyes that you couldn’t find in a nice moisturizer. But I would recommend this product! I’m a fan. Moisturizing Eye Cream!
