I got this free from Influenster, it works great on my dry skin and it’s a good retinol in oil. I use the Paula’s choice BHA so I have to switch the two products so I don’t mix the acids but it’s been really great for my skin! I use it last and it takes a bit to sink in but otherwise I love it love this oil
