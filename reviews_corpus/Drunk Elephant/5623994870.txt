This is a staple part of my routine to de-scale my face and on my underarms to help minimize ingrown hairs the day after shaving. I use it twice a week in cooler weather and once per week in warmer weather so the one ounce size lasts me a year. I noticed an immediate improvement after one use and my skin absorbs other products better after using this. I am careful not to use any cleansers that have active ingredients (such as tea tree) before applying this to my skin and follow up with the marula oil mixed with aloe vera gel. I have no reason to swap this out for something else because this has worked consistently for three years. I am a Black American with oily, acne prone skin. My Holy Grail Night Serum
