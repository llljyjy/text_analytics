Ive been struggling with skin irritation for the past year: red scaly patches, flaking itchy eyelids, acne, dryness, eczema, and uneven texture. I’ve tried so many fancy serums and moisturizers with cleansers from Cetaphil, Cerave, and The Ordinary... Nothing was calming my angry skin! Finally, I wanted to try something completely different, and gave a bar cleanser a try. Overnight (literally) I saw a difference, and it only got better over the next few weeks. The never-ending cycle of flaking eyelids and red eczema spots I could not soothe for a year was healed within a week. The rough uneven surface smoothed over a few weeks. I still get the odd spots here and there, but it definitely did not cause any breakouts. Sure, it’s less tidy on your counter and while travelling, but I’ll take that over any of the skin issues I was having. And I love the silky slippery way it lathers and moves across the face. My only fear is it being discontinued down the line seeing as it’s not as popular as their items, and people get hung up on the bar format. If I could only use 1 Drunk Elephant product, this would be it! Transformational! I pray they never discontinue
