I tried this several times and it was not for me. Trying it on the back of my hand, it seemed fine, but on my face (and using the correct amount) the white cast is unacceptable without makeup and pills on top of all of my moisturizers. If you have very light skin, it may work well, but know that it smells of sunscreen. I would recommend the Innisfree sunscreen in its place.Light/Medium skin toneCombo/oily/dehydrated skin Doesn't work for my skin tone or type.
