After burning my face with a high-strength retinol, the A-Gloei .5% retinol oil was recommended to me by an employee to help work my way back up to a 1%. I fell in love with the texture of it, so I got this one for daytime use to avoid overusing retinol again (Drunk Elephant uses Merula oil for both products, so they feel the same). Despite being a skincare addict, I’d never used a facial oil before. I have combo acne-prone skin and was worried that an oil might break me out. Now I don’t know how I was going without it, honestly, and my skin has stayed clear with use. My oily t-zone and dry cheeks seem a lot more balanced as well.This feels “luxurious” as the name states going on. It absorbs nicely, leaving me with unbelievably soft & smooth skin and a serious “glow from within” appearance. It’s also really soothing after a retinol burn and does not cause a stinging sensation.This does everything moisturizing creams fail to do on their own. I use it at the end of my regimen immediately after FAB ultra repairing face cream. Facial oil convert! Combo skin soothed & glowing
