I love the super minimal scent this oil gives off and it is so smooth to apply. I recommend moisturizing your face heavily along with using this product due to it drying out your skin otherwise. I mix this in with my skincare routine 2-3 times a week and I will definitely keep this as a part of my weekly routine. My skin is brighter and smoother as a result of using this in conjunction with my other products and I plan to purchase again! Wonderful product
