I really like the container it comes in. It took me just a second to figure out how to use it. I like how you turn the lid to make the pump pop out. You don’t have to worry about losing a lid or product accidentally get spilled. One pump was enough for both of my eyes. It did hydrate my eyes after using. I still have not noticed much of a difference after using for two week. I did sometimes have a little bit of stinging in my eyes not sure if later during the day product got in the somehow. For the price I probably would not purchase since I haven’t noticed much of any changes. It’s ok…
