I am blown away by this product. With that said, I’m a skincare guru. I research and am constantly trying new actives & products. I have combo skin with mild acne but worst of all- I’m a picker (I know, terrible). It leaves these awful little red marks that take FOREVER to fade, but I just can’t stop myself. I’d seriously heard AMAZING things on Reddit about Azelaic acid for acne & hyperpigmentation/marks. And it lived up to the hype! I applied it at night as the last step of my skincare. It should be said that this is labeled as a “mask“ but its creamy texture & you apply & leave on like any other cream- don’t let that spook you. * THE RESULTS* I woke up in the AM with my marks SIGNIFICANTLY faded... IN ONE NIGHT. They blended into my skin & we’re so much less noticeable. I’m amazed! I’ve researched the ingredients and this thing is PACKED with very well regarded, high quality stuff. I’ll update my review after continued use but... If this is the result I’m seeing after one night- it’s acne sufferers (and pickers) dream! DE with another win! Bravo! Unbelievable OVERNIGHT Results!
