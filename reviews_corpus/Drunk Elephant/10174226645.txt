so I am an absolute skincare fiend. i have high end and low end and have probably tried every product you can imagine. i have acne prone, oily skin so I am REALLY picky about my moisturizers especially (because most cause me to break out). I was using the cerave one (it was the only thing that seemed to not break out my skin) but I got this as part of a trial set for the meet the minis and then again when I bought one of drunk elephants holiday sets. I was honestly unbothered by this and was only going to use it because I got it in these kits. Oh. My. God. I am not someone who believes in buying such an expensive product for something like moisturizer but wow. I was using this under makeup and at night just to use it up and my skin has been SO SMOOTH since I started using this. I sorted out my acne for the most part about two years ago but I still gets small bumps that aren’t really acne. However when I tell you my face has had NO TEXTURE since using this cream I am literally stunned. This has been the only thing I’ve been using consistently that is new and I am really pleasantly surprised. I would really recommend this product and am happy that I tried this out when I normally would have never done so before. wow
