This is a great all around product. To start, the packaging is great and makes it easy to travel with and prevent waste.  It goes on light and has no scent. Your skin is left moisturized and after weeks of use I felt my eyes looked less tired and more youthful. Drunk elephant also avoids harmful ingredients and is truly cruelty free which always makes me a bigger fan. Great eye cream
