I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Drunk Elephant in exchange for an honest review.This eye balm is nice, thick, and creamy without it being greasy or too difficult to fully blend into the skin. It leaves my under eye area feeling moisturized. I’m not quite sure whether or not there have been other improvements other than moisture. I don’t think I would purchase the product on my own due to the price. nan
