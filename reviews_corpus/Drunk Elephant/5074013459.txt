This moisturizing cream is thick and creamy with practically no scent, which I love.  This cream is whipped perfectly and is very moisturizing to my skin without feeling heavy.  It sinks into my skin leaving it looking and feeling hydrated.  It doesnâ€™t irritate my skin and I have very sensitive skin.  It calms my skin down after I use my retinol products.  Sometimes I add a few drops of one of my favorite oils for a deeper hydration at night.  I have very dry skin. Love this moisturizer
