This product is great. Don’t look at is just a way to remove makeup. It does a pretty good job removing makeup, but a gentle face wash after is necessary if you’re removing heavy makeup - which you should be doing after heavy makeup use anyways. I love using this every day in the morning to clean my sensitive skin followed by moisturizer, instead of face wash. It’s very hydrating and does a great job cleaning pores. I also find my moisturizer works even better when I use this as a base. I use kiehls ultra facial cream and Ren gentle cleansing milk face wash. I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin and this combo is doing wonders for me. I only do face wash if I’ve used makeup or if not every other day (trial and error has shown me washing my face when I haven’t used makeup is too harsh and irritates my skin. This product is amazing as a gentle substitute) This is a great product!
