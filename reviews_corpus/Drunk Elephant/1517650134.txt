I have been using this for over a year now. It is the only eye cream that does not irritate my under eye. Helps with my eye bags too! I have tried other creams and because I have such sensitive skin, everything else brings on irritation. A little goes a long way. I use in the am and wait at last an hour before makeup. Amazing!
