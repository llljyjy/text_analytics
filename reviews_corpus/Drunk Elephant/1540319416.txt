I have been a long-time fan of Drunk Elephant products, so I was so excited to try their Ceramighty AF Eye Cream. I like that it is light and applies nicely. It isn’t too greasy, but does offer hydration to the eye area. I suffer from dry skin, so hydration is a must for me.  I’ve noticed an improvement in the fine lines in my eye area and plan on continuing to use this in my daily skincare routine. nan
