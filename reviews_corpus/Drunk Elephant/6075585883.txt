I typically LOVE the DE line, but initially wanted to skip this product because I’d tried Marula Oil in the past and found it didn’t really seem to …do anything for my skin. I’m so glad I received this product complimentary to review because my mind is CHANGED! Just goes to show that just because one product doesn’t work, doesn’t mean another formulation won’t! I think the retinol in this product truly does make a difference, and perhaps the higher concentration of Marula oil does as well (DE says on their website that it makes up 95% of the formula!). I fully expected not to see much with this product and give it an “eh” review, but I’ve been using it nonstop with noticeable results. As a fair skinned redhead , my skin turns red at the drop of a hat. I’ve noticed that this product definitely helps cut down on my general redness, and my skin texture has been SO GOOD - super soft and smooth. I have super dry skin and don’t often see much results in terms of moisturizing effects with oils whether I use them alone or in combination with a cream moisturizer, but I’ve definitely noticed a difference in my skin as far as dryness when I use this with my (holy grail) Tatcha Dewy Cream. I definitely think this product has a spot in anyones skin care regimen if you’re looking for smooth, soft skin or if you have issues with redness like I do. I don’t break out often, but I did have a few tiny spots that this oil seemed to help clear up, so that was an added bonus! I’d definitely be curious to give this stuff a shot next time I have an actual breakout to see if it makes any difference then as well. If you’re on the fence about this product, I’d definitely say to go ahead and give it a go. It did take me a few applications (around 5 days straight of using the product) to really notice the changes, but when they came, they were definitely noticeable! Wasn’t sure, but pleasantly surprised!
