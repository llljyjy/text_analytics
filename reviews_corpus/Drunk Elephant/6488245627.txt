Belif is discontinuing my long time HG eye cream so I’ve been looking for a replacement that provides lasting hydration, looks great under concealer and doesn’t cause milia and this ticks all those boxes.  What I like most is the packaging as, unlike a jar, the locking twist up airless pump is more sanitary and travel friendly.  My only complaint is I’m paying more money for less product compared to the Belif eye cream but as this is the only one that does everything I want, I’ll continue to repurchase. nan
