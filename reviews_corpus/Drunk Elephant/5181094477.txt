I liked it so much, it has a very light smell, and I like that it has pomp, it left my skin more moisturized in the area under my eyes, on one occasion I was checking it without makeup and it lasted a long time moisturizing the area around my eyes and with makeup on top gives me a healthy finish I loved it! The only bad thing I can say is that it made me cry the first time because she got a little bit in my eye so be careful when putting it on. Love it
