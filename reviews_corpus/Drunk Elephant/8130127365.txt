When Sunday Riley came out with their ceramide cream did we not all freak out?well guess who did it better? Drunk elephant. There’s a reason Drunk elephant has become a cult classic. First of all, I love the container and how you twist it to open. There’s no real scent and the application is quick and easy. I use it as a nighttime routine cream and while I’ve only used it for a couple of days I can see the deep indents in my eyes decreasing and also a decrease in my dark circles. The price tag is a bit hefty but for the product and it’s cocktail of ingredients, it makes sense. Overall it’s a great buy and worth the splurge. nan
