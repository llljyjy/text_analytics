I had been wanting to up my anti-aging game but found other retinol products too much for my super sensitive skin. Using this product three nights a week has been great. I wash my face, apply my eye cream, mix a couple of drops of this with my moisturizer, and I’m set. I’ve noticed improvement in my skin texture, the fine lines(and a couple not so fine lines I inherited from my mother’s family) on my forehead are reduced, and I’ve also seen a reduction in breakouts. Overall I’m very happy with the product and will keep using it. I haven’t noticed more sensitivity to the sun since I started using this, but I wear an spf 40 everyday. A good intro to retinol
