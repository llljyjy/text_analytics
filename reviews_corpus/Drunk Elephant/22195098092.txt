this is much to expensive to use as a micellar water BUT as a toner i find the price more justifiable. since it is packed with barrier supporting ingredients such as ceramides, vit e, & fatty acids i like to put a few drops on my hand and pat it into my skin when iâ€™m feeling dry & tight. it leaves my skin feeling cool & refreshed. with a watery, milky texture, it is very easy to dab onto skin & i almost wish it came as a spray. toner>micellar water
