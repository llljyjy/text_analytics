Wow i just love this. Skinfix was my favorite until i found this. I’m combo and dry skin, so this doesn’t feel so dewy like skinfix. And yes i feel my skin soft, plump, firm. I was scared because I’m using Paulas Choice retinol 1% and sometimes there are some products that irritate my skin, but i can use this on top my retinol and its great. A really good product for anti aging and moisturizing. Holy grail!
