I’m on my second large tub of this stuff. The consistency what I look for in face cream- it is thick enough to not feel too wet and oily, but thin enough that it is easy to spread over my face and neck. It’s very mild for me, and soothing when I apply. I don’t wear any makeup and this does not leave me shiny. on my second large tub
