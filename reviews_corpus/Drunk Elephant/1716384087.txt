I was looking for a nice hydrating and moisturizing cream for my dry flaky (rosacea) skin. Pros:-Great packaging and dispensing systemhydrating-I like the peptides to help my damaged skin barrier-feels hydratingCons:-hydration doesnâ€™t seem to last very long (a few minutes for me)-not moisturizing enough for my dry skin...I need to apply an oil or heavier product on topOverall, this might be a good product for me during the summertime. good moisturizer but not great for dry skin
