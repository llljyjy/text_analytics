I liked this. The directions are vague. I’m assuming you leave this on and don’t wash off which is weird for a facial. Over all it was really nice thick consistency very hydrating upon application. I’m not sure if it really brightened my completion but my skin is relatively clear. I received this complimentary from Influster in exchange for my honest review I like it
