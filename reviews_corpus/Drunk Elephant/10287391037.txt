I waited for a month before I decided to write this review. I will say is seeps into my skin very well. In comparison to other oils like the Herbivore’s Blue Lapis Face Oil I will say Drunk Elephants is a bit heavier. But clearly that’s expected with a retinol. I don’t see much of a difference but I only use it at night 3x a week. I’m sure if I’m more consistent I’d see quicker changes. The only difference I’ve noticed is my skin tends to be a little brighter. It’s not terrible but it’s not iconic.
