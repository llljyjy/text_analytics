So I used it once and the truth is that my skin felt very heavy, I have mixed skin with a tendency to be oily so I decided to ask my dermatologist and he told me that it was an oil for mature skin (40 years and older) I decided to give it to my mom to try it and she loved it! She is happy and her skin feels fabulous! Definitely recommend it for mature skin. Mature skin oil
