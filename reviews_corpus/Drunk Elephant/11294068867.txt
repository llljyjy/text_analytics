I love the texture of this product, it is fluffy, and airy, but rich at the same time. Application is soothing, and it sinks into the skin well under makeup. I did find that it didnâ€™t hydrate my skin as much as I would have liked it too, having extremely dry acne prone skin. For the price tag I would opt for something more hydrating and repairing for my skin barrier as I feel like I needed to use more Product than another moisturizer. Not as hydrating as anticipated.
