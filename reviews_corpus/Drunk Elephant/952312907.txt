This was my first try with a retinol and I wasn’t sure what to expect. But I love most DE products-one of the things I love about them is that they sell the minis so I can see how they work for me. This worked unbelievable well on some new lines I was getting-those vertical puppet lines from the corners of my mouth down either side of my chin. Maybe because they were just starting to form, and even if it’s just temporary-they are gone after just a few days use. On wrinkles that I’ve had for a while like my forehead worry lines I haven’t noticed the same dramatic difference but I’m willing to keep using it to see if there’s more improvement. One pump/pea size is enough for my whole face, it absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave any kind of shiny plastic look or film. I didn’t have issues with peeling or flakes, my aging oily skin drinks it up. I do use a small bit of B-Hydra™ on top of it, another DE product that really works for me without clogging my pores. I think it’s worth trying out any of the minis to see if they work for you. Price-wise based on the small amount I need to use, the mini will last me a long time. I like that I can try, mix and match most DE products without having to pay full price for something that I ends up not working. Definitely going to get the full size when the mini one runs out.
