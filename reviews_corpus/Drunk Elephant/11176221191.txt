The girl at Sephora highly recommended this sunscreen and I heard good things about this brand before, so I purchased it. It had a strange finish, can’t even properly describe. It felt like the ingredients weren’t blended in well. And after applying it on my face, I found weird streaks of the sunscreen that was coming off my skin. FYI my skin was well hydrated as I apply sunscreen as the last step of my morning skin care. So those streaky things can’t be my dead skin cells. Immediately returned it to the store. Disappointing
