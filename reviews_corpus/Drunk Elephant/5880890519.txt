I have nothing against this product, but this product hasn’t done anything special for me either. Yes, I find it (decently) hydrating, but it’s not as hydrating as I’d hope for the price. I like the pump dispenser, as it makes it easier to get the right amount of cream. I personally wouldn’t buy this for myself again. Decent
