I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. This is a good moisturizer. It’s thick and creamy and feels great on my skin. However, my skin is dry and I didn’t find this nearly as hydrating as other creams I have used. It would be perfect for someone with oily skin. All in all, it’s a good product because it made my skin feel smooth and appear more even but I think there are better, more hydrating products available for the money. Good But Could Be Better
