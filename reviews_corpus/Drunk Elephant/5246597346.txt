Been using this retinol oil for about a month and I’m loving it! I was a little worried in the beginning that it would make me break out and it never did! I use it at night with my drunk elephant moisturizer and it’s been leaving my skin smooth and brighter! Thanks to Influenster and Drunk Elephant this is going to be part of my nightly routine from now on! Love Love Love
