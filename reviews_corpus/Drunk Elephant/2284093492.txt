I received this product through Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I enjoyed the product, but it did take me some getting to used to. For my sensitive skin, it worked best 2-3 x a week, not daily. Once I switched to that cadence, my skin responded really well to this and it left my skin very plump and moisturized. You do not need to use a lot of this product for it to work. nan
