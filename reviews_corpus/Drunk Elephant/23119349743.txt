I really liked this at first, cute design and loved the pump top feature and the benefits it was touting was right up my ally of needs. However; the more I used it the worse my oily, and somewhat sensitive/acne-prone skin became. I was getting quite large zits in places I never get. I stopped using it a few days ago and switched to First Aid’s moisturizer and all but one pesky zit is on the path to clarity. I read a bunch of reviews with people having the same problem. This formula needs a lot of work or should be marketed to people that don’t have my skin type. Major disappointment considering the price tag. Do not buy unless you want a zit face
