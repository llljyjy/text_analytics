As someone who is always on the go, it can be hard to have a full cleansing session. This product is a game Changer for me. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean. It does smell like play doh, and I wouldnâ€™t recommend applying with a cotton ball because the cotton ball will soak up a lot of the product so you end up using a lot more than you need to but I use my little face scrubber to apply it and wipe away with the cotton ball. convenient for people always on the go
