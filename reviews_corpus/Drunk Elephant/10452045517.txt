I like this retinol. For comparison, I had been using The Ordinary 0.5% retinol in squalane for the last 3 months. I found that this Drunken Elephant retinol performed similarly, and I think the ceramides helped my complexion too. I would recommend this for someone who is ready to try a higher does of retinol. I used it about once a week, sometimes more if my skin felt extra dry or sensitive due to winter weather and this frequency was enough to see results. One thing I will say, I started this when I had already been using retinol for a year, specifically using 0.5% concentration for 3 months leading up to receiving it. If this is your first retinol product just remember it does take a few weeks to see results at first, but donâ€™t be discouraged! Continued use over time is the key! A good retinol product
