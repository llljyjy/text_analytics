It doesn’t smell that bad, i don’t know what the fuss is about. I’ve used far worse smelling products (hello P50), this is tolerable. If you’re someone who needs their product to smell like a bowl of fruit however - this is not for you.I received the trial size version and I’ll be buying the full size. There is a noticeable difference in the last few days of using this. Chill out!
