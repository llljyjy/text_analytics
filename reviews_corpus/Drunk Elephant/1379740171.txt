Influenster sent me the Drunk Elephant A-Gloei Maretinol Oil so I tested is out for a few weeks. I used it mostly at night. It keep my skin hydrated and feeling really soft. I read you should mix it with the C-Firma but I will try that next month.This formula has 0.5% retinol ceramides. It’s vegan and it has antioxidant rich virgin marula oil. This formula is supposed to leave your skin with a healthy looking glow and it is supposed to minimize hyperpigmentation, fine lines, blemishes and sun damage. I didn’t know just much difference with the hyperpigmentation but it did do everything else for me. Amazing Retinol Skincare
