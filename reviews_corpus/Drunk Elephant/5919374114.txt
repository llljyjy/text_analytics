This oil definitely helps me a lot. I have sensitive skin so retinol is very strong to my skin most of the time. But this retinol oil just feels so gentle and soft when applying to my skin. My skin has been popping up some random acne and blemish. I was using my go to skincare to fix them but they just don’t go away. So I decided to try this oil which said it can help with blemishes, lines and restore to a healthy glow. I was hesitating to use oil on my acne at first but it really did the magic! I apply it in the morning, my skin feel so calm and didn’t have redness at all and my blemish and acne became smaller. I highly recommend this if you have the same experiences like mine nan
