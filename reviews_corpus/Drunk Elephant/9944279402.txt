I can’t speak to packaging issues as I used a travel size but I was head over heels for the instant appearance after using this! It felt amazing & made my skin look amazing! I’m all for budget friendly, effective products but when I splurge next, it’ll be on drunk elephant! I hope they figure out their packaging issues by then as it is a little too pricey to not be able to access the awesomeness inside! Love, love, love!
