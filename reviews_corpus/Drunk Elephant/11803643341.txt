I love this! I hate the process of taking off makeup, and anything that requires a cotton pad requires 3-5 cotton pads to get all the makeup off. This is AMAZING. Some of the reviews I have read make me feel as though people don’t quite know how to use it properly. It’s not supposed to act as a cleanser, thus you have to wash your face after you’ve given your face a good rub with this product. Also, you scoop some into your finger tips and rub together until it creates a smoother consistency. This is the absolute only product that takes off ALL of my makeup. I don’t use the exfoliant at all, so I only gave this 4 stars as I feel wasteful repurchasing this product and it doesn’t give an option to not include the exfoliant.
