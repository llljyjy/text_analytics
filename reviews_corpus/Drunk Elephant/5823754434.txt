Please go back to your old formula. I’ve been a huge fan of the last formula for years. This new, customer-mixed product is a bust. It lasted half a long, regardless of my mixing skills the texture was different every pump from runny to thick. It’s not the same. I’ll be trying another brand until DE figures this product out again. New formula is a bust for loyal customer.
