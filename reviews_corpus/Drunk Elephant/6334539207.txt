Overall I enjoy this retinol oil, but I haven’t noticed a substantial reduction in the minimal forehead and smile lines I have (I’m 23). This oil is incredibly hydrating and I love mixing it in with my moisturizer in the evening to wake up with smooth, hydrated, and non-greasy skin. The packaging is opaque, which is great for retinol, and the dropper isn’t messy. I’m also very impressed by the lightweight formula and pricing. I would definitely recommend this!
