I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Itâ€™s a really great retinol option in the winter. With the winter months/dryer weather, I was finding it hard to use my typical retinol gel. It was causing my dryness/flakey skin. This keeps my skin nice and hydrated within the winter while still allowing me to maintain the benefits of a retinol. I have also noticed a clearer, brighter appearance to my skin. Lastly, I love that this is a clean product with ceramides to improve the skin barrier. Very nice product & formula! Great for the winter!
