I love this product. Note, I DO double cleanse, but I do not use it as my main cleanser. I use this as my very first step, to take my makeup off. I warm it up in my hands and rub it gently all over my face to release and melt all the makeup. Itâ€™s very gentle and even helps get waterproof mascara off. Definitely have to keep my eyes closed though. I only use about a dime size amount, and it goes a long way. It makes my face feel so nice and smooth after. I then use a real cleanser AFTERWARDS. I AM SO UPSET THEY TRADED THE MAGNETIC SPOON ATTACHMENT FOR THE CLIP IN ONE THOUGH!!!!! THE CLIP IN ONE IS SO INCONVENIENT WHEN IM TRYING TO DO THIS IN THE SHOWER WITH ONE HAND!!!! LOVE! Use as step 1 when double cleansing!
