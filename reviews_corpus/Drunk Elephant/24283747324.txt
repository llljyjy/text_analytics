I love this oil! Truly perfect for beginners. I have never used retinol and as someone with very sensitive skin, I was honestly scared to. I applied 3 drops to cover my face at night for a week and and kept waking up to amazing results! My skin was plump and looked hydrated, and my redness was reduced. I highly recommend this product, Iâ€™d say it is very much worth the cost! Best Beginner Retinol!
