I’ve been really enjoying this product after using it every other night for the past few weeks. I haven’t noticed anything drastic, but in the morning when I wake up I notice more glowy skin after washing my face. I can only attribute it to the face oil since I hadn’t changed anything in my skincare routine. Surprisingly, I did not have any irritations from using this product despite being a retinol beginner. I’d only ever used retinol eye creams before. The only downside is depending on the moisturizer I use at night, it does tend to pill sometimes. I put this oil in the very last part of my skincare routine. Overall, this is a great retinol for those who are just starting out! Beginner friendly
