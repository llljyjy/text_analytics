I think this is a great formula for people who have never used Retinol before. I don’t use oils often because it clogs my pores, so this isn’t the best formula for me, but I’m also a seasoned Retinol user. This is especially great if you have dry skin as the oil will help combat the effects of retinol. Only complaint is that the directions for the product aren’t the best. This is primarily oil, so it should only go on as the last step of a routine because if you were to apply before other products, the other products wouldn’t be effective because oil is “too thick” to penetrate. Nice formula for new Retinol users
