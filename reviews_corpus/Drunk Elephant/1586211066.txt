Marula oil in my opinion is the worst facial oil. I really tried to like this but it congested my skin, caused blackheads and made me break out tons. I could not believe it was this oil, but as soon as I stopped using it my skin cleared up. Marula is not a great oil at all. I much prefer Argan oil. Also this product is way overpriced. nan
