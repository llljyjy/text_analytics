I have loved and used this product for a long time and the new formula/packaging is a dealbreaker. The product is runny, shoots out of the pump so much that I’ve started applying it while standing over my bathtub so it doesn’t get on the walls, and the bottle leaks so much that streaks of product run down the sides of the bottle even when not in use. What a waste! So many people have complained on social media and DE responds 100% of the time that it’s user error and we all just put the bottle together wrong when mixing it. If that’s true, they need to FIX it so that doesn’t happen to so many of us. I will be finding a new c-serum in the meantime. Such a letdown. New Packaging Wastes Product
