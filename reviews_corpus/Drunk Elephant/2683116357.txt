I used this product for a few weeks and I do like it. It is true to its name. I would definitely use it more as a night eye cream because it takes a bit to absorb. It really does moisturizer your wye area! I love yhe idea of the packaging but after you press down the product keeps coming out resulting in wasted product. I would definitely recommend this. True to its name
