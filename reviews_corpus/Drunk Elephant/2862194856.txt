I liked that this product really seemed to hydrate the skin around my eyes but didn’t feel too heavy. I think the recommended usage is a bit much and I found I needed a lot less product than that.

I use a fan quite a bit which always makes my eyes feel very dry, and this really helped make the skin around those areas feel more hydrated. hydrating
