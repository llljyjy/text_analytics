Okay soooo I purchased this a year ago and still have a little left in bottle and I use this 1-2 times daily! I just use a very small amount you really don’t need very much. For that reason this is a steal. The quality of this I feel could have been better it is a very light gentle cleanser. I don’t think I will re purchase this though just for the fact I felt my face feel not as deep cleaned as I would like. I think I prefer the purity cleanser instead of this one or something else to that gives a more intense cleanse feel. good but I would try something else
