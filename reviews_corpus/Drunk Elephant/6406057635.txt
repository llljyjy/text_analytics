This is the most hydrating face mist I’ve ever tried. The smell takes some getting used to but it is sake so it’s to be expected. However the results are instant, the most beautiful glow from the hydration the mist gives! I love to use this when my skin is feeling extra dry as a “toner” before my creams and serums, or throughout the day as a moisture pick me up! Will be repurchasing despite the price. Worth it for the glow!
