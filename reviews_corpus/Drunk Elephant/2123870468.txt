I’ll start off by saying this mask is amazing and I’m so glad to see it carried at Sephora Canada now. I’ve been using it for years but had to have it ordered from the American website using a cross border shipping company (which cost extra) :CIt’s a very potent and thick cream exfoliating mask. 15-20 minutes is all you need, so follow the directions carefully. I have a decent tolerance for most exfoliants & retinols so maybe start with 15 minutes or do a patch test if you’re not sure. It stings a little upon application (that usually fades) and your face will likely be red after so don’t do this as a step in your skincare routine right before you go out or right before a big event. What I do is make sure I don’t use any retinols or exfoliants that day, wash my face gently to remove any dirt and debris, put on an even thin layer, leave for 20 minutes (set an alarm!), rinse really well with cool water, slather on a non-fragrant facial oil, go to bed, and wake up with soft smooth baby face skin. I usually dont use a retinol or exfoliant the next day either, but instead focus on hydrating soothing products and of course sunscreen, because your skin is always extra sensitive to UV rays after a good exfoliation. Hope this helps a little! :) nan
