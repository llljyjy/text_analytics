I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I really love the packaging of this eye cream, the pump dispenser that pops up helps keep this product sanitary and is easy to clean. I love drunk elephant, I feel as though it is a wonderful skincare brand and they have been around for a long time. The eye cream is thick and a little bit goes a long way. It doesn’t feel heavy on the skin, it actually left my skin feeling soft and smooth and it absorbed quickly. I like that it doesn’t have a strong smell either. I would recommend this product to others. Works Great!
