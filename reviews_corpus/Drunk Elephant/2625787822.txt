I generally like DE products (love their glycolic acid serum, Protini moisturizer, eye cream and eye serum, etc.), but this product doesn’t work for me. When I use this, I always wake up with some new breakouts. I don’t think this is making my skin break out because it’s a bad product—I think this just isn’t enough to control my breakout-prone skin. (Sunday Riley Good Genes works better for me.) If you’re less acne-prone, maybe this will work for you! Just not the best for me
