This eye balm is amazing. I’ve always been a fan of Drunk Elephant products and this one does not disappoint. The skin around my eyes are a sensitive area so I have to be careful what skincare products I use. This particular product has been wonderful. It’s very hydrating and non irritating. It’s also nice that a little goes a long way, since it’s not the cheapest product. It’s definitely worth it for those who have sensitive skin and need extra hydration. A new favorite
