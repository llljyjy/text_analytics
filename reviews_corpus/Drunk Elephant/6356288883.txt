So far , I am really enjoying this. First time using a retinol and I noticed my face not as red first thing in the morning which is nice. I had a purge breakout prior to using this. My routine is skin fix acne cleanser + retinol drunk elephant glycolic night serum , and I would say itâ€™s calmed down significantly after almost two weeks of using. so far so good
