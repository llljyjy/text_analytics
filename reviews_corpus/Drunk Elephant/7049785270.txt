I have been a long time fan of Drunk Elephant. I love their cleanser and polypeptide moisturizer. One of the very first products I tried by Drunk Elephant was their Vitamin C serum and I LOVED it! It made my skin look clear and felt refreshed. However, their new product has been very disappointing. The product has been oozing out of the bottle since I made the purchase. It has collected crusty residue on the outside. More product has oozed out than I have actually used--WASTE OF MONEY. I hate putting this product on my face in the morning. I am used to a more sticky serum, however this feels like sap. It sits terribly under my moisturizer and had done nothing for my skin. I am extremely disappointed and I am hesitant to trust this brand again. I WASTE... do not buy
