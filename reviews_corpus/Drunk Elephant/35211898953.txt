this is an okay serum. it does feel hydrating and like it is adding some extra hydration to my routine, but i think for the price point it’s just okay. the ordinary’s hyaluronic acid serum does the exact same thing at a much better price point. i feel like when you buy this, you are purchasing for the branding. overall, i will continue to use, but i just think that’s there’s other serums for cheaper that are the same. not anything special
