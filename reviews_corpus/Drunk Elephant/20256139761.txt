This is my favorite Drunk Elephant serum by far, and I want to purchase it again, but the dispenser broke when I was about 2/3 through the product. I emptied the remainder into another container to use it, but that really compromises the product when it is no sealed and I’m sure it’s not as effective now as it should be. I though this was an isolated incident, but last night the dispenser broke on the glycolic night serum. Also by Drunk Elephant, and similar container design. When I logged on to write a review I saw many others have had the same issue. I’ve been using Drunk Elephant’s line for a number of years now, but the quality is not what it was. Great product in the WORST container.
