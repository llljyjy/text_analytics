I had no problem with the mixing of the product but the packaging is awful.  The top broke within the first week of use.  At that point, it was difficult to get the product out as it came out with bubbles.  Finally, I found that I can unscrew the top and put some in my hand which leads to lots of unnecessary waste.  There are too many other choices on the market to mess with inferior packaging. good product if you can get to it
