This was a sample size but believe me when I say it lasts. I added it with the framboos serum nightly and barely had to use any because the smallest amount was enough to cover my face and neck. This worked well with the serum and I was pleased with the results the next morning. It absorbed well and was unscented. Will definitely buy the full size when this is out. nan
