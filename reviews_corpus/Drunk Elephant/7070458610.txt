Purchased this because I wanted something that was different than an oil. The concept of including an attached spatula is great but the product itself is not. It’s very waxy and not the easiest to wash off. I spend so much time trying to wash this off even after wetting my hands and going back in to massage it into my skin again and again. My skin doesn’t feel that much cleaner either after incorporating this before my regular face wash Other better options out there
