This is a great retinol product for someone with sensitive skin! My skin can be pretty sensitive to stronger face products like retinol, but this has been gentle on my skin while also giving great results. My skin has been looking great without looking irritated or dried out. I do try to use a really good moisturizer after applying. Plus I love that itâ€™s an oil and easy to apply! nan
