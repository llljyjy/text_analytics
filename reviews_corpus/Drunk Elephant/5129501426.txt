Definitely very user friendly and easy to apply. It is very nice and moisturizing. I haven’t seen any difference in my skin, but I don’t think I’ve used it long enough. I have had some break outs but I can’t confidently blame this product. I don’t think It’s purging either. I’m excited to keep using this and see what it does to my skin! Nice beginner retinol
