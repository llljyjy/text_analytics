This thick yet absorbing eye cream is truly a dream. I love how smooth and hydrated my eye area feels after using and after a couple months my under eye is more plump than before. I have very sensitive eyes and this caused no issues. In fact, I’m super picky about moisturizers in general but this one now has a spot on my vanity. Also, the smell is slightly earthy reminding me that it contains a 10% plant omega lipid complex. I’m all for more natural ingredients so that’s a win! Not to mention, Drunk Elephant did it again with the amazing packaging. This one turns to open and close replacing the need for a cap. 5 stars. This is the one!
