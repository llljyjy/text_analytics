I received the Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos voxbox from Influenster and Drunk Elephant in exchange for my honest review. The Lala retro whipped moisturizer w/ ceramides is so nice! ITâ€™s light whipped texture and practically scent-free formula is perfect for hydrating those with sensitive skin. It seems a bit thick/heavy at first but it blends into your skin so nicely! nan
