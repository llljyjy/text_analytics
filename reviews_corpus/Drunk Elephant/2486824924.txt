I have to write a review because I’m suprirsed at all the negative reviews on the new packaging, and I think a lot of these reviewers are uneducated about how Vitamin C works (no shade). I have re-purchased this probably 15 times in the last 6-7 years. This is the best Vitamin C serum I’ve ever used, especially for the price. The problem with Vitamin C, is it’s incredible unstable. The product starts out clear, and oxidizes to a dark orange when it’s no longer good (after about 3-4 months after opening). A lot of times, a product will sit on the shelf for a long time, and in this case, already be a little oxidized when opened. The new packaging is so smart and innovative because you are guaranteeing the freshest possible batch and highest concentration of the products as it’s not active until you mix it yourself- which is why it’s clear (as it should be). I’ve never had an issue with mixing it, it’s super simple if you just follow the instructions, and I get the same results as I have always gotten with the previous packaging except it lasts a bit longer now which I love. 100% recommend and don’t let the bad reviews scare you away!
