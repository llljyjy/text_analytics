My first impression of this product overall was excitement. After using the product, my skin felt incredibly hydrated and looked moisturized. Immediately I noticed less redness and dark spots fading. The product ingredients are fast acting as this leave-on mask uses 10% azelaic and 1% salicylic acids to add radiance, smooth and illuminated skin. Ultimately, this has given me a brighter, smoother, and firmer looking glow. I am enthusiastic about continuing to use this to see ongoing results! I highly recommend you give it a try! A Must Have Illuminator!
