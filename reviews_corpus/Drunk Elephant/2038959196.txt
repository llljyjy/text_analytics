I have only used this a few times, but I kid you not this oil has softened my skin and made it look a little more smooth! I suffer from lots of texture on my forehead and around my chin, this has helped a lot with that! It’s got a great light weight texture and doesn’t feel too greasy, I find that within a hour after applying it the oil is fully absorbed. Great to layer in with other products. The only thing preventing me from giving it a fifth star is that I need to use it more! Other then that I like it! Gloei-er days ahead ✨
