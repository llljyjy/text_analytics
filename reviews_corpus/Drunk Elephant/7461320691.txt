The Good: This is a fantastic product and probably one of my most recommended products to others within skin care. This is a one of a kind formula, I love all kinds of face oils but nothing compares to this. This is a very light-weight oil, it’s non-greasy, it goes on light, absorbs amazingly into the skin and does not leave behind a high-shine residue. There is no real scent to this oil, it’s a very neutral, nearly non-existent, faint natural scent almost like a real cooking oil. If you are scent averse and are on the hunt for a face oil this should be in your wish list (or cart). After using this, my face always feels baby soft every single time. I have been using this product for quite some time and although I dabble in other oils and have even found others I really love... I continue going back to this product as a simple, go-to product. The formulation is simply super unique, most oils have variation in only scent but this product has a completely unique formulation and consistency to the point where it’s truly impressive. A little goes a long way, I love adding a couple of drops of this to a moisturize or doing a quarter “pump“ of it as an all over skin pick-me-up. It’s been at least 3 years since I’ve consistently had this on hand and I don’t see that changing any time soon. The Bad: I really can’t think of anything bad about this product and I try to be really nit-picky and detailed within my reviews. That’s why this product has truly earned it’s 5 star rating.The Ugly/Honest: This is a pricey oil and there are other ones out there on the market that are very nice quality as well. However, this oil is a real standout in my opinion, therefore I’ll forever continue purchasing despite the hefty price tag... and that’s the ugly/honest truth. The Golden Elixir!
