I love the texture of this cream, it’s light but feels so luxurious and velvet like. I get dry patches on my skin occasionally so after using this, it really helped hydrate my skin and bring it back to life! I also like that it’s Unscented so I don’t have a clash of scents when I layer my skin care products. Perfect for dry skin!
