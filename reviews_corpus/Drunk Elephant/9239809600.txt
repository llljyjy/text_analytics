Love this more than I thought. It’s so smooth and doesn’t give you the harsh, burning, and peeling side effects that retinol often leaves, which is a HUGE plus. No need to question whether or not you will get the same results using another product with retinol because this serum DELIVERS and shows within a week of using it. My new favorite retinol product
