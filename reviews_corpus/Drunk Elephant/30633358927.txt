I’ve been using this serum for a year now. My face feels softer and more even, which is great. But this pump keeps breaking, like so many others’. My first bottle broke at the pump, and my second also broke exactly the same way. I am in touch with a Drunk Elephant customer service, but they are slow to reply. I am using several other products of this brand, and this is the only pump that broke like this. (Other products come in the same pump-shape and never broke in the last 2 years.) Until they announce that they fixed the problem on the factory floor, I will NOT be buying this one. Not worth the mess or the hustle of poor customer service from this company, sadly. Love the serum, hate the breaking packaging
