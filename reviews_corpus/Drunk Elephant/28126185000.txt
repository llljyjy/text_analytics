This has made my skin appear so much more even in color and has evened out my skin texture. My face is glowing and I have way more confidence than before using this product. It’s not overly oily but gives a very nice moisture level and I cannot get over the glow. I did have a little bit of an acne breakout when I first started using but I have this problem every time I start using a new facial product. Since I’ve been using almost three weeks now I have seen a huge improvement all around. Wow!
