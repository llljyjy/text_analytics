This product is very moisturizing, and the best part is a little goes a long way! You barely need anything to cover your whole face/neck. The downside is the scent (or lack there of). I don’t need a scent for my products, though it’s nice to have, but this had sort of a clay-ish scent by default which was odd. nan
