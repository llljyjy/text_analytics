I am a big fan of Drunk Elephant and this eye cream continues my love for their products. After a couple weeks of applying under my eyes every night, I’ve noticed more elasticity around my eye area. I even feel like it’s helped with the milia under my eyes. I love the texture of this cream. The whipped formula helps make it feel less greasy and heavy. My skin is smoother brighter and more radiant. There is no scent, which is perfect for anyone with sensitive skin. I find half a pump to be the perfect amount for my under eyes. The container is also very well made with the aesthetically pleasing lavender color packaging. Ready to Purchase Again!
