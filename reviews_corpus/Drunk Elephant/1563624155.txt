I’ve been using  this eye cream for a good month now and I love it! It’s creamy without being oily, it gives nice hydration  under the eyes and a perfect base for concealer. I find that when I put concealer on it’s smooth and doesn’t look dry and cakey. I do feel also that my under eyes are a little brighter when I put it on. I love the packaging, it dispenses the right amount of product so you don’t get so much waste. All in all I highly recommend it if you like smoother and hydrated under eyes. Perfect Everyday Eye cream
