This eye balm is so moisturizing yet lightweight. It rubs in easily and really provides a serious layer of hydration. Anyone with very dry skin, especially around the eyes, or who lives in cold/dry climates should try this! It doesnâ€™t irritate my eyes at all and I love the new packaging! Must-have for winter
