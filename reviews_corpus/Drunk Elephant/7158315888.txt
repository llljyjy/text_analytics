I love this brand so when I saw they had a vitamin c serum I was stoked! But when I got it I was disappointed first of all with how exspensive it is and how little you get and having to put it together myself. I’ve been using it for about a month now and I haven’t noticed any difference that I can tell. It’s super sticky hard to evenly distribute on the face and the smell isn’t the greatest. I will not be repurchasing this unfortunately. Bummer!
