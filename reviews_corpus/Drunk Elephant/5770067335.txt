I used this product after showering and I found it brought moisture to my fast and made it feel refreshed. The first time my face must’ve been very dry because I needed a little extra outside the “serving size“ to cover my face. But now I’m able to use the recommended amount so I feel that my skin is retaining the moisture with this product. I haven’t noticed any breakouts caused by it, and I don’t find the smell offensive although my boyfriend tested it and disliked the smell on his face. So despite him not enjoying the smell I still recommend the product and think it was worth using. It's nice and moisturized my skin
