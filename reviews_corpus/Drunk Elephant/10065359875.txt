Really great for people with dry skin that breaks out sometimes! It’s incredibly hydrating, and smells so nice, and really helps my skin to look plump and brightened, and I noticed my breakouts getting better while using it. The only issue i’ve noticed is that it’s just a messy product, which makes sense because it’s an oil, but it is something to keep in mind, the bottle gets messy. nan
