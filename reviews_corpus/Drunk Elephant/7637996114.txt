I recieved a free sample of the lala retro cream drunk elephant, from sephora. Its beautiful with no perfume nice spreading cream. But did not do great on my skin. I have combo oily dry sensitive skin. N it gave me a little breakout on my usual chin spot. So not for me. But its very creamy for more drier skin. Awesome cream but not for my skin
