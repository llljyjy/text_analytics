I got this a sample after buying the  C-firma serum .The colour is nice on my medium/dark skin tone and has a bit of shimmer so you forgo the highlighter. it’s very sheer and subtle so great for everyday “no makeup“ look. I do think it’s a bit overpriced for what it is and I didn’t notice any difference in my skin. Nice natural blush, but overpriced
