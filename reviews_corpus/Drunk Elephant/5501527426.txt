Skincare addict here and I have no had luck with any retinol product before this. I have extremely dry semi sensitive skin and retinol has absolutely wrecked my skin before, even very low dosages have never worked. I got this on a whim because it is in oil format and I was determined to find a retinol product that worked for me and this is the one. I’ve been using it for 2 months and to say it has made such a difference is an understatement. My forehead and chin are my problem areas. I get lots of closed comedones and this has helped smoothed them out. And when I do break out(hormones)this takes down the spots over night. I use it almost every night(6 days because I skip it when I use baby facial). I’ll probably buy this forever tbh. Absolutely holy grail. Wake up to the softest smoothest glowiest skin of my life. New HG!
