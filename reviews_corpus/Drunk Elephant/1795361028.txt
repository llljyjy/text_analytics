I really loved this product. As someone who has very sensitive skin, I had no issues with allergies or breakouts. One thing I wish was that the oil was lighter and I could wear this in the morning. I think in the future I will exclusively use this during the dry winter months. Otherwise I think I would repurchase!! Great for Dry Skin
