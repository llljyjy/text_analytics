Nice consistency cream/lotion, however, it is pilling like crazy! This has 5 star reviews and nobody mentions that it is pilling. I am assuming that everyone received the product for free in exchange of a 5 star review? I came to find out that azelaic acid at this 10% strength is pilling no matter what. Azelaic acid is a powder, and it is mixed in the vehicle of moisturizing ingredients. Once the product sunk in and dried on your face the powder will sit on your skin and if you just swipe your finger across your face it will pill like crazy. To be fair, all over the counter azelaic acid products will pill for the same reason. Get the prescription strength 15% gel and you’ll be happy. It won’t pill. I just find it very suspicious that not one person has mentioned this pilling issue in the reviews. It is pilling like nothing else!
