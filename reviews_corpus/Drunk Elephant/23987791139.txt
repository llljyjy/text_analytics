Influenster gave me the opportunity to try this product out ! They sent it back in December and I’m leaving a review now ( Feb) bc I needed to get to see an actual difference before leaving my word on something. I have really dry skin and my face breaks out bc of the mask so that’s why I actually was happy to try this. It has improved the redness on my skin and the dryness as well. I do recommend it and I will purchase when I run out completely. It is oil so when you apply it it does feel and leave you a little oily but it drys in a reasonable time and doesn’t feel dewy or watery it like a perfect feel. And I’ve gotten compliments recently on my skin after applying it. Must Have for Dry skin !!
