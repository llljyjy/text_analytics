I am glowing after I apply this serum. It’s easy to mix, and you are able to tell how potent and fresh it is. I have had one in the past which oxidized, and I could tell it was doing nothing for my skin. Don’t let the stickiness turn you off, and let it soak in for a minutes. Your skin will love you for it!! My face loves this
