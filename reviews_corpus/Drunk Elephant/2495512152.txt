much to my wallet’s dismay, this is one of the best skincare products i have ever used. it is so hydrating but doesn’t feel heavy, which is essential for my acne-prone, oily skin. the genuine glow it provides is so good you’d swear you somehow mixed up this product and your glowy primer. i also appreciate that this mask doesn’t make my face feel humid. upon application it is nice and cooling, and settles down to an unnoticeable finish (unless you look in the mirror and see that glow… seriously this stuff makes you SHINE). this is going in my summer rotation undoubtedly. a tip: don’t layer with a moisturizer containing silicone—it will pill. godsent
