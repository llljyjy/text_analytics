Super disappointed- I wanted to try the drunk elephant hype. First, the application is so poor, the product ends up more on my hand than face due to it being as runny as water consistency. It’s also extremely sticky and doesn’t pair well with layering other products. On top of that- I haven’t noticed any difference in my skin from the 2 months I’ve been using it. I’m going to go back to Peter Roth vitamin C serum ( I actually noticed a big difference with that product). Not worth it
