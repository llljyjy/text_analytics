I had used 2-3 tubes if this product a couple of years ago and had stopped it as it was expensive for me being a student at that time. But it definitely had made my skin look much brighter and glowy looking. I recently restarted using it again and on my second tube now. I like the new packaging better as it helps to keep the acid potent for longer periods of time. I also feel that this serum was a bit more thicker in the past. I mix it with  drunk elephant B-hydra for an added moisturizing effect and I love the combination. I know my skin is getting brighter since using this product as my parents (who see me only through video calls once in a while) say that the tiny brown coloured moles on my forehead are more noticeable now.. lol Brighter skin
