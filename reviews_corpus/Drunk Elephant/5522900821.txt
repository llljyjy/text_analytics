I’ve been using this moisturizer for a few months now and it’s just okay. It’s not as moisturizing as I would like, it’s good for summer and daytime use but I definitely need something more moisturizing at night. It also spreads weird, it doesn’t sink into my skin right away so I have to rub it in for a good minute before it’s fully absorbed. If this was cheaper, I would buy it again but given the price, I’m not planning on repurchasing any time soon. Okay Moisturizer, Not Worth the Price
