I love this micellar water! It’s so gentle and silky on the skin and it doesn’t irritate my skin at all. It’s really good at getting off makeup and spf, however even after using this to double cleanse (this as my first cleanse and Krave Beauty’s Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser as my second cleanse), I still have stubborn waterproof mascara left over. Other than that, I really like it. Silky and gentle!
