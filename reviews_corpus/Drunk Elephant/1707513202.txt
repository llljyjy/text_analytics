I’ll be honest I was nervous to try this because retinol makes me break out.  I was pleasantly surprised by this because my skin didn’t break out at all!  I think this is due to how it’s formulated and the 0.5% retinol strength.  I apply this to a clean dried face and let it absorb for about 2 minutes.  I then apply my moisturizer on top and boom glowing skin!   Tip: put in refrigerator so when you apply it’s nice and chilled! No more retinol breakouts!
