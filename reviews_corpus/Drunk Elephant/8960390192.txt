At first I felt like my skin was softer and plumper, now a few months later I have weird dry patches and a few sores kind of like hives in some areas. Iâ€™m glad I had only bought the full size of this and not the rest of the line after the trial size pack I bought. I was already wary because of the price. It seems if you have sensitive skin this is not for you. Not suited for sensitive skin
