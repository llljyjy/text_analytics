This product does a good job removing makeup but leaves a very weird film on even after cleansing after putting it on. My face doesn’t feel clean after. I have a lot left since it’s a huge jar but I plan on only using it for my eyes. I don’t love the smell but it’s fine since I use it before I go to bed. I do like the little spatula that comes with it though. makes me feel like I have a film on my face
