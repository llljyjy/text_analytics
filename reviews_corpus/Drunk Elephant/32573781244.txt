After reading through million articles on whether you can use salicylic acid and retinol together or not, I finally decided to try Drunken Elephant. The reviews for it were raving and I had to get it to see the hype. Since the serum is more oily in texture it has not caused any sensitivity or burn to my skin. I am using it in the pm since retinol does not go well with sun exposure. Has it overnight changed my skin? No but it definitely is making skin appearance look more clean and even. I have had hormonal acne most of my life and some of my blemishes are very stubborn. I am using The Ordinary salicylic acid 2% in the am and retinol in the pm and I am pleasantly very happy with how my skin is looking now versus what it was when I started. I will recommend it and suggest you to be patient to see the results! Worth the hype!
