I’ve been using this oil for a few weeks now. I first apply my serum and let it soak into my skin for a minute.  After that, I use A-Gloei (3 drops) and gently massage it into my skin. It absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue.  My skin feels hydrated immediately after use, and in the morning!  The bottle is really great quality and completely opaque so I love that the product won’t spoil easily.  Most importantly there’s NO smell at all.  I’ll continue to use this and hope it does a good job minimizing my dark spots. nan
