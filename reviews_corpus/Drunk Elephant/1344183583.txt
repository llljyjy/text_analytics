I love Drunk Elephant, but not this product.  This looks lovely on my skin.  It helps blur discoloration and other imperfections.  The problem is, this product is so heavy on the skin.  My skin immediately starts sweating once I put this on.  It feels like I’m wearing a thick mask, which I hate.  My skin needs to breathe.  It’s a “nope” from me. nope.
