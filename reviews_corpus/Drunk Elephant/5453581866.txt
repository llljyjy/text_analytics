I was so excited to receive this product to try for free in exchange for my honest review. I absolutely love this eye balm from Drunk Elephant! I used both morning and night, a little dab will go a long way. My eyes feel replenished and well moisturize without any irritation or harsh fragrance. I love the smell of this product and am so happy with the results. My only complaint was that it too me a minute to figure out how to open the container. Twist it, I almost broke the bottle Great product
