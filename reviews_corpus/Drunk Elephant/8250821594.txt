I was super psyched to receive this product free from Drunk Elephant and Influenster in exchange for my honest review! The Drunk Elephant Lala Retro Whipped Moisturizer with Ceramides is a fantastic compliment to the Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum. The formula feels slightly thick, but not too think for the summer, and it doesn’t have a fragrance to it. My skin looks and feels SO much healthier and the breakouts have gone away and stopped since using both products. A little product goes a long way so don’t let the price deter you. I would absolutely recommend this product as a part of your skin care routine and I will be adding it permanently to mine! Thank you so much Influenster and Drunk Elephant! Works for my oily/combo skin!
