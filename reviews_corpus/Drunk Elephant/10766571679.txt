I’m a first-time retinol user and I’ve been using it for about 4 weeks, 2-3 times a week. I feel like I really can tell a difference in my skin’s appearance! My skin looks smoother, more glowy, and less tired at the end of the day and when I wake up. I can’t wait to keep using this and see what it does in even more time. I never felt any sensitivity or anything that many first-time users feel, which makes me think this is the perfect retinol/formula for first-timers. And also, the packaging - the bottle is HEAVY which makes me feel safer traveling with it in my bag! It’s also so pretty on my shelf. Great First Time Retinol
