This has been the first winter where I have had extremely dry and blistering lips, and I tried many different repair lip balms and products to help. I mostly bought this lip balm for the cute packaging but this has been the only lip balm that has solved my problem. Yes $18 is pricy and the packaging is small but it definitely works well and my lips have not been chipped since I got it. nan
