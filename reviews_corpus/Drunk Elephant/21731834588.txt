I RECEIVED THIS COMPLIMENTARY OF INFLUENSTER FOR TESTING PURPOSES. I feel like this is a good intro for someone looking to start retinol because it’s gentle enough but still effective. although it’s an oil i didn’t find it to be overwhelmingly greasy. i found best way i liked applying it was mixed with the Protini cream. after use, my skin did feel smoother & looked gloei :) nan
