I am really impressed with this eye cream! It is the perfect texture for the delicate under eye area. The consistency is not too thick and not too thin, and a little goes a long way. After using, the skin feels sufficiently moisturized. Additionally, it works well under sunscreen and makeup without pilling. The ingredients list includes a Ceramide blend, Plant Omega-Lipid Complex, and soothing oils, which I all found very soothing. The packaging is user-friendly and very cute. The cap twists to open, which helps keep the product extra protected and clean. Overall, very happy with this product! Great texture and hydration!
