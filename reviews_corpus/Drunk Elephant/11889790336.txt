I am grateful for receiving this #DrunkElephant #Voxbox by #Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve heard of Drunk Elephant from multiple sources but never got the chance to try it for myself. The A-Gloei Retinol Oil has a smooth consistency that’s not too greasy nor waterly. I usually use facial oil as the final step of my nighttime routine; however, I previously used Luna by Sunday Riley. This oil worked similarly by helping pack in the moisture overnight with hydrated skin in the morning. I recommend this to anyone who has drier skin (especially in the winter) and needs a subtle retinol product in their skincare routine. nan
