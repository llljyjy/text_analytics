This product is good but caused my eyes some sensitivity. I do wear contacts, though. Probably best for people who don’t have skin sensitivity around their eyes. The texture is smooth and doesn’t leave your face oily. The smell is fine and I did see a slight improvement with dark circles. Decent product but caused sensitivity
