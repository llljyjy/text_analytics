I was given this product via influenster in exchange for my fair and honest review:Wow! Seriously impressed! This is also really great as an under eye primer. It’s very smoothing and blurring. My under eyes look so nice! I’ve been using this for a little over a month and it’s really great! I use it every day. The smell isn’t my absolute favorite, smells very natural I guess. But it’s a great product. I would really like to try the firming version when this one is all gone Love! Must have
