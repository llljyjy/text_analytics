This is a really good moisturizer for those who are looking for a fragrance free, thick, intensive treatment. The base of this cream is marula oil which feels amazing and leaves my skin so supple and glowing. This is definitely a must for those who have dry skin. I’ve been using it for almost 3 years now and my skin loves it. I do find that it’s worth the price as you only need one pump per application. It usually lasts me over 2 months when I use this once a day. A must for dry skin
