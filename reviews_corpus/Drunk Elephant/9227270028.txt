The “assemble yourself” packaging broke within a couple weeks, making it near impossible to get the formula out of the bottle unless you take the pump off each time. Seemed to waste a lot of product that way. I will never purchase this product again, which is a shame because I’ve been using this for years. It also seemed like I used double the amount that I did before. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing the new formula. Will not purchase again
