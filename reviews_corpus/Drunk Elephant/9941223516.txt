To me, Drunk Elephant is just an overpriced fad brand. I got a sample size of this and was not impressed. I have oily skin and this always left my skin feeling greasy, like it was just sitting on top. Also, the price is outrageous for a moisturizer. I have a $12 moisturizer from Target that works better than this. Would not recommend. Not worth it
