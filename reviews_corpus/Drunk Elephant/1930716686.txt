Great to use on sensitive eyes as it doesn’t irritate or sting the eyes at all.  Removes makeup and cleanses the face well.  I still like to rinse after using it even though the bottle says you don’t need to.  I didn’t like how it smelled, but its still a good quality product overall. For Sensitive Eyes
