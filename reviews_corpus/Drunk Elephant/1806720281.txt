This is such a nice introduction to retinol, I imagine it would be perfect for someone looking for a gentle start! The oil feels so luxurious and moisturizing. I have breakout prone skin and am happy to report I had no purging or breakouts with this oil. I found it to be really a nice addition to my winter routine, it really helps take care of any dry spots or patch’s. I’d recommend it to anyone trying to get into retinol who’s skin needs some extra moisture. Very gentle and nice!
