Receive free in exchange of my honest review. The first time I applied it, my eyes were not ready for it and they were tearing up but after that I’ve used it over and over and it doesn’t hurt or burn my eyes anymore. I like the consistency of the cream, it is very easy to apply. I like the pump, very easy to control the amount you want. I don’t have much wrinkles yet and I was hoping it would help with my dark under eyes, but no luck with that. nan
