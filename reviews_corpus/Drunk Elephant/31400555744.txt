I love this product! This is a great sunscreen for whenever you want to be glowy. I do not recommend to wear this with makeup since it kinda pills. The sunscreen also looks weird when you first squirt out of the bottle onto your hand and looks like itâ€™s unmixed but it really looks good when blended out very well on the face! glowy w/o makeup
