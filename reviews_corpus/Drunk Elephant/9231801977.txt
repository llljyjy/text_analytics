This Retinol oil is a great addition to Drunk Elephants product line. Retinol causes my skin to dry and peel, while this oil is so subtle for my sensitive, acne prone skin. It helps balance, moisture, and prevent fine lines and wrinkles. My skin feels very soft and subtle now. I have even noticed some dark spots diminishing. The price is high, and my only con with these skin care brands these days. However I would recommend to every skin type. I received this product complimentary via Influenster for review purposes. #gloeidays #complimentary @DrunkElephant @Influenster So Soothing
