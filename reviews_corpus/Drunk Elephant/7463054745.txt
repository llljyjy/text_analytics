This product is amazing. I wish I had decided to try it sooner. It’s very moisturizing, & absorbs beautifully. The consistency feels somewhat thick, but my skin absorbs it instantly. No scent, no sticky residue like I’ve experienced with other products. I will continue repurchasing. If you have dry skin, you won’t regret buying this! nan
