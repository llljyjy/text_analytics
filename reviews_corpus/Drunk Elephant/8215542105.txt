Been using this for about 10 days and so far I haven’t seen anything drastic happen in terms of textures or wrinkles. What I can say is  it’s very lightweight, non scented and absorbs instantly. My skin is left soft and lightly hydrated. For me this will work better during warmer months because I like a heavier moisturizer during the winter. For reference my skin is fair and combination. I often get reactions around my chin area due to hormonal acne and this didn’t irritate or initiate anything. I will update after longer use. Lightweight!
