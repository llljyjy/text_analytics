Absolutely love this moisturizer. I notice my skin is firmer and more even and it truly does a great job moisturizing. I love changing up my routine and trying new products, but this is one of the few things I purchase again and again. Itâ€™s pricey but worth it, which is saying something because I usually default to drug store moisturizers. Absolutely love! repurchase over and over
