I have combo skin that is very sensitive and also have rosacea. I am very dry in the winter/spring and a bit more oily in the summer/fall. This is my perfect summer/fall moisturizer. It is light, hydrating, and gentle. It plays well with all of my other products. I’m a repeat buyer and haven’t found anything else that quite compares. Great Moisturizer
