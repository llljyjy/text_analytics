I really do love this lip balm, it’s not greasy and sinks in quickly, the scent is pleasant and light, and it’s reasonably good at keeping lips soft. I also don’t mind spending on quality products. But compared to other similar products that are half the price, the high price tag just isn’t justified. This is something I keep an eye out for in gift sets with products I already use but just can’t bring myself to buy on its own. Great product, just not worth the price
