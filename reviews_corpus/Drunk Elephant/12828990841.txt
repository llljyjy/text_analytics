I love the twist open cap and pump so the product stay clean and you can control the amount one pump at a time but the packaging is really big for the oz that you get. I love how the cream feel, it feels soft, creamy and almost airy like whipped cream. I’m not so keen on the scent but it is fragrance free and that’s a good thing. Innovative but unnecessary packaging
