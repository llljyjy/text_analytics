I used this product in the past and didn’t notice a difference with hyperpigmentation so then I tried a bunch of other vitamin C serum products.  Fast forward a few years and every time I researched vitamin C Drunk Elephant serum came up so I thought I’d give it another try.  I like the way this product has been  revamped.  You mix it yourself so it doesn’t oxidize before you even get a quarter of the way in!  I will say this time around with the serum being fresh, I’ve seen improvements with hyperpigmentation!  I’m glad that I gave this serum another try! No wonder it always make the “best“ list. Stays fresh
