I’ve been testing this product since late December and wanted to give it about a month before I left a review. What this oil does is minimizes the look of lines, hyperpigmentation, blemishes, and sun damage, locking in moisture and restoring a healthy glow.The product is super easy to apply. I always apply it at night, and by morning I’m left with a  gorgeous retinol glow. The packaging is classic to Drunk Elephant’s vibe. It’s not only cute, but the dropper works very well, which is always nice. I love how much better my makeup sits on my skin since using this product. This oil definitely smoothed out my skin and fine lines, which in turn makes my makeup glide on with ease. The ingredients that Drunk Elephant highlights within this oil are:  0.5% Retinol, 95% Virgin Marula Oil, & Ceramides. I’ve been using retinol products for over a year now, and my most favorite thing about this oil is I’m not left with a retinol burn after using it multiple times a week. It’s very moisturizing. However, because it’s not as strong as other retinol products, It does take longer to see results. A-Gloei is perfect for those who want to start using retinol/retinoids. I would definitely recommend this product for those getting started with retinol products. For those who already are using higher strength I’d recommend sticking to what you already use if it’s working. ✨ Let it GLOW ✨
