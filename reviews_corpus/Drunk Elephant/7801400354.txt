Got this from bazaar rewards to try it out, doesn’t notice change in skin due to small size.The smell is something like herbal, the consistency between oily and watery, IMO leaves a weird feeling on skin after application, like walking this type of tiles that aren’t smooth but has good traction instead, is the best I can put it.Never knew the price of the full product, and don’t think I’d consider buying now I know. Can’t say I like it much
