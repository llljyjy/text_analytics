Not a fan of the bottle type. It’s super super cute and modern BUT makes it hard to get all of the product OUT for use. This past year I’ve been trying to create the perfect skincare routine for my combination skin type. I’m PUMPED that I was sent Drunk Elephants Whipped Moisturizer & Night Serum free for testing purposes! First impression: there is no scent to either products & the Night Serum has a neat bottle design. DM me for full review after 30 days.GOALS: reduce fine lines, dark spots, & hydrate under eyes. Great option for winter months if you have combo skin like me and are prone to dryness. Gel serum with pure ingredients
