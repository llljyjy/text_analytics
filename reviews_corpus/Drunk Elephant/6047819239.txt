I use this oil every night after I get out of the shower & it has changed my face and skincare routine! I have dry skin and I put the oil mixed with drunk elephant lala retro moisturizer and I jade role both of the products on my face nightly and I can see a HUGE difference in my skin, my acne scars have gone away and my breakouts are very minimal! Highly recommend to add this to your nightly skincare routine especially if you have dry skin! DRY SKIN HOLY GRAIL
