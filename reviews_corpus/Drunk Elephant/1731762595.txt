Does this product actually work? Idk.I’ve been using it for a month and haven’t noticed any results. I know it takes a few months to really see changes in fine lines, so who knows.. maybe it does. I can however tell you that it is not irritating in the least. I have dry sensitive skin and found this oil to be very hydrating and calming. I was able to use it daily right away without any irritation. Too soon to tell…
