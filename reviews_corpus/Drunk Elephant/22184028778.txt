I have pretty oily skin to begin with so I’m always iffy about using a face oil. I mixed one or two drops into my moisturizer and I didn’t see any issues as far as clogging my pores or making me really oily. This really helped to brighten and even out my skin tone. I do have alot of acne scars and discoloration. I probably would buy this again. I received this product for free to review nan
