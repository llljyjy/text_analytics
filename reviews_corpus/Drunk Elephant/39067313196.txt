I used this product every day and night for at least 3 weeks. I love the easy twist dispenser and that I can control how much cream comes out. Saves more of it and no double dipping your fingers into it. The lotion is moisturizing yet firming in a gentle way where the skin does not feel still. The appearance of micro wrinkles smoother out. Little goes a long way. Had zero skin sensitivity to it. Tried complimentary in exchange for a review through Influenster. One of the best Iâ€™ve tried.
