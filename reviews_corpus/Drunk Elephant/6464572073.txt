This cream was a total bust. My skin is combination but I use prescription tretinoin and my face stillPeels from that- I wanted a ceramide cream and this one was a no brainer bc it was from drunk elephant. Oh well- it is super thick which is fine but it doesn’t absorb into the skin and then it’s just like a greasy layer on top- not possible to wear under makeup so don’t even try. It just does absolutely nothing if anything it dries my skin out more. If you want a great ceramide fry Sunday Riley ice cream it’s amazing- you can buy small samples on eBay . I’m starting to veer away from drunk elephant bc several of their products have been disappointments in the last year for me. don’t bother
