The texture of this serum is great. It mixes very well with the drunk elephant moisturizers and other serums. It feels very nice on my skin, but I have not noticed any dramatic changes in my skin. I do not feel like it is adding any hydration, my skin is the same since before I introduced this product. I can see it working well for dryer skin, but I do not see any dramatic results with my combination-normal skin. For me, itâ€™s a waste of money. Good serum for some.
