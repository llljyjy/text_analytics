I did receive this product for free from Drunk Elephant & Influenster in exchange for my honest review! I want to say that I’m a big fan of Drunk Elephant products. I was very excited when I found out I was receiving this. So far it’s great! I’ve seen my skin become smoother and it feels really hydrated when I use this. Doesn’t irritate my skin, doesn’t leave it feeling super oily. I use two drops and I only use it at night. Says you can mix it in with your moisturizer but I have yet to try it. Only reason I took off a star was for the price. If is pricey however I understand it is a serum and most serums are pricey. Packaging is excellent it’s heavy and feels great. Smoothing!
