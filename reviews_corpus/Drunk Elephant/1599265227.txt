I love this stuff! I received it for testing purposes but I could see myself repurchasing. I love that the oil doesn’t just sit on your face but absorbs into the skin. I still can’t tell if it does anything because I haven’t used it long enough but it doesn’t break me out which is good! I feel like it is a good intro to retinol. Great oil!
