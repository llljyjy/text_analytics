I have been using this product for around 3 to 4 years and if I had written a review before I would have called this stellar and spectacular. However, this new formulation seems to have a lot of problems. Initially when I bought the bottle I wasn’t too sold on having to mix it myself but I really do love DE as a brand so I decided against it. Not to mention the waste of plastic, 3 months after purchasing the product began to leak within the pump and a white-like rocky substance began to form around the pump. The serum turned runny, the cap became difficult to turn and the side of the product had orange liquid. With this I will be switching to another vitamin C. It’s such a shame as I really do love this brand, but until they return to the old formula I won’t be purchasing this product anymore. Their new formula is not it!
