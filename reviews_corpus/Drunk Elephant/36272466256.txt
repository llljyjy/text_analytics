Pros: it did brighten up my skin, so there’s that. I also enjoyed the mini lab project of mixing the formula! Definitely doing their best to make sure it stays as fresh as it can on the shelf.Cons: the entire experience of the product once it was on my face. It smells strange. (No, it had not gone bad.) It’s also oddly sticky. Even noticing my skin looked nice during the day couldn’t get me to push through with this product, that’s how unpleasant it felt.All that being said, I used it just once and my skin did look brighter. If you can push through the sensory experience of having this on your face, then it does its job. Not for me
