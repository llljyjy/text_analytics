I wanted to like this but unfortunately, something in this product doesn’t work for me. It dried out the skin around my eyes to the point where the areas got red and flaky. I saw someone say that they use it to treat acne scars so I’ve been using this on scars on my arms and legs and I think it’s actually making a difference! Obviously won’t be repurchasing, but glad I could find a way to repurpose the rest of this expensive cream. nan
