I love this Bouncy Brightfacial Masque  by Drunk Elephant! It goes on smoothly and feels light weight. It does feel slightly greasy for a very short period but once my skin absorbs it, it disappears. I can tell it’s active ingredients are working hard because I have one specific dark spot that bugs me that seems to be lightening up. It’s a bit pricy, but worth the investment. I only apply at night. Love love love
