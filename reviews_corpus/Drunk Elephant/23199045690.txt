This really is a luxury face oil as it’s labeled. I have tried other oils before and none of them are as thin as this one, which I love because I don’t like the feeling of thick oils. I will say I think it’s a bit overpriced since it’s just an oil, so it’s not like it’s going to drastically change your skin in any way. All it’ll do is lock in moisturize. I’ll enjoy it while I have it, but I won’t be repurchasing after. But if you are a big fan of oils, this is a great one and you will love it. Luxurious, but overpriced
