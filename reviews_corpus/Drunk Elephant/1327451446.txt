Amazing spf! I absolutely love this! It gives such a beautiful glow, smells like cocoa or chocolate without that weird spf smell, and feels so lightweight. I recommend this for medium skin as fair complexion people then to get an orange tone if applied on light skin tones. For me this blends effortlessly and I’ve been using it as a foundation (applying concealer and powder on top) and it gives such a natural glowy look. It’s very moisturizing as well and it’s my new spf. I hope they never stop selling this because it’s seriously such an amazing product nan
