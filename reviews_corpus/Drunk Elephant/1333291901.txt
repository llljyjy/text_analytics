I am torn about this product. I have been using it every other night and at first I really liked it and my skin was glowy, but after a week or so I noticed my skin was so sensitive that it was making my other products burn. I typically use a .5 retinol that my derm recommended and it has never made my skin feel this way. Unfortunately I don’t think I will be switching to this as a regular staple in my skincare routine but I am going to give it a shot using it on my chest where I have some aging and some sun damage since I can’t tolerate it on my face.
