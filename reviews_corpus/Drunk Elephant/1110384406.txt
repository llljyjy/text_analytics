Like others have mentioned, it does smell a bit but I can get past it because of the amazing results! Vitamin C is a tricky ingredient, and not all 15% Vitamin C serums are the same. This is truly one of the most potent formulas you can buy but it does mean you get the medicinal smell. For me, it dissipates after i put my moisturizer on and the results are striking! I noticed a visible difference after the first week and often get compliments on how ’glowy’ my skin looks. Worth it for me, but if you can’t get past the smell, there are plenty of other great (albeit less effective) alternatives Worth It
