deserves zero stars for new bottle with broken pump - I mixed the product and then was never able to get the product pump to work.  Expensive and unusable.  I did pour it out into my hands and apply it that way which is a bit messy.  Product is a bit chemically in smell and quite sticky - even under my sunscreen.  Contacted support to see if there was a trick to getting the pump to work and was basically treated like an idiot because I can’t get the bottle to work.  Fun!  Obviously, won’t purchase again and considering the customer service, avoiding becoming a rouge member again. Zero Stars
