This is my first time using a Retinol Oil product and I absolutely love it! The hydration, the glow, this product has it all! If you are looking for a new addition to your skincare routine, this is the product to try. It nicely moisturizes and you do not need to use a lot of product either. You can use this in the morning or night - totally up to you! Not only does it hydrate skin, but it also can help with acne as said on the bottle. I highly recommend this product! Love the hydration!
