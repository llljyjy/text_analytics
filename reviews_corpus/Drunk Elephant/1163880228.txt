After receiving this, I read on the package that soy bean oil is one of the main ingredients! Not only is soy an endocrine disruptor (a problem for estrogen receptor breast cancer) but it’s a cheap, garbage oil from a subsidized GMO crop.  I’ve always been a big Drunk Elephant fan, but returning this today! Soybean oil is one of the main ingredients! Nasty!
