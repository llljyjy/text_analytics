I love this serum. I bought it because I loved Protini moisturizer and wanted to continue using peptides over the winter while I needed a heavier moisturizer. The lactic acid has my easily congested skin looking and feeling smooth and glowy as well. The only reason it’s not 5 stars is the packaging. The top of the container became difficult to turn ~3 months in, and it leaked a little, so now the dry serum inside the top is making it difficult to open/close. I’ve had problems with the container of the DE vitamin C as well, so I wish they would transition to more simplified packaging. Great serum, poor packaging
