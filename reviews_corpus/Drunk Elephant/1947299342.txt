I much preferred the old formula. Why make us mix it ourselves? As others states it doesn’t fully mix properly which is frustrating as it seems that it wastes a ton that just sits at the bottom not mixing with the serum…Also color Is different and i don’t know if it’s in my head or what but it just feels different going on. Doesn’t seem as effective. Hoping drunk elephant will take these reviews into consideration and go back to what everyone was religiously obsessed with before. I am seriously considering changing to a different brand if it remains the same cuz i just don’t like this as much. Old formula was way better
