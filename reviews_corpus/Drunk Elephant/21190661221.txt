I love this product! it’s helped so much with my acne prone skin and it makes me feel so refreshed after. However I have had acne since I was 11 and have been treating that acne with prescription grade formulas for a pretty long time now. I wouldn’t recommend this formula to anyone with sensitive skin or as a “gentle” mask. This baby packs a punch but she doesn’t leave me irritated in the slightest. Only gripe is that the nozzle can’t get air of the ending product out and it’s a little frustrating to have to scoop product out of the bottom to get my moneys worth. Still love it tho :) For “experienced” skin <3
