Something about it changed - smells bad/expired. I’ve purchased this many times over the years but suddenly it stinks! Smells like you’re putting a farm on your face. I exchanged it at Sephora and even wrote to Drunk Elephant and they exchanged it for me. Same odd smell. I had my husband and my mom smell it and they confirmed it has an unpleasant scent. I live in San Francisco where it’s always a cool 60ish degrees so it can’t be the way I store the product. I always have this product stocked in my skin care line but not anymore. I can mask the smell a bit when I make my face cocktail at night of marula + framboos + la la cream and the smell eventually dissipates but for about 2-3 minutes after application you think you visited a petting zoo.
