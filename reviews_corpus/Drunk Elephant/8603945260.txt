I was using the ordinary moisturizer before I received this drink elephant moisturizer for  free to try from influenster in exchange for my honest review. The one from ordinary was super thick and goopy. It made my skin feel so greasy afterwards. When I got this in the mail I immediately quit using my old moisturizer and replaced it with this one. I have been using this Lala retro whipped moisturizer in the A.M. after cleansing my face. The product itself doesnâ€™t have a smell and the consistency is more on the thick side. I have sensitive skin and so I never know which products are going to agree with my skin and which ones are not. This did not irritate my skin. My skin feels very hydrated after applying without a greasy after feel. Great moisturizer!!
