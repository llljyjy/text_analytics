Provides a dewy light tinted glow.  Works for medium to fair skin, but not porcelain white skin. Right now this is my second favorite tinted sunscreen. My favorite is Neocutis’ Journee, but it’s very expensive and a little harder to get a hold of. Also, always double check the expiration date if you buy in store, because sunscreens expire.
