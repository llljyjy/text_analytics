I feel compelled to write this review after Sephora failed to provide any assistance at all.  DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY - for $103 I’d expect the packaging to hold up - I was wrong, it’s become almost unusable - bottle cracked, have to fight with the bottle to pump out serum.  I knew I had to mix this myself, didn’t know I’d also be expected to DIY a working bottle.  There’s other pricey vit c serums that do better and for less hassle. Pass - poor design
