I shopped around for a GOOD makeup remover. Specifically something that could remove everything from my eye area. It needed to remove all of the eye makeup and be gentle so I didn’t end up ruining my lash line. This product was highly recommended on several beauty blogs so I decided to give it a try. It’s AMAZING for what I wanted. Leaves skin feeling buttery soft, no residue, product packaging is well thought out with magnetic scoop, lasts for 3-4 months depending how much you use. Definitely part of my everyday routine. Make sure to use a generous amount. Keep away from heated area (I don’t store in my shower because it tends to separate the product). I have acne prone skin and can still use it throughout my entire face to remove makeup. I do use a different cleanser afterwards and the combination works great to not cause breakouts either. Would definitely recommend if you like taking your makeup off in the shower like I do. Must have for makeup removing
