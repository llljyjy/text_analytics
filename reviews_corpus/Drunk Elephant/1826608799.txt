I’ve been using a L’Oréal eye cream for a few years, there’s nothing super special about it and I notice it burns my sensitive skin at time. I was actually looking for a new eye cream to try, and here comes Influenster to the rescue! I absolutely love this eye cream! It’s rich, smooth like butter going on, and doesn’t burn or lack moisture! I’m definitely going to switch. switching!
