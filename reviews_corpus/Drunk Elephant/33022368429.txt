ive been using this as my cleanser for about a month now and i personally think its not worth the price and you can get way better for 42$ ! if you do not moisturize your skin (which i do not recommend to do) this will dry your skin out. i liked that it was not perfumed. this cleanser didnt make me go ‘wow’ but it did its job. when i will finish the bottle i will not repurchase. great but you can get even better
