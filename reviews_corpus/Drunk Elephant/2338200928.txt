So, I’m not sure if I’m not using it right or what? I followed the instructions only to be left constantly wiping this product off my face. “Warm water activates it“? Hardly, it’s oil and water- they don’t mix and this product is so hard to get off. I end up washing my face twice- sometimes 3 times to get all of this waxy product off. It’s disappointing due to the price of the product. It does work well removing most make-up. However, it’s then a process to remove this product from your face. Ehhh....
