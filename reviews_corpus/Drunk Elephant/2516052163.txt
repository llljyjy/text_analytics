This looked and does work the same as The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution. But this is an expensive price What is confusing on the box of “how to use“ didn’t add new users never used anything peeling solution should use for 10 mins, but in the package it said. With The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution it said “Leave on for no more than 10 minutes.“ and for this “Leave on for 20 minutes“ which is quite long for a mask/peeling solution. Idk about this...
