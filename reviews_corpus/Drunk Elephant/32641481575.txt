Okay so overall this stuff is pretty amazing. I have extremely oily skin and was nervous about using this product as it is not really one I would gravitate towards at least texture wise. But after using it the first time it left my skin feeling moisturized but not oily and slick feeling. I actually started to mix it with my niacinimide and it has been doing wonders for my skin. I like how thereâ€™s no scent as I can be a little sensitive to scents and smells. I definitely will continue using! Amazing! Even for oily skin!
