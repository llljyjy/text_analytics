This is the first retinol oil serum that I have ever used and I really liked the results. I only use it before bed a few nights per week because I was worried about bothering my very sensitive skin, and my skin always looks much happier and healthier the next morning. Over time, I feel like my skin looks much younger and has more of a glowy look. Definitely very happy with this serum! It has also helped with my acne issues, which is really nice.
