I used this randomly while staying with a friend and now I cannot go back. I have combo skin & I’m extremely acne prone. I like using the Paula’s choice AHA toner every couple days which really helps maintain a glow but thi a literal game changer. I do it twice a week and my skin has NEVER looked better. A holy grail.
