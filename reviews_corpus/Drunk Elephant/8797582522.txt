I am an avid user of drunk elephant and have always love their products. This product wasn’t any different, the eye cream went on smoothly and sat well under my make up. I love the design of the eye cream and makes it functional when traveling so you don’t have to stick your finger in a jar. I also like the factor that it is in the section of clean by Sephora. I’m starting to make the switch to all clean products. While it is pricey, I do think it is worth it. nan
