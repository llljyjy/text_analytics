I got drunk elephant before they changed the recipe or the way they packaged it. And it was amazing I loved it! But now that they changed everything it is a crappy product. I waste more of it shoots out like water. When I mixed the product it didn’t mix well. And just the feel of the product is no longer the same. Rumor has it that drunk elephants stole the original recipe of another company that researched vitamin C for years. And that company sued them, maybe that’s why they changed the ingredients. Was awesome.
