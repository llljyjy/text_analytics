I use this in the mornings and I love it, but there are just a few setbacks. First, the price, it’s astronomical, especially when it’s 0.5oz and you don’t even know if it’s active because of the instability of vitamin C. Second, you can’t wear concealer over this. I’ve tried several brands and multiple ways of application, but it always creates a patchy look under makeup :/ In my opinion, I wouldn’t buy this again, but if you have the money and don’t wear makeup maybe this is for you! It did significantly help with my undereye circles! Expensive.
