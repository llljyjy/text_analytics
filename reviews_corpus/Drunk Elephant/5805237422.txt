I am a pretty big fan of Drunk Ellie products and use a few regularly in my routine (lala whipped cream and d-bronzil, so I was excited to receive this one.You can see the texture is very creamy, but it applies very lightweight. I’ve been using it for several weeks and I can truly tell a difference in my skin’s hydration and elasticity. I think it’s also made a difference in brightening my under eye circles as well. I would definitely purchase this product for myself and recommend to others. nan
