This is such a beautiful rich undereye cream.  It really makes that area feel plump and nourished without making makeup look cakey.  I love that I can easily use this on both my undereyes and lips both in the day time as well as evening and it provides the perfect amount of nourishment.  I do layer this over a serum for best results.  I find this is more of a “lock in hydration” product versus anything with really any significant brightening or actives to reduce wrinkles or fine lines, but I love the thick texture and it ensures my undereyes never look dry or unbalanced Good but expensive
