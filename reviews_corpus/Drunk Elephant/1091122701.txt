I wanted to love TLC Framboos so badly but my skin just can’t handle it. THIS ONE HOWEVER,  I love so so much and it doesn’t make my skin angry and reactive. This is the perfect amount of resurfacing but still gentle. You definitely won’t see the instant results like you would with TLC but if you are sensitive that’s just something you have to accept regardless. Finally an acid for sensitive skin!
