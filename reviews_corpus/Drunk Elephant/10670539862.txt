OK LIKE… WOW. I had this oil sitting on my makeup desk for over a YEAR. I got it in a kit and never reached for it, but then one day I ran out of my moisturizer and decided, for the time being- I would try this out. This stuff is AMAZINGGGG. Not only is it extremely hydrating, it actually calms my acne. I apply it generously before bed and when I wake up my skin is like glowing, I’m genuinely so happy. Did not expect to love this product as much as I do. AMAZING
