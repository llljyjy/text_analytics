I have heard of this brand for quite some time but have been nervous to jump outside my normal skincare routine. Boy am I happy I did! My skin is typically quite troublesome—red, blemish-prone, bumpy, dull. This product does it ALL. Literally magic in a bottle for your face. Hard to believe it targets all these issues at once. Also, for any post-partum mama’s or women in generalWho suffer from melasma, this product was made for YOU! My “sunstache” is virtually undetectable. Thoroughly impressed with this product. I received this product to try as part of a campaign. Absolutely THRILLED with my results!
