Right off the bat I did not like the smell of it. Smelled like cooking oil, color of cooking oil.. and felt like cooking oil. However it did leave my face feeling soft with a light glow to it. Over all I donâ€™t see me purchasing this for myself personally.I received this complimentary of influenster. Not for me maybe?
