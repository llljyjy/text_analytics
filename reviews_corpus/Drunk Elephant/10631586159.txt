I received this as a gift from Drunk Elephant and Influenster for an honest review. To give you some background, I have oily and acne prone skin, and I have tried retinol in past and it made me break out all over my face so I was hesitant to try this. I tried this 2-3 times a week and my it is so gentle yet effective on my sensitive skin. It did not make me break out and I saw noticeable improvement in my skin. Worked great on my acne prone skin
