I received this product for free in exchange for my review.  I love that it has a small amount of retinol, I have wanted to incorporate an oil into my skincare routine but I was scared I have been applying a few drops every night I have not seen any results yet.  This oil feels very moisturizing after a while.  Iâ€™ll keep using it and seeing what happens! nan
