WHY THE CHANGED FORMULA? I am so sad. This was my got to for so long. This is not the same , I understand the mixing the formulation for stability reasons. However that shouldnâ€™t change the makeup of the product . This is different. I can feel it and see it. So this is a waste of money. I would rather have the old ones back. extremely disappointed. THIS FORMULATION IS AWFUL
