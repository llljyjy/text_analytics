I bought my first d bronzi two years ago when my intern told me about it. I went HAM with drunk elephant products for a year and finally switched to the Ordinary (big change, I know) and this is the only product I still use. The color is perfect, the smell and texture is spot on. This always gives the perfect glow to make me camera-ready working from home when all I want to do is put on concealer and mascara - no foundation needed! Iâ€™ll never NOT buy this
