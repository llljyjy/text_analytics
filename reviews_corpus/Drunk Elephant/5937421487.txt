These last a fairly long time. I can use the white one every day, it has a milky texture when wet but will lather. It leaves my face tight and clean. I normally don’t like milky cleansers but it is soothing and satisfying when im not using the beste number 9. I use the brown bar every 2-3 days because it has little exfoliating beads and I don’t want to irritate my skin barrier. This is my second time purchasing. Let them completely dry or pat them down with a paper towel before storing because it will leave residue in the storage case. My lil friends
