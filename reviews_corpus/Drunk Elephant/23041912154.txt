My skin is ultra sensitive and super picky. It reacts to all the usual skincare holy grails (vit.c, retinol, niacinimide, most cleansers, masks and scrub exfoliators... the list goes on), but the Protini moisturizer has been a staple for the last few years, and I’ve been looking for something to add to the routine to help clear, brighten and bring life back to my face. I am blown away to say that the Protini Resurfacing Serum is now my one true holy grail. Where all others have broken or dried me out, this little beauty adds moisture, clarity and brightness. Feels silky soft on the skin after applying (I mix one pump with my facial oil from the Potion Masters, and then top with Protini moisturizer). I use this only at night and make sure to be liberal with sunscreen during the day. I’ve been using it consistently for two weeks and I feel like I’m glowing. I use half the base makeup I used to feel like I needed, and it’s the clearest my skin has looked in ages. Pores are minimized, texture has started to even out. If you haven’t found your holy grail yet... don’t give up. I think everyone’s skin requires something different. I’ve been through a lot of misses to find this hit. nan
