I received a complimentary sample of this moisturizer courtesy of Drunk Elephant and Influenster. It can be tough to make a full analysis of a moisturizer when it’s a sample size, but I try to be as practical and fair as I can in my approach. Pros: -The scent of this moisturizer is mild. Not much to it. -A little goes a long way, so you don’t have to use a lot.-Feels lovely upon application and keeps your skin smooth but not greasy.Cons:-It’s price. But hey, that’s just Drunk Elephant products, so no surprise there.-It takes a little massaging to get the moisturizer to absorb. Overall, this moisturizer works well and seems like it will last a long time. I’ll continue using until it’s run out to determine if I might purchase this in its full size. nan
