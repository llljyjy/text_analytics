I received this as a sample just recently. I will say the texture of this moisturizer is great, it feels very creamy and luxurious. It does absorb fast as well, which I appreciate. It didn’t leave my face feeling extra soft and smooth, but it does get the job done. I didn’t feel that this was worth the hype, the Fresh Youth Preserve and the Tula 24/7 samples I received were both miles better. Not bad by any means, its a good product with no fragrance. Just doesn’t feel like a 5 star moisturizer. GOOD but not GREAT
