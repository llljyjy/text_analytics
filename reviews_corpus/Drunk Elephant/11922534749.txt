I received this from influenster for my honest opinion and I was sooo excited to get this box! I’ve been using the products for about 3 weeks. The moisturizer is super creamy and feels great going on and my face feels super soft after.  However, I have oily skin and I think the cream might be just a little heavy for me as I usually use a gel moisturizer.  I do think it’s a nice moisturizer for people with dry skin and I would definitely recommend it! super creamy!
