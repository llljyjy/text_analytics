I received this product as a complimentary gift for my honest review and experience. While I did love the texture- it was thick and moisturizing, great for an overnight eye cream- it was also irritating to my eyes. It made the skin around my eyes itchy, and made my eyes water. I also donâ€™t recommend for dark circles, it did very little to brighten the eye area nan
