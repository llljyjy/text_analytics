I LOVE so much about this product. I’m a pretty experienced user of retinol and was so excited to receive this oil for free in exchange for my review. Lots of retinol products can be drying and live the fact that it’s an oil, I’ve had no peeling or drying out with this product and love the fresh glow it gives me skin. My only complain is that the retinol doesn’t seem very strong and I haven’t noticed much change in my skin. It’s great in addition to your stronger retinol products though! Really nice product, needs more retinol
