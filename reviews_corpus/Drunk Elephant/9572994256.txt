This is one of the best products out there for bringing back skin brightness and clarity. I instantly notice a difference in how my skin looks after one use. My skin looks clearer and feels a lot softer. There is a bit of a tingling sensation and definitely read the directions before use or bad things could happen. As for the oil, I think this also helps to create long-lasting results and keep the face moisturized after the peel. I was afraid it would give me pimples because of how heavy oils can be but it didn’t. A little goes a long way with the oil too. Too much and you’ll get grease face. Gives You New Skin
