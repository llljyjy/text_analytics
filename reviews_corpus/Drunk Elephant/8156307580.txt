I was looking for a similar product to my skinceuticals that wasnâ€™t quite 150$. This smells and the consistency is similar if not exactly the same, but it is very sticky. I did not enjoy how sticky it made my skin and for 80$ the standards for performance are still quite high, so I would pass. nan
