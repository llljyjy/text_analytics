I just wanted to leave a quick note about the bottle— I know a lot of people are having issues with the design, and I’m sure it’s possible that those are defective, but I want to make sure that you folks are holding the white part of the bottle and twisting the teal part to make the pump part come up (it’s the same as the A-Passioni bottle). I really like the design of the bottles and have been through several with no issues so hopefully this helps or you don’t get any more messed up bottles! ABOUT THE BOTTLE
