I used these bars for the first time today and my skin felt incredibly soft and clean! And what I love most about these bars is by the time I am finished my skincare routine, they are completely dry and ready to be put back into the case. The only problem I have with them is the smell, it smells very weird but they don’t have fragrance. I don’t mind the smell if they work! Once I applied my other skincare products and washed my hands, the smell went away. That’s all I can say about them because it was my first time using the bars nan
