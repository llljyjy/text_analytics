So far so good! I don’t think the people leaving reviews about “having to do it yourself” understand why. They made the packaging so that you mix it fresh yourself when you receive it, otherwise there would be people getting Vit C mixed and already weeks or months old. Vitamin C doesn’t last long without oxidizing, and then it’s no good anymore. With this new packaging, you mix it fresh and it can last 6 months. And yes, this serum has a weird smell, but this isn’t something new, most Vit C serums smell like hotdogs when you first apply, but it goes away. So far I’m liking this and use it in the morning before my sunscreen. I’m noticing brighter skin and and I’m a little more glowy. This is a little sticky at first and takes a while to soak in, so I’m knocking off a star for that considering I’ve tried other Vit C serums that don’t feel tacky at all. nan
