I had a sample size of this and after a few days I noticed how bright and fresh my face looked and how much less make up product I needed to apply. I have a hard time justifying 80 dollars when I use The Ordinary products regularly and I am a big fan of many products from their line (I do not love their lactic acid though). But this is a different ballgame. This is worth it. I don’t know what magic they use but they get the perfect blend of acids, to plumping to brightening and nourishing all in one easy to use, yes expensive, bottle. I think the twist and lift cap is fun. I like all the expensive Drunk Elephants and Sunday Riley serums but no way can I get them all…this is the one I splurge on. Worth it!
