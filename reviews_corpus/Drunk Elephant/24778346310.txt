This product is great from the bottle design to the serum itself. I have normal to oily skin with mild scarring due to hormonal pimples. This has helped even out my skin tone and glow as well as lightening the dark spots after 5 days. The consistency is perfect to apply to skin without feeling greasy or dry. Incentivized review. nan
