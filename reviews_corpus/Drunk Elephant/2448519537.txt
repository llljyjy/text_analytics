Love using this because it portions out the ‘right’ amount but don’t know if I would purchase this on my own. I received this for free for my honest review. It is very hydrating and makes my under eyes look nice but the cream I got from cerave does the exact same thing but at a fraction of the cost and more than triple the amount. $60 is just too much for basically the same thing in a cool package. Good but I feel is overpriced
