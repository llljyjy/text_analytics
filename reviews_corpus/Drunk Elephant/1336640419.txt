My favorite moisturizer but I use it sparingly because it’s not cheap. Hydrates my combo dehydrated skin and it takes away the appearance of fine lines temporarily. I layer a sunscreen on top because there is no SPF. I first purchased the mini version which is sample sized for $25 as I was worried it would break me out as I get acne very easily. It gets so bad with some products I’ll even get cysts on my neck. This caused no issues so I was confident in getting the full size. I’ve tried tons of other moisturizers albeit not usually as expensive and I always return to this. The smell is not offensive and has a clean feeling scent. nan
