Needed a cleanser to fully remove sunscreen so tried this two nights in a row. After the first night I noticed some tiny blemishes coming up under my skin. Waking up after the second use, I can confirm that this broke me all around my jaws and chin. Just when my skin was looking clear and smooth. In the garbage it went! BESTE IS THE WORSTE!!
