it was just ok, a nice little refresh spray but nothing special. honestly i feel like it might of made my dry skin a bit more dehydrated and dull than usual, and made my skin turn red and irritated sometimes after cleansing and serums so if you have dry sensitive skin be careful. wouldnâ€™t re-purchase. just ok
