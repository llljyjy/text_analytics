I’ve been hoping this product wasn’t the culprit of an all-over breakout in small, itchy, red bumps and peeling that took a week to go away, but after spot testing it again today I’m already starting to break out in an itch again. Really wanted to love this product but clearly I’m allergic to something in it, so just be weary if you have sensitive skin! Bad Reaction…
