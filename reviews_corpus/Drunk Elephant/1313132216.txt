Nope for me. I’ve used the old formulation and it worked wonders for getting rid of hyperpigmentation spots on my neck and brightening my skin. After they changed the product so you can mix it on your own, I haven’t seen the same results, the dark spots are still on my neck, I switched over to the Cos de Baha vitamin c and used that just on my neck to see if I could se a difference and within 2 weeks it faded my spots where the DE could not with over 3.5 months of daily use. Will not repurchase. Don’t waste your money!
