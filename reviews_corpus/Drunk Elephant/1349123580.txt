I actually quite like this product. I feel like it has diminished the fine lines on my lips to a degree. I was questionable about the large size but I have learned how to maneuver it. However, I do find it very expensive for the amount of product you get and it is not super moisturizing. I personally use it as a barrier when Iâ€™m doing my skin care to not get retinol near my lips and then before I go to bed I apply a more occlusive lip care product. I would re-purchase but I would like to see the price reduced. Good but Expensive
