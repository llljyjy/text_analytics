I love the brand and I love this product. This is a great addition to my face cream in the morning  which adds colour without wearing foundation. Having read the other reviews, it’s important to acknowledge that this will not add coverage and this is not, in my opinion, to be used on its own. If it’s concentrated it can be quite overwhelming. I myself am very pale and I add a tiny drop to three pumps of cream that are meant to cover my face and neck. The pros here are; that it does not have the gross smell of self tanners and it doesn’t feel unnatural. However, there should be an expectation that it will build colour on your face as it just works while it’s on. It wears of at the end of the day. In summation, this is a super fun product to add that makes a tiny bit of difference. I find that it’s worth it because the bottle lasts forever and it really feels like a special product. However, if you are on a budget and looking to refill only your staples, this is not one of them. I still give this a 5 star review for the fact that there isn’t anything exactly like it. Excellent
