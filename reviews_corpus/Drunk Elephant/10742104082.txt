I received this as a sample, but this is an ACTUAL review. Ok I actually love this oil! Drunk Elephant honestly never disappoints. I’ve been using it for about a month now consistently, and I’ve noticed my skin has been more radiant! Since it’s winter, my skin has been super dry, so this has also helped smooth my skin and reduce any dry patches I get. The texture of the oil is super thin and silky. I don’t like anything super thick on my face, so this was a pleasant oil. I definitely recommend if you need a good face oil. Silky Smooth
