Drunk Elephant has done it again in bringing us ingenious & innovative skincare! This time it’s a retinol oil that’s gentle on the skin and works just as impressive, maybe more, as your standard over-the-counter retinol product! As I get older, my skin becomes more susceptible to sensitivities; however, I haven’t experienced any skin irritation, breakouts, or discomfort thus far! This product is easy to apply, absorbs seamlessly into the skin, and leaves a gorgeous glow behind after every application. After using for almost two weeks, I’m already noticing a more even skin tone, diminishment of fine lines, and a more youthful appearance overall. My skin is more soft and supple, as well as hydrated! There’s truly no fragrance and the texture is very similar to your typical treatment oils. I also, as always, appreciate the optimal quality and ingredients that make up Drunk Elephant’s products and the A-Gloei Maretinol Oil is no exception! I still can’t believe how well my skin agrees with this skincare and I agree with the results! Skincare at its Best!
