Compared to my body, my face is paler because I use sunscreen pretty religiously and I’m olive-toned and, when I’m not tanned, I feel like my skin looks very yellow and sickly. I originally bought this because I saw Allana Davidson raveeee about it on her YT channel and now I get why. I mix it in with my sunscreen and it instantly makes me look tanner, and in my eyes, healthier. I really like it. It’s a bit expensive, but you don’t need a lot of product to make a difference IMO. Use 3 - 4 drops and you’re good to go! To be honest, I don’t know if my hyperpigmentation fading has anything to do with this product in particular or other products that I use specifically for that, but either way my skin looks great! Oh, and FYI, this doesn’t break me out! Great Instant Tanner
