Really love the formula for this and would honestly consistently repurchase if it wasn’t $90. Results are immediate. But, there are too many great glycolic acid products at a cheaper price to justify this. I don’t mind spending money on a great product but this one just isn’t unjustifiable for me. Great packaging for travel though! great product but not tor the price
