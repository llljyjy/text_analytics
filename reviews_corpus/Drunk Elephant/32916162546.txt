Ok I cannot say how much I love this product so much more over the ordinary & Paula’s choice, it’s actually a holy grail for my acne HOWEVER, 1. It’s extremely expensive & 2. It literally goes within a month and half for me I get about 6 uses out of it before I need to go and buy a new one, I use about 8 pumps for me entire face next time I’m gonna try 6 to get the most out of this product. LOVE IT BUTTT…
