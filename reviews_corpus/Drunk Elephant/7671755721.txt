I’ve been looking for a good vitamin c serum to purchase for a while, but I was nervous to purchase this one because of the price tag and some of the lower reviews. The vitamin c I was using prior didn’t contain any l-ascorbic acid, which is not a good thing if you actually want the vitamin c to absorb into your cells, and since this one contains the recommended 15%, I decided to take a chance. And oh, was it worth it. I assumed this would be one of those things that helped over time, but wouldn’t do much instantly. So when I saw myself in a mirror a few hours later and my skin was glowing and my dark undereye circles were noticeably lighter, I was shocked. The container is opaque, which is great because vitamin C is very unstable and I appreciate that it protects the product from light. I loved mixing it myself since it means this will stay potent longer. Some people say it’s hard to pour, but I didn’t think so. Before pouring in the serum, tap the powder container on a hard surface a few times to unstick it from the bottom of the container. This is what I did, and I didn’t have any powder stuck at the bottom after I poured in the serum and shook it for a minute.This product doesn’t have any added scent, so I can understand how someone might be really sensitive to smells and not like that. However, the fact that it is unscented is great for your skin, and its natural scent doesn’t smell bad to me: I might compare the smell to something like baby powder or baking soda. It’s not overpowering in my opinion.The worst part is that it’s a little sticky, but for me, personally, that’s not a problem. I don’t wear makeup most days, so I’m willing to deal with a little bit of a sticky product when it’s this good. Plus, because it adds so much brightness to my skin / under-eyes, I feel even less inclined to wear makeup. I truly love this product SO MUCH
