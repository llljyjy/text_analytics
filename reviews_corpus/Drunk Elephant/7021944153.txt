I love this! It has made my skin soft and smooth. I still cant give results for long term. I do have some acne scars, which im hoping this will diminish the appearance of it. So far it’s been good and happy to be using this. I apply it after i was my face, before going to bed. In the morning my face feels great. You dont need much than just about 2-3 drops depending on your face size but that’s all i need to get good results. Love and Excited to Use Each Time
