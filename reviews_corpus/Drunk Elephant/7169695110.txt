I like this lip balm. it’s perfectly buttery and comfortable and has no scent. applies really nicely and lasts quite a while. it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. the tube is a bit chunky and awkwardly shaped but it’s still pretty easy to put on. I wish there was more product for the price tho nan
