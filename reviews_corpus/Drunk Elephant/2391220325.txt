I’ve tried to love this, I really have. All of the DE skincare products break me out. In fact, I haven’t found one that doesn’t. This is the second or third time I’ve tried posting a review for this, but they somehow never showed up. Curious, indeed. Anyhow, I’ve been using DE off and on for a few years now and I’ve finally given up on hoping it will work for me. Breakout City
