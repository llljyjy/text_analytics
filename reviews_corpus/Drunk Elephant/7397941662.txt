As a die-hard fan of the La Roche Posay adapalene gel I was hesitant to try out a different retinol product, but this oil based serum has done wonders for my skin! It is significantly more gentle than the adapalene gel and keeps my skin clear and un-irritated. I like that I can use it day or night and that it provides nice hydration while it resurfaces my skin. Love! nan
