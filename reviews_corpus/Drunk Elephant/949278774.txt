It’s a good eye cream, but a little on the thin side, so if you prefer something thicker around the eyes, you may want to look elsewhere. After using for a week, twice a day, I really don’t notice any improvement, and I really can’t justify paying that amount of money for something that doesn’t outperform my usual CeraVe eye cream. However, I do prefer Shaba over DE’s C-Tango eye cream which stung my eyes and made them water. At least Shaba doesn’t sting! I am a DE fan (their A-Passioni, C-Firma and Protini cream are worth every penny), but I think I would only continue to use this eye cream if they reduced the price by at least one-third. It’s just way too overpriced. Decent eye cream...but WAAAY overpriced!
