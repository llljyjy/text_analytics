I got a sample of this product and was so happy to try it out. It is the perfect moisturizer to soothe my dry skin in cold weather. It’s thick but sinks in well and doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy. A little goes a long way and it doesn’t really have a scent. I will definitely be purchasing this is the future!! So good!
