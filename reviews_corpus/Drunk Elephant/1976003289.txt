Excellent moisturizer for those who have dry skin. I was initially skeptical that this product would clog my pores but it turns out to be one of the best moisturizers out there. It is super gentle on sensitive skin, light enough to hydrate for the whole day. The product itself it comes in a beautiful pump, which usually last me 4-5 month. Highly recommend! Love it!
