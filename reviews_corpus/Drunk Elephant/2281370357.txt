This product has really changed my skin and I never say this lightly. I am very picky about my skin which is sensitive and combination. During the winter, my skin started peeling from dryness after my ski trip. I started using this oil and I really felt that my overall texture started improving, even after the first use. It is an oil but it doesn’t make me feel greasy. It also has a gentle amount of retinol which does not cause me extra dryness because of the hydrating oil. I am able to use it daily because it is so gentle.  I will 100% be repurchasing when I’m done with this. New holy grail product for winter
