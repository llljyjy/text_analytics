This makes my skin look absolutely incredible. I use this once a week and leave on for 10 minutes. In my opinion 15-20 minutes is way too long. I did that once (and I’m used to chemical exfoliation) and my skin peeled for a solid week. Even with 10 minutes, my skin is bit flaky the next day but I just buff my face with a towel the following night and my skin looks incredible the following morning. Kind of a tricky product to get right, but for me it’s worth it. I bought this myself. really amazing; don’t leave on for very long
