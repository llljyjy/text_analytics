I have always wanted to try retinol oil since I have heard about it’s wonders all over media platforms. I personally love this product because I feel like it revitalizes my skin. On my dry days I like to put a baby drop in my foundation to give it a dewy look. A little goes a long way. Keep in mind this is an oil, so the best time to use is it usually after you wash your face before bed since it might make you look like a delicious glazed donut if you are too generous. My favorite thing about this product is that I wake up the next morning with tighter and softer skin.  I received this item as a free sample and I believe it will last me a long time. Though the price is high, the bottle goes a long way so I’d likely purchase again. Soft & Silky
