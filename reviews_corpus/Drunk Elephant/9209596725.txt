I received this product complimentary in exchange for my review. This oil feels very nourishing on the skin and sinks in fully after a while, leaving a glowy sheen behind without being too sticky or greasy. I love that it has a small amount of retinol, as I’ve been meaning to incorporate it into my skincare routine. I’ve been mixing a few drops with my moisturizer each night. I haven’t seen any noticeable results yet but will continue to use it and see what happens! Not irritating
