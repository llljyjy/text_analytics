This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used, and I’ve tried so many at this point. Compared to this moisturizer, it felt like others just sat on my skin. I use this product before my primer under my makeup and it feels like it actually enhances my primer. I’ve just repurchased for the second time and will continue buying. Pricey but so worth the money and lasts pretty long. Love
