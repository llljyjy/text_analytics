I was eyeing this for awhile and decided to finally try it since it went on sale and I’m so happy I did because after only a few days, my skin is improving very nicely. I was using Caudile SOS serum but it wasn’t playing nice with my other skincare, so I had to find something else and this fits perfectly. The packaging needs to improve and it’s too expensive which is why it took me so long to try it. The sale price $60ish dollars should be the regular price and although I will keep it in my rotation, I will only purchase it on sale/discount. It works
