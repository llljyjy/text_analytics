I first purchased this serum around my 61st birthday. 5 months later I have just ordered for the third time. I use this serum faithfully twice a day and have never felt more confident about my skin. In the evenings I also apply this to the backs of my hands and they look years younger and are so soft! I know the container is designed to protect the product from exposure to light and air, but I see it as a negative that I canâ€™t tell how much product is left. I Will Continue to Repurchase
