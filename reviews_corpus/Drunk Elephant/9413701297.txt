I used my points to get a trial size for this because I had been torn on whether to buy it due to the mixed reviews. I’m glad I did, because I would not spend money on this product. If you have a sensitive nose, this is absolutely not for you. Usually even if something has a scent I don’t like, the products I use afterwards gets rid of the scent. Not with this. It’s sickly sweet, kind of like oranges that went bad. The consistency of it was okay, but it dried a little sticky (that however went away after I applied my moisturizer) I can’t speak on how well it actually worked as I didn’t see a difference, but the trial definitely wasn’t large enough to show accurate results. The only pro really was that it was fun to mix together. It’s not the worst product out there, but it’s certainly not something I would buy again. There are better vitamin c serums out there. Smells like sweet death
