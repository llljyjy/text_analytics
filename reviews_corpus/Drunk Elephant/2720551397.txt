Definitely not worth the $$ or that hydrating. So bummed because I like other products from this brand, but it definitely missed the mark. The only reason I gave it 2 stars vs 1 is because it didn’t break out or upset my sensitive skin and did seem hydrating when you first apply. But overall, don’t waste your money. Didn’t really make a difference at all. Would not buy again
