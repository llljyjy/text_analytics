DE’s micellar water has a watery lotion type consistency, a lot of the product absorbs into your cotton pad (if you’re using one) so you have to use extra product to get the job done, and there’s a distinct play dough smell to the solution—but it is fragrance free I believe.This is one of the oiliest micellar waters I’ve ever used and it always left a light a noticeable oil film on my face after use. While I typically double cleanse with some kind of water based cleanser after my micellar water step, with my Bioderma micellar I could sometimes be lazy and skip that step while not sacrificing clean skin. With DE’s micellar I felt like if I didn’t use a cleanser after use my skin was still dirty and would likely be too oily for my essence and serums to properly absorb.Overall I gave this two stars. One star because I have very sensitive skin and over the course of using this for two months I didn’t notice any irritation. The other star I gave is because while I did not like this one bit, it might be somebody’s HG? Somebody with incredibly dry skin, is not acne prone in the slightest, and doesn’t use any serums or watery products after cleansing… just goes straight to a cream.I subtracted a star because while there weren’t any large breakouts I would trace back to this, I felt like I got a few more little whiteheads here and there than usual. Another star was subtracted because I feel it didn’t do the job and required that you go in with a second cleanse (not optional like most micellars). And the final star was subtracted because drugstore micellars are doing a far superior job than this for just a fraction of the price. Save your money! Drugstore micellars are way better AND cheaper…
