Hate hate hate the new design for the bottle. I can’t believe I hav to mix my own product at this price point. Bottle is trick and broke, making it almost impossible to access the product without it leaking. I probably wasted 30% of the bottle. It’s also a different consistency than the previous formula. It’s runnier so when you quiet it into your fingers, it’s drips. Disappointed. let down
