I’ve always loved the old formula and can understand why people don’t like the new one. When I first mixed the packages, the entire contents of the little bottle couldn’t fit into the actual applicator bottle so it’s just waiting around until I get through enough product to mix in the rest. I used the serum the night I mixed it and despised it. I felt like I was wasting solution because so many bubbles caused the mixing/shaking were coming out so I needed to pump more into my hands to get the actual serum. BUT, I highly recommend waiting a few days until the bubbles settle down from mixing the bottle. I was about to return it but thought I’d give it another chance, and once the solution settled the product is just as good as the old formula. Leaves my skin glowing! New Formula vs Old
