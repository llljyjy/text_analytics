I got this product before it got popular and it still is my favorite moisturizer by far! So simple, hydrating, and lightweight (which makes it not clog my pores). I have repurchased this time and time again & will continue to do so for its amazing results on my skin. It evens my skin tone and makes it feel baby soft. Iâ€™ve tried a lot of Drunk Elephant products and other moisturizers but this one is definitely my fave (for oily skin). 100% worth the price and the hype. My Holy Grail
