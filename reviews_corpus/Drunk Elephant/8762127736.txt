I waited about a month before reviewing this product. Because I wanted to see if it had any impact.The formula is very light and works really well with oily skin. Because of this it also absorbs into the skin really quickly. It leaves the glowing finish on my skin. It’s also a good beginner level retinol and because it’s not irritating and it’s really an oil more than a retinol.However I have noticed it doesn’t really affect the texture of my skin but does brighten little bit. I know with retinol regular long time use is the trick, so I’m expecting more obvious changes to come in the near future. nan
