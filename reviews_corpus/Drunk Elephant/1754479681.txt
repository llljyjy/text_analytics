This was a thick moisturizer that left my skin feeling greasy. I found it extremely thick and it was hard to spread on evenly and took a while to fully absorb. I was not a fan of the scent as it was a bit overbearing. I would not have bought this myself as it is very pricey for what it is. I received this product as a free sample to give my honest opinion of. Not worth the cost.
