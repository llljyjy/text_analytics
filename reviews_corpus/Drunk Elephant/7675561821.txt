I originally had 2 stars but I changed to 1 star. I’ve gotten through about half the jar and stopped using this. It melts off your make up fine but I think it smells terrible and the exfoliating sand smells even worse. Almost like when you collect shells from the beach but leave them out to dry and it smells like gross old seafood. It doesn’t leave me feeling like my face is clean and cleansed I feel clogged and oily. I double cleanse anyway but after putting this on I feel like I have to wash my face 4 more times to just get it off. I’ve broken out all over my face from using this and now I’m doing damage control on all my break outs. I usually don’t break out but I have break outs on every portion of my face. The only reason I would use this is if I had stubborn eye make up but even then I think I just want to completely throw the jar out. The only thing it does well is melt your make up but it doesn’t clean your face and leaves residue, which makes me feel like my make up is probably still on my face. I wouldn’t recommend this and I definitely will never buy this again. Skip this
