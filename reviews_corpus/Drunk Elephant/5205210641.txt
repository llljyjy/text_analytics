I bought this with high hopes, but sadly every time I use it I don’t see much of a difference. It doesn’t really give you a glow or tan, even when you put a dollop on! I’ve gotten better results with my Eco tan and Saie’s glowy primer! I feel like the added antioxidants and oils is also a marketing gimmick… Not worth it
