I just finished a full size of this and I really enjoyed it! I use it as my first cleanse to remove makeup and then follow up with a gentle gel cleanser to remove the remaining residue. I love that this one is polyethylene (plastic)- and frangrance-free, so it’s amazing for sensitive skin! I didn’t try the exfoliant because I was worried it would be too harsh. It’s nice of them to include an extra sample in here, but I think most people who buy this probably have sensitive skin and don’t want a potentially harsh exfoliant. But that’s just me, so I didn’t dock stars since I didn’t try it. I just donated mine. Great polyethylene-free cleansing balm!
