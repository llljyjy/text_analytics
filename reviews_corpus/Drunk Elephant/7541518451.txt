Drunk Elephant gifted me their Ceramighty AF Eye Balm to try out! I’ve been using it for over a month, and I can confidently say that it’s by far one of my absolute favorite eye balms to date. It has significantly helped the skin texture under my eyes, as well as bags. It retails for $60, but a little bit goes an extremely long way. I strongly recommend giving this one a go ⭐️ A New Fav
