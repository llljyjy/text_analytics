Feels nice on skin. Hydrates decent. BUT, it definitely effects my makeup. My makeup does not stay when using this moisturizer. It is the only product I changed in my routine. Sad it didn’t work. By the end of the day my face is spotty and splotchy from makeup movement. wanted to love it, but couldn’t.
