My first impression of Drunk elephant, was that it was effective by fading spots, and reducing redness and brightening my complexion. My skin felt more firm and looked radiant. The ingredients are amazing in these products in my opinion, but always due prior research before using product. What I did notice immediately was how firm it made my face feel, then I started to see other signs it was working for me. I would recommend this product & this will be a staple in my skin care routine. Get you some Drunk Elephant!!!
