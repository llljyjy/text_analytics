i have sensitive skin and this product is not for me. i am huge micellar water gal and this was just not it. it didn’t feel hydrating or nice at all. right after my skin was red and sensitive. could be my skin, but i suggest i’d you have sensitive skin using a drug store micellar water that has a much simpler formulation would be better. i’m not sure what ingredient is in here that is making my skin irritated! but maybe for people who aren’t struggling with sensitive skin it would be fine. nan
