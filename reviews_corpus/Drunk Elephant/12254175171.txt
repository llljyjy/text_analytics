The pump broke after 1-2 months of use and I don’t know how to declog it. So now I have to open the bottle to use it each time or a lot of product leaks around the pump and goes to waste. If they fixed the pump I’d give it 3/5 stars. Also not noticing much of a change after 2 months of consistent use (with an spf over). :/In the photo you can see residue from where the pump leaks when I use it. And the product is still clear yellow and not orange so it’s still supposed to be potent! broken pump
