I received this product and was super excited! As a night shift nurse the constant bags under my eyes are no joke. This eye cream was hydrating and thick and didn’t irritate the delicate skin under my eyes like other products have. I felt like it’s moisturizing but light so I didn’t feel oily and it gave my tired eyes some rejuvenation it needed!! I definitely enjoyed this product! nan
