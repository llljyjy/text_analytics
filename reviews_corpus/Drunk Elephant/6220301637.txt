This is a very rich, thick eye cream. It does feel verynice, but I had concerns about millia if I used it toomany nights in a row. I typically go for a more gellike formula. This is soothing. I actually used it onmy nose and forehead to help treat a sunburn.One full pump from this packaging is wayyy toomuch for just your eyes.For this price, I would prefer more activeingredients. Very Rich
