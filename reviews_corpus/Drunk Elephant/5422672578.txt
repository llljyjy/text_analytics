I have mixed feelings about this product. I don’t think it does what it says it will do - there’s no lasting firming at all. But it does seem to help with puffiness, especially in the morning, more than other products I’ve tried. And no side effects - no drying, no itching, no greasiness, etc. Great for removing morning puffiness
