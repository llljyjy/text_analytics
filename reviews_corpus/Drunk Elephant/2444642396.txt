I received this product free from Influenster inexchange for my honest review. I’ll start off by sayingthat if it weren’t for my eyes burning from it, I wouldprobably be obsessed with this product and give it 5stars! It smooths and plumps the skin around my eyesand reduces the severity of my naturally dark undereyes. I only use half a pump for all around both eyeareas so a little goes a long way. The texture of thisproduct is creamy and blends into the skin nicely.Makeup also applies nicely over this product when Iuse it in the morning. It’s just okay, not worth the price IMO
