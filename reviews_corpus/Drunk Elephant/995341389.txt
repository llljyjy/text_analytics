This serum is my new favorite! I’m mid 30’s, my main concerns are dullness, signs of aging. This serum makes my skin so plump and glowy. It tingles a bit but I haven’t experienced any irritation. It’s sort of a thinner consistency, and does feel a tad sticky but I put moisturizer on over it and no pilling or anything. I use this at night and moved my retinol to daytime (under sunscreen!) and my skin is looking so great. I will definitely be repurchasing. nan
