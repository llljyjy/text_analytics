I got a tiny sample of this awhile ago and was instantly in love! I made that little packet last as long as possible because I really hate the price point of DE products but mannn after trying 5 products now; they’re all worth it.I hav tried EVERY self tan product under the sun and even the ones specifically for your face; and without fail I always break out. I feel a lot more confident with some tan to my skin tone because I’m natural olive toned but have genetic dark circles. So when I get a little more tan, my dark circles aren’t as prominent. All that to say: THIS amazing product allows me to get that color to my face without breaking out of from self tan or having a spray tan slowly change shades over two weeks. I mis literally like two drops with my DE moisturizer and rub into my face and I’m given an instant bronze glow. It stays all day. I’m able to do my usual spot concealing with cream bronzer and blush, and this stuff still lasts! I’ve used it for several months now and it’s never irritated my skin. OH and the cherry on top… I have oily skin and this doesn’t exasperate the oil at all. All around PERFECT PRODUCT. EVERYDAY MUST HAVE
