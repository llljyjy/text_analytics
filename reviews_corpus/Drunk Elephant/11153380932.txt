I received this product in exchange for my honest review. Everything about this is perfect. The delivery system, with the pump built in, is excellent. Perfect for traveling. There is no scent to the cream, itâ€™s a normal viscosity, and feels a tad sticky when first applied. It dries quickly though and you can see a difference with repeated use! Love this eye cream!
