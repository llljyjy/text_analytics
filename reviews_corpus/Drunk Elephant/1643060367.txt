I received a free sample of this to try for a review, but my opinion is my own. I really like the texture of this product and it soaked in nicely even though it is pretty thick (a little goes a long way). I think it does a good job moisturizing and I like that it doesnâ€™t seem to have ingredients (like certain metals, that I recognized at least) that basically act like makeup and fake a brightness, so you get an idea of if the product is actually helping. nan
