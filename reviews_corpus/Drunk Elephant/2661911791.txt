I purchased these for travel, both bars are about 1.5 by 1.5 inch by 0.5 inch blocks. I use these for my face and body, they arenâ€™t drying and effectively remove makeup and sunscreen. I keep them on a wood soap block to stop them disintegrating in the shower or becoming slimey. The little blocks last a surprisingly long time. Great for travel
