I’ve been using retinol for over a year and I know it takes time to see results. I’ve been using this oil and it has a great texture, it’s light and leaves the skin looking healthy but I haven’t really seen a difference yet in my skin texture or anything like that because I’ve been using it for a short time, I don’t have an opinion yet but what I’ve already noticed I don’t think anything amazing, just ok nan
