I was skeptical of this product due to all of the hype so bought the mini to give it a try & I was surprised by how well it worked! It really moisturized & hydrated with a small amount of cream. I tried to find cheaper moisturizers but as I’m 40 & live in Canada with 4-season climate, the other options just weren’t doing it for me. So the one product I am willing to invest in is a good moisturizers & because you don’t need to use a lot of the product for it work, I’m willing to invest in the full sized product! Worked for me!
