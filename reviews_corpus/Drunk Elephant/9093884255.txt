I have sensitive eyes and am always a little nervous to try new eye creams but I am very happy with this one so far? It comes out looking kind of thick but it actually feels pretty light once on your skin and gets soaked up well! It could be a little more moisturizing/moisturize longer but it’s still pretty good! I am not a huge fan of the packaging though because it feels kind of cheap but that’s just the type of packaging DE uses! Good for sensitive eyes!
