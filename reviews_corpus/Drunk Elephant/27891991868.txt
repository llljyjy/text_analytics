Very moisturizing and kept my skin from being dry and cakey with makeup but was uncomfortable and heavy when i was in the heat and i felt like it was “melting” but it would be good on a colder day (especially with dry skin) or if your staying inside - good for really dry skin Don’t recommend for summer heat- but moisturizing
