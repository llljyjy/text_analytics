I received a small sample from Influenster and tried it 1-2 times. I love how lightweight it is. It contains ceramides so I know it’s good for my very dry skin. I have eczema and I did not have a bad reaction to this cream despite my sensitive skin. Because it’s a clean product, I may consider purchasing this in the future on my own instead of my typical ceramide cream. No bad reaction!
