I’ve been using this cleanser for a few years now and absolutely love it! It does a great job of removing grease and everything else and leaves your skin feeling smooth and moisturized. You only need to use a pea size amount so although it may seem expensive it’s not actually in the long run because it will literally last you a year! love love love it! love love love it!
