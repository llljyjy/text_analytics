I had an eye cream I was loving and almost out of and then I received this one complimentary and decided to use it before repurchasing the one I had been using and loving and I ended up living this one possibly even more. It’s a great consistency, thick but not too thick. It works well as both a day and night eye cream. It’s super moisturizing. I don’t know that I necessarily notice a reduction of fine lines, but in the eye creams defense I’ve never noticed that with any eye cream at any price point. Overall I’m really enjoying it and think I’ll likely end up repurchasing this one instead. nan
