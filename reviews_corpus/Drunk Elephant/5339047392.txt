Amazing. I mix a drop or two of this into my moisturizer. It wakes my skin up and gives a lovely glow. My skin looks perfectly sun-kissed with this product. I love how you have control over the amount, so you don’t need different shades between seasons. I also have sensitive skin and most bronzers clog my pores. This doesn’t irritate my skin. Also love that this is a clean enough product that I don’t worry about my young child touching or kissing my face with it on. This may be the second skin care/ makeup product I’ll re-buy in my lifetime. I’m generally non-committal and non-monogamous when it comes to skincare and makeup! Amazing
