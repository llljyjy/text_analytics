I did not really know what to expect when first using this product, but after the first night I was pleasantly surprised. The product reduced my redness greatly and my skin tone and texture looked much more even. The only thing I did different that night was put on this mask as my last step. I have been using this every night since then because I think it really benefits my skin type (combo, some acne). Although being a mask, the product itself is a light cream which soaks into the skin quickly and it’s not sticky or uncomfy at all. I dont think this product is something that would usually catch my attention, but having used it i’m happy I was introduced to it by Influenster for free in exchange for a review. I recommend trying it out if youre looking for something as a last step just to top everything off. Last-step overnight mask
