While the product itself may be great, I find that the quality of the packaging has declined. I noticed my sister’s protini serum bottle broke, but assumed it was just a one off thing. Later, when I got my own bottle, the pump cap also came off. When I finally managed to shove it back into position, it no longer pumps smoothly and is stuck. I’ve had great experiences with the the C-Firma serum bottle, TLC Framboos bottle, and the baby blue hydration bottle. Overall, Drunk Elephant is a favourite brand of mine, and I loved everything about the products I owned, product and packaging both. This packaging really disappointed. There’s still a bunch of product inside, but I’m having a very difficult time dispensing it. Great product, faulty packaging
