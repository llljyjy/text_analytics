I donâ€™t understand the bad reviews. This serum Is SO hydrating!! Truly like a glass of water for your skin. But like every Hyaluronic Acid Serum, you need to apply  it on DAMPED skin!! If your skin is dry when putting it on, it will dry the face, like every hyaluronic acid serum. My skin drinks this up! Truly hydrating and soothing! So hydrating! Apply on damped skin!!
