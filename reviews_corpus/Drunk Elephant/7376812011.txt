I bought this sort of fearing that I would fall in love with it and would have to continue buying it and unfortunately, this has become essential for me (I say unfortunately because it’s expensive haha). But it’s truly the best moisturizer I’ve used. It makes my complexion so soft and smooth, and I swear my skin wakes up looking more even and less red after having it on overnight. I even feel like it’s helped with my acne—maybe just because it’s more gentle than other moisturizers. I have an oily forehead with a really dry chin, jawline, and nose, and this moisturizer does wonders on the oily and the dry sections. To me, it’s 100% worth the hype and worth the money. If I’m gonna choose one area of my skincare routine to splurge on, it’s gonna be this. Best moisturizer I've ever used.
