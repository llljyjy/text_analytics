I don’t usually like miccellar water but this one goes above and beyond! I originally received this product as gratis when I won a gift bag but I definitely am going to purchase once I’m out! I will say even though the scent is fragrance free, it smells like play dough to me. However, it still is a great product. I prefer to use it with a cotton round before I cleanse my skin, instead of a makeup remover. After use, you can really see all the dirt/debris come off. I would highly recommend this to anyone! Miracle’s in the Milki!
