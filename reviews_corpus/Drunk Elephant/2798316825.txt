I’ve been using this for years, ever since it came out. The smell doesn’t bug me and it doesn’t have much of a smell in my opinion. I prefer zero fragrance in my items bc it is not good for your skin, so I don’t mindOnly is a little sticky but once it dries, it’s fine. It makes my skin glow!! Best vitamin c serum
