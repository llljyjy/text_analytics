A fact about this product is that it is an extra mile when we talk about moisturizing the eye area, I did use it in my night skincare routine and immediately the eye area felt moisturized, the formula is pleasant and it almost doesn’t have a scent. I like the idea behind of the product, it is a clean cosmetic, they also avoid the use of some ingredients that have a potential for irritation, in theory, it is good, but I need to let y’all know that I felt a little irritation in my eye when I woke up this morning, and it was the only thing I used around my eyes, after washing in the morning it was all good, tonight I will try use less so it doesn’t get into my eye. The last considerations are the cute little packaging and the clever pump idea. Yes, I would recommend it!I’m excited to keep using the product and see the results of it in 8 weeks or so. ✨SO FAR SO GOOD✨
