Not the best, but not the worst! A little goes a long way! My main concern with this product is that itâ€™s advertised/recommended for all skin types. I usually have a normal/dehydrated complexion! When first applying it feels great and replenishing - however after about an hour it feels like it just sits on my skin rather than absorbs, and leaves me feeling & looking greasy! Would only recommend for someone with a more dry complexion - and otherwise would only recommend tying a sample before purchasing!! Consider your skin type!
