I received a trial of this product for my honest review. I already use a few DE products but this was my first time trying this moisturizer. I enjoy the Hydra and Protini, but this is the first one that feels like it could be a regularly used moisturizer as opposed to a serum or an as-needed moisturizer, like protini.It smells like a standard moisturizer, not awesome like some of other DE products like bodywash or face wash, but this is a non-greasy and very moisturizing product! I enjoyed using it with other products as “smoothies” as DE likes to call it. It’s a good way to distribute other products. nan
