Well I’ve using other eye cream , but after trying this I’m definitely switching. It’s everything I want in an eye cream. It’s very hydrating, but not greasy which is perfect for a make up. And it has ceramides which are essential for a good skin care. And it does not have a strong scent like some others. Im in love nan
