I have a normal to dry skin. I live in a hot and dry area of Texas. I received this product from Influenster and the brand during summer (July). It is not the best time to try out this product. Even though it claims to be lightweight, I still find it sticky and heavy on my skin. I like it because itâ€™s fragrance-free and the science behind this product seems to make it a great hydrating cream. Good cream for winter
