Full disclosure: I received this as a free gift via Influenster. I own several drunk elephant products already so when I was sent this I was absolutely excited. I incorporated this item within my nightly routine. The texture is not overly oily and has no residue after it seeps into your skin. I also layered several other products to see if it would start pilling. And it passed the test! I have hormonal acne skin, retinol has always been my best friend through this new skin process I seem to be in. It leaves the skin looking very soft, glowing, and supple  just after a few tries. I gave it one less star for the scent, I was not a fan. Amazing!
