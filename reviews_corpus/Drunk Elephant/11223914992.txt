This eye balm is so nice. I love the texture and how it absorbs really nicely into my skin without it feeling greasy or too heavy like other eye creams I have used. This product also leaves my under eyes feeling really hydrated and smooth. Also, a little bit goes a long way. I really like the packaging, especially as someone who travels, because I know it wonâ€™t spill in my bag as long as I twist the top to hide the pump. nan
