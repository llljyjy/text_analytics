This is the first review worth writing so I hope it helps someone.Let me start by saying... I suffered with hyperpigmentation all my life and adding this product to my skin routine has been life changing. To be honest... it was a real struggle at first. I used it as a face wash, as a toner as well as a quick refresh, but once I found the way that worked best for me... my skin has never looked better! Not only did it slowly help to reduce hyperpigmentation on my combination skin, it also brightened my complexion and left my skin with a natural glow that I haven’t seen in years.I really think this was the missing piece to my daily skin routine. Thanks Drunk Elephant! If, Sephora continues to stock this product and Drunk Elephant doesn’t change or discontinue this formula... I will be a customer for life... for sure. Amazing Product!
