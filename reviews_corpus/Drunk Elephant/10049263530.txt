I am loving this bouncy brightfacial masque illuminateur! It makes my dry skin feel and look amazing!! It has 10 percent azelaic and 1 percent salicylic acids. Those go deep into the skin to clarify uneven tone, fade stubborn spots, and reduce the look of redness. It provides a brighter, bouncier, and more even complexion. I have been using this for my morning and nightly routine. It comes in a pump bottle, and I pump 2-3 pumps and apply it to my face and neck after applying all my other skin care products. This dries down very quickly and doesnâ€™t leave my skin sticky, oily, or greasy. I have definitely noticed a difference in the redness and with my uneven skin tone. This completely smooths my skin, and clears a good bit of the redness which is amazing!! It has definitely become one of my favorite masks! If you have redness, stubborn spots, or uneven skin tone, I would definitely recommend giving this a try! It works incredibly well!! Makes my skin smooth, and fades the redness!!
