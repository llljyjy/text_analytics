If youâ€™re not used to retinol this is a great one to start with. Due to the serum/oil nature, it does not dry you out at all. I have been using it for about two weeks and I can see quite a difference In my hormonal acne and just the smoothness of my skin. I received this product complimentary of Influenster. nan
