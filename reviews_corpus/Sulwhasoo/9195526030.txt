Sulwhasoo products always feel so luxurious. Their packaging is always so minimal and to the point. This cream is no exception. It has a whipped texture and I love applying this cream at night to let it get fully absorbed. Skin literally feels like silk after applying this cream. Sulwhasoo isnâ€™t a cheap brand but their products are for sure worth a splurge. Smooth like silk
