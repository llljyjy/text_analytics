So I have become a full Sulwhasoo convert.  I typically love the Concentrated Ginseng Cream but decided to try this as a light daytime option to help stretch the more expensive Ginseng Cream further. And I ended up loving this light essential moisture cream. It is a gel like consistency, it hydrates nicely under make up without being heavy, and is really just the perfect amount of moisture for the day. Might not be enough hydration for someone with extremely dry skin, I lean towards combination type closer to dry. Great spring/summer moisturizer. Fresh and Light
