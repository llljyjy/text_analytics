The product is great and left my skin feeling hydrated without stickiness.  Combined with the serum it leaves my skin glowing.  The one thing I donâ€™t like is the scent.  The smell upon opening is a bit strong and pungent.  I was given this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. nan
