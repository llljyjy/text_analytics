This cream has a really nice and thick consistency to it. My skin feels super soft and hydrated each time I use it, but I’m not quite sure if I see a difference in firmness. I’ve been using it for over a week now on my face and neck so I’m not sure if maybe I need to use it for a longer period of time to see a difference. Other than that this is a great moisturizer! Nice Moisturizer!
