The cream has a lightweight texture that blends into the skin fairly quickly. The scent isn’t overpowering but it does have fragrance and some citrusy oils towards the bottom of the ingredient list. For the price you’re paying the ingredient list is not very impressive. They’re pushing the whole ginseng aspect as the selling point when they’re really isn’t much research to back that ingredient up. Not a good value
