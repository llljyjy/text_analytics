Kindly gifted by Sulwhasoo, I found that this cream really helped brighten my skin after an extended period of time, help moisture in the driest months and didn’t cause any irritation for my sensitive skin. I’m not sure the price point is worth it, but I had a great experience with it! Really nice but not sure if worth the price?
