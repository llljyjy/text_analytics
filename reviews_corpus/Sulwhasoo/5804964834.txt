This kit is a good way to try out Sulwhasoo for the first time, or good travel sizes for a short trip. I have combination/oily skin and these products are lightweight, don’t feel oily, but feel nice and balancing. The cleanser feels slightly drying but that would be my only complaint. I like the scents, they’re not overly fragranced. Definitely Worth the Try
