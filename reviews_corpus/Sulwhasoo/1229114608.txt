Sulwahsoo gifted me this set, honest opinions are my own.I love this kit! It’s a great way (and super affordable at $58) to get to know Sulwahsoo, a Korean luxury skincare brand that is part of the AmorePacific group. This kit comes with a cleansing foam, balancing water, serum, and cream. The First Care Activating Serum is ~$45-50 on its own making this set a steal since you can also try the Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream that sells for $52 for the mini or a hefty $260 for the full size.I was already a fan of the Activating Serum - this lightweight serum immediately hydrates my face and helps absorption of other skincare products. The Gentle Cleansing Foam (full size retails for $38) removes sunscreen & makeup and gives a squeaky clean feeling without stripping the face of moisture. It’s got a mild, herbal scent.The Balancing Water is Sulwahsoo’s toner ($52 for a full size), made with purslane (to moisturize and soften skin) and anti-oxidant rich goji berry. It’s a refreshing way to prep the skin after you wash your face. I personally didn’t see a huge difference in but loved the relaxing herbal scent. Not a must buy for me in the future at this price point.I’m happy I got to try the Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream as a full size is $260! It’s a super luxe face cream that smooths, firms and hydrates. My face looks radiant & glowy while feeling plump and moisturized. The earthy, herbal scent is quite strong but gradually fades away. Cons: Fragrance. This line may not be for you if you are sensitive to fragrance. The serum, cleanser and balancing water all have a mild herbal scent as ginseng is the star ingredient to the line. The Renewing Cream’s got the strongest scent - while relaxing and calming for me, it may be overpowering for some.Price.Definitely priced in the luxury skincare category with a full size cream going for $260.Will continue to come back to Sulwahsoo by picking up this affordable kit! Affordable way to try Sulwahsoo hits!
