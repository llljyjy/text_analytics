I am sharing an honest review on the serum gifted by Sulwhasoo. It smells like ginger which I like but might not be for everyone. I found that for my combo skin it reduces oils and my skin appears slightly firmer. It is a nice addition to my skincare routine but I did not notice any other significant changes to my skin using this. Nice but didn't see any significant effects
