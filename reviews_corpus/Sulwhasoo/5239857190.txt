I have been using this cream over the past couple weeks and I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin. I’ve been struggling with postpartum acne and just overall tired/dehydrated looking skin and this cream has helped immensely. My skin feels much more hydrated, smooth, and firm after using. I apply it before my makeup each morning and every night before bed. The cream itself feels like butter, but I don’t love the scent. It isn’t overly fragranced and goes away pretty quickly once applied, but has a musty scent to it. It has amazing ingredients and works really well, so that’s really all that matters.*Gifted by Sulwhasoo, but this is my honest review Worth it
