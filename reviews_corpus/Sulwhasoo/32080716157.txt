I have nothing but good things to say about Sulwhasoo Overnight vitalizing mask. I have been using this every night for about a month now and my skin has become so much more supple, glowy, and hydrated. It is an expensive product but the bottle is big and full of product. I haven’t even made a dent yet and I can see it lasting a long time. A pea sized amount is all i need for my entire face. The product is so rich and creamy and doesn’t take long at all to notice a difference. I could go on and on but this is an amazing night cream definitely worth the splurge
