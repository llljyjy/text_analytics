The Sulwhasoo first care activating serum really helps hydrate your skin while also brightening and firming! I use this post-cleanse serum-essence after cleansing my face and before I put on any other product on. I put about two pumps in my palm and massage into my face in circular motions starting at my nose. I then use my palm and gently press on my cheeks and forehead until completely absorbed. this serum has an orange color and a slight scent. The result is a very glowy, hydrated and soft baby like skin texture. I was kindly gifted by sulwhasoo! nan
