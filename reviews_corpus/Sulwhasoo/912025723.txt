This set is a great way to try out these products or to use for travel. Theyâ€™re really gentle and have a light, refreshing scent (maybe like pine?). My skin feel soft and hydrated. I definitely think this is a good deal and would also make a nice gift for someone. The serum is also a super generous size! Great kit for travel!
