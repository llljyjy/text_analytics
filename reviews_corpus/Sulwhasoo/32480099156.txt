This oil cleanser from Sulwhasoo has been a super gentle product to my skin.  I use it to remove my sunscreen and make-up mostly.  I did say “most make-up“ in my headline because it removes all hints of foundation, blush, brow pencil, eyeshadow, bronzer/any contouring I have on but only manages to partially remove my Fenty Beauty’s Flyliner for example, & mostly remove my Rare Beauty’s Perfect Strokes Mascara.  Aside, my skin has no complaints and it’s a fairly reactive, acne prone type.  It’s best applied directly to the face to break down the crap on it and then wet your fingertips, massage the product all over till you get this milky lather and then rinse off.  Being lightweight liquid oil based it can be a bit messy when pumping the product out and into your hands etc.  The bottle is simple in design and I think it’s cute this way. I also liked the box it came in, the brand design is tastefully simple. 4 out of 5 because it doesn’t remove make-up but not all make-up and at $53.00 it should remove all make-up.  BUT, you do get quite a bit of product in this bottle and mine has lasted what feels like an eternity, it is gently formulated and has been non-irritable to my skin and safe to use around the eyes.  Has a delicate scent and overall feels nice when first put on in its oil form and also after it’s been lathered up and doesn’t excessively dry my skin out once rinsed off. Gentle cleanser that removes MOST make-up
