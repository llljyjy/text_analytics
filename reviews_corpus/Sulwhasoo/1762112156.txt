I’m in my mid-30s with oily, acne-prone skin, and I’ve been on the hunt for a light, anti-aging moisturizer. This. Is. It. It has a very light texture (a little goes a long way) that absorbs very quickly but still feels nourishing. As other have noted, it has a light floral, herbal scent. I tolerate but don’t usually love fragrance in skincare, but I’ve come to love the smell of this (though people with sensitive skin may want to stay away). The cream itself is also light enough that I can use it both in the morning and the evening, even with my oily skin. I purchased the mini version first to test it out, and after a month of regular use (morning and evening), I shelled out for the full size. I’ve noticed that my tired, uneven, drab looking skin looks like I’m wearing makeup when I’m not. It’s more even, resilient, bouncy, and radiant. My pores look smaller and when I do have hormonal breakouts, this does seem to calm the inflammation. If you’re in your 20s with great skin, I don’t think this product would do much for you, but for me it’s worth the investment. Also btw, this product was recently reformulated and Sephora hasn’t updated the ingredient deck. The new version has no retinol -- the Sulwhasoo website has the correct ingredient list, which I matched up against the box I received. This, along with the First Care Serum, is a standout product that is actually worth the high price tag. HG product, worth the price
