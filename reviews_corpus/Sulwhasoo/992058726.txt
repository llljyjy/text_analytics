Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Serum is an encapsulated,golden-hue serum filled with tiny bubbles of powerful antioxidants. The bubbles of serum are released upon application. The directions say to ’Warm three pumps between fingers and apply to face and neck in upward motion. ’ I applied the serum after toner and as directed, and gently pat-pressed it into my skin. The serum has a lightweight, gel-like texture. I could smell a hint of ginseng, herbal but it’s nice smell, to me. The scent doesn’t linger. The serum absorbs well. It’s not sticky nor drying. The serum feels smooth and barely-there after completely drying down. My face feels so nourished and plump. It’s expensive but the smallest amount dispensed is truly all I needed to cover my face particularly immediately after toner. I tried applying the serum after letting my face completely dry and I had to use a bit more. So, I’ll stick to semi-damp skin. I enjoy using this serum and will continue to do so to reap the anti-aging, wrinkle fighting benefits. I received the serum complimentary of the brand for my honest opinion. Beautifully formulated
