Terrible. My skin did not like this product at all. I have three little white bumps after using this for two days. The first day I figured it was because I used it when I exfoliated. However, by the second day, I knew my skin just did not agree with it. It is very drying like the reviews say it is. What a waste of money and I will be returning it this weekend. Save your money awful
