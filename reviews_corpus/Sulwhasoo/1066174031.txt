I wrote a detailed review twice, but the app crashed and never posted it, so I’m writing again.  Third time’s a charm...I’ve been using the cream for about half a year and really like it. It has a smooth texture that melts into the skin once it spreads on the face. It leaves me very nourished and radiant, and I swear it makes my cheeks slightly rosy (due to ginseng’s properties). I have normal to dry skin and can use this throughout summer and winter without issues. If you’re oily, this might be too much in the summer, but I still don’t think it’s heavy in the traditional sense. It is not a lightweight fluid or gel cream, though; it is a cream through and through. I use retin-a and get chemical peels often and have not had any issues so far, and I like to pair it with the Classic Cream at night, which is a bit thicker and more potent.  One last thing, it smells like ginseng. If you don’t like herbal scents, you might not like this, but it doesn’t linger like perfume does; it’s just how ginseng smells.
