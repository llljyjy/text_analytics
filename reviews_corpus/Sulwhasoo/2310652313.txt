I noticed a difference after using this cream in terms of my face’s hydration and smoothness. It’s a good cream for night or day as it doesn’t pill under makeup and seems to deliver continuous hydration. I’m not a huge fan of the scent of ginseng but don’t find that it lingers. Overall a solid product and I like the texture. I received a deluxe sample complimentary from Sulwhasoo. Visible Difference
