I’m such a fan of Sulwhasoo skincare products. I’m a huge fan of their revitalizing overnight face mask. This renewing cream has been great for my sensitive skin. The cream has left my skin vibrant and very soft. My skin feels hydrated and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling oily. I also like the light olfactory of the cream not overpowering but just right. Gifted by Sulwhasoo, thanks again for allowing me to sample. nan
