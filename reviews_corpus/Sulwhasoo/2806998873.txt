I have heard great things about the Sulwhasoo Anti-Aging Serum so I was so excited to try it! The serum is basically odorless and I love that. I have super sensitive skin and usually heavy fragranced products donâ€™t agree with my skin. I also have dry skin so I am always looking for products that will help with hydration and I love how light weight yet hydrating this serum is. I need to give it some more time to speak to the anti-aging benefits but so far, so good! Gifted by Sulwhasoo nan
