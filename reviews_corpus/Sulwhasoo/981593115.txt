Sometimes I feel like I’ve tried every serum on the planet so when I heard about this one I figured why not. And now I am hooked! After just a little more than a week of daily use my skin is looking and feeling awesome. I’ve never had great skin texture and my skin feels so smooth now. My pores are definitely looking better. One nothing I like most about this is how well it absorbs and feels dry on my skin and not sticky. It’s quite reasonably priced In comparison to other luxury lines. At 65 I have to say this is the best serum I have used in a very long time that actually makes a big difference in then look of my skin. Excellent Serum!
