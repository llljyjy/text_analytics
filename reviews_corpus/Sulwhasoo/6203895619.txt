This is one of the most luxurious creams I have tried, ever. It feels like a soft cushiony pillow upon application and so luxe on my skin. I love it so much plus it goes perfectly with my combination skin. It is not greasy at all, absorbs so well and keeps my complexion hydrated through out the day. It has a soft pleasant scent to it. Overall my skin feels supple and I just enjoy it so much. Supple, hydrated skin
