I received a trial size complimentary from Sulwashoo in exchange for my honest review of the product. Overall I felt like the cream was amazing, but would be hard for me to justify purchasing. It feels lightweight, hydrating, and goes on smoothly without needing too much product, however the scent is a little too strong in my opinion. I would have loved to used it linger to see the effects of fine lines, but overall liked the way my skin looked while using it. nan
