I typically use the farmacy honey halo moisturizer. While This was gifted by Sulwhasoo, I could see myself switching over. I love the formula as it does leave any greasy residue feeling and I can feel it tightening up my skin as I wear it! I have naturally dry skin and not only does my face feel more hydrated and smooth, it brightened up dramatically! I would never consider myself to have full skin, but this made my face feel more alive and fresh than it has in years! I donâ€™t know if it is the ginseng or what , but my face feels alert and ready to tackle the day. 10/10 would recommend
