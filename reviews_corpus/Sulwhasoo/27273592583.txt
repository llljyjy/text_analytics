I enjoyed trying out these minis, it consists several of their best selling products. The serum and balancing water were definitely my favorites from the set. They didn’t feel heavy and I didn’t experience any irritation at all. There is some fragrance but I wasn’t too bothered by it! I highly recommend this set for those wanting to try out this brand before committing for full bottles Great for trying before buying
