I received this product complimentary from Sulwhasoo to test out and share my honest thoughts. I’ve only used this for 3 or 4 days so far, but I am enjoying it! It has a really lightweight, slippy, gel-like serum texture that feels very nice and cooling on the skin. It layered well under all my other serums and moisturizers,  which I really appreciate. I do feel like it has already brightened and smoothed my skin a little bit, so I’m definitely planning to continue using this product to see the long term benefits. The only thing I’d like to note is that it does have a pretty strong, almost alcohol scent to it. This scent does fade very quickly once it’s on my skin, but I know some people are extra sensitive to fragrances like that so I want to make sure to include that disclaimer. Enjoying this so far!
