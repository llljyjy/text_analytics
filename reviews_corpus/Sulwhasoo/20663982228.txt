I like to wait a few weeks after starting a product to write a review; that way I can give an accurate review. I added this moisturizer to my 10 step facial routine.  I really love the results. My face feels firmer, moisturized, and has a fresh dewy look.  To start, I bought the small size to see if I liked the product. It worked great! Now I just ordered the larger size. I would like to note that it does have a strong ginseng smell, but once you add your SPF, it dilutes the smell. Works Amazing!
