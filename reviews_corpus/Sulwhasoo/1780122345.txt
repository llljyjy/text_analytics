I’ve purchased 6 times. I look forward to washing my face because of Sulwhasoo Oil Cleanser. The natural scent is so refreshing and calming. I have dry, textured, sensitive skin and this helps balance and soothe. I wear at least 2-3 coats of mascara and dark liner/eyeshadow everyday and with 2 pumps of the oil, in about 20 seconds it’s all broken down. I’ll continue to recommend this to all. nan
