This set had the complete skincare routine! I love the cleanser because it was gentle yet fully cleansed my skin. The scent of the cream was very natural and I could smell the ginseng. Itâ€™s not very pleasant but o can overlook that because it was moisturizing on my skin. I would definitely consider this set as gifts. nan
