I have been trying this cream and I have really liked the results. I got the small size .5 oz/ 15ml which I would say is a perfect size for traveling but definitely not for regular use. Since I am 32 I have been looking for more products that are for anti aging. This product has been great for dryness and uneven texture. I would recommend getting the bigger size even though it’s $120. I definitely think it’s worth the price. Great product
