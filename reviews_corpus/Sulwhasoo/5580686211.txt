I initially liked this oil but after a couple of days it started really irritating my skin and it made me break out quite badly. I gave it to my friend who has dry mature skin and she loves it. If you have sensitive or acne prone skin I would recommend Farmacy clearly clean up oil balm. This one irritated my eyes and has a scent to it. nan
