One of my really good friends told me about this brand-years ago, and now I finally tried it! I actually really enjoyed the activating serum, definitely a star product for me, gives my skin a nice boost of hydration and a sense of plumpness as well, the other products in the kit are cute too, I just feel like youâ€™re not necessarily getting enough product, but the activating serum is definitely an amazing product! nan
