I’ve repurchased this serum multiple times and have backups so I’m never without it. I find it just makes everything else slightly better. I don’t think it works miracles, but I know my skin is smoother and softer whenever I use it. The real reason I keep it around is that it helps other skincare products absorb better. My skin just drinks up my toner and moisturizer after I apply this serum. I also enjoy the herbal scent and the heavy glass bottle -- it just makes the whole product experience more pleasant. One star off because it’s not a miracle-worker like Dr Dennis Gross Retinol and Ferulic overnight treatment. It’s just - consistently good at making my skin look better.I wouldn’t recommend this product for anyone with dry skin because of the alcohol in it. Alcohol isn’t the kiss of death with skincare products -- the reason so many companies put it in their products is that it makes the active ingredients absorb better into your skin! However, it does that by weakening your moisture barrier so that ingredients can penetrate better. For that reason, you shouldn’t use more than one product with alcohol in it -- the effect of multiple applications of alcohol to the skin is much worse than a single application per day. People with dry skin should avoid products containing alcohol, as they can exacerbate dryness. Those of us with normal or oily/combination skin are probably safe to use one (1) alcohol-based active skincare product per day. For me, the benefits of the First Care Activating Serum outweigh the potential negatives. I’ve repurchased like 5x and will continue to do so. Repurchased multiple times, improves skin texture
