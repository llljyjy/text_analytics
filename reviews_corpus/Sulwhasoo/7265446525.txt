Gifted by Sulwhasoo, this Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream is so refreshing on the skin. With the sample I received I don’t think there’s enough product to say it improved my wrinkles but I definitely have noticed some smoothing to my skin. The texture is creamy but still light on the skin. I found that for my dry skin I need more product to feel like my skin is hydrated. My skin absorbed this product quickly. Also leaves a pleasant glow! Refreshing
