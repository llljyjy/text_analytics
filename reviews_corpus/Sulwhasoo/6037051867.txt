I was gifted by Sulwhasoo!! Iâ€™m definitely a fan of Sulwhasoo! I love the smell this cream gives off. Very earthy and it makes me feel grounded after a late-night shower. My skin is VERY very dry and sensitive. But this cream helps my skin so much!! I notice just overnight how soft and hydrated my skin was! I use to wear a sleep face mask every night but this changes the routine now!! Changes My Skin Overnight!!
