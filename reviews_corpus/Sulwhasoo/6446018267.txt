Excellent for my maturing skin - it’s super moisturizing but no greasy feeling and it doesn’t break me out, which I appreciate.  I feel moisturized throughout the day with this product and don’t feel like I have to put on more in the afternoon.  I also like that I have to use very little to get the results I’m looking for, especially considering the price.  The mini size has lasted much longer than I expected.  The scent is a little earthy but goes away pretty quickly.  Quite excellent! nan
