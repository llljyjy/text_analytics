Absolutely freaking obsessed with this stuff!! It smells soooo good, a little bit like eukalyptus, if that’s your thing:) It’s got this beautiful “slip“ to it when you wash your face and super gentle for my colorado dry skin. I normally have oily skin but when I use this and hydrate the crap (like, drown my skin) out of it, I am SO much less oily. I do always double cleanse if I’ve had makeup on, otherwise just this. Skin crack (insert drooly face)
