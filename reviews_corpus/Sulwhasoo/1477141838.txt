I received this complimentary from Sulwhasoo. In exchange, I would give a review....wellll... You know when you go to a really fancy spa and they use products on you that you know cost a lot just based on the smell? Well, this is that. lol. This made my skin not only look hydrated but feel amazing. A little bit goes a LONG way! Spa
