This moisturizer resolved a mystery skin condition I had been suffering from for nearly a year, and the timing was perfect as I received a sample of this stuff the WEEK before I was attending the most important event of my life: wedding.I had dark crusting skin spread over the sides of my face and my whole forehead, I figured since the steroid cream I was given didn’t work, when this arrived, I just put it on overnight, and woke up to all the affected skin on my face PEELING OFF like a snake.I was so perplexed that I immediately looked up to buy thi stuff to use, saw the price, silently closed the page, and thought it would be that.I managed to find a source to purchase this stuff directly from Korea for a fraction of the price, so I am pleased to say, if you want this, get it from Korea! Knocking the star off for Sephora pricing this so high when it could be so much less (definitely still expensive, but not insane like this)[I’m sure the story will sound fake, but I did end up seeing a dermatologist immediately after the big even, got biopsied, diagnosed and put on antibiotics to clear up the rest of the affected skin that I didn’t get to apply this cream onto. This cream just saved me from having to deal with hundreds of relatives seeing and getting scared of what happened to me.] Miracle, solved a mystery skin issue
