This moisturizer is outrageously expensive, and there’s pretty much no non-prescription cream that can drastically change your skin. Knowing that, this is something to possibly splurge on if you have the money, but nothing to go broke over. Like other people stated in other reviews, it does have a strong scent that I describe as “horse’s hoof” that very quickly dissipates, pretty much as soon as it hits your face. I also think it smells a little bit like ashwagandha tincture, if you’ve ever smelled that. I appreciate that the smell seems “natural,” as in, what the ingredients likely smell like without any cover-ups. As for performance, it has a great texture that sinks in well and doesn’t feel heavy on my face, but as fall approaches, I don’t necessarily feel it gives hydration more than any other “normal” priced moisturizer.
