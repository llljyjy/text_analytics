The smell is so strong that I had to wash it off. It’s not one of those scents that you can smell as you’re applying but fades away once it’s on your skin—it lingers. I’m glad this set gave me a chance to try smaller sizes before committing to a full size. If fragrance doesn’t bother you, you might like these. nan
