I absolutely love this kit! I think it’s a great way to try out this brand. The gentle cleansing foam worked great with my dry combo skin. It didn’t strip my skin dry and my skin felt well cleansed after. The activating serum is definitely one of my fave serums I’ve tried, leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth without any stickiness. The balancing water was gentle and hydrating. The ginseng cream was really moisturizing and I think I would prefer to use it as a PM cream more. Great kit to try!
