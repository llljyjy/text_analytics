Love the ingredients and how soft, hydrated and radiant it leaves my skin. It absorbs quickly, doesn’t leave a greasy sensation, and has worked great on my sensitive combination skin. It has a light  yet  refreshing herbal scent. Def a great cream!I’ve been kindly gifted by Sulwhasoo with this sample in exchange for my honest review. Love how radiant it leaves my skin!
