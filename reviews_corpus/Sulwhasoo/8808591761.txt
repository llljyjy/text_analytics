This is my first time trying out this brand and first things I like the glass packaging makes it feel so  luxurious. I used serum two times and I like how it absorbs instantly and leaves my skin feeling. The wrinkle cream I apply around my eyes as thatâ€™s my main wrinkle concern area and hope to see some results there. The water cream/toner is so light and absorbs easy. They all have strong fragrance that smells like oils. nan
