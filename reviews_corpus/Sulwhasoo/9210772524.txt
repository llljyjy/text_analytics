I was very excited to try this product! When first opening the cream, you are greeted with the aroma of ginseng. It smells very herbal and I got used to it quickly. The texture of the cream is very lightweight. Once on my face, the cream felt very hydrating and soft. Afterwards my face feels amazing with firm and hydrated skin. I have very dry skin, and Iâ€™m excited to keep using this product to help moisturize. This product was gifted to me. Great Moisturizer
