Hydrating toners have been the best discovery of my twenties. After cleansing, using a hydrating toner that you can pat directly into your skin and leave to get it moisturized and perfectly primed for serums to work better leads to the most glowing skin.Some require two or three layers. Some can be sticky or you feel it on your skin too much. With one layer this just makes you feel like you have the perfectly balanced and hydrated soft skin of a baby.It makes your skin SO soft and balanced. I currently have 4 hydrating toners in my bathroom, but this one is the best. Balanced, soft, hydrated skin with one layer!
