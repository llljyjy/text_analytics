This product truly works to bring out a healthy glow to the skin, I use it right after cleansing in combination with rosehip seed oil and it helps the skin draw in the oil leaving you moisturized but not shiny. I was pleasantly surprised that this company is part of Amorepacific, whose products I love because of how effective they are especially their enzyme peel and single vintage extract. In fact this product smells and feels like their single vintage extract but at a lower price pointâ€¦ I look for products that actually work and other than Sunday Riley and Amorepacific a lot of the skincare products at Sephora seem too be more about the packaging than the actual effects. nan
