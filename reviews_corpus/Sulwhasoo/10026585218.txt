Love the soft woody, oriental scents, and the products are amazing! I’ve only been using for a few days, and I have seen and felt an improvement on my skin’s texture. This set helped calmed down my skin from testing a product that didn’t hydrate my skin enough. The cleanser though is not enough to remove mascara, so make sure to double cleanse. The hype is real!
