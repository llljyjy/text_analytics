The thickness of this cream is nice, and I like that you don’t need a lot to feel covered and hydrated. I think it’s a good cream but I’m knocking a few stars off for the smell and price. The smell is borderline cold cream/grandma scent to me and I think $120 is way too much for this product. I think you could get another cream similar to this for less than the price. However it is a decent cream. Good cream, but overpriced.
