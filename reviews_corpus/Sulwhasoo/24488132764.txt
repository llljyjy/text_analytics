It’s been 2-3 days since I’ve used the whole set. Since I have a combo skin type, I tend to get very dry during colder season and sometimes even oily during the day. I use the whole set instructed in the pamphlet that came with the packaging, since I feel like it might be heavy for me during the day, I only use the serum and cleanser, while all it at night. Recently having a bad breakout as well but not from this product so hopefully this set can eliminate and decrease my acne High-end skincare
