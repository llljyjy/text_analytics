Sulwhasoo is a luxury beauty brand so before investing, this kit is fantastic to try out their best selling products first.  The first care serum usually runs $89 for 2 oz, this kit includes a 1 oz serum so I feel this kit is a great value. These little minis are adorable and very high-quality. The serum is my fave, but my skin responds really well to this little routine. My skin feels silky and velvety, and it brings my dull skin to life with a nice, subtle sheen. I love Sulwhasoo!
