Unfortunately this product made me breakout. I used the product before bed and woke up with like 5-7 white heads on my chin. I am very sensitive to fragrance and it is very strong in this product. The product does feel very nice and nourishing on the skin, so if you don’t have sensitive or acne prone skin it might work better for you. I also didn’t find it to have a whipped texture - more like a rich cream. Not for sensitive/acne prone skin
