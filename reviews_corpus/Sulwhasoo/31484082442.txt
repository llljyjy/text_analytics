I received this product complimentary from Sulwhasoo in exchange for my honest review. The cream is very pleasant to apply, it is easily distributed over the skin, absorbed quickly enough, does not leave a film feeling (the skin is very soft, velvety to the touch). After 2 weeks of use, the pores have decreased, the skin is moisturized, the complexion is even.Perfect for my very dry skin good cream
