Sulwhasoo is one of my favorite skincare brands, so I’m always excited to try out different products from their line! The Essential Comfort Firming Cream is a whipped cream that helps make your skin look and feel supple and bouncy. It’s made with a potent blend of antioxidant-rich goji berries and intensely hydrates your complexion to help smooth out your skin’s tone and texture. The product feels incredibly hydrating, and my skin is smooth to the touch upon application. While this is suitable for all skin types, I think this would be especially great for anyone with dry or aging skin. nan
