This luxe anti-aging cream uses ginseng and retinol which helps with aging. The consistency of the product is not too heavy and not too lightweight. Itâ€™s right in the middle, which is just the way I like my face cream products. I applied the product at night after I washed my face. In the morning my skin felt hydrated and smooth. The price point definitely reflects luxury and I would suggest trying a sample size before committing to the full-size product. My skin feels hydrated and smooth
