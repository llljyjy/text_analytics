This product is scentless and a standard cream I would use for my nightly routine. It’s a rich creamy texture that does not leave any residue after applying. It absorbs well and doesn’t feel oily on skin. I’d say it’s too rich for the am routine but I can see it being used in the winter time. I have to wait and see if it has firming effects. Nice texture for a pm routine
