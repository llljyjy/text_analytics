I was excited to try a Sulwhasoo product for a while now, I’ve been interested in a luxury face lotion/cream and this one sounded like something I would love. I have dry skin and I’ve been trying this out as a part of my nighttime routine. It’s a soft and fluffy like texture and it leaves my skin hydrated and smooth. So far, I really like this! nan
