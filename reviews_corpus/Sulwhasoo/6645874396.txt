Got a mini sample and was very excited to try this. I have oily skin and have been using this day and night for two weeks now and I really am bummed about this. The pro is that it makes my skin look dewy (in a non gross oily way) and I’ve gotten a few compliments on that but most importantly I love how it helped my tiny forehead crease that was bothering me, I can’t even see it now which is like magic to me. But the con..oh the con :( it’s made me break out. Not in a drastic way, but I’m not used to having more than one pimple pop out every other three months. I suddenly have four or five spanned out across my whole face and its just frustrating. I know it’s this product that made me break out since nothing else changed from my simple routine: micellar water, cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen. This was the first serum I added to my routine in years and feel very conflicted. I’ll probably just use this on small sections of my face that need tightening but feeling discouraged. woe is me
