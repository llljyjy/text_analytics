I received this cleansing foam from Influenster and so happy that I did. This was one of four products that I received and I used this to take off my makeup and it did a really good job. I liked the foam aspect of this as it was very gentle on my skin and didn’t irritate me at all which other products have done in the past. I liked the foam texture and it had a nice minimal scent that wasn’t overpowering at all. The bottle itself is pretty to look at. A must try cleansing foam!
