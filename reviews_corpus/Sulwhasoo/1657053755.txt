This product is definitely a luxury item and it feels like one too. It’s a rich cream that provides great hydration and plumps my skin. It lays well under makeup. I can definitely tell that it does firm and helps with my lines. The product is pricey, but it takes very little for each use. I appreciate that it doesn’t have a fragrance and it’s amazing on my dry, sensitive skin. Rich and plumping!
