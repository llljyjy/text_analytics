I’ve heard so many good things about this cream I was so excited to try it but the amount of product was so little that I couldn’t afford a second application Personally I like to try the products for at least a week so I can write an honest review no I could feel no change since I only tried it once but I can say that the texture is great and that it absorbs very well into the skin! Great texture
