I received this product complimentary from Sulwhasoo in exchange for my honest review, and I can say without hesitation that I LOVED this luxurious cream. The texture is marvelous: itâ€™s somehow thick without feeling heavy. It melts beautifully into the skin and leaves it feeling plump and hydrated. It also gives my skin a healthy glow. The scent is light but lovely; I definitely pick up the ginseng but it is soft dissipates quickly. I am noticing smoother and firmer skin already, and am thrilled to have this as a new part of my skincare routine. Luxurious and Lovely
