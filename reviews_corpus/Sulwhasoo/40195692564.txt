This moisturizer has been a game changer in my routine! I have dry sensitive skin and recently it has been very irritated and cracking which can get pretty painful. After just one use of this product my skin felt so much more hydrated and smooth! Not only did that feeling last throughout the rest of the day, but my face felt smooth so my texture had improved quite a bit. The cream itself is also very lightweight and not greasy at all so I believe it can also suit oily skin! Overall this product is a 10/10 for me and I will definitely be purchasing it as my new daytime moisturizer!This product was complimentary from Sulwhasoo in exchange for my honest review! So Hydrating!
