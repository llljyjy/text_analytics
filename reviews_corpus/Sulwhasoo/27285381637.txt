I love this serum. It’s very fluid and spreads nicely across the skin. It absorbs quickly and smells great. There is a bit of a sticky feeling right after application but I always follows up with a moisturizer so it doesn’t bother me. This makes my complexion look amazing and blurs my pores so beautifully. I absolutely recommend this serum if you can justify the price tag. nan
