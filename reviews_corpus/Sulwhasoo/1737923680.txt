First few days using Sulwasoo cream and noticed how soft my face feels in the morning! The scent might bother other people as it has a “gingery” smell. Although it is not as strong as other products. It absorbs easily on my skin. Overall love this product! Super moisturizing and my skin feels amazing! Pretty Amazing!
