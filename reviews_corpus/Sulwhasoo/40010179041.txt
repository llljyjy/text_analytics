I received the Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Serum complimentary from Sulwhasoo. This is a lightweight serum. It absorbs to my skin almost instantly. It has a strong scent which disappears very fast. I apply 3-4 pumps to my face and neck at morning and night. I am happy with results I got after just several days of use. My skin feels silky. I always used good skin care products, but my skin never was so soft and smooth. The texture of my skin improved. It became firmer, brighter, and fine lines got less visible. The skin is very hydrated. I like this product very much! Good product
