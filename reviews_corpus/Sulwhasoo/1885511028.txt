I love how my skin feels with these products!  The gentle cleansing foam removes my foundation, concealer, bronzer and blush with ease and my skin does not feel dry!  I also love the balancing water to tone after cleansing. My favorite product Iâ€™ve tried is the First Care Activating Serum.  This keeps my skin hydrated and feeling so fresh. I love it!  The Concentrated Ginseng cream is a mid-weight moisturizer and has a very faint clean smell that may be ginseng?  I do recommend this set and the products. Really impressed with how my skin feels! Such a great travel set
