Okay so I really wanted to love this cleanser but I unfortunately rather hate it. At first I didn’t understand what was happening to my skin but I eventually realized it was this cleanser that was making me break out. I have been acne free for a few years now, so to find my skin breaking out like crazy along my jawline was  freaky. I waited good three weeks to see if there would be any improvements but nothing got better, in fact it got worse. I don’t recommend this cleanser at all. It’s such a bummer cause this was pretty expensive! Made me break out
