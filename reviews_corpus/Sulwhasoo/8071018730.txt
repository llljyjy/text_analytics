I have been waiting for a chance to try Sulwhasoo’s renewing cream for a while now, so of course, when I got the opportunity to try it as a gift, I jumped on it! First off, a little goes A LONG way here. Which is almost required given the price tag associated with the cream. It’s very lightweight and if you’re prone to greasy or even sensitive skin, you’re safe here. Since we’re still in the Fall season, not sure how this will be added to my winter skin routine. It has a nice clean spa-like scent to it, but the fragrance doesn’t irritate one’s skin. I have sensitive skin, so this is something I pay close attention to. This product is very nice, leaves your skin looking healthy, and gives you a “dolphin-skin“ (think dewy skin) look with only one product! The only downside I have to this is the price - it’s a lot. If you aren’t fully committed I recommend going for the trial size instead. This is complimentary from Sulwhasoo, so I was lucky to have this given to me, but I can see why people buy this item. Is the price worth it?!
