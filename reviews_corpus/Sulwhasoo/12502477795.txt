I purchased this mini cleanser after trying it in the Sulwhasoo Bestsellers Kit and falling in love with it. It is gentle enough for my extra dry winter skin, yet perfectly effective. My skin isnâ€™t left feeling dry or stripped, and I personally love the soft, herbal scent. Love this soft, gentle cleanser!
