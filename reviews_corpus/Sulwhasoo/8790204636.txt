This moisturizer definitely firms the skin when applied. I could feel it instantly. It also hydrated the skin very very well. I will say it has a mint, earthy, herbal scent to it which I usually like but I did not enjoy it in this product. It is a great moisturizer and does have firming benefits but the scent is not my favorite. I haven’t used long enough to see any type of long term results but I would recommend this as long as the smell doesn’t bother you! Great moisturizer, I do not like the scent
