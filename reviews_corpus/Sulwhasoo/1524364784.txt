I was gifted by Sulwhasoo this concentrate ginseng renewing cream to try out and I am loving the product so far! The smell is nice, not too overpowering which I like. I love the texture of the cream itself, very smooth and creamy. It is extremely moisturizing. After I applied it all over my face, I can feel how hydrating and smooth my skin feels. I’ve been using this product for 3 days now and I can feel the difference in my skin! It feels tighter & defiantly hydrating. I have dry skin so I am always looking for something that can hydrate my skin and this product so far is great! I’m excited to see how my face is after a week of use! Loving it
