I love this to remove my makeup. I’ve tried balms before but they irritate my eyes when I try to remove mascara or eyeshadow. This does not burn or bother my eyes and manages to remove all my mascara (I use waterproof). It did leak a little bit when I ordered it online which I saw was an issue for some however mine was not as significant. Would def recommend if you’re looking for a gentle but effective product! nan
