I was gifted by Sulwhasoo a sample size of this product for review. This renewing cream is very light and has a strong ginseng root scent. I followed the direction by taking a pea size of cream, rubbing it between my fingers to warm up, applying the cream by patting it on my face. I enjoyed using this, but I donâ€™t think a pea sized amount is enough for my face.  This cream made my skin feel soft and hydrated. I think I would need to use it more to notice any firmness or smoothness. Need more than a Pea-Sized amount
