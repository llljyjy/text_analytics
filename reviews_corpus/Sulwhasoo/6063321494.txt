Wow I am impressed, this set is definitely amazing to take with you on a trip, but also would make a such an awesome gift for a great price point or an introduction to the brand if you want to try something new. I used it only couple times and i am already in love with every single product.It does have a very distinct herbal smell, but i donâ€™t mind it at all, I am totally getting the regular size of the First care, Gentle cleansing foam and renewing cream. Love it
