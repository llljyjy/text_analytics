I received this product complimentary from Sulwhasoo in exchange for my honest review. I like that it contains some antioxidant-rich ingredients such as goji berries, black beans, and arrowroot. It has a rich creamy texture, but absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling sticky. It makes my skin soft and hydrated. Also, it’s gentle on my skin, and I haven’t experienced any irritation so far. However, it is overpriced, and contains a fragrance which I don’t like. Also, I haven’t noticed much of a difference when it comes to anti-aging. I probably won’t purchase this product. nan
