I LOVE this product. I’m 31 and have eczema and while I don’t get flare ups on my face it does leave me dry. I use this every other night and my skin just glows in the morning, it’s wonderful. I even added retinol to my routine again recently and in the past even the gentle starter routine has left my face flaking but with this it’s stayed soft and moisturized. It’s also a huge amount of product for the cost, especially considering it’s higher end.The smell is definitely strong but I think it’s pretty pleasant, it reminds me of pine and doesn’t last long at all. My new holy grail overnight moisturizer
