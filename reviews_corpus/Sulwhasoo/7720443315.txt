This product is actually so creamy and I love the way it absorbs into my skin. It targets a lot of issues I have with my skin like loss of elasticity and lack of hydration. Of course ginseng has a stronger smell so just beware of that but ginseng has been known in eastern medicine to have a lot of health benefits so I definitely love that itâ€™s in my skincare. I received this product complimentary from Sulwhasoo. nan
