First of all, I love Sulwhasoo because with their products, a little goes a long way. This cream is potent in the best way – I’ve been using a sample size and my skin feels so soft and hydrated with just a dime sized amount. The subtle ginseng scent is so calming and I love applying this before bed after washing my face. *This product was gifted by Sulwhasoo* nan
