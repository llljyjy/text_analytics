I have used the activating serum from Shulwhasso (and LOVED it) so I expected greatness for this comfort firming cream. And? Great it was!! I love the light & fresh scent, the hydration (I have dry skin) and how glowy (in a healthy way) that my skin looks after using. I have a hard time paying a lot for skincare so this is steep for me but this brand would be worth it! High end skincare that's worth the price!
