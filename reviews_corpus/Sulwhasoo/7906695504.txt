I love this mask! I usually struggle with peel-off masks. I can never get them to peel off well and usually end up scrubbing my skin with water. However, this mask just works for me. It comes off so easily, and leaves my skin looking soft and plump. I usually follow it up with the Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng line, but anything promoting hydration would work well!
