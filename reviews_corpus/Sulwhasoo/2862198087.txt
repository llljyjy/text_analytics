This product does not require makeup pads to remove your makeup and mascara, pore a dab in your hand and rub to remove makeup, it comes off in second without any intense rubbing.  This is exactly what I love, it’s the best product I’ve used to cleanse my face. Plus I don’t need pads anymore and it’s soft on my skin and prevent wrinkles around eyes.  It’s totally worth it!!! And cleanses your pores and hydrates.  I love this product.  Use it properly people use it properly and you will love it!
