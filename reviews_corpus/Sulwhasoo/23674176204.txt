I’m 48 years old and always looking to try the newest anti-aging products on the market. So I was very excited to get to try this Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream Deluxe Sample 5mL complimentary from Sulwhasoo for review.The texture of the cream is silky smooth and it goes on the skin easily. I love that it doesn’t leave a heavy or greasy feel. To me it smells a little like ginger and I’m not a huge fan of the scent. But I am happy with the way it makes my skin feel plumper after only a few uses. Silky and non-greasy
