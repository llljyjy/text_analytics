I got a small sample of this and thought it was a decent product. It has a earthy scent and a little bit goes a long way. I do like how lightweight and easily absorbed the cream was. My skin felt really smooth, but Iâ€™m not sure the cost of this one is worth buying the full size. It did a good job helping my skin, but there are much more reasonably priced products out there that do the same.  Gifted by Sulwhasoo. Expensive but nice
