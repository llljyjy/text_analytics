I received the tiniest sample to try out. It feels nice on the skin, very hydrating, but given the small amount in the sample bottle, it’s hard to say I noticed any real difference in my skin after using only a few times. Because the price is so expensive for the full size, it’s unfortunately not something I will be purchasing to continue to use. The description of what this product does sounds promising but I can’t tell whether it did anything for my skin. Gifted by sulwhasoo. Didn't wow me
