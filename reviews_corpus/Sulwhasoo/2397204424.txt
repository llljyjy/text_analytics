Ginseng goodness! Complimentary from Sulwhashoo.  The cream was silky smooth, does not have a sticky finish. It made my skin glowy in the morning and it help maintain my skinâ€™s moisture. My skin do look plump once i applied the cream. This is a great night cream for my dry skin. I have used their essential comfort line before, it was great. The ginseng line is more targeted towards anti-aging and wrinkles. Ginseng Goodness
