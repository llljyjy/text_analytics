only giving it 4/5 because i’ve only used it once- but i feel very positive about my long term use with this oil cleanser! i was able to remove waterproof mascara. granted, i brushed my eyelashes with my fingertips for around 10 seconds but it worked great! my skin felt very nice and soft afterward. i have very dry skin so it didn’t last too long. $40 is a high price but i am happy i bought it. we’ll see if this will be a rebuy after some more uses. good product if you’re down to spend the money!
