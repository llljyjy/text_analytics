I always love mini kits so I can try a brand without committing to a full size, especially because Sulwahsoo is pricey! The cleanser and water are both nice, but don’t feel *special* to me. To contrast I’m in love with the serum and cream together. It’s a magical combo. They both have a light herbal scent that’s pleasing. The serum does not pill with the moisturizer. The serum dries down and the cream leaves my skin soft and dewy. I am dreaming of the full size of both! Complimentary from Sulwahsoo the serum and cream are the stars!
