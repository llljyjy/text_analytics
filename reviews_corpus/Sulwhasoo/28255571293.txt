I was pretty disappointed with this set, it has great reviews. The ginsing cream was nice, but overall the routine left my skin looking and feeling terrible. I have very sensitive oily/combo skin. I have since found a better routine, unfortunately not sold through Sephora. If your skin is like mine I would say try a gel moisturizer/oil free routine. Not good for Sensitive and Oily skin
