This cream has a very nice texture and scent to it. It is a firming cream but after using it, I did not notice much of the firming effect but it is very moisturizing. I will give it the benefit of the doubt and say maybe I need to use it for longer and use it 2x a day. Other than that it is a very nice hydrating and moisturizing cream. nan
