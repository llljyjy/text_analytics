This was my first time trying anything from this brand. I love the convenient travel size. I used the cleanser and it was very gentle & didnt strip my skin, then I went in with the serum and this added extra hydration & elasticity. Using the balancing water helped to provide and keep moisture. I have dry sensitive skin and this helped tremendously.The last step I applied the moisturizer. This is such a luxurious cream and I enjoy the light oriental scent. Made my skin feel smooth and plump. I will definitely be using this in my p.m routine. Gives my skin that extra glow
