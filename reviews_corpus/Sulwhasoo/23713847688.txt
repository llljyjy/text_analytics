I received the Sulwhasoo gentle cleansing foam complimentary from Influenster. The product came in a plastic pump. The smell is a wonderful clean ginseng scent. I was skeptical about whether or not I would like this since it’s a foaming cleanser and I have dry skin. I can say that not only does this cleanser leave my skin feeling clean, but also so soft! I love this cleanser and will probably be purchasing it once I run out. I don’t even use a whole pump to cleanse my face. I really really enjoyed this! Love it!
