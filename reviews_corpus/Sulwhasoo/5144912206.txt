I got a sample size complimentary from Sulwhasoo.   Iâ€™m going to have to buy a full size because I love it! This stuff is so moisturizing and a little goes a long way. I have oily and acne prone skin and this stuff is perfect! Has a scent but it goes away after a few minutes. It is lightweight so can be used day or night. Did not leave me feeling greasy. very moisturizing
