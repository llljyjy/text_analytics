This cream feels super smooth and hydrating. I love how rich it feels and the consistency. The scent is super subtle and lovely. That being said, I was only sent a super tiny sample so I canâ€™t speak on whether or not this cream has any effect when used for a few weeks or months. The price tag seems too high. nan
