There is a reason why this cream is so popular! And I am so happy I was gifted this by Sulwhasoo. There are no words to describe how wonderful it is! Due to my sensitive skin, my skin did not flake or peel, which is a first for me. Since I had failed to find a retinol product that worked for my skin, I decided to give the cream a try since it was so heavily promoted in skincare forums and by influential bloggers. My skin felt really smooth and hydrated and I always need some really good hydration for my crazy sensitive skin. gifted by Sulwhasooâ€œ LOVE IT
