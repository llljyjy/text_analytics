The Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream has a very good consistency. It’s not too liquid and not too creamy creamy. You only need a small amount to apply to your face. I have very dry lips and I’ve been applying an extra layer on my lips to get them hydrated and within 3 days my lips are no longer chopped. My face definitely feels smoother and hydrated. It’s a cream that I was gifted by Sulwhasoo to try on and I am going to purchase it in the future. It smells like a plant but I like it lol good consistency
