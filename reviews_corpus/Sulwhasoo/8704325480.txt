Honestly love this kit so much! The serum is for sure my favorite tho. The aroma is lovely & very much therapeutic. The cleanser is very gentle and removes makeup well (also smells nice). The tonic is very moisturizing & really seals everything…the moisturizer feels nice but I really hate how it smells. If you ever caught lady bugs as a kid you’d know that it smells just like them… AHmazing!
