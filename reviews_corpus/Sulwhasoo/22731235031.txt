I have been looking for something that will help hydrate my skin that has become super dehydrated in the Los Angeles dry weather. I wanted to try this because I keep hearing about it, and I really love the way this makes my skin feel! I’m constantly on camera and I feel like this product wasn’t too dewy for the camera, and it also helped hydrate my skin. I can definitely tell the texture of my face is more even as well, which is a bonus I didn’t realize I was getting. I cannot speak on any firmness because I don’t struggle with that yet, but I can say that this product does hydrate my skin and make it look more even. It delivered the results it communicated, which is something I appreciate and believe in! Hydrates & Helps Me Be Camera Ready
