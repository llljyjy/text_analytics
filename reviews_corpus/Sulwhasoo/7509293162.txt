I’ve been wanting to try this serum-essence for a really long time because I’ve heard such great things about it and I’m so happy I was able to test it. This product has a really nice subtle skincare scent and a thin texture that instantly absorbs into the skin. It does make my skin feel more hydrated and helps the rest of my routine work better.This sample was gifted by Sulwhasoo. nan
