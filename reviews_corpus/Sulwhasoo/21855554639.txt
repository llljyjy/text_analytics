This is gifted by Sulwhasoo. I use this at night after I cleanse and dry my face. I apply this lightly all over my face and, make a note, a little goes a long way. The cream is on the oily and thicker side, however, it absorbs so nicely! This does have a strong scent of earthiness and outside. I have noticed such a difference within a week of using it! With the retinol in the product, my fine lines have significantly improved and not as noticeable. nan
