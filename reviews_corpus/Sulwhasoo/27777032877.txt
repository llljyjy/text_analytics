It’s hard to resist Sulwhasoo. My skin was dry and lack of radiance and that’s why I wanted to try a thick formula to make sure it will deeply hydrate my complexion. This cream did what I expected and now my skin looks more supple and smoother after few uses. It restored my skin bounce. Great to restore dull skin
