i got this for a trip because my usual face wash doesnâ€™t come in a mini size and it is just so perfect. i was really worried about trying a new product because i have pretty dry skin, but this made my face feel super smooth. my skin is already pretty clear but i feel like this is helping to perfect it. and it kinda smells like pine which was a very pleasant surprise. this is my new favorite product i actually love it so much nan
