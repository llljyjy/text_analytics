The ingredients and the amount is honestly a good price. The smell is very herbal, and feels very calming. I don’t know if I’ve ever had faster results with any night cream than this one. My skin agrees with it very well, and I feel very confident in my bare skin! Very great product and definitely will re-purchase once I run out! Here’s a non-edited photo
