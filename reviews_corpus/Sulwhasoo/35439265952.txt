The ’La Mer’ of Korean skincare and something I’ve been itching to get my hands on for a while! It’s lightly hydrating, unlike the ’Classic’ version which is richer and more suited to drier skin types. It sinks right in and doesn’t leave me with an oily film on my face - which is what usually happens with most moisturizers that I try. It probably helps that I don’t use a huge amount of the product. Before I apply the cream, I use a few drops of the ’First care Activating Serum’, allow it a few seconds to absorb and immediately follow with the Concentrated Ginseng Cream. From all the Korean skincare products I’ve been treating myself to recently, this one is definitely one of my favorites, though I do prefer the ’Classic’ version over this one as I found it to be more hydrating, whilst going easier on the perfume and silicones (Dimethicone is much lower in the ingredients list!). During the time that I’ve been using this brands’ products, my skin feels more hydrated, more radiant and luminous. Go with this version if your skin veers more towards combination. ’Classic’ if your skin needs more hydration, or is sensitive to silicones. ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
