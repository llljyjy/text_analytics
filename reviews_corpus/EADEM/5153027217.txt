I just started using Eadem Milk Marvel only two weeks ago and have already seen tremendous results. I am so pleased!The first image is my skin a few months ago, note the dark spot. The second image is my skin today. I’ve had Fraxel before and somehow this serum product is even better than a laser! The Milk has lightened the spot so much - it used to be deeper but now it is level with the rest of my skin. I’m so glad I invested in a quality spot remover this time. This product is well worth it. Can’t wait to see how my progress continues. Thank you Eadem! Miracle product! I love it
