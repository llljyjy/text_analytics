This cleansing balm is a true dream. I love how it comes in a tube and is virtually mess-free. My face was very moisturized after using and not a stripping feeling at all. Iâ€™m adding this now to my nighttime routine as a first cleanse to remove my makeup, as it breaks down mascara very well. A true dream cleansing balm
