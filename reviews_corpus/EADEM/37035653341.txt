Great serum. I have very sensitive skin and I usually break out in small red bumps for a week. If the rash doesn’t go away I can’t use the product. This Milk Marvel is the first product that hasn’t broken me out once. It leaves my skin so soft and I’ve noticed the dark spots fading little by little. I was so excited after the first week that I went back and ordered 4 more bottles to make sure I don’t run out. Highly recommend to everyone and especially for people with sensitive skin. Great Serum
