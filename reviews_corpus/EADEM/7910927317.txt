I have super oily skin, so it was a bit of a gamble buying this because it doesn’t take much for a moisturizer to feel thick and heavy. But this was totally worth it. It’s almost like carving out butter with the fufu spoon that then melts in my hands and spreads so thin and beautifully across my face without clogging my pores. I love the texture of this stuff. But it’s almost like make up in that you can layer it on itself as much as you want to get the right amount.  There is no pilling and it plays well with my other products. So far, I’ve only used it at night because I have a moisturizer with SPF for the day so I can’t speak to how well it layers under anything else. I would definitely repurchase. Worth It
