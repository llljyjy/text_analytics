I agree that the packaging while beautiful, is hard to use with the dropper and get all of the product. BUT it definitely works. I already use prescribed skin care products, but nothing was working for my hyperpigmentation. After using this for about 6 weeks or so, I definitely noticed a difference! I use it morning/night after cleansing but before putting anything else on. nan
