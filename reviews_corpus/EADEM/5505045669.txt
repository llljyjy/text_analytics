Many of you are probably new to this brand, as was I. But holy cow this moisturizer is amazing!!! First of all, the packaging is glass and heavy and so luxe feeling and comes with the pretty gold spatula so that it is hygienic. It will look so pretty on a vanity too. Secondly, this definitely feels just like the name says-like a cloud. Upon application, my skin feels instantly soothed, hydrated and smoother. It looks brighter too. I can’t wait to see the long-term effects! *gifted by Eadem, but this is really how I feel and I’m definitely going to repurchase! Sooooo good!!!
