This didn’t work for my sensitive skin. My skin feels like it has a wax coating the morning after use. I had to start mixing this cream with heavy oils just to feel somewhat moisturized. Definitely do not “blind buy” if you have dry/dehydrated/sensitive skin. I was more happy to finish the bottle than I was happy to use the product. nan
