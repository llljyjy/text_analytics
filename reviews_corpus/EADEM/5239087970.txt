Whatâ€™s not to love about this brightening moisture cream? Light in texture, gorgeous packaging, and smooth, blemish free skin left after using for the past few weeks. Usually I have dark spots from acne and this has helped to replenish my complexion which is wonderful. The cream is unscented which is perfect for those with sensitive skin. nan
