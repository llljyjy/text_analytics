I’ve been using this every other day for about 3-4 months and as soon as I ran out, my skin was in desperate need of it. I use a vit C serum from skin ceuticals on the days I don’t use this and it’s been working amazingly. My only complaint is when it’s close to empty, you really have to do the most to get leftover product out. nan
