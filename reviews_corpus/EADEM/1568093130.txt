I like wearing makeup but what can keep you from enjoying it is the process of taking it off. This product breaks up so much of the makeup off. You apply it onto your face and once you add water it turns into a cleanser. The consistency is a gel and although a bit tacky, itâ€™s necessary so it can really attach itself to the makeup. I enjoyed it and it will be added to my skincare routine! 100% recommend! Makeup Melter
