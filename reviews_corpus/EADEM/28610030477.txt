So I have alot of post acne marks from hormonal acne  and heard good things about this serum and wanted to try it. My skin is combo to dry and very red after my flareups so I’m cautious about trying new things. I used this for a week at night only  and my skin got super super dry, even when I added in a thicker moisturizer. It gave it almost a rough texture, not like a normal dry feeling. The bugger issue though is that the dropper is HORRIBLE. I tried to tough it out to see if I might push through the dry phase and see results because the texture is really nice but I just can’t stand it. With a $70 product I expect to be able to get it out without issues. I read reviews that said similar but didn’t think it could be that bad, but it is, and there is a plastic piece in the top that looks like it would make a huge mess if you tried to pour it into your hand (which would probably waste a ton as well). If it was a cheaper serum I would suck it up but I returned it and will be looking for something else. nan
