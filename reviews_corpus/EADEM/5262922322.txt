The texture on this is insane. It starts as a jelly, turns into an oil, and then turns super milky. This removes makeup and SPF really, really well, honestly better than most cleansing balms I’ve tried. If this didn’t have such a strong scent, I’d consider this a holy grail product. The scent bothers my head when I have a migraine—pretty often—though. It’s not artificial, it’s a really earthy, almost herbal scent. Just strong. This is a great cleansing balm though! The ingredients are nice, the formula is super impressive, and it doesn’t irritate my skin or eyes. If they come out with an in scented version, I’ll buy it forever. Wish it was unscented
