It completely removed my liquid lipstick and mascara and left my skin calm and hydrated but still really clean. I didnâ€™t even feel like I needed a second cleanse. Instead of rubbing for 60 seconds and then splashing and rinsing, I rubbed for 60 seconds and then wet my hands and rubbed a little more which I think made it work better than it would have otherwise. I also really liked the botanical scent and the slippery texture. It This product was gifted. Very hydrating!
