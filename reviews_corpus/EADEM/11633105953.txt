This is my new go-to for cleansing needs. My typical night routine for skincare has been double cleansing with an oil cleanser or cleansing balm, and the brands I’ve previously used although took off my makeup well, always left a weird film feeling on my skin and didn’t really feel super clean (hence the need to double cleanse). This cleanser- one and done! It takes off my makeup so easily and so well AND leaves my skin so hydrated without a film or oily feeling. The packaging is also so cute and came with a little wildflower package. Entire experience- beginning to end. Have already been telling everyone about this cleanser. New go to cleanser
