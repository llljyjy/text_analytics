The product itself was pretty great. I applies well into the skin and it leaves you looking radiant. My only con is the packaging. The dropper is not useful because the serum has a thicker milky like consistency, which makes it really difficult to get the product out of the bottle. I ended up returning this to Sephora because I couldn’t get the product out. At a price point of $68, I would rather not waste my money on a product that’s unusable. If the company decides to change their packaging, I may give them another shot because I really did like what I was able to use. Need New Packaging
