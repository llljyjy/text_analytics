Gifted by Eadem. This moisturizer is perfect for winter months. It has a thick creamy consistency and is very hydrating but doesnâ€™t leave skin feeling sticky or heavy. My skin immediately feels plump and soft. The added bonus is the spatula, love the design and how easy it is to pick up the right amount of product. Hydrating and plumping!
