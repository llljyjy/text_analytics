First, I do like the consistency of this product, it is quite thick for a serum but not enough for a cream. It absorbs well, is not greasy, and does not break me out. I have only used it three nights so I can’t rate on the effectiveness of the product but I feel pretty strongly regarding the packaging that buyers should know before paying this much. I am giving this two stars solely on the packaging and dropper. After 3 days of use, I can tell that there will be significant product wasted,  Since it is thicker than a serum, the product sits on the walls of the container so I will never be able to reach that product.  The bottle is too wide for the little amount of product because the dropper doesn’t reach the bottom of the pot so it does not pick up the three drops the instructions recommend, it picks up about 1 drop.  It is actually quite difficult and frustrating to use knowing that most of this will be wasted.  Even if this worked 100%, I would not repurchase until the packaging is improved.
