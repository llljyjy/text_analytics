beautiful packaging, very nice if youre looking for an occlusive or a thick cream for barrier repair but you can find that anywhere for much cheaper. and it just doesnt provide that dewy glow i thought it would, im assuming its the butters in here that give the thick moisture sensation but visually it sets to a matte/waxy finish on the skin. I also think for a moisturizer that has some pore clogging ingredients high up on the list, ceramides that arent in the correct ratio to actually even improve the skin and the cost for the amount is just not worth it. this is also very similar in texture, feel etc as the summer fridays jetlag mask. reminds me of summer fridays jetlag mask
