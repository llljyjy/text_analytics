I am obsessed with this moisturizer! For context, I have acne prone skin with lots of hyperpigmentation—this moisturizer does not feel heavy on my skin and does not make me break out.  Initially I tried to use it as my day moisturizer, but I found that it is better suited in my evening regimen after I apply Tretinoin. When I wake up my skin isn’t oily or slick to the touch, just a beautiful soft matte finish.  I highly recommend! A little goes a long way. Absolutely worth a shot!
