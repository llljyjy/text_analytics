I have quite the collection of cleansing balms and oils, but this one stands out amongst some heavy hitters. This formula dispensed like a clear gel, but goes onto the skin like a thick balm. Once massaged onto dry skin this melts into a silky oil that dissolve makeup and spf products. All you have to do is emulsify with water and everything rinses clean. Im really impressed with this product and will make it a staple for double cleansing. New Staple Cleanser!
