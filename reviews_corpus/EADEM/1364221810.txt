I have both acne-prone and sensitive skin and I had to return this as it made me breakout. Itâ€™s also not as moisturizing as I thought it would be. I do like the little spoon it came with and that this product actually comes with a decent amount, unlike their vitamin C serum. Not ideal for acne-prone sensitive skin
