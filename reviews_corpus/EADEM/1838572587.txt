I am not a lover of cleansers.  I always use a cleansing oil as it’s easy, quick and gets everything off.  This stuff works!! It is similar where you can put it on your dry face and it’s feels very nice and silky. It smells a bit like lavender and it is very very nice.  This is my 2nd bottle Must have
