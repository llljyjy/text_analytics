This is a really great moisturizer! It’s very hydrating, feels smooth and soft on your face, doesn’t leave you feeling greasy or sticky, wears well under makeup (specifically powder foundation and primer) and the packaging is a really nice glass bottle. I have no complaints and would absolutely recommend if you are looking to support and try new brands. For reference I have normal to dry skin, I’m 10 weeks postpartum and it works well for me right now in with the cold dry winter air. Product also came with a really cute little spatula for application. It all feels very luxe and fancy. Product was gifted by EADEM for review purposes. nan
