This is such an innovative product & I love it! Starts out as a gel, becomes an oil as you rub it onto a dry face, it then emulsifies completely with a bit of water & washes right away. Removing makeup & all the impurities of the day. Also leaves no greasy residue behind! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to try a new first cleansing product. The price is right & itâ€™s so interesting to use! Love it! nan
