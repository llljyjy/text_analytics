I tried all sorts of cleansing balms and this one is unique! It starts off like a thick gel, and as you rub it it turns into an oil which removes all of your make up and sunscreen. There’s no waxy or very greasy feel like some cleansing balms I’ve tried, and it emulsifies very easily with just a bit of water and turns into a milky liquid that washes away cleanly. It smells really good too! I really like this and the only thing I would change is to give it a flip top cap. Photos show me in full makeup and then after just using this product. I do use a second cleanse after this if I’ve used makeup, but not if I just have a bare face - it’s enough on its own. Very cool product, removes makeup well
