A game changer for sure. Iâ€™ve use this for almost 3 months now and the result left me so happy. It faded my dark spots really well and soo fast. After one month of using it, my red dark spots were not so red anymore and you can see the weekly improvement of it fading. I use it day and night and lemme tell you it made my complexion so much brighter. I love how its made for woman of color but made for all skin types. Its very gentle and non irritating. Will definitely continue using this!(Before vs After one month of using it) In love!
