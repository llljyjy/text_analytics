So I never write reviews but…… I need anyone on the fence to know they should just buy it lol. It’s pricey but worth every penny. It comes in the most GORGEOUS glass packaging. (I also just prefer glass packaging for sustainability) I’m in my 20’s and have never found a moisturizer I truly love or a moisturizer I would without a doubt repurchase until I purchased this one. I don’t like gel creams bc I feel like after they absorb and feel as if I hadn’t applied anything. However most day creams that are thicker are also leave my skin with a little to much residue on top of the skin, which I wouldn’t mind, however I where glasses and the residue can often transfer on to my lenses with I can’t stand. (Yes I am picky I know) This cream is the perfect balance of moisture and dewy finish that keeps me hydrated all day. Cloud cushion are the perfect words to describe how the application feels. I purchased this on Eadem’s website where I also bought the spatula for sanitary reasons but it adds just a little extra dash of luxury. It’s fragrance free, vegan, and cruelty free so it checks all my boxes. I can’t recommend it enough! nan
