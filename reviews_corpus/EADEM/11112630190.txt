Let’s start by saying Simple packaging but awesome product. This Eadem cleansing balm starts out looking jelly like but turns into an oil texture when rubbed into your skin. With no strange smells this product starts melting your makeup in no time & leave skin feeling soft and moisturized. No sticky feeling or dryness after usage. I’d definitely recommend this product This was gifted to me by Eadem in return for my honest review. Melting Makeup
