I was looking for something a bit more hydrating yet breathable than the Skinfix barrier cream I’ve been using the last couple months, and this exceeded my expectations. The texture is light and feels super luxurious. It spreads beautifully on the skin, and leaves a healthy glow. It soaks in quickly and doesn’t clog pores. I have combo skin with occasional acne, and this product moisturized perfectly and hasn’t caused any breakouts. A little goes a long way, so I only need a pea sized amount to fully hydrate my face. The only thing that could make this product better is if it had a sanitary way to store the little spatula that comes with it. Love this! Luxurious lightweight hydration.
