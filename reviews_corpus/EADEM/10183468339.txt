This cleansing balm so so nice to use. I’ve been looking for something to replace my makeup wipes that isn’t too hard on my skin and also isn’t super oily. This cleansing balm was perfect. It applied like a creamy balm and washed off so easily. It smallest amazing and left my skin still feeling moisturized. It was very easy to use and my makeup melted away with the slightest touch!
