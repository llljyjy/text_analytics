I tried a sample of this and actually love the herbal smell. It’s very relaxing used with a face roller. It sinks in your skin pretty well, but also doesn’t absorb too quickly. Definitely considering buying a full size version since the sample took me a while to finish! It goes to show you don’t need a lot of product and a little amount goes a long way. nan
