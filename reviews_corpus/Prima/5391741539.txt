My skin was a wreck after a month of traveling so I bought this hoping it would help rebalance my skin. It’s exactly as advertised–“deeply restorative.“ My skin felt immediately better after a single use, and after a few weeks my skin is glowing. Highly recommend if you’re needing an extra dose of hydration. Intense hydration.
