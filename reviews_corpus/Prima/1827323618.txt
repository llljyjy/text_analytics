Purchased with my own money.The oil does not absorbs that well.Relatively thick consistency.Nutty smell (older batch)Why the clear container? Feels like any cosmetics should be air tight and protected from light to keep its prime components active and fresh.True, Jojoba oil is very stable but not true for all the other oils included. I love Prima transparency.I checked the batch report and to my disappointment, Sephora sold me a batch from December 2021. Already 7 months hold. Not cool Sephoraâ€¦.no wonder it was on sale:/ check your expiration date
