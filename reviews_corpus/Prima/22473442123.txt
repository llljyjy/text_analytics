This cream is great. Highly moisturizing and the cbd noticeably helps calm my skin. Upon first opening, the smell def smells like shea butter and cbd. The texture is smooth and buttery like shea butter creams and very thick. It would be nice if the cap came with its own scooping spatula to be able to easily scoop the desired amount. I find the texture, as lovely as it is, can be a little annoying to scoop with my finger without getting either too much or too little product. I was hoping that i wouldnâ€™t enjoy this cream because of the steep price tag but i love it so much i will keep purchasing and have it in my rotation, especially during the winter. I have combo skin with an oily t zone and dry marionette/chin area and i find that this moisturizes well and doesnt make me too greasy if i use a proper dose of it. New favorite moisturizer to keep in rotation
