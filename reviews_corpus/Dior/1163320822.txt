I received this product in exchange for my honest review.  First, I love the packaging.  The tube has a metal applicator on a soft neck, which feels super cold when you apply the serum to the undereye. It feels cool and refreshing on the skin. The product itself is a typical serum consistency, fast absorbing, doesn’t disturb makeup application after it fully sets. I apply morning and night.  I have extremely sensitive skin and there was no irritation to my skin or eyes at all.  The fragrance is strong.  I do not mind it but if you are sensitive to smells this may not be the serum for you.  The  serum does work to minimize appearance of fine lines and undereye bags. I’ve noticed that my faint lines under the eyes have temporarily disappeared. I’d buy again.
