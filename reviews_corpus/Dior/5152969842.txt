I received this from Influenster on Monday and was excited to use it.  I used it the first time on Monday night and I almost gave up while it was still in the palm of my hand.  Firstly, it has a highly 95 year old grandma house/perfume smell to it.  Secondly, it left my skin super dry.  I have very normal skin with no major issues other than fine lines but this stuff made it feel like the Sahara desert.  Lastly, I figured I could fix the dryness with my regular moisturizer but I ended up doing three different moisturizer to alleviate the tightness.  With all these issues, I still decided to give it a fair shot.  Used it again yesterday morning and night and this morning but I just canâ€™t it any more.  If I could get around the horrible smell, maybe but the dryness and tightness is very uncomfortable.  Not only that but I just looked in the mirror and I have dry patches that I have never had before.  With a price tag of $47, this deserves a negative 10 stars. AVOID THIS PRODUCT!
