I received this product in a Vox Box. The cleanser is a creamy foam that is clean, paraben free & softens as it cleans your complexion, neck & decollete. My skin felt smooth, soft, hydrated & firm. The container is a 5 Oz tube. The only con is that is has a heavy fragrance. If fragrance does not bother you, I would recommend this product. Creamy delight
