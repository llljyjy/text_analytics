I received a complimentary full size product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The balm is thick, so when it comes out of the tube it doesnâ€™t run or drip all over. I find that it feels too greasy for my face, so I have been using it on my hands. It keeps my hands hydrated but with a greasy feeling. Because of the greasy feeling, I would not purchase this product. Thick and greasy but hydrates well
