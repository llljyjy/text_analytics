After using this product for a few weeks, my skin looks and feels amazing. It looks smoother and has an amazing glow. I use it every morning. It’s super light weight and it smells amazing. The smell is not strong at all. I have oily skin and this has by far been the best product to work with my skin type. I also let my daughter try, she has dry skin and it’s working amazing with her skin type. This is a must have in your daily skin routine. 10/10
