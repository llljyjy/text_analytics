I really like this moisturizer! I love using it before my makeup because it soaks into the skin super fast and it doesnâ€™t leave your skin oily or shiny. It soaks in and just leaves your skin looking hydrated but not at all glory or shiny, which I love. I have dry cracked hands from the cold weather and this really helped my hands even after only one application! I recommend this! (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review) Love it!
