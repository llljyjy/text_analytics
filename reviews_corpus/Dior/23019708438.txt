I have mixed feelings on this product. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of product in here but found the packaging to be underwhelming. It’s hard to get product out (and apply with the applicator) without the serum suctioning back in. The product itself was fine; very sticky and needs to be paired with an eye cream. It didn’t do much for my dark circles but felt cooling and soothing. I imagine this would work well for eye puffiness, but that’s not something I deal with. nan
