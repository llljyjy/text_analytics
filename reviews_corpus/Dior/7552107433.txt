I really like this dior cleanser! First off, it’s a fairly large bottle and with this product a little goes a long way so I can see this lasting me a while. The texture is really nice and it lathers very well on the skin. I personally love the floral scent it has and to me it makes it feel more luxurious. I have dry skin and the scent doesn’t irritate me or dry my skin. I used this after an oil cleanser and feel like I am left with a clean face and my skin feels very soft after each use. Great cleanser!
