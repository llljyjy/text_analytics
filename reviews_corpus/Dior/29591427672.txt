Dior off/on foaming cleanser is pretty much the gold standard for sensitive skin. I’ve tried a ton of cleanseers, oil cleansers worked well, but were always heavily fragranced and clogged my pores. Traditional cleansers got the job done, but stripped my skin. I started using this, it removes even my long wear foundation, and doesn’t clog my pores. It’s been difficult to find the right cleanser that maintains my skins balance and Dior off/on is that cleanser. This cleanser made of natural ingredients which is great and maintaining my skin hydrated for long hours.After using this cleanser my skin look fresh and smooth.I love it! Natural ingredients best
