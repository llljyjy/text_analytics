I was so excited when I saw this especially since I was searching for something for my eyes! I like the sleek look and the applicator. It makes it so easy to apply to your eyes. The applicator is very cooling to the eye. I’m able to “massage“ the serum under my eyes and going to the corners with no problem. It’s too early to notice any big difference since I’ve only tried it for a few works but I can say so far so good. Happy that it didn’t irritate my eyes or anything. This will become a staple to my routine if I do see any changes in the next couple months! I did knock off one star because I haven’t fully seen the results yet. Also, sometimes it’s hard to get the serum out but it was an easy fix. Just turn it upside down and give it a little tap. nan
