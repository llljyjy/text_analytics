I liked this foaming face wash but I’m not in love with it. You can see that it cleans the dirt and my skin is velvety after each wash but besides that I don’t see any other benefits. The fragrance is horrible in my opinion. It smells like some old lady perfume. I would not go out of my way to purchase this product but it’s not horrible. Like it but don't love it
