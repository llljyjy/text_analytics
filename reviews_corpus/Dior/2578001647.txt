I received this item complimentary from Influenster & Dior in exchange for my honest review. I was super excited to try this product out. I really like the packaging and the application process. The serum aborns very easily and feels good on the skin. I have been using every night for about three weeks now and haven’t seen any improvements though. So I was shocked when I saw this was recommended by 90% of reviewers. Is it a nice eye serum? Yes, but if it’s not actually doing anything than I can’t see myself purchasing this in the future. I would have expected some results by now. I’m going to continue using it and hope for the best. To each is own, try at your own risk Worth it?
