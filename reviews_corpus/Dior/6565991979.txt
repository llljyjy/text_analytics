I received full size product for review.   This Eye Serum has been working very well for me.  My dark circles have lightened up a few shades and I don’t have as much crepeiness in my under eye area.  It has a smooth texture that keeps your under eye hydrated.  While it is more expensive,  I think I’m going to buy another bottle when this is almost gone because it does make me look a little more “awake“. Will definitely purchase
