I was excited to receive this product from influenster & have enjoyed using it. It foams up really nicely so you really only need a little bit. I have been using it twice a day everyday & still have a lot of product left. I have very dry skin & it didn’t strip any moisture but also isn’t what I would call moisturizing for those of us with dry skin. The scent is very strong it smells like flowers it’s not bad but very noticeable however it does fade after you rinse. It cleanses well with o r without makeup on but waterproof makeup was a little more difficult to remove which I find is normal for most cleansers. I’d recommend this cleanser especially if you can get it on sale because it is on the pricey side. A little goes a long way
