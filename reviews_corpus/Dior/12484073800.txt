I received this Dior serum for free in exchange for my honest review. My skin was pretty dry before trying the serum. After I used the serum my skin instantly had that glow look. My skin felt moisturized. I personally like the scent of the product. It smells like a clean scent. Iâ€™ve only used this about a little over a week now, so I will continue to track my results throughout the next few weeks. I also like that the products are 91% natural-origin ingredients. I suffer from breakouts here and there, so I enjoy using natural procure to not flare up breakouts. So far I enjoy this product! I would definitely recommend. Incentivized voxbox
