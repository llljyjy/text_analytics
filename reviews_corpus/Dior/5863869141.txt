I have used this cleanser for the past few weeks and have to say I do really like it. I have used it in the shower as well as morning and night to clean my face at my sink. I do feel like it cleans my face well and takes away all of the makeup and grime from the day. It did feel slightly drying at first, but I tend to have dryer skin so that may just be due to that. Due to this I tend to use it a few times a week rather than every day. The cleanser meshes well with the rest of my daily skincare routine. I havenâ€™t noticed any breakouts or anything since using, which is definitely something I worry about with new products. Packaging is nice and sleek, however, I was not a fan of the twist off cap. I found it difficult to find a place to put the cap when using the cleanser in the shower. Overall I do like this product and will continue to use it. Nice Cleanser
