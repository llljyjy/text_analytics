I like the scent of this cleanser. It’s not too strong. It cleans well and leaves my skin feeling kind of tight. I think it’s a little drying for my skin. My normal cleanser is Rodan and Fields and it doesn’t dry my skin out. It’s creamy out of the bottle and foamy when wet. I received this product for free for my honest review. nan
