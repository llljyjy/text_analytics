This cleanser is a classic creamy foaming cleanser - meaning, itâ€™s more suited to those with oilier skin. If you have drier skin, this would be too drying. But personally, this product has performed very well. The fragrance is rather strong, but it foams up really well - each time I use the amount equal to a very small dot, but it foams wonderfully to clean my skin very throughly. If you use this when you shower, the steam and residual water on your hands from the shower would allow you to work this into your skin without it drying up. This bottle could last a long time, and does a good job! good for oily skin!
