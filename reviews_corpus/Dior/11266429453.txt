I love this cleanser! I just started using it and I can already see the difference in my skin. It’s so creamy and leaves my face feeling super smooth and doesn’t dry it out and washes off without leaving a residue. Also a little bit goes a long way!! Highly recommend if you have an oily T zone as it’s really helped mine! Refreshing
