this repair balm is literally so good. i’ve been dealing with severe dry skin lately and the second i applied the tiniest bit of product to my face, it instantly hydrated and alleviated my issues. this product is lightweight, mildly fragranced, and a little goes a long way. i’ve tried many moisturizers but this product just worked so much better for me and i’m probably going to rebuy it. definitely recommend. dry skin savior
