This is a dense fluffy cream that gives the immediate feel of richness and deep hydration upon application. It absorbs gradually leaving a truly non-sticky non oily feel on the skin. The skin feels plump, moisturized and hydrated. It is surprisingly emollient and absorbs fairly well into an elegant thinner protective layer. It is fragrance- and colourant free and only contains one preservative. All in all, having the minimum amount of ingredients, the lack of additives mean that the formula is mild and suitable for even the most sensitive skin also. Can be used as a daily treatment or when your skin needs some extra moisture and/or soothing.I think it is definitely worth a try if you struggle with dry areas and would like to have a more elegant formulation (especially on the face). Lush and delicious for your skin
