I really like this cleanser! It foams up to a mousse like texture and is super soft. One thing I liked in particular is that it left my skin feeling super clean but did not leave it with the “tight skin“ feeling that you often get with other cleansers. However, if you don’t like scented skincare, this is not for you. It has kind of a milky lily scent that I didn’t mind but it might not be the case for others. All in all, I’m super satisfied :) Lovely cleanser!
