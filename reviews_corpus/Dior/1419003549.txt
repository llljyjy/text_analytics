I have been using this eye serum for about a month and have definitely noticed improvement to the skin under and around my eyes. Less puffiness, less fine lines, and the deeper lines on the sides of my eyes (crow feet) are less noticeable. I’ve also noticed the my eye makeup seems to be going on around my eyes more smoothly and is not settling into my fine lines and wrinkles! I love the cool feel of the applicator but I do find it difficult to get the right amount of product out. I’ve opted for squeezing a bit out, tapping it around my eyes, and then using the applicator to rub it in. This works better for me and means I waste less product! I highly recommend! Fantastic skin care addition!
