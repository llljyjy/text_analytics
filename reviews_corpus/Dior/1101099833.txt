This cleanser is like a trip to the spa for a luxe facial in a bottle. A little goes a long way and it works into a really lovely foamy lather. It helps to remove all dirt and makeup from the day and leaves my face feeling so clean and ready for the rest of my skincare routine. I love the packaging, it’s easy to squeeze out as much or as little as you like and it looks really beautiful on my counter. If all Dior skincare is like this I can’t wait to try more. I would repurchase over my normal cleanser and would definitely recommend to friends and family. nan
