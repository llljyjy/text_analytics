i received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I was super excited when I received this box to review. The Dior Totaled Capture Super Potent Eye Serum is amazing! Upon first use the product went on very smoothly and left my eyes feeling moisturizer and looking brighter. After multiple uses the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes started to become less noticeable.  The applicator is really nice, it allows you to get into all the crevices around your eye smoothly. A small amount of product went a long way. At first I was worried the results would NOT justify the $90 price tag on this profit but I WAS SO WRONG. This product is definitely worth spending the extra money on if you have the extra money to spend. I would definitely recommend this product to others and would buy it again (as long as finances allow) Great product! Worth the price!
