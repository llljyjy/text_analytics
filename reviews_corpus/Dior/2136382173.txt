I use a chickpea amount in my dry hands to lather up with water and cleanse my whole face and neck. Its creamy and thick but not as thick as La Mer’s cleanser—which smells and feels very similar to this. La Mousse is fluffy and moisturizing. It foams up nicely, but it’s not as thick as a Shiseido cleanser or micro-foam if that’s what you’re looking for. It also isn’t as sudsy as the Capture Totale (my favorite) is. It removed my leftover makeup well and cleansed my pores. I didn’t feel any tightness or drying and could comfortably apply my toner immediately afterwards. The scent remained for a little while, so it is fragranced but it’s a creamy fresh soap scent that isn’t bothering. Good amount for the price and designer too. ON
