I liked this cleanser , it’s smells absolutely amazing, it’s smooth and foamy the way I like , was very excited to receive it because otherwise i wouldn’t bought it itself. The packaging and the product feels luxurious , it worth its money for sure . It is a little bit drying ( most of the cleansers I use are drying to me ) so I wasn’t much surprised, but I loved it anyway , it will last me long because you will only need a pea size amount for use . Amazing))) Yes , I love it
