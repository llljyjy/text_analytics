The Dior Cica Repair Balm is nice, but not anything special. It’s a lightweight cream for face and body that I like to use as a moisturizing makeup base. I like that it doesn’t feel greasy or sticky and absorbs into the skin quickly. I believe that this would be great for sensitive skin since there’s no fragrance and it’s not heavy, but I don’t have sensitive skin, so I’m not positive. I don’t think that this balm is worth $60 though (& I have a $100 Charlotte Tilbury cream that is worth it that I would repurchase). If you use it on the body, you’d go through it super fast, so I only used it on my face. I wouldn’t go out and purchase it for that much money, but if it was $30 I’d repurchase. Overall, it’s a good product, but not worth the price. Good But Not Special
