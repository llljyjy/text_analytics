This cleanser is thick and lathers so nicely. A little goes a long way! I love the way it foams up on your skin but doesn’t feel like it’s stripping your skin dry. It does an amazing job of removing makeup and moisturizing at the same time. My skin feels so fresh and clean after I use it. The scent is also quite nice! Amazing cleanser!
