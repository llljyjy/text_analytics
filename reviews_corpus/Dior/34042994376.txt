i really wanted to like this face wash, i used it for a few days , loved the way it made my skin feel, but after a few days i started to notice these bumps on my face. i havenâ€™t changed anything to my face routine besides this face wash. my skin used to look like the 1st pic, and now it looks like the 2nd pic. had to stop using the face wash and now my face is clearing up again. hated this
