Received this product complimentary from Influenster. Thick moisturizer that surprisingly does not cause breakouts. I have combo skin. It makes my skin feel very smooth and hydrated, but does not give an overly heavy feeling. Not sure if I will use this in the summer but it is definitely great for the colder and drier months. I also think it smells great! Faintly smells of chamomile, not strong at all. The only potential negative is that it doesn’t spread as easily since it is thick, so I use more than I want to and it’s a small bottle. I might go through it more quickly than normal. nan
