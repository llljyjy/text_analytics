I would 10/10 recommend this product to anyone! I started using it when my skin was super dry and within two uses, all my dry spots were gone. I love that it is a thick and creamy moisturizer, but it doesn’t feel heavy. It feels super nourishing and refreshing. I will definitely be buying this product when I run out! You’ll Love It
