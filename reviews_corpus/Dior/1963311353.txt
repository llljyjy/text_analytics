After using this serum for the past few weeks, I am very happy with the results so far. Every time I use it, there is a noticeable difference in the brightness and smoothness of my under eyes by the following morning. The consistency is very thin and cooling when you apply but soaks in quickly and does not feel sticky. Although the product is a little difficult to squeeze out because of the hardness of the tube, the applicator tip feels amazing on the eyes. It’s not super moisturizing so I will probably add a thicker eye cream over top in the cooler months but overall I’m thrilled with my results so far. I would definitely consider permanently adding this to my skincare routine if it continues to perform this well over time. Thrilled so far
