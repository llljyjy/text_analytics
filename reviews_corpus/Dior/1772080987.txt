This balm is an excellent winter night time cream. Especially if you live in a place with frigid dry winters like me. I have rosy pink very sensitive skin and this balm is so soothing and left zero irritation. It has no smell whatsoever which honestly I love. The ingredients seems really clean and simple yet wow this is super moisturizing. I would definitely purchase this! If your face is dry look no further!
