I recieved this product from influnster in exchange for my honest opinion. I think Cica Repair Balm is a great product. I used it on my dry rough hands and it was a game changer. They are now so soft and smooth not easy to attain in the middle of a midwest winter. I will buy this again it was wonderful! GREAT PRODUCT
