I really enjoyed this Dior Capture Totale eye serum. It is lightweight, absorbs quickly and was easy to incorporate into my existing skincare routine.  I apply it at night and and use the tip to massage the serum into my under eye area and follow with my eye cream. My eyes appear brighter and less puffy. nan
