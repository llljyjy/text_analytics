I was pleasantly surprised by the applicator, it was very colling and made it easy to spread the product under my eyes. It didn’t irritate my sensitive skin and no harsh fragrances. I really enjoyed using this, it made my skin feel soft and smooth but I’m not sure that it made a huge difference. Nice serum
