[I received this product as a gift from Influenster and Dior in exchange for my honest review.] Very lightweight serum that does not irritate my sensitive eyes (I wear contact lenses daily). Makes my under-eye area very smooth and feeling hydrated. I throw it in my makeup bag and re-apply during the day when I feel dryness around my eyes.Update after 1 week use: great for summer heat, since it’s not oily, my concealer stays in place and doesn’t crease. The only downside is the product volume. I wish the it was a bit bigger. Great to use on the go
