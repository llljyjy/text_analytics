Great moisturizer, particularly for people who don’t like scented skincare products. It has a thick creamy texture and it absorbs into the skin. It does not make my skin feel greasy at all and it doesn’t pill. I took off one star because while it is a great product, nothing about stood out as particularly exciting. nan
