Okay so I tried this product and I’ve become obsessed. The formula is made for sensitive skin so you can actually use it on your face and body, the texture is soft and silky and absorbs into the skin nicely, the results are very appealing as it made my elbows super rejuvenated and smooth and most importantly it actually does what it’s advertising. It makes skin more rejuvenated and vibrant and creates a healthy skin effect! Worth the money!
