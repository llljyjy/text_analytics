I received this product in exchange for my honest review from Influenster Per the website’s description “A soothing face cleanser that removes makeup, oil, and impurities while preserving hydration for clean pores and comfortable, hydrated skin.” I have to say that for me, I found this cleanser to be rather stripping. My face feels dry after use. I have oily skin and sensitive skin, the pro’s are that this product didn’t give me a reaction or make me break out. The smell is light and pleasant with a satisfying lather. The bottle is massive and a bit bothersome with its huge twist off cap. But it feels like you get a good amount of product for the price. I wouldn’t repurchase as it doesn’t really do anything positive for my skin. Smells good but fairly stripping.
