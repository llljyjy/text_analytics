I have been using this product for a few weeks and I like it! It doesn’t lather a lot, but it goes on smoothly and rinses cleanly. I don’t feel like my face is too dry afterwards, either. It removes makeup easily.  The product has the consistency of a light lotion and a pretty heavy scent. Reminds me of perfume. If you prefer light or no scent, this cleanser is not for you. Overall, I would recommend it! Cleans without drying. Heavy scent.
