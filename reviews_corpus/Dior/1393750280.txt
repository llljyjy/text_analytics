I have greatly enjoyed seeing results from this serum. It is lightweight, absorbs really well, has a clean feel on my face and is not tacky or greasy. In the winter, I don’t think it’s moisturizing enough to be standalone, but with repeated use, I have seen my skin look more energized and well-rested and my discoloration issues seem to be tamed as well. The one thing I could do without is the fragrance seems to be a little strong, but not off putting. Highly recommend! Another winner from Dior. Another Winner from Dior
