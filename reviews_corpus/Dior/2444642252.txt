I love Dior and their products have been awesome for me in the past, but they keep changing the lineup so right when I get a routine figured out they discontinue what I’m using.  I bought this cream because my skin is always too dry over the winter.  This is definitely a very deeply moisturizing night cream type of product.  I feel like it moisturized my skin well but I also saw an increase in breakouts.  I bought it twice because it seemed to get used up fast, there isn’t a ton of product especially for the price. nan
