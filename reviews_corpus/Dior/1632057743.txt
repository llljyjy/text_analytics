I am in love with this face cleanser. I normally buy standard drugstore cleanser that foams but this takes foaming cleanser to another level. It comes out creamy and foams up nicely. The smell is gentle but most importantly the hydration. This product leaves my face feeling moisturized but clean. It doesnâ€™t leave the pores tight but gets into them well. No residue left for toner to clean up. It has definitely changed my opinion on high end vs drugstore cleanser quality. nan
