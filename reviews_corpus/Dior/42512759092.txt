This product was received for free from Influenster and Dior in exchange for my honest review.  I have been using the Dior Le Serum religiously every morning and evening since I received it a few weeks ago.  It has a light fresh fragrance and a smooth, creamy consistency.  One pump goes a long way and covers my face.  Another half a pump also covers my neck.  The serum absorbs quickly into the skin.  Soon after applying it the first time I noticed my face appeared more radiant and tighter.  I noticed after continuously use that my skin was smoother and my pores were less noticeable.  It is plumper and firmer.  The fine lines in my eye and lip area are barely visible now.  I love that this product is environmentally friendly and uses 91% natural origin materials.  The bottle is beautiful.  It reminds me of a pretty perfume bottle.  I know that Dior has refills available for some of their products.  I would love to see this as an option for the Dior Capture Le Serum.  I will be purchasing this product when the bottle Iâ€™m currently using is gone.  I highly recommend the Dior Le Serum. A Must Have Serum
