I usually avoid foam cleansers at all costs because they’re too thin and don’t clean well. But I’ve finally found the perfect foam cleanser for me. It’s thicker than other ones, cleanses deeper into the pores, and takes off my make up with ease. my face felt so soft and smooth after just one wash I was amazed. This cleanser is worth every penny and more! Amazingly Smooth
