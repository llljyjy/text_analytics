I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.First starters I really like the eye serum. It’s very creamy and just soaks right into the skin. I was a little worried to try it because I have very sensitive eyes but I was surprised when this product causes me no issues. The one thing I didn’t like was the metal applicator and the ridges on it. It was a little to rough on the skin, especially on such a delicate area. nan
