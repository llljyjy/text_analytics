Dior has done much research after learning that the eye area represents 80% of perceived age . As a result , they have identified 9 signs of aging that impact the power of the eyes. They have combined them into the eye power index which is unique to Dior. These include homogeneity and brightness, the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, dark circles and congestion, drooping eyelids and toning of the skin around the eye area.  This is Diorâ€™s first age-defying and awakening serum. It uses 3 active ingredients along with 3 actions to correct these 9 problems.  Bringing nature and technology together. It contains 92% of natural-origin ingredients.1. Biocellular Longoza which re-energizes the skin. 2. Rye extract which stimulates the skin for toning and firming. 3. Acetylene Hyaluronic Acid which maintains moisture. Let me talk about this extraordinary applicator. This double patented applicator has massaging head with 7 smoothing waves of perfection. Works great on any eye type. It felt cool and smooth on my skin.  I just glide this luscious formula over my skin. It even gets into those more delicate area around my eyes. Test results say that in 1 week 26% see results. In 1 month +64% noticed firmer skin. My experience is that in only 1 day I noticed a tremendous difference. My eyes,  because of lack of sleep, are always puffy with dark circles. Almost immediately  they were gone. A combination of the cool feel of the applicator and these ingredients work miracles. My eyes looked more smooth and awake. Dark circles and fine lines just disappeared. Its one of my top 3 eye serums. I highly recommend it. If I could be I love with an eye serum, well this is it.
