Got a deluxe sample of this and wow, AWFUL! I cannot remember the last time I had a pimple. The first night I used this, I woke up with bumps all over my forehead. I thought it could’ve been a fluke so I tried again a couple nights later. Woke up with bumps on forehead, cheeks, chin, it’s just horrible. Throwing the rest of this sample away. It’s a shame because it’s a rich, thick cream. The smell is super strong but pleasant. Very disappointed it made my skin freak out. nan
