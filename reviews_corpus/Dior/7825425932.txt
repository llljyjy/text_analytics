This cleanser is wonderfully smooth and a little goes a long way. The fragrance is pleasant and it froths beautifully. My skin feels squeaky clean,  however there is a slight sensation of a waxy residue once the skin dries. I’m not used to that feeling as I generally use cleansers that don’t leave my mature skin with that squeaky clean feeling, but rather a moisturized feeling. The packaging is nice in that it is flat, easy to hold and pack for travel. A little goes a long way!
