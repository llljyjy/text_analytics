The balm comes out very luxurious and thick, but smooths out into a very silky texture that doesn’t feel oily or overbearing. It’s pleasantly unscented in that there is a natural scent from what I assume are the botanicals, but they didn’t intentionally try to cover up or add to the scent. Those with sensitive noses may be able to smell a light fragrance, but for the most part it’s unscented. Moisturized my skin well with the bad winter weather lately. Feels super nice!
