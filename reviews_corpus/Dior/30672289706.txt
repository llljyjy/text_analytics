I absolutely love all things luxury brands. I love how innovative they are sometimes, like the OFF/ON concept for this cleanser. The box reads: “OFF: Eliminates impurities, urban particles, makeup residue and excess sebum. ON: Soothes and protects the skin’s hydration and barrier.”A little of this goes a longgg way, if you spend more than 10 seconds lathering the product! It is scented; I wouldn’t say heavily or lightly scented because I don’t personally have a preference/sensitivity to scented or not scented products. Although, If you are sensitive to scented products in anyway, this will probably be too much for you. It has a strong soapy smell, with a undertones of a floral Dior perfume that I can put my finger on. I used this in the morning after sleeping with my nightly face serums I use (rose water&hyaluronic acid face toner, estee lauder night repair and curology moisturizer) I feel like the product definitely broke down and rid any oils. I did not use a washcloth for exfoliating, just lathering with my hands. Once my face fully dried after a few minutes, it felt so so smooth, without using anything on my face after the wash. The scent still lingers after a few minutes as well.I received this free as a complimentary item for my honest review, but looked up the item cost to see it priced between $40-$60. I generally use Olay Advanced Anti Aging Detoxifying Pore Scrub and a ELF hyaluronic acid moisturizing cleanser. Would I buy this on my own accord, maybe… Although, I do struggle with some blackheads on my nose, and generally like something with more exfoliating power, like the beads in the Olay cleanser I typically use. Dior Products Are Quality, But Pricey!
