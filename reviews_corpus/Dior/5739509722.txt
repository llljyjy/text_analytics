I tested this product for 3 weeks, using it 3-4 times a week. This is a very nice serum in amazing and innovative packaging. The tube has a unique metal applicator on a soft neck, which feels very cold when you apply the serum to the under eye. Thr applicator is AMAZING and should be used on all under eye products!! It feels amazing on the skin. The product itself is a typical serum consistency, fast absorbing, doesn’t disturb makeup application after it fully sets. I apply at night, following with a heavier eye cream. I love how this feels on the skin, I have not one complaint and I love the jasmine e floral scent . The fragrance is actually in the middle of product ingredient list, which means the quantity of fragrance is fairly strong.  I don’t recommend this for people with eye sensitivities, however, the serum does work to minimize appearance of fine lines and undereye bags. I’ve noticed that my faint lines under the eyes have temporarily disappeared. This product actually works and is definitely worth the price point! Highly recommend the splurge- a little goes a long way and I estimate this tube will last at least 4 months! Under Eye MUST HAVE!!!
