This is the second time I have received this product to test. It is a nice product and I especially enjoy the cooling metal applicator on my eyes to help de-puff them. Not sure that the actual eye serum does anything more than any other eye serum, however. For those in a budget, you could hack it and get the same effect with your regular eye cream or facial moisturizer and a $10 mini facial roller that you cool down in the fridge before using. Nice cooling effect but pricey
