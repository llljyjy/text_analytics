I am new to the luxury skin care game, but this cream was a way to get into it! It is heavy on the skin making it the perfect night time cream. It left my skin very soft in the morning and I felt the hydration for about 24 hours. Wearing it morning and night was a little much for my oily skin but it did not break me out. I love this cream! nan
