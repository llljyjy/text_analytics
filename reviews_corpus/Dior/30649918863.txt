With the winter weather, my arms and elbows have been very dry. This balm helped it feel normal again. I’m sensitive to fragrances so the light scent was very welcomed.My issue is with the price. It’s overpriced. You’re paying for the brand name. You honestly could get something just as good for at least half the price nan
