Applicator is the truth. As my under eye skin betrays me a little more every year, getting thinner but also puffier, wrinklier, and saggier I have found my application or serums never feels thorough so I end up overdoing it. One should never rub scrub or beat on this skin. The fragility is real; however, this serum and applicator are the perfect combination for tired maturing eyes. I Am noticing an improved relief from the usual exhausted appearance to a healthier rested look!The price doesn’t seem to be a good value to hough I feel I’ve had similar results from products half the price. I received this product in exchange for an honest review from Influenster. Applicator is the Whole Truth
