Living in NYC means I go through so many season changes, and Iâ€™ve been looking for an extremely gentle and pure cleanser, after using this product I can honestly say it left my skin feeling fresh and clean with a fresh scent. I have to say a little goes a long way. Application is fairly easy the product goes on with a light, silky feeling. After use my skin felt soft and smooth without irritation. Overall fantastic cleanser for sensitive, combination and mature skin. Skincare Addition
