Acne in a container. It smells like shaving cream and gives acne. I tried to love this especially for the price tag. I used it on and off for two months and every time I used it I would get  acne. It took a week to get my skin back to normal. I wish I could return this garbage but itâ€™s past the return point. I do NOT recommend this. nan
