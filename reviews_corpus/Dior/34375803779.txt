This is my new favorite serum! It has a beautiful light scent. Every time I use it, my husband says “you smell so nice!”. I have definitely noticed a positive change after using this product. I have been putting it on twice a day(morning and night). My skin tone is more even. I love how smooth and hydrated my skin feels. The price is a little higher than what I normally spend but it’s worth it. I will be keeping this routine! My new favorite serum!
