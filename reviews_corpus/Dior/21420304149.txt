When I first opened the tube, I was concerned about the thick creamy texture being used during the day. I was worried that it would make my skin feel greasy which is saying a lot with dry new England weather!!It is unscented and absorbs really quickly. After the first week I could really feel a difference in my skinI received this product free from Influenster for testing. nan
