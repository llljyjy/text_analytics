This comes with a nice applicator tip that feels cool and easy to use. I like how it feels on my skin but I do need to use my fingers after to pat it in more. I haven’t notice any difference in my dark circles or puffiness. It is pricey so I’ll keep using it to see if I notice any results and if it’s worth the price. Has a slight fragrance that I don’t care for. nan
