I used this Dior Off/On foaming cleanser each morning during my shower. I loved the way the cleanser felt during and after application, I loved the smell,and the results were great. This cleanser was a great lotion like consistency. It was not runny at all making application simple. You needed very little to do your complete face and neck so this product will definitely last a good while. My skin felt refreshing and clean after use. After using it for some time I noticed cleaner pores and experienced less break outs. I enjoyed the more fragrant smell of this product. It smelled more than most face washes but it was pleasant not overpowering. It smelled of floral like to me. I loved the design of the container. It was more slender but still very stable when sitting. It took up much less space in my shower than other face products I have used. The container also made using the product simple because it was easy to grip and squeeze. This is a very good thing for people like me who often drop items and a lot of the time canâ€™t put a lot of force into squeezing containers. This one worked very nicely. I would definitely recommend this product for those wanting a great cleanser that is easy to use and effectively clean the skin. Using this product has definitely made me want to include more Dior products in my daily routine! Yes, I like it that much. Great feeling clearer skin
