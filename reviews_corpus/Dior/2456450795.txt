The cleanser leaves a nice clean feeling after using it but I must be sensitive to one of the ingredients since I tend to feel slightly red after using it. Nonetheless it has a nice scent and does what itâ€™s supposed to. However, I do feel it is a bit overpriced. You get a large tube but you can get similar results with cheaper cleansers. Nice but overpriced.
