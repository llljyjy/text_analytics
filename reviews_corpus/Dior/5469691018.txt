This cleanser is creamy and foams when water is added! It removes makeup but is gentle on the skin. After using it, my skin feels clean but not stripped or tight. I also like how the packaging is simple and elegant but also watertight and easy to use. However, it does have a strong perfume like scent. Personally, i enjoy the scent, but those sensitive to fragrance might wish to avoid! Luxurious cleanser!
