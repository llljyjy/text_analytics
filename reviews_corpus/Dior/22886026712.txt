This is one of the best moisturizing creams I’ve ever used. It is a little pricey, but if nothing else seems to work, this is your answer! No scent, so if you’re sensitive to scents, this isn’t scented at all. Not greasy. Absorbed into the skin quickly. My hands are so very dry. I use moisturizers on them, but this one lasts so much longer. Great moisturizer
