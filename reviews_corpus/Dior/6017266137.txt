I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  I tried this on my face, my arms, my legs and my heels. It is thick but absorbs nicely. I did not like the way it felt on my face because it left a greasy feeling. I didnâ€™t like it on my arms either because when I washed my hands I could feel the lotion washing off like it was thick, leaving a splotchy mess. It did however work well on my legs and especially well on my heels which were dry and cracking. I can noticeably feel the difference on my heels, the dryness and cracking is slowly going away every day, a little bit more, as I apply it. In my honest opinion, I think it works the best for legs, feet and heels. Depends on what body part you use it on for me.
