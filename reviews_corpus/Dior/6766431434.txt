This eye serum is very nice. I hqve been using it for about a week and have noticed improvement in hydration and a slight improvement in fine lines. It has no noticable scent to me, it applies smoothly. The metal tipped applicator is a nice touch, and feels very soothing and cool when you apply it. It is slightly tacky after application, so unless you apply an eye cream over it that may be noticeable to you, and is one reason I deducted a star. I received this item for free in exchange for providing my honest review. Love the applicator!
