Fabulous moisturizing cleanser. This cleanses yet doesn’t dry out my skin. I apply this a night time during my. Kemal skincare routine. The cleanser has a beautiful strong fragrance of Lily, so if you don’t prefer fragrance in your skincare this isn’t for you. I took a small dollop of cleanser and applied it to my wet face. It creates a nice light form and feels gentle and luxurious on my face; like a mini-facial! Luxurious & Moisturizing
