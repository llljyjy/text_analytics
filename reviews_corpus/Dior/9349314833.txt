Have been using this cleanser for about a week now. Has been good on my skin, and has helped remove all the makeup and oil that has built up in my skin through the day. Feels refreshing. The scent is pretty generic. Smells like standard bar soap. Expected it to have a more expensive, fresh screen. I am enjoying this product overall. nan
