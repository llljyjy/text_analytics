This was honestly so lovely on my face and hands. I think it’s hydrating without being overly greasy and that’s coming from someone dry skin in the winter. But disclaimer, I do tend to use a more hydrating formula in the colder months. It soothed my hands on those really cold/dry days and didn’t irritate my face at all. I have a somewhat sensitive skin in the winter. The fragrance was very natural and faint. The only downside is the price but it is Dior lol. Overall would defs recommend but this does remind me of a certain brand’s happy hydration cream. it’s good!
