I received this courtesy of Influenster and Dior. I have very sensitive skin and was excited to try this. The balm left my skin looking and feeling soft but not greasy. It absorbed well and while it felt nice I don’t think I’d purchase it at the high price tag when there are comparable items for less. Nice but not mind blowing
