I really liked the texture of this serum. It was light and felt cooling on with the applicator. I did not realize I was supposed to put another eye cream over top of the serum. I prefer one eye product at a time and would never use two at once. It was just too much.The not great part of this product was the applicator. I had a really hard time getting enough to squeeze out and often times too much came out at once and it was very wasteful. Itâ€™s really hard to squeeze the tube...it is very stiff and rigid. I did like the feel of the metal applicator though.I did receive this a gift to review it. I am not sure I would purchase this because of how ti comes out of the tube and the face you are supposed to use it with another eye cream. Nice but, not great
