I really enjoyed this facial cleanser as it was very gentle for my sensitive skin. There is a very light, natural scent, which was refreshing and not overpowering. In terms of clearing my skin of debris and oil, it’s probably the best cleanser I’ve used. While it’s tough on grime, it’s not tough on your skin. I have combination skin, which is difficult when selecting a product. Oftentimes, my skin becomes too oily or too dry; however, this product has the right balance. I would put gothic product in the future. Cleansing & Hydrating
