This is my first Dior skincare product I have tried. My face is very sensitive and easily prone to breakout. My cheeks have been on the drier side this time of year. I was excited to use this new cream. I used it at night for a couple nights. I did feel like my skin was hydrated, soft and smooth. Although I did break out so this wonâ€™t be a cream I can use on my face very often. I have been using it on my hands and cuticles and LOVE it. Very nice cream to help heal you skin
