The Dior Capture Totale Super Potent eye cream had no scent scent too it. Easy to apply. I like the applicator tip as it helps to apply to the eye and massage the eye. The texture of the serum is just how I like it. No too thick. This product has already show to reduce some of the lines around my eyes. The only issues is the lid is not easy to attach back on because of a wave in in. I highly recommend this product. Dior Capture Totale Super Potent eye cream
