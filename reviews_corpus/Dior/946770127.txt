I’ll start with the pros of this facial cleanser. My face felt very clean after use and not that tight dry feeling. I like how the cleanser foams up to get all over easily. The scent is a pro and a con for me. It’s very overpowering for a facial cleanser and has the Dior rose scent. The good part is it does fade and you can’t smell it afterwards. My cons are:After a few weeks of use I noticed I was getting types of acne I hadn’t ever gotten before. I stopped use and my face has cleared up. I did like this at first. The tube that it is in makes it difficult in the shower. I like one handed tubes and this one you need two hands to put the top back on. It’s just awkward. Good and bad
