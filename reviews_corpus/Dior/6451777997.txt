This is a great cleanser! It’s a soft scented foaming face wash that gently removes my makeup & skin impurities from the day while not drying out my skin. (I have dry skin for reference) It doesn’t have a super strong fragrance, just a soft scent. I mostly use this as my second cleanser after a cleansing balm but you can use this alone and it will still deliver! It’s such a luxurious feeling product, highly recommend! Love this!
