This is a solid moisturizer. It’s hydrating and leaves your skin with an almost velvety finish. It’s really nice and also great for hands. I like it a lot, which is surprising because I don’t expect much from these more expensive brands. Is it life changing?? No but definitely nice and a great moisturizer for someone looking into dior products. Also doesn’t hurt that it looks great on my vanity LOL GOOD MOSTURIZER
