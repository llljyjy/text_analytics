I wanted to provide an honest, real review for this Dior OFF/ON Foaming Cleanser so I waited until I used it consistently for over a month before writing this. First off, I’m a huge fan of Dior- if I’m going to splurge on a luxury brand, Dior is my go to for self-indulgence. How did it hold up to my expectations? This cleanser was nearly perfect, nearly. For a luxury brand, I was happy to see that the cleanser was in a plastic tube instead of glass bottle which makes it more convenient for sitting in shower. Also the shape of the bottle made it easy to hold, unlike other tubes, it never slips out of my hand while rushing in the morning. With super dry skin,  a lot of cleansers are too drying for my skin. This one didn’t exacerbate my eczema at all. It was effective at removing my makeup and didn’t strip my skin of its natural oils. My only issue is if my eyes are slightly irritated, this cleanser burns. Deal breaker… no- but also doesn’t make this cleanser first place on my list for repurchasing either. Love the scent, smells fresh but not super overpowering either.  If this shows up in a gift set around the holidays, I will definitely be picking it up or around the sale seasons but I will not be purchasing this at full price as it’s expensive at nearly $50 for something that’s not absolutely perfect, just nearly. I really have enjoyed it, just as I do with everything by Dior. almost perfection
