It’s hard to find a moisturizer that is thick enough to actually soothe winter skin, but doesn’t break you out. Dior managed to strike that balance perfectly with this balm. It’s fragrance free and sensitive skin approved, and works well on every winter worn surface of my skin that I treated:  face, elbows, knees and hands. I found it works best for me as an overnight mask, but makeup also applied easily over the top without pilling or patchiness. This product has definitely earned a standing position in my moisturizing arsenal. Perfect skin partner for MN winters
