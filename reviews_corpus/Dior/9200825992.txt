I am usually very picky about face washes, but I absolutely love this one. It makes my skin feel so clean afterwards. It is expensive, but since it is foaming you only need to use a small amount so it definitely lasts awhile. The scent is great as well. Smells good and not too strong. Will definitely be repurchasing once I run out. nan
