Packaging and size are great for the price considering it’s Dior. Cleanser foams up well, and my skin feels very clean after using it. I have oily/combo skin this cleanser feels great after a long day at work. You can smell the strong fragrance upon opening the product. I don’t mind fragrance and nor does it affect me, but just want to note it for those who want to try it. nan
