I recently tried the Dior La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser. The outside of the bottle presents itself with a simple sleek elegance, while the inside holds a lux quality product. My skin is can be combination of sorts, so sometimes products are often a hit or a miss for me. With that being said, I had no issues at all with this formula. I love how the cleanser foams up and froths up while Iâ€™m massaging and cleaning my face with it. The water lily extract really does take my makeup off without feeling like I am having to put tons of effort into it. While having tried several other face washes that are suppose to remove makeup effortlessly(and have not passed the test), the Dior face wash actually did pass and complete the task at hand. The cleanser removed the harsh impurities of the day from my face and left my skin feeling so fresh and so clean clean :). This is a scented foaming cleanser, but keep in mind that the fragrance is not overpowering-it smells like you had just been given a unique mix of fresh flowers. My face felt so smooth, refreshed and invigorated after using this product. It was like going to a mini spa-for your face. This cleanser can be used daily at anytime of day to refresh and revive. That being said, I am highly satisfied with the Dior La Mousse Off/On Facial Cleanser and I would recommend this facial cleanser to anyone who wants a soft face with a dewy glow freshness to your skin.
