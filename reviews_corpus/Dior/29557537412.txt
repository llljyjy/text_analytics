I received this product free as part of an incentivized campaign in exchange for my honest review.  The product claims to be a super hydrating, age defying eye cream, designed to eliminate or greatly reduce puffiness and wrinkles around the eyes.  You use it twice a day.  my 50 year old skin is showing signs of sun damage and age, and I also have a skin regimen for morning and night.  I do not use a separate eye cream, usually. I tried this Dior product first in the morning and was impressed with the packaging, the steel applicator tip (cool to the touch) and the hydrating formula,  and lightweight feel of the product. Even more amazing was the performance. The puffiness dissipated within minutes, and the product created a smooth surface for makeup application. With the additional primer I applied, the fine lines and wrinkles under my eyes were no longer visible. The floral scent is very mild.  I did not smell it until i held the product directly under my nose.  I will definitely continue to use this eye serum and will repost with my feelings after continually using for a month.  I highly recommend this product and am currently planning to repurchase it after using it only a few days…it’s that good! Amazing!
