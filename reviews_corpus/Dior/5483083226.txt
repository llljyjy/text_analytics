This is a very interesting product. It is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin but works well as a moisture barrier to protect your skin from the elements. I like to use it on dry areas of my face to lock in moisture after applying cream. Also nice on the neck, decollete and hands. Lightly scented with a delicate floral or herbal scent that is not obtrusive. Good for aging skin. Lightweight and effective
