I received this product complimentary from Influenster. I love it. I’ve been using it a week and can definitely tell a difference in the fine lines. I use an avocado eye cream from Glow Recipe, so I used it after applying this serum. I love the applicator. It’s cool to the touch. I will agree with other reviewers that I feel like too much comes out. If you don’t put enough, then the applicator doesn’t glide. If you put too much, you have to dab in the excess. Overall, I feel like it’s a great product. Great product
