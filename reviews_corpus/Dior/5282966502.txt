What a beautiful product. I’ve been using rx-strengthretinol which makes my skin dry and easily irritated. As a result, some other products I’vetried can burn but this balm is the perfect last step after eye cream and hydrating serum to seal in moisture while feeling soothing and comforting to my sensitive skin. I was expecting it to be fragranced being from Dior but was pleasantly surprised that it has only the slightest scent. The only downside to this balm is the high price - especiallysince there are other fantastic balms out there that offer similar benefits. The skincare equivalent to a cashmere sweater
