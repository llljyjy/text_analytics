I received this cream complimentary from Influenster. What I like about it is it provides instant hydration. My face was soft and dewy all day. It can be used for multiple purposes and I found it softened my dry elbows and hands. I liked how easy it was to throw in my travel bag knowing I could use one product for several areas. Great product but it’s comparable to other well known less expensive products and I’m not convinced there are any benefits related to “recover and repair“ besides what any other reputable cream can provide. Nice product but not exceptional
