This is what I’d like to tell you about this particular serum. It is definitely high end and seems like a very good product and the tip with which you apply the spatula the serum onto your eye is ribbed which is really cool and it definitely helps you spread the serum under your eye very easily and it’s also cooling. So I definitely enjoyed actually putting it on to my face and having it slowly absorb into my skin. The first time I tried it it left a white residue and it took a very long time to get absorbed I would even say it didn’t really actually fully absorb so I was disappointed.I continued using it because it seemed to be doing something and I wanted to see the results and I have to say that after continuous use it felt like my under eye was tightening and getting a little bit later a lot and less puffy. The scent is non-noticeable it’s not strong it just barely has a scent which is great especially for those people who do not like fragrance in their facial skin products. But I do have to say that even in the morning it’s still sticky so I don’t know if that’s how it supposed to be but I thought it supposed to get absorbed into your skin but it does not so it always stays on top of your skin. Overall I think it does something to your under eye and it gets better therefore I will be using it and recommending it to others but just warning them that it is a slightly different product that I am used to wear the serum does not get fully absorbed and sometimes leaves a white residue on top and this is my honest review.
