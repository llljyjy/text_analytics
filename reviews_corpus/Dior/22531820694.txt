I like this moisturizer a lot! It says that ur provides hydration(for up to 48 hours I believe) and I do agree. My only complaint is that I’m pretty sure it said it didn’t have an odor but it does have a camomile scent. I do like how it smells but I think they should probably take that off of the packaging. Other than that, the product itself is very good! Good moisturizer!
