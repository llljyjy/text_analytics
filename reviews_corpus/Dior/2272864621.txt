This cleanser feels extremely luxurious! I like how it lathers on and foams up so it does take off makeup well. The fragrance is really nice and floral but a little too strong for my taste which is why I’m giving 4 stars. It didn’t irritate my skin but I can imagine people with sensitive skin might have issues. Lux cleanser!
