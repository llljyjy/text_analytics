I received this product for free in return for my honest review.All the good stuff:  The packaging is beautiful—a heavy glass bottle and a pump that’s easy to control, so you don’t get too much and waste it.  The lotion is very silky, with a light, pleasant floral fragrance, and has a clean, fresh scent.I have tried many products that all promise to take away wrinkles, but have always been disappointed, with my wrinkles still being exactly the same after use as they were before.  I took a “before” photo, and then used the Capture Totale for the first time 12/15/22.  I took another photo the next day, and I was shocked to see that the crow’s feet around my eyes were markedly reduced! On the 18th, the third day, it was looking even better. I added before and after photos, but they don’t really show how much more luminous and soft my skin looked after using the serum.The not-so-good:It has fragrance and may not appeal to some people. I liked the fragrance, though.It does not dry down right away, and feels a little sticky, even after adding my moisturizer.  I kept finding that one or two stray hairs would be stuck to my cheeks. It is very expensive, and may not be affordable for many people.I did not see any improvement yet in marionette lines or nasolabial folds.Overall:  So far, I really like the serum. It has only been six days, so it’s probably too early to tell, but I will follow up in another week or so.Note: Photo on left is from 12/15, on right is 12/18.
