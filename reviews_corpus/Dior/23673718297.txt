I’ve only been using the Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Serum for 10 days and can already see that some of the fine lines are less visible which given how close I put the camera to my face is impressive. I really like the textured applicator and that the ridged surface is cold which seems to help with any eye puffiness too. The fact that it’s not overly fragranced is a nice bonus for my generally sensitive skin. Silky Smooth
