I’ve always struggled with oily skin but now that I’m getting older I guess I would be considered to have combination skin - the worst of both worlds. My skin is still oily but now I struggle with dry patches as well. This cica repair balm is fantastic for those dry patches. I love that it’s not heavily scented like so many products and it didn’t leave my skin greasy, it was soothing and absorbed well. Soothing and moisturizing without a greasy feel
