I received a free product to try. Loved the texture and the applicator. It wasn’t greasy nor was it thick and heavy like some eye creams. It also didn’t have a strong fragrance. The applicator felt cool and soothing too. I don’t have dark circles or puffiness fortunately, but I do have fine lines. I think this formula may have helped so I’ll be buying another to make sure. Color me impressed somewhat! nan
