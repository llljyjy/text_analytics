This is the perfect multi-use moisturizer to throw in your bag. It’s a great hand, body, and face lotion for convenience. It’s a water based moisturizer which I love because it’s super hydrating and doesn’t leave a greasy film residue. It’s fragrance-free as well, which is great for it being multi-use. If you’re in the market for a new versatile lotion, I’d recommend this! J’adore!
