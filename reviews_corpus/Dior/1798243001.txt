The packaging is very simple but at the same time attractive. Since the tube is wide and unusually slim, it is extremely easy to get the cleanser out of this packaging without having to do a lot of squeezing. You’ll only need a tiny amount each time so the product will last you a long time. I love the consistency of this product and how it transforms into a luxurious, creamy foam once it is mixed with water. The cleanser deeply cleanses the skin and gets rid off make up without having to do a lot of rubbing. A lot of foam cleaners leave my skin feeling dry and tight but not this one! La Mousse cleanses without stripping the skin and leaves my dry skin feeling hydrated and soft!La Mousse Off/ On contains 90% natural origin ingredients which is always a plus in my book but it unfortunately contains fragrance. I don’t mind scented skincare products but the scent of this cleanser is too strong for me. Besides the strong, perfume like scent, I really enjoy using this cleanser. If Dior decides to make an unscented version of this product, I would most definitely purchase it. nan
