What I love about this product is it can be used anywhere on the body.  It’s a great regular moisturizer for the body.  I can put it all over just after my morning shower.  It can be used on especially dry areas which has been great during the winter! It’s thick and scent free so it feels like it’s really soaking in and making a difference with no harm to the skin.  It’s safe for the face so for an extra moisturizing night, it can be applied before bedtime.  The thickness feels like I’m treating my skin to something special! Luxurious, safe and versatile
