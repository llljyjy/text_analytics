I have normal to oily skin so I only used this balm at night or as a mask on days I was at home. It is super moisturising and I really like it. I use it as my last step. I don’t have issues using it with tretinoin. I would definitely buy this when I run out and I have told my friends about it and shared it on my IG stories. It’s that good. I received a sample of this Dior Cica Recover and Repair Multi Use Balm via Influenster. nan
