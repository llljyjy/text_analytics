I tried Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum. As a 45-year-old woman, I am starting to increasingly notice the effects of aging on my skin, especially around my eyes. I have fine lines setting in by my eyes and dark circles from lack of appropriate sleep. After trying Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum for a week, I noticed the fine lines being less noticeable. They arenâ€™t completely gone, but they are definitely harder to see, with a more filled-in appearance. The slightly dark circles I have been getting have also brightened up. I did not have any puffiness, so I cannot say how this serum would affect that. I would continue to purchase Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum if only for its ability to help blur the fine lines around my eyes as I begin mid-life. I would recommend this product to my friends. Helps with fine lines
