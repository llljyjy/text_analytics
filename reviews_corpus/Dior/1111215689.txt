This balm is amazing! Talk about healing softness without being heavy or greasy! In just one night, dry patches on my face were smoother and softer. It worked so well, I used it on my calves that were crazy dry, and it worked there, too! The smell is nice and light - this product is definitely worth every penny! Great Balm!
