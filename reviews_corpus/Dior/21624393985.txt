I have been using the Cica Balm for about a month on my neck and chest.  My neck is starting to get those wrinkles that come with age and this is the perfect moisturizer for that area.  I didnâ€™t care for it on my face, it has a slight smell.  It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin very soft.  I also like it on the top of my hands. Dior Cica Balm
