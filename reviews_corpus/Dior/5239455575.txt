So first off Iâ€™ve notice how less puff my eyes look after using this . Its very hydrating and feels lightweight. Melts right into the skin no heaviness whatsoever.  I hate having to use my fingers so I really love the applicator. It gives a nice cooling effect. Before applying makeup under the eyes this has been a must for me. nan
