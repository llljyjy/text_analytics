I received this complimentary product in exchange for my honest reviewI received this complimentary product in exchange for my honest review. I’m giving this 4 out of 5 stars.1: This eye serum is super lightweight, very fluid, and absorbs very quickly.2: The scent is so delightful! I love how this smells. It’s very fresh and dainty in a light scented lotion type of way, but it’s not irritating on my skin, especially with it being around the eyes.3: The metal applicator tip feels amazing on my skin. The first time I used this product, I used it right out of the box and it was instantly cooling and cold. I will have to remember to try it colder just to see.4: The packaging of the product and the box is pleasing to the eye and it feels good when I hold it. (I’m a sucker for nice packaging). Pretty Nice!
