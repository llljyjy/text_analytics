Totally Amazing & A Keeper. I have Dty Skkn. Every time I wash my hands, face or body it’s lotion time. In the winter 8 have to use oil or gel too. If I don’t it feels like my skin is going to crack. I cover every inch from my forehead to tips of my toes. I use a serum, oil, jelly & face cream at least 2 times a day sometimes 3 to 4. All of those add up to a Hefty Price too. But they are necessarily along with drinking enough water to keep my skin hydrated. Well I was Totally Blown the 1st time I used Cica Recover & Repair Multi-Use Bslm. It’s Thick but not greasy. it’s smells lovely but not too strong and transformed my skin from dull to Glowing. My skin a bit sensitive & I have an allergy to Sulphates. This Balm was Perfect. I used it twice a day & a bit as a Primer before my Foundation. I had a few nights where it was Vold so I put it on a little Heavy. Made my skin feel so soft, moisturized & JUST PLAIN HAPPY. I highly recommend this Awesome Balm To all of You Beautiful Women out there. Your gonna Luv it!!! Makes my Skin Feel So Young & Happy!!
