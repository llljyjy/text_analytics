I was worried this cleanser was going to be heavily fragranced but was surprised with a light and clean smell right off the bat. I have dry skin so some cleansers can leave my skin feeling stripped and even more dry, but this one leaves my face feeling so soft, smooth, and moisturized! It foams up nicely and leaves my skin feeling clean and my pores feeling tight! I also love how much product you get for what you pay for! The bottle is a really nice size compared to some other high end cleansers! I am super impressed with this cleanser and will definitely be purchasing again once I run out! moisturizing and purifying!
