I received this product from Influenster to try and noticed a huge difference just a couple days after using it regularly. The applicator is unique and cooling, and the serum gets to work quickly!! My only qualm is the heavy fragrance. Thankfully it didnâ€™t irritate my eyes or my skin, but I really wish companies would stop adding heavy perfume in makeup and skincare. Great serum! Heavily scented.
