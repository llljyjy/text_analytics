The product itself is good. It’s a lightweight serum that quickly absorbs into the skin. It left my undereyes feeling hydrated which in turn does reduce the appearance of the fine lines that I have under there. It is lightly scented, but nothing that is too overpowering or irritating to the senses. The packaging could use some work.  I feel like I have to use quite a bit of pressure to get some product out.  And the applicator tip seemed too big and wasn’t comfortable to use under my eye.  I opted to squeeze some product on my ring finger and applied it that way. Overall it’s a good product but at the price point it is,  I would choose a different, more Affordable product that has the same results. nan
