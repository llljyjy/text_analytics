This is my new go to balm to hydrate my skin. Diorâ€™s Cica balm is fragrance-free, glides on easily, absorbs quickly, and makes you face feels refreshed without leaving behind residue. You can apply to face, neck, or anywhere that needs TLC. I love it and have been raving about it to everyone. My new go-to balm for skin hydration!
