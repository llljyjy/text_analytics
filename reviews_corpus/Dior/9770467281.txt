This was a great moisturizer. Coincidentally, I was experiencing some serious dryness on my face due to winter weather, and this product saved my skin. After just one application of the Dior Cica Recover and Repair Balm after my regular wash and tone of the face, those dry patches were thoroughly moisturized and that moisture felt locked in. The next morning, there was barely any dryness left! 2 days later, my skin is glowing and hydrated with no dry patches to be seen!The texture of this product was thick, comparable to the La Mer Cr√®me de la Mer moisturizer but in a bottle instead of a jar. And it has no parabens, formaldehydes, sulfates, or phthalates! All in all, a great moisturizer for intense and lasting hydration. Great Hydrating Moisturizer
