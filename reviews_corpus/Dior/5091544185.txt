I received this product complimentary from Influenster for my honest review. I was shocked to receive a full sized product. So I feel I am able to give a pretty decent review. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks I do notice a difference in my wrinkles, but they are still there. I like the concept of the roller, I’m just not sure if it’s better than patting it on.  You’ll definitely need to use it consistently to notice the difference. I did not get any irritation from this cream. All in all this is a great product and I would highly recommend. nan
