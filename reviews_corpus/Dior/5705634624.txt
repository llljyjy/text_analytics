I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review from Influenster. The eye serum is a medium weight thickness that isn’t runny or too creamy and applies with a smooth oval metal applicator. The applicator feels nice on the skin but is a bit awkward to fit in the tear duct/inner corner area. The serum feels nice and hydrating but pretty sticky if you apply to the eye lids.  I feel like my under eyes look a bit plumper and brighter but nothing dramatically improved and the affects seem pretty temporary. I don’t notice my fine lines being diminished after use or over time and I’ve tested this product nightly for about a month. Maybe it would be more noticeable if I had more defined wrinkles but for the price, there’s better more affordable options out there. Okay but nothing special
