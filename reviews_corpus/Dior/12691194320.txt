This is a good cleanser but not sure how accurate it is about removing pollution from your skin. Its just a typical cleanser with a nice fragrance. It says it is hydrating but right after I rinsed and patted my face dry I immediately saw the dryness in my skin. Overall nice cleanser but didnâ€™t wow me decent cleanser
