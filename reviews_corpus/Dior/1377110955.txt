I really like this simple cleanser. It has a pleasant scent, great lather, washes off easily, and doesn’t leave the skin feeling dry. I’ve been using this cleanser for about 2 weeks now and I haven’t noticed any difference in the quality of my skin, which is actually a good thing. I probably won’t repurchase this due to the price but it was nice to try some luxury skincare. nan
