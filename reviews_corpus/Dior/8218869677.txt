I like this cica multi-use balm but I don’t love it. It does the job well of calming and hydrating the skin, however, I don’t think it’s worth the price tag. I think I would reach for other high end skincare products first. It does hydrate and soothe the skin nicely, and I enjoy using it as the last step in my nighttime skincare routine. I apply a dime sized amount to my face and neck to lock in moisture. It worked well in calming my skin after have sensitivity due to retinol. I don’t apply too much because the balm texture can become sticky if too much product is applied. I also like using it as a mask, applying a thick layer for 10 mins then wiping away the excess. Since it is Dior skincare, I wish there was a nice scent to the product for more of a luxurious experience. nan
