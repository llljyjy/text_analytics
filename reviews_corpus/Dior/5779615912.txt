I’ve received this product complementary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  I’ve never tried Dior skin care product and this face wash was pretty good experience.  First, I got an inch of this paste and lathered onto my face.  And after a while of gentle massage, the foam turned into a softest foam/bubble.  It’s like you don’t need to touch the skin to wash the face because the foam is so fluffy and thick.  However, I did not notice the moisture after rinsing it off.  Also, it has pretty strong scent of flower, so if you have even the slightest sensitivity to scented product, you might want to skip this.  It did cleanse my skin pretty well though. nan
