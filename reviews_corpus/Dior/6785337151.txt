It’s hard to find a face wash that effectively cleanses your skin without leaving it feeling stripped and dry, while most hydrating cleansers don’t feel like they clean very well and leave a film on my skin. This cleanser is different. The consistency is unique. It is a little bit like a cream and foaming cleanser in one. It thoroughly cleanses my skin without stripping it and there was no heavy residue left after rinsing. My skin feels hydrated and comfortable after use. I like that it’s composed of 90% natural origin ingredients. I also like the claims that it removes 99% of pollution particles and reduces the effects of pollution by half. It makes me feel like I’m getting added benefits on top of just cleansing my skin. Though it does have a fragrance, it’s not overpowering and disappears shortly after you rinse your face. The only con I have is the added fragrance which I try to avoid in my skin care because it can be irritating. The scent doesn’t bother me any but I would prefer it being fragrance free. Otherwise this is a very nice cleanser that leaves my skin feeling clean and comfortable after use. Nice Cleanser
