I personally loved this cleanser! My first Dior skincare product and I’m impressed with how luxurious it feels. It’s soft and has a great lather. The one thing that may be a downside for some is how heavily fragranced it is. It’s the strongest smelling cleanser I’ve ever used, like straight up perfume. I don’t mind it, especially since it makes my skin feel nice. Luxurious! Worth the splurge!
