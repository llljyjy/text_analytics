I’ve enjoyed using this cleanser. It foams nice, my skin feels nice and clean without feeling stripped, and it smells nice. My skin looked glowy that night after use, as I mostly used it at night. However, that scent is also  strong, so I would advise to steer clear if you’re sensitive to smell. It’s a floral kind of scent and it feels and smells very luxurious. However, it’s not something I’d probably repurchase, especially not for close to $50 when there’s other products that work just as well for a fraction of the price. If I was going to pay so much for a cleanser, it needs to be something truly special. I’m rating four stars because it is a very nice product, and I’ll enjoy using it until I run out, but it’s not a must have product for me. The price is just too much for what it is. nan
