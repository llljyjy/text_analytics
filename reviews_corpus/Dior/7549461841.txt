I love the Dior foaming cleanser. I have tried a many face cleansers and have always gone back to two out of the many that I have tried, including the drunk elephant bestie number 9 cleanser and the Clinique cleanser. I have not been able to find any that I like better or even the same for that matter. That was until I tried this product. I love the consistency of the cleanser and it leaves my face feeling clean and smooth. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice high quality cleanser that is gentle but does a great job. The simple packaging is jut the icing on the cake for this product. I love how it looks sitting on my counter. Excellent Product!
