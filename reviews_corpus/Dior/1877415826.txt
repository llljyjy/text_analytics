This was another win for the Dior brand.  The face wash came securely packaged. Texture was between a foamy mousse and a cream, and was really smooth. It “lathered“ up nicely; a little goes a long way.  I didn’t find the scent to be too strong, but it was definitely noticeable while washing my face.  Both my mom (mature skin) and I (combination skin) felt the wash left our skin soft and moisturized.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants soft, moisturized skin. Left my face soft!
