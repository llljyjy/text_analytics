As you can see in the photo, I waited until I tried a decent amount of this product before writing my review. I have incredibly dry skin and am always on the lookout for a moisturizer that will be nourishing without feeling too thick and sticky. This balm does just that! I’m a big fan of cica/ tiger grass for targeting redness, and I would say this product falls somewhere in between Dr. Jart’s Cicapair Calming Gel Cream and Tiger Grass Cream in terms of thickness and moisture level - i.e. richer than the gel cream but not as thick as the tiger grass cream. This product strikes the right balance while calming my skin and leaving my skin moisturized. The price point is a bit steep but that’s to be expected from a Dior skincare product. I’d say if you’re on a a tighter budget, the Dr. Jart products more or less do the same thing, but if you can shell out the extra dollars, this feels like a slightly optimized version of the Dr. Jart Cicapair line. Great all year round for dry skin
