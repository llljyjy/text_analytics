This product felt very nice on my skin. It seemed to have a lot of perfume in the product. The smell is strong to me at least. I donâ€™t hate it though and it did not break me out. It left my face feeling very clean. I would recommend this product for anyone who loves a luxury feel. Luxury Skincare!
