I tend to have dry skin so you can imagine how exited I was to try something new from one of my favorite skincare and cosmetic company’s. I love that this is a multi-use moisturizer as well as being paraben free. I’ve used it both AM and PM since receiving it and I love its rich and creamy texture. I especially like it for my neck, chest and forearms. I feel like these areas never get enough attention and usually just get whatever moisturizer is left on my hands from my face or the rest of my body. So to be able to put something this luxurious and effective on them is great. I’ve noticed much more supple skin in these areas as well as my face, and all seem to hold the moisture that this balm provides all day long. A total win in my book. I will be replacing this tube as soon as mine runs out! #Dior #Influenster This Dior Multi-Use Balm is the BOMB!!
