Iâ€™m really loving this serum! It is thin and absorbs into the skin quickly leaving the skin more plump. The best part is the metal applicator which is cooling and helps de puff the eyes. You have to make sure you add enough serum or the applicator will not glide easily. But overall, I highly recommend! loving it so far
