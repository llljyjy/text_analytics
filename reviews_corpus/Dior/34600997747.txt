I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster. This balm is so luxurious feeling, and moisturizes so well. I have mildly sensitive skin and I was left with no rashes or breakouts. I have mostly used it on my hands and face, but I also tried applying it to my legs and arms and it moisturized just as well. I really reccomend this product, especially if you have oily skin or combination skin like me, as it leaves no oily residue behind and fully absorbs into the skin. I would 100% purchase this product again. My new go-to moisturizer
