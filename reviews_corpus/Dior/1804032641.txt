So far I am loving this cleanser. It is creamy and foams up very nicely. It has a pleasant nice scent to it which I like. The scent is very light and disappears Soon as you splash your face with water and rinse. I love the tube as it’s easy to get the product out.  Face don’t feel stripped at all afterwards. I use this with the Dior Life line and have seen so far great results. Liking it better than my Chanel skincare I was using prior. Oh and I paid for the item with my own money so this review is of my own. Loving this cleanser
