I live in an area with a windy harsh winter climate .I love how protected and moist my face felt my face felt after  using Cica-Reparatuer  cream . It goes on smoothly and hydrates skin without a greasy look .The cream is a medium consistency and I didn’t notice a scent .I’ve also applied it to my decollate area and it hydrates the thinner skin very well . The product is a bit pricey,but you do get 75ml of cream which is a nice amount and a little does go a long way.I am not sure how this product would work in the summer months as it may be too heavy Fragile Skin feels protected
