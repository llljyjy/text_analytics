I received this product for free on Influenster and I can’t say I was a fan. For 2 weeks I used it and it made my skin break out and feel incredibly dry. I wanted to love it but I just didn’t, although maybe my sensitive skin wasn’t the best contender for a product with fragrance like this. The smell and consistency is nice though. Just too much for my skin; if you don’t have sensitive skin on your face it may be worth your while. Dior cleanser - made me breakout
