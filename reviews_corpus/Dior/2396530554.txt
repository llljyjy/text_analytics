After using this for the past few weeks, I have really enjoyed it. I love the applicator and how well the product absorbs into my eye area. I have sensitive eyes and this didn’t cause any stinging. I didn’t mind the smell and the texture is great. I didn’t notice extreme results, but my eyes always looked brighter after immediate use and I do see some improvement overall. nan
