So I wear Estée Lauder Double Wear foundation every day and need a good cleanser to take all of it off. I normally start with a cleansing oil (DHC) and then double cleanse with Vanicream. Even doing that still leaves some foundation on my skin so I have to wipe off the remaining foundation on my skin. Since starting to use this Dior cleanser, I still use a cleansing oil for the first step of my nighttime routine, but I’ve noticed I don’t need to wipe of remaining foundation leftover after using the Dior cleanser. I only wish there was a smaller travel version I could take with me on trips. Better Than Expected
