I really wish it didn’t have the fragrance that it does, especially being a product for near the eyes. The smell does seem to dissipate however I found it to make my eye area feel quite itchy. Otherwise the product went on nice and absorbed quickly. Only time will tell if it works. At the $80 price point though I don’t believe it is worth the money. The ingredients aren’t that remarkable and there are definitely better more affordable options. Reaction?
