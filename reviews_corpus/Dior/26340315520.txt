This was part of a promotion from Influenster. It’s so cool how I got to review this! This product is light and airy on your skin and has a slight floral fragrance. I use a small amount usually a dime or a quarter if I have a full face makeup. Aftermath of using it my skin wills tighter softer and smoother. I had issues with bumps on my forehead and it helped lessen it. I recommend it if you want a cleanser that doesn’t strip your skin. nan
