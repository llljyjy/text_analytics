I love this Cleanser. It’s a thick creamy mousse out of the bottle but lathers into a nice foam. The foam helps to lift and wash away dirt and other impurities. It does a good job of removing left over makeup and mascara too. It has a nice scent and also makes your face feel soft and hydrated. I look forward to washing my face  morning and night! I usually use Cerave Hydrating Cream to Foam Cleanser but it’s going to be hard going back to it. I highly recommend trying this Cleanser! Love this Cleanser!
