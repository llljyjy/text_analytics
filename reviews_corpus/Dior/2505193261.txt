Overall this is a really nice luxury cleanser. A little goes a very long way and foams up really nicely. My skin felt clean without feeling stripped. It didn’t do a great job at removing my eye makeup but when used with a cleansing balm first it worked well. It also has a pretty strong floral scent. It doesn’t linger too long but if scent bothers you I would skip this. Thank you Influenster for sending me this to review. luxurious
