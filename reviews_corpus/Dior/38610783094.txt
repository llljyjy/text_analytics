I received this product for free from Influenster and Dior in return for my honest review. I am giving this product four stars just for the reasoning that I feel like it is difficult to apply at times. I feel like sometimes the bottle is too hard to squeeze out product and other times I feel like I barley squeeze and way to much product comes out. I just feellike you never know what you will get when you squeeze. That may just be me though. This product is beautifully packaged. The ridges in the applicator make for a pleasant application to the eye. The serum itself is lightweight and has a nice faint fragrance to it. Once the serum is applied it is a little tacky on the eyes but not in a bad sticky type way. It didn’t take but a week for me to see results using this serum. I have found that my puffiness has went down. My dark circles are less noticeable that even my husband said that I look more rested than before. I feel like the fine lines under my eyes are still noticeable but are not as deep so now my makeup isn’t settling as bad. I feel like over all my eyes have been rejuvenated. If you are looking for a serum that works well quickly and don’t mind the price or the way it is dispensed, then I would defiantly recommend this product to you! Quick Results!
