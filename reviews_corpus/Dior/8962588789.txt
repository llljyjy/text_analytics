I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. This is a lovely product and works well as a hand cream. I have not tried it on my face because I have combination skin and this seems too thick of a consistency for me. I love that there is absolutely no fragrance! It keeps my hands supple and soft. I took off a star, though, because $60 is just too much for what I would just this for. Great, but pricey!
