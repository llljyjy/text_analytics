The Dior Capture Totale Cell Energy Super Potent Eye Serum is different than other eye serums I’ve used, but in a good way. First off is the applicator, it’s ridged metal, which has a cooling and massaging affect when applying the serum. The serum itself it much more lightweight than I was expecting, it’s very thin, but that gives it the benefit of sinking into the skin quickly and easily. It didn’t leave behind a sticky feeling and after it was absorbed into the skin, I noticed a cooling, almost energizing feeling. I applied it morning and night as per the instructions on the packaging. It sat well under my makeup, didn’t interfere with my other skincare and didn’t didn’t cause any irritation. After first use the skin under my eyes did feel smoother, more hydrated and firmer. After over a month of continued usage, I have seen a notable difference. The skin under my eyes appears and feels smoother, firmer, less puffy and more awake. I didn’t really have dark circles under my eyes but I think I do notice less hints of dark circles. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it is quite heavily fragranced, but thankfully it’s too noticable after a minute or two. I definitely recommend trying it, it’s pricey but worth it. Perfect but for the fragrance!
