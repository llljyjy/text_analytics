Super excited to try this serum! I love that it is in a tube with a built in applicator. I put it in my fridge and when I use the metal tip, it’s nice and cooling. The serum itself is lightweight and it absorbs quickly but you can only spread it with the applicator tip. I have to manually tap it in after sweeping it on. And make sure you clean or wipe off the tip after each use. The serum does build up in the crevices and it’s not sanitary. I do think my eyes look brighter and my dark circles don’t show as much but they’re still there. For those who have dry skin, you will still need eye cream after. Lightweight and absorbs easily
