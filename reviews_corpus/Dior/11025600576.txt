I have really enjoyed this product! I received a complementary bottle for reviewing purposes and I have really enjoyed the multipurpose power of this product. Especially in the winter, it has been so much easier to only carry around one product for both my face and body. The cream is thick and does not have an overwhelming smell. Great!
