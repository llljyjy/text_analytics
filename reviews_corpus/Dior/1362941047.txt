Overall it’s a decent cleanser.   A little product goes a long way.   It does have a mild scent that I can’t place, but it’s not off putting. I didn’t do a great job of removing all of my make up and mascara.  This would probably be best used in a double cleansing routine.  I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. nan
