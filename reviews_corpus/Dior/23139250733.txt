I received this product for complimentary testing purposes in exchange for my honest review. With that done, let me tell you just how much I love this balm! It’s non-greasy and applies very easily. That is only the beginning,  though. The real magic happens after application when the skin just absorbs all of that moisture leaving it feeling baby soft and oh so smooth. I was amazed at how soft my face felt after my first use.There is absolutely no scent to this product, so it won’t be competing with any perfume you might wish to wear, and it did not cause any adverse reaction to my sensitive skin. I felt my face, now I'm a believer!
