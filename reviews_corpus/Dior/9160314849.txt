This is beautiful from the formula to the packaging. Love the cooling metal applicator! After continued use, it left my undereye skin firm, soft and brightened, as soon as the first week!  This is a great addition to my skin routine, though I wish it didn’t require an additional eye cream. I really enjoyed using it, but I can’t see myself spending this kind of coin without a huge discount. Loved! But need sale to justify price
