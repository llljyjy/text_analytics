I have extremely sensitive eye skin, to the point where I get inflammation if a product has drying ingredients. When I read the ingredients and saw alcohol listed, I was worried, but gave it a try for 2 weeks. My eyes have never looked and felt better. I notice a visible difference when applying my under eye concealer, my skin is smoother and requires less product to cover my dark circles. My eyelid skin is especially sensitive and it’s plump and hydrated. A little goes a long way, one tube will definitely last me through the end of the year. I was skeptical of fashion brand skincare lines bc the ones I’ve tried in the past were wastes, but Dior has figured it out. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because for this price it should have more potent anti-wrinkle and skin lightening ingredients too, but it doesn’t. It’s primarily for hydrating, smoothing, and firming. I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Dior in exchange for my honest opinion. nan
