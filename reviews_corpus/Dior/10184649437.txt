So the facewash itself is great. It’s foamy, you don’t need a ton to cover your face, it cleans very well, and doesn’t leave my face feeling dry.  Great, right? Except the perfume smell is SO STRONG. Like, it’s way overpowering. So much so that it gave me a headache and I could smell it through my very congested nose while sick. I used this for a week, and didn’t have any issues with the results of the product (like drying, for example), but couldn’t stand the smell. It’s literally like pouring a bottle of perfume on your face.  Would use and purchase if it wasn’t for that. If you don’t mind/like strong perfume smells on your face, it would be a great product. I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Smell is too strong!
