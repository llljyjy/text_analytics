I’ll start off by saying I’m 30 y/o, my main aging so far is in the eye area (fine lines under the eye, darkness, lids not as taught as they once were) I thought this was a really elegant eye cream formula that’s a joy to use, good execution of the cooling metal applicator. The texture is light enough you could layer a richer eye cream on top at night time but I personally didn’t find it necessary as this was plenty hydrating on its own. However it’s currently August and I may feel differently during the winter time. Definitely noticed softening of the lines around my eye within I would say a week or two. Hydration instantly. The applicator feels great in the morning and I could see it doing a really good job at reducing puffiness although I don’t have a ton of that to speak on. Next time I have a good cry I’ll probably try it out haha. Dark circles I never notice much difference with eye creams but I think there was a good optical brightening effect which is nice for day time especially if you don’t wear concealer. Speaking of which my makeup applied beautifully over top of this, no creasing, no problems blending. Overall definitely worth the money if you’re looking for something with this kind of texture and applicator! nan
