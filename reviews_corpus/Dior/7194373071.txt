This feels so luxurious. There is a strong floral fragrance but I personally do not mind it. The face wash foams very easily and doesn’t require much to clean the face. Also, it left my skin feeling so smooth and moisturized afterwards. I’ve been dealing with super dry/flaky skin and I was surprised it did not worsen it. The instructions say not to get it close to your eyes which I accidentally did and I can say it BURNS. It’s a great cleanser otherwise!! I would highly recommend. So good for dry skin!
