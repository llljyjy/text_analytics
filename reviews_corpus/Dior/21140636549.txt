I really like this wash! It does not dry out my skin and the gentle scent is a plus. My face feels refreshed after using this and does not feel stripped. I love the texture of it and how moisturizing it feels while I’m washing my face. I can use this daily and it’s effective in removing the oils and sunscreen of the day. Gentle and refreshing!
