I’ve been so pleased with this eye serum after several weeks of use. I’m about to turn 40, and have some fine lines, dark circles and occasional puffiness. But I also have sensitive skin that is often irritated by eye products. This Dior serum tackles my issues but has not caused any stinging or redness, with the exception of one time when my eyes were already a bit irritated. In time, I’ve noticed that my lines are less noticeable and I’m seeing less discoloration and puffiness. The formula is lightweight and absorbs quickly. It moisturizes and gives me a glow without greasiness. Lovely, subtle scent and a generous amount vs the typical .5 oz. Nice! Effective but gentle
