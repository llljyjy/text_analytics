I am reviewing Cica-recover and repair  by @Dior. I was given this product for free in exchange for my honest review with @Influenster.  I live in New York and my hands and face tend to get painfully dry. The first thing I noticed was that you didnâ€™t need a lot to take the dryness away. I also noticed IMMEDIATELY was there was no oily residue. I mean you could rub it in and go! I used this product on my hands twice daily, as the directions stated. I could not only see a difference, I could feel a difference as well. When I applied it to my combination skin, my skin just drank it up! I would definitely recommend using this product to bring your beautiful, soft and supple skin back! Excellent product
