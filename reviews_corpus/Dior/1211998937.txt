This eye serum is great! I love the applicator, which gives the eye area a bit of a massage. It has a nice, cooling effect as well, which feels great during application. It absorbs well and doesn’t leave residue on the skin. Only a little bit is needed at a time, so the bottle should last a long time! However, it is definitely pricey for an eye serum, depending on what you usually buy. My eyes looked more refreshed, didn’t have as much of a dark circle look, and looked like the skin around the eyes was a bit plumper. Would definitely recommend if you’re looking for a high-end eye serum to make your eye area look younger! nan
