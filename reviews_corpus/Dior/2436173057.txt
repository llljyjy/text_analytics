Love this creme. I’ve used it as day/night creme but I really like it for dry patches on my elbows, knees and it’s amazing for your hands. Makes your skin feel and look very hydrated.  Highly recommend trying it.  I don’t have sensitive skin. Not much of a scent to it. My first Dior product  I’ve ever tried. nan
