This is a very lovely cleanser! It foams up extremely well and really feels like it gets everything off of my face without stripping my skin. It was easy to take off my makeup using this as well! The after effect on your skin after using this product is something Iâ€™ve never experienced - my skin is moisturized and soothed, which is extremely welcome as my face typically feels very dry or stripped after washing with some cleansers! The only thing to be aware of is that the cleanser does have a scent to it. I do not mind this too much as it is a wash off product, but I do understand that some have sensitivities to scents in skincare products and prefer ones without a scent in them. The scent is very nice though, just a bit strong! I do also wish the price point was a bit lower, but you are paying for the brand name of Dior so I understand that! It is quite a big bottle however so it should last an extremely long time. Great moisturizing cleanser!
