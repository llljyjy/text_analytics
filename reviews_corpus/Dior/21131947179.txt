I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing and reviewing purposes. I really like the serum itself. It feels nice on my skin and I like the way it feels. I haven’t used it long enough to notice a difference yet so I can’t comment on that. I will say my one complaint is the applicator. I find it difficult to squeeze and use but other than that it’s fantastic. This is a nice serum
