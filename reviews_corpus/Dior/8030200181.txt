I received this as a free sample to test out and see what magic it holds…WELL…let me tell you!  Yes it is a bit pricy BUT it is well worth it!  I have combo skin and this was so wonderful under my dry eyes!!!  I started seeing results in about a week but right away it feels so nice on my skin.  The applicator tip is cooling because it’s metal and the serum sinks right in!  No greasy left over!!!  I saw results about the same time.  My under eyes were way less puffy and my dark circles lightened up in days!  I will most likely be purchasing this when I run out and that says alot because I HATE spending big bucks on products but ladies and gentlemen this is magic in a bottle!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Was pleasantly surprised!!!
