The Dior OFF/ON Foaming Cleanser works great to soften my mature skin that is naturally dry! The two in one benefits of removing dirt and impurities then softening and protecting the skin from pollutants is awesome! The water lily is a nice benefit, the scent is different, Iâ€™m still on the fence whether I like it or not but I was definitely impressed with my skin softness after about a week of using! I plan to continue using and I was incentivized for trying! Effective!
