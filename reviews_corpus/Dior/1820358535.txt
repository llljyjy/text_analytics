At first I wasn’t a fan of it because it smelled like paint or glue to me but after rubbing it on my skin I could smell the chamomile. This balm is however moisturizing without feeling too thick, after application my skin feels smooth without feeling like I put on thick lotion. I do find that it’s a bit too pricey to use all over my body so I would just limit it to my face and hands. Overall I find it okay, I like that it’s formulated without synthetic fragrances but just not worth the price. nan
