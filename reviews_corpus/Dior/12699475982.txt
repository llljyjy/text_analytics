This face was from Dior is nice! I think it does a good job washing the dirt and makeup off my skin. It suds’ up really nice and you don’t have to use much of it to get in a good lather! It’s not rough on my skin either! I feel like you get a good amount for the value. My only problems with the product are that it makes my skin feel a bit dry afterwards, but I haven’t noticed super increases dryness, and it has a weird baby powder smell. As well as the design of the bottle. When you lay it down while you wash your face sometimes it drips out and wastes some. Maybe they could change the design of the bottle to have both sides be flat that could be good! Overall it’s a good product and I really like it! I feel like it really does get stuff out of my pores. Will likely purchase! I was sent this product from influnester to try and give my honest feedback of. Pretty impressed!
