I love trying high end face washes because their packaging always seem so luxe. A little goes a long way for this Dior facial cleanser. I use it in the shower and it lathers and foams really well. It has a Dior floral smell so if you are sensitive to scents this may not work for you. It definitely does a good job breaking down residual makeup. Once I dry my face, it doesn’t leave it super dry and has a nice shine to it. I would say this is a decent cleanser, but nothing too wow where I will go back to buying it. I’ll stick with my Tatcha rice cleanser. nan
