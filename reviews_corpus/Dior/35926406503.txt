I received this product to try for my opinion.  I usually use Clinique cleanser but was excited to try this cleanser.  I love the fact that itâ€™s composed of 90% natural origin ingredients.  This felt light and silky on my skin and smelled like water Lilies.  It left my skin feeling clean and very hydrated for hours after using it.  I would suggest this product to anyone who like hydrating their skin for hours as well as fragrance.  The fragrance lasted for hours so if you are sensitive it might not be the product for you. Beautiful smelling, completely hydrating cleanser
