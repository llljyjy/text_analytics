I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review and let me tell you, if I had paid $60 for this cream I would’ve been returning. I love the minimalistic bottle design, good size, fits in all of my purses. It does have like a really clean scent that you can bearly notice and I like that. BUT I just feel that it doesn’t work for dryness. I have really dry hands and when I put it in I do feel my skin soft but it’s like a glove sensation because if I move my hand I still can feel the dryness underneath. WEIRD. This is perfect just for the daily use like any other cream but fancier and maybe TO PREVENT dryness. You can use it on top of you moisturizer. TO PREVENT DRYNESS on top of your routine.
