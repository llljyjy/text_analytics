I normally use foaming face washes or oils. I was excited about trying Dior’s Off/On cleanser with natural ingredients. I used a small amount , the product is a creamy consistency and feels emollient. The small amount I used lathered well for full face and neck. Rinsed cleaned leaving my skin feeling soft and not taunt. I have sensitive skin with some redness and dry patches. Dior’s cleanser did NOT cause any irritation or breakouts. The only thing I wasn’t a fan of was the fragrance. I just haven’t used products with fragrance for a long time, so that was different for me. It isn’t bad and Im sure many will love it. Im definitely going to continue to use this cleanser. The price is great for the amount of products as I said only a little amount is needed. Great Emollient Cleanser!
