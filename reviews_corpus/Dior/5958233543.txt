I received this product complimentary from influenster for my honest review of this product. This product is needed for those with sensitive skin or those with irritations to fragrances. My skin is not sensitive and it is predominantly dry.  For those of us that have their hands in water most of the time, like I do because I work in a hospital, this is fantastic in keeping my hands moist after each wash. I thought this might be good for my heels and cuticles, but this did not help with these problem areas. This did well for the cold and hot days, but did not get that moisture to last more that 24 hours. I did use this product as a spot treatment on my face, because of a pimple that was beginning to scar. I put this on the scab of the scar on my face for two days. After the first day the peeling skin was gone. The second day the soreness of the pimple was gone and I did not have a super dark hyperpigmentation mark. The Cica Recover &Repair Multi-Use Balm comes in this convenient packaging where you can throw it in your the purse and go. The balm itself has a nice consistency to me, it is not to thick, creamy, and a little bit goes a long way.  I typically like products creams with a fragrance, but you have those moments when you don’t want or need a fragrance. If I  don’t have a fragrance that matches my scent of the day I just added the scent into the balm. This did not mess with the integrity of the product. I would recommend this product and I will purchase this product as a spot treatment. Lux on the go
