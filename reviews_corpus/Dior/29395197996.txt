DIOR CICA BALM FTW!!!  Between our super dry winters, and my journey into menopause.... the skin on my face isn’t the same.  Dry, flaky, even feels different.  Influenster sent me Dior Cica balm in exchange for my honest review.  Well to be honest, I wasn’t very hopeful.  I’ve tried 3 other high end creams, to no avail.  I’ve applied Dior Cica balm before bed, and in the am.  My face already looks and feels better.  The bags under my eyes are starting to disappear.  My face just looks healthy again. I highly recommend this balm, and it works for all skin types, even sensitive skin.  Dior just made a friend for life❤️ Michigan winter is wrecking havoc on my skin.
