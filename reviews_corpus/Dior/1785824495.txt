Took about a couple of weeks to see some results. I loveeee how I can no longer see any dark circles. The puffiness is starting to disappear. I donâ€™t look as tired. My eyes definitely brightened up. I love using the applicator. There are different techniques to help reduce puffiness and lifting the eyes, which helped a lot. I highly recommend! nan
