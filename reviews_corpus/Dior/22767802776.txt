This multipurpose balm is amazing I love the fact that is is gentle and extremely moisturizing. This balm is very hydrating and helps with fine lines and wrinkles it is wonderful for your face and neck, but I also love the fact that I can use it on my hands and it makes them look fabulous. This is not just a face balm you can use it anywhere you look dry. Itâ€™s wonderful on dry cracked feet as well I will definitely buy this balm again in the future and recommend this too my friends and family. Best multipurpose balm
