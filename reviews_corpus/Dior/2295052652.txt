Very hydrating and no fragrance which makes it a great all purpose cream. I used it on my cuticles which have been super dry. It really made a difference! I’ve also used it on my face when some areas felt dry and had positive results. I was very pleasantly surprised at what a great cream this is. The only negative is the price is a bit steep in my opinion; I doubt I’d pay $60 for it. Very hydrating
