The product is overall, easy to apply and rather convenient given its design. The applicator is pretty neat but short lived, considering it’s supposed to feel nice and cool since it’s metal but it quickly warms up after finishing one eye. Prior to using this specific product, my eyes were in decent condition as I already had a product I was using prior to receiving this. Not puffy or dark, but just some little lines here and there. I stopped using my daily eye creams and just used the Dior product once in the AM and once in the PM so I can get a true review of the effects. The results were very slight for me personally- again, I don’t have a lot of wrinkles or eye issues, just some light wrinkles. I began seeing results after 2 consecutive weeks of use, the lines became more faint than they were when I first started using this product. By week 3 and 4, there was minimal change and I was okay with that. For $80, it’s a steep price - I saw similar results for a product that runs $54. The trick to these eye creams is that when you do stop using it, the lines return so it’s not a permanent solution and I saw this when I forgot to pack this during vacation to Aruba for a week. When I returned the same results came back. Overall, I would recommend if you want something luxurious. It does what it says, but only as long as you continue to use the product. Maybe I need to finish the entire bottle before permanent results, however I haven’t gotten to that point yet. Worth it, if you have the budget for it.
