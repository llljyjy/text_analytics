I’ve been using this cream on my face. I’ve had some dryness and redness on my face, since using this product the dryness and redness has seem to diminished. It was my first time trying to product so I wasn’t sure what to expect from the cream. The cream didn’t dry out my skin or cause any irritation. I am always careful when trying out a new skin product. This Dior cream has been very helpful. In my opinion, it has helped me a bit. Not sure if it’s the best in the market but it has definitely been helpful. I think you should give it a try at least once and finish the product in order to determine if it’s worth repurchasing. I am still half way. So I’ll definitely update once I am done with using the full product. nan
