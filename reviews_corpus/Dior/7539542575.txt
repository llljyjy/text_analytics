I received this product for an honest review.  This product is fantastic to use!  It’s lightweight, cream pawed but is not thick, has a clean scent to it that’s not overpowering, & seems to be working.  I have only used it for a week and can see some improvement in forehead lines.  I’m going to continue to use it to see what more it can do.   Then I can say for sure, how well it’s working on my face & neck.  If ur looking for a light weight product to use at night, I would put this into ur rotation! A skincare must have!
