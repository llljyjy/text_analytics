This eye serum is great! I like the light scent, it’s not too strong. I love the flexible head and cold applicator. I have genetic dark circles, so nothing gets rid of them, but I do notice a difference after using this serum. My under eye appears smoother and it doesn’t feel like I’ve put anything on. You don’t need a lot, which is nice. I would definitely put this on my list of favorite eye serums! nan
