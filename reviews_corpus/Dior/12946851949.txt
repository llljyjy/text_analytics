I received this complimentary gift from Influenster to try out, and was super excited to receive it. Iâ€™ve never tried Dior skincare before. This face wash has a really good consistency and lathers so nicely, it felt super soft on my skin. However, I thought the scent was a little strong, almost like a cologne. I have pretty sensitive skin, but this face wash was still very gentle on my dry skin. Amazing consistency - sensitive dry skin approved
