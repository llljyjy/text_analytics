I have combination skin. I tend to shy away from any sort of product that mentions hydration. But this is a game changer for me! I started using it as a spot treatment on certain areas of my face and hands… but I quickly stated using it as a morning and evening treatment! I have sensitive skin, and often have break outs when using a new product, but not with is balm. It’s a regular in my routine now! Awesome product!
