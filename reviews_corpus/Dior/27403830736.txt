I really liked using the Dior Recover and Repair Balm. I used it both on my face as a moisturizer as well as on my hands for a lotion. I felt as though it was absorbed by my face well and it left my hands nice and moisturized. The texture is nice and very smooth. it is fairly unscented so Iâ€™m sure it would be good for sensitive skin as well. nan
