I started using this product right away to help me reduce my puffy eyes. I definitely need some help with decreasing the under eye area. I have some tought nights and early mornings so using this Eye Serum has been a game changer in my skin care routine. So far I can see results that I hadnâ€™t seen before. My dark circles are there but not as defined as they used to be. I like that I can use this in my morning and night skin care routine. The application tip make the process and smooth one and very easy to do. I am completely shook by this Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum and I fully recommend this to everyone. This is going to be one of those products that will have to be a forever one in my skin care kit. I'm shook and loving it.
