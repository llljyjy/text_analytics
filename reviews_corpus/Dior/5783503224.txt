I received this product in exchange for my honest review:This multi-use moisturizer from Dior, and I love it as a daily moisturizer for my face or as a night cream. Finally a product that delivers results! The balm is rich and nourishing, but is not heavy & sinks into the skin very well. use it on my face and neck .The balm looks great under makeup, and doesn’t “ball“ like some other moisturizers that I have used.This balm is deeply hydrating, but doesn’t feel tacky or sticky. Once it had dried, it literally felt like a silk veil was on face still giving me continuous moisturizing effects, leaving my skin velvety soft. This product has a very light fragrance (almost none at all) but no irritation and no clogged pores.I have aging dry skin and live in a state where the weather is crazy..It could 80 one day and freezing ice the next. .As a revitalizing face mask I apply a thin layer of the mask on the face. Left it on for 10 minutes, then used my facial roller to massage the product of my face. What an at home spa experience!The chamomile seemed to soothe and reduce the redness on skin after I dermobladed, and again there was no breakouts or irritation. I love it as a daily moisturizer for my face or as a night cream, and will purchase this product out of pocket!!#voxbox#influencer #dior#diorcircarecoverybalm#sephora A Product That WORKS!
