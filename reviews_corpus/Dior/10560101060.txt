I received this product complimentary of influenster for my honest review. I thought this was a good cleanser! I liked the consistency and the scent. It made my skin feel clean and refreshed. I have combination skin and this doesnâ€™t dry me out or make me oily. I would probably use this in the morning as I prefer more of an exfoliant in the evening. A bit pricey but a good option! Gentle effective cleanser
