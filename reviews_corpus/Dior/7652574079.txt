It gets the job done as the second step in a double cleanse. I just didn’t like that I had to use so much to wash my face. The tube is large though so it’s not a ripoff, I just prefer using a smaller amount that works itself into a lather. Only docking off one star since it was an inconvenience, not something major. nan
