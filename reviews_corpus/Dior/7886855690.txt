This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. I recently moved to a drier colder place, and my skin has been so dry and my makeup doesn’t sit nicely, and I was looking for a new moisturizer. I have tried so many and I didn’t like most of them. This one however, is so moisturizing and lightweight, lightly fragrant, creamy, and long lasting. Sits well under makeup, and all my dry patches have gone away. I can truly say I love this stuff. I'm obsessed.
