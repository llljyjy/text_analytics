This is an excellent moisturizer for dry, sensitive skin! It can be used on the body and face. It has a light scent, and it also doesnâ€™t not leave a greasy feeling on the skin. I have been using it for a couple of days on my hands and have noticed that they are super soft and less dry. I will definitely continue using it as a hand lotion! nan
