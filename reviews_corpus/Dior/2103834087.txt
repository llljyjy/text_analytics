I used this product for about 4-5 weeks before reviewing. I am currently pregnant and was not blessed with the “pregnancy glow“. This eye serum has changed my eyes within the past few weeks that it feels amazing! I am 31 years old and the fine lines under my eyes have slightly disappeared to which I feel confident walking outside with no makeup and no under eye concealer. It did take a few weeks to notice a difference, but highly recommend. This is a product I received to review for free from Influenster. Give it some time...it works!
