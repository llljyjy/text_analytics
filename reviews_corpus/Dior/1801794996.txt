I received this product as a free sample to test out. This is a wonderful eye serum if you’re looking for something easy and quick to apply. Love the packaging. The metal applicator helps with puffiness. I am 36 years old I don’t have any prominent wrinkles yet but I do have dry under eyes and dark circles. This serum hydrates pretty well for me on its own. I can’t say it helps with dark circles yet since it probably takes time to see improvement. Nonetheless I highly recommend! Great for all ages and wears nicely under makeup. nice eye serum!
