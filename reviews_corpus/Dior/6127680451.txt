I received this item complimentary to try. The tube that I received feels like it’s practically empty. I have to squeeze extremely hard to get just a dot of serum out. I don’t really see a difference, but then again, there isn’t a lot for me to try out. I do like the applicator tip though. It feels nice. It’s okay
