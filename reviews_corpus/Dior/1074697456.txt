I received a tube of this eye serum courtesy of Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion on the product. I am not one to usually use an eye cream or serum as they donâ€™t usually do what they claim. Honestly, I am pretty impressed with this eye serum. I have fine lines, dark circles and puffiness, and it helped reduce these issues. The dark circles look lighter, and the puffiness decreased in about 15 mins.  I have been using it everyday since I received it. It feels luxurious and does not leave behind any stickiness. I have very sensitive skin it did not irritate me at all. I will continue to use, and will repurchase Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum. It is a little pricey, however this little indulgence is worth it for me. Love it
