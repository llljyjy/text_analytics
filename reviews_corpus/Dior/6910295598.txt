Wow! This is a great product! I tried it because of dryness around my face especially around my mouth area and within a couple of days I saw a huge difference. I would wipe the excess on my hands because it says for face and body, because I have extremely dry hands see the pictures. My hands were so dry that they would bleed at the knuckles. I did not take a before picture but I did take a picture two days after and then two weeks after and look at that huge difference. I highly recommend this product! It works great! And only after a few days you can see all the progress. I highly recommend this product! It works great!
