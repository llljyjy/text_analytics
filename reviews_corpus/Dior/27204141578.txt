I received this free from Influenster to give an honest review!This was a nice cleanser but was a bit drying for my skin. I have aging skin and as I have aged it’s become a bit more dry. This cleanser definitely did not help with that. As far as removing make-up, it removed the majority. My eye make-up was left behind. I do not wear waterproof mascara. I also wear very light natural make-up. So it’s not heavy. If you are a double cleanser like I am, I suggest you stick to that routine with this cleanser. It does have a nice scent! Nice but a bit drying for my skin
