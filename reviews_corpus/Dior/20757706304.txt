I enjoyed how I could for go a nighttime moisturizer. This cleanser is rich and creamy out of the tube and with a bit of water it was easy to spread it on my face with my fingers and it rinsed off completely and didn’t strip my skin. With continued use the more skincare benefits can be noticed. I have oily skin and I didn’t have any issues with this cleanser. Cleanser w/ Skincare Benefits
