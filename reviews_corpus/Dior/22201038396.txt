While this cleanser claims to be suitable for dry skin, I personally found it to be too stripping for dry skin types. I’ve tried using this multiple times. The first time, my skin was a bit on the greasy side, and the cleanser worked great without making my skin feel tight. The next couple of times I tried it, my skin was flaky and dry (not because of the cleanser) and this cleanser stung so much and was so painful to use if I kept it longer on my skin for more than 15 seconds. Therefore, I wouldn’t really recommend dry skin types using this. This also has a white soap fragrance to it that lingers for a while even after washing it off, but it’s not super strong. This removes makeup pretty well, or at least when I tested it. I took a very budge-proof lip stain and swiped it on the back of my hand, waited for it to dry, and was able to wash it off with the cleanser. Overall, it’s a great cleanser, but it’s not the best for drier skin types. nan
