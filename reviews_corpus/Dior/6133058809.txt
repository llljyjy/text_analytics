This is the first time trying an eye serum and I loved it. It has a really nice cooling feeling and the applicator is the best. It does have a scent but its very mild and nice. After only a week of being using it twice a day I already see a difference in my skin. It feels more hydrated, brighter and plumper. It absorbs very quickly so its easy to apply it under makeup and its the best to use it before your eye cream at night. I will keep using it and I will definitely repurchase it. This is your sign to get it!
