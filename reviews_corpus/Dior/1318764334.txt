Luckily, I don’t really have fine lines yet so I can’t comment on the efficacy of the product on that. I don’t really have dark circles either, more like light circles, but I couldn’t really tell if it helped with that. I do feel like it helped the puffiness under my eyes. It comes with a metal applicator which feels nice and cool during application. You can even put it in the fridge or freezer first if you want it really cold. The product went on nicely and I had no issues wearing it under my makeup. Overall, a nice serum. I just think I need to keep using it consistently to see more results. Nice eye serum
