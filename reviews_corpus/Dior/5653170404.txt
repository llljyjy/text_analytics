I really enjoy the floral scent of this cleanser and how well it lathers during use. However, if you do not like fragrance in your products or if you are sensitive to fragrance then this may not be for you. My face also felt really clean after using this cleanser without feeling that it was stripping away my skinâ€™s natural oils. nan
