I absolutely love this Cica Recover & Repair Multi Use Balm. I’ve been using this everyday and love how hydrated and plump my skin feels and looks, it doesn’t leave my skin greasy or sticky, the texture is perfect and smooth. It’s really good if you have dry spots it gets rid of them quickly. It also works great under makeup. Would definitely recommend. This is so hydrating.
