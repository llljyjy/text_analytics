Though I wanted to love this cleanser (since the formula itself works quite well with my skin), the fragrance was simply too much to bear. It’s an extremely strong fake floral scent, and it simply doesn’t leave your face. I highly recommend this product if you’re okay with fragrance, but if you’re not, definitely don’t get this product!
