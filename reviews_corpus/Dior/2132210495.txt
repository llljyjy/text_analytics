I have been using this product for 3 weeks and while it was nice, it did not do anything different from my other eye serums at a fraction of the price. I did like the applicator but wished the serum made a difference. My husband has more more fine lines and I had him use it with me. There were no results besides being hydrating. I wanted to love this product since I love many of Diorâ€™s make up products, but this one did not do it for me. Nothing special
