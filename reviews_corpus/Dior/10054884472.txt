I really enjoyed this facial cleanser I received from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. The smell is luxurious and the packaging is beautiful. I love the elegant and minimal look it gives. I used two different portions to see how potent it is and to my conclusion, less is more! I used less than a dime sized squeeze and it lathered up nicely. It made my skin feel soft and fresh after each wash. I would recommend this to a friend! Smells Expensive
