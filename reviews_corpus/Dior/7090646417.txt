I received this product to try and give my honest review.  I opened up the box and quickly read the packaging to see what the product was to be used for.  I was pleased as I read that the product had no fragrance and was made to help recover dry areas of skin quickly.  I showered and instantly felt the immediate dryness in my face.  I squeezed a small amount on two fingers and rubbed it onto my face.  I quickly felt the velvet smoothness that the balm left on my face.  It did not feel sticky or leave any residue.  I have been using it day and night and have felt quite a difference in the texture of my face.  The weather has been windy and with mask wearing, my face has been dry and almost chapped...well this balm has been a lifesaver.  It is a great addition to my daily face routine. A quick recovery for dry skin!
