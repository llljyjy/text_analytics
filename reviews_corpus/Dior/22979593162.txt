I’ve been using this for a couple weeks now and I like it, it’s great on my face and neck. I wanted to love it, but it’s really done nothing about the dryness on my arms or hands. But it’s wonderful on my face and neck. I’ve actually noticed fewer deep lines around my mouth and eyes, and my neck has plumped and looks twenty years younger. So, my overall opinion of this cream is that it’s amazing on facial skin, but not so good for the rest of the body. I still very highly recommend this and will continue using on my face and neck. A wonderful face and neck balm
