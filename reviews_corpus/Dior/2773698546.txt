I use it as a second step cleanser for days when I need to take off my makeup. It foams up and cleans really well. My face feels super clean afterwards but a tiny bit tight so it’s not a “gentle“ type of cleanser. Not the tightest I’ve been with some other cleansers though. It’s pricey but cleansers always seem to last pretty long for me. The only “ick“ is the strong scent. As with all Dior skincare products, this cleanser is heavily fragranced. Definitely not light. I don’t mind it but it does come on a bit strong when applying. If you can’t deal with fragrance, this cleanser may not be for you. Cleans well but it's heavily fragranced
