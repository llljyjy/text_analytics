My biggest concern when it comes to moisturizers is that my skin would feel like it did before I put the moisturizer on my face. I put this on before I go to bed and I wake up with my skin still feeling like it did when I first put it on…still hydrated! It has a very clean scent that didn’t bother me at all. Can’t recommend it enough. Gets the job done!
