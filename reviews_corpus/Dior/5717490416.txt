Let me begin by saying that I received this complimentary product in exchange for my review and honest opinionI am an older woman, and have become quite particular over the years regarding the types and quality of facial products that I use on my more mature skin.  I have read on several occasions that what you choose to cleanse your skin with is of little consequence, the more import items are the serums, lotions, toners and moisturizers that remain on your face.  I couldn’t disagree and more vehemently with this statement.Appropriate cleansing is vital in maintaining healthy skin.  Although I have tried too many to count, I currently have only a handful of products that I would even consider using to cleanse my face with.  This new Dior la Mousse has been moved to the first position in my short list of cleansers.  This is a thick, luxurious cream that glides on the skin, and is then transformed into the thickest, softest, smoothest most wonderful blanket of foam that is imaginable.  It is an almost mask like experience that rinses off easily, completely with no residue, and removes all signs of oil, makeup, and the day’s wear and tear.  My face feels so clean, hydrated, and actually ready for the remaining skin care products that I end my day with. I highly recommend this product, it is well worth the investment.  I will definitely be purchasing more.  Now that I’ve found it, I would hate to be without it. The best facial cleanser available
