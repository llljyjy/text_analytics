This balm has somewhat of a thick consistency but glides right onto my skin.  Itâ€™s not greasy or tacky feeling. It really moisturized my face and left it feeling soft and smooth.  I was so impressed how it made my face feel that I used it on some very dry spots that I have just above my knees. No more cracked and itchy skin and it definitely improved the look and feel of my skin in that area. This is a great moisturizer that I recommend for all those really dry areas on your skin. Great moisturizer!
