I got this to try from Influenster, and Iâ€™m really happy with it. It is mild enough to use on your face but strong enough to moisturize different areas of your body. It was creamy and blended well and was not greasy at all. It made my face feel soft and hydrated and gentle enough to even use near my eyes. I put it ony hands too and they were definitely softer. Very subtle fragrance and a little goes a long way. A good product for all over. Good allover moisturizing treat
