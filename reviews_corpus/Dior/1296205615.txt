When I first received this product, the appearance and hand-feel before lathering it up reminded me of the Clé de Peau Softening Cleansing Foam, which is my favorite luxury cleanser (and costs about 3X as much as this Dior product, sadly; I really wanted it to be a dupe!). It produced a beautiful lather but about 20 seconds after it hit my skin, I started to feel a slight burn, which is unusual for me as I do not have particularly sensitive skin. After rinsing thoroughly and drying, I noticed my forehead and cheeks had some very dried out/flaky areas that weren’t there prior. I am VERY into skincare and never skip a step in my morning or evening routines so I know those flaky spots were not there before I started the wash. I also noticed that the scent, which is very floral and not a fresh scent, which I prefer, really stuck around for a long time and made me feel very sneezy. I have used the product every evening for about a week and a half and suffice it to say, will not be continuing. It’s going to be relegated to a shaving foam.
