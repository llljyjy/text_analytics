I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Dior is a quality name and this is a quality product! Iâ€™m extremely happy I was chosen to receive this! I was so excited about receiving this product so the first night I tried it! It comes out of the bottle in a creamy luxurious consistency. It is profitable because with a very small amount you get an adequate cleaning. It has a very strong smell that explodes once you rub it one your face and it accompanies you for a long time after cleansing your skin. The scent is amazing but it is super strong to the point where if you use to much it can be overwhelming. My skin type is a combination so I felt like it worked perfectly for me leaving my skin super fresh, however I think that for dry skin it would not go so well because it may leave it too dry, while for oily skin it would be ideal. It left my face feeling super soft and definitely clean, it will definitely become a part of my skin care routine! I really liked it a lot and I would recommend it!! AMAZING PRODUCT
