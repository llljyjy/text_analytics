I was a little uncertain about using this as someone with very oily skin, but I’ve been liking it a lot. The texture isn’t oily or thick, it’s really creamy and it doesn’t make my skin shiny at all (it’s almost like a soft matte finish). I have a couple fine lines on my forehead and I think this may be helping them. It’s also gentle enough to go around my extremely sensitive eyes without burning them, so that’s a plus. It’s been windy and freezing and having extra moisturizer has been a must, and this doesn’t pill with any of my other skincare. Unsure if it’s worth the price tag for me personally, but it definitely feels and performs like a luxury product. nan
