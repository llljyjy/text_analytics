I really like this facial wash. It lathers very well with very little product. It also rinses off without leaving any residue and face is not  tight or dried out. My face felt really clean. I have very sensitive skin and it did not cause any irritation. It does have a mild scent but not too overpowering. It left my skin soft. I would recommend. Lather Well
