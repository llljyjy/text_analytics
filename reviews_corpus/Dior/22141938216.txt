This was my first Dior skincare product and I was surprised with how much I enjoyed using it! I usually use a gel cleanser but this foaming experience was almost luxurious. You don’t need much product to get a good lather which tells me this bottle will last me a long time. I felt like this did a great job removing any leftover remains from my first cleanse and left my skin feeling clean while moisturized. Super gentle and hydrating. The package was minimalist and I don’t have any issues squeezing the product out. I thought the scent smelt very floral which was pleasant and not overwhelming. Overall, it is a bit pricy but I would recommend and will most likely repurchase when I finish my current bottle. nan
