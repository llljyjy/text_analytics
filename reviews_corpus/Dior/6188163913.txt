LOVED the smell of this product! Just very light and clean and slightly floral. I really enjoyed the innovative head that allowed for massaging the eye area, and I do think this added some luminosity, particularly to my under eye area. I only wish there were instructions on the product itself or on the box, and the QR code on the box leads to an error page. The tips on the Dior website were wonderful, though! nan
