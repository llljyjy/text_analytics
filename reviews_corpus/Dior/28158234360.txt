I have combo skin and I’ve been testing this out as a night time moisturizer due to it’s thicker consistency and I’ve been really enjoying it. It’s a little thick, but not overly thick and doesn’t feel gross on my face and doesn’t leave me feeling greasy the next morning like some night moisturizers can do. My biggest complaint is that I wish they’d be a little more clear on what this product is supposed to do rather than just branding it as a multi use product. But I have been enjoying it Great as a night moisturizer
