I received this product through Influenster. After using this cleanser for about two weeks, Iâ€™m happy with the results. I used it to wash my face at the end of the day (after removing my makeup) and noticed that it left my skin very soft, supple, and moisturized. It didnt dry out my face like other cleansers that I have used in the past.The smell was actually really nice and subtle which I appreciated. I have very sensative skin so I usually do not use scented products but this cleanser didnt cause any negative side effects even with the scent.The only reason I would take one star off is because of the price. I do think you could find an alternate product that is not nearly as expensive and still provides the same results. However, considering the prestige of a luxury brand product, I can understand the price point. Overall Happy with this Product
