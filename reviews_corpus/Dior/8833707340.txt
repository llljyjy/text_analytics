This is a great moisturizer for sensitive skin. It has a very light fragrance, so it’s good if you’re sensitive to fragrance. I use it on my hands and other dry spots like my elbows. It’s really moisturizing without being sticky and made my hands feel softer than they have in a long time. Most other hand creams I’ve tried only make my hands feels moisturized for half an hour at the most, but this made them feel good for longer. However, I do still need to reapply after 4-5 hours because my skin is very dry. nan
