I really loved this face cleanser! It was super gentle and didn’t irritate my skin. It has a slight fragrance, but not enough to be irritating. Foams up easily and feels really nice. After using, my face didn’t feel tight or dry which means it does a good job of preserving your skin’s hydration. Great cleanser
