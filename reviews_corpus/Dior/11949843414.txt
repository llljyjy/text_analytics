I’m still not 100% sure how I feel on this. I love the elegant packaging, with clean lines and a sleek profile -- not just pretty, it fits perfectly on the tiny shelves in my apartment shower. It also has a fantastic texture: add a little water (even cold) and it foams up wonderfully in the hands, and it doesn’t leave your face feeling tight or unclean. Definitely more of a soapy/bubbly lather than a rich, creamy one if you do it in your hands like me, but it’s still thick enough to do the trick. A little goes a long way and the bottle is a nice, big size (so I don’t feel bad washing twice in a row on those days I really need it!) At night I use it after an oil balm cleanser, or just by itself if I’m too tired and didn’t wear makeup. In the AM it’s on its own for cleansing.The downside: The fragrance is pretty strong. It’s not like a floral perfume, just straight-up powdery lily, but not being particularly sensitive to fragrances, I don’t mind too much after using it for a few weeks. The scent is a bit like cheap bar soap, but such is the nature of any floral water. If you are sensitive to fragrance: steer clear. It didn’t do anything for my acne, but it didn’t make it worse, either. I’ve been pretty bad about my diet, hydration, and sleep recently (exams stress season is upon us) though, so take this with a grain of salt!I wouldn’t recommend this to people uninterested in brand names, simply because the price point/fragrance combo for what it is, but it you don’t mind splashing out a bit for the feeling of luxury in your daily routine it isn’t a bad choice (again, it’s a good-size bottle). If you don’t mind a strong floral... Also wouldn’t recommend if you’re looking for active skincare in your cleanser. Not sure if I’d buy it again for myself (mosty because I’m still attached to my previous one), but I fully intend to use every last drop! Like luxe bar soap
