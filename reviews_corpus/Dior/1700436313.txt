This is a really great cleanser! It is gentle and did not make my skin feel dry after. A little goes a long way and you get a beautiful lather with a tiny amount of the cleanser. The only thing I donâ€™t love is the heavy floral scent, but fortunately it does not linger and goes away as soon as you rinse it off. I definitely would recommend this cleanser to a friend! nan
