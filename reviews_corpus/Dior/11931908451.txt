This face wash is everything!! Lovely light clean scent. Super soft smooth creamy buttery almost lotion-like texture. Blends and foams like a dream. Gives your skin that tight clean feeling while still making it feel moisturized and not too dried out. Only slight con, doesnâ€™t seem to be too helpful for acne prone skin, but maybe over time that will change! Will be using this until the last drop and may consider purchasing after too, despite the higher price point! So luxurious!!
