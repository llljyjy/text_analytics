The product plus the applicator feels so good on your under eye. The product comes out milk white when you squeeze it-be careful not to squeeze out too much! When you squeeze the bottle it doesn’t come out fast so that’s good. It is instant relief for the eyes. I will post an updated review after a week. So far it feels great around the eyes, no stickiness and I look more awake! nan
