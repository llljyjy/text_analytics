let’s start off with packaging... first off, it’s a stunning. I love the simplicity and the fact that it’s in a squeezey tube. but the best part is the product is stellar too! the smell gives me very “classic Avon“ vibes which I’m not too into but it lathers great and leaves the skin feeling clean but still hydrated. I highly recommend checking it out! Yes!
