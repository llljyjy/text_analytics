I received the Cica Recover & Repair Multi-Use Balm from Dior on 22 February and began using it on 23 February. Because I wanted to give this product a fair shake, I stopped my regular morning and evening moisturizers during this trial, and used the Dior exclusively. The balm has a pleasant, creamy texture and absorbs quickly, with no oily film so it is great to use under makeup, though I did note that it does not contain SPF. It is free from added fragrance and has a very faint, herbal scent, attributed to the natural ingredients. I have one extremely dry and flaky spot on my face that has shown marked improvement over the course of this trial. Another wonderful thing I found, almost by accident, is that this product is absolutely amazing at soothing and calming my face after a derma rolling session! No other serum or moisturizer I’ve used has eased the redness and itching that I get from rolling; Recover & Repair  does.  Also, let me point out, it is great on my dry, over-washed hands, helping to heal two cracked knuckles! My skin is aging and very dry and this, unfortunately, did not hydrate my face overnight as well as I had hoped it would; I was looking forward to waking with moist, dewey skin, but, unfortunately, the Recover & Repair is not quite heavy enough for me to use as a night cream. I appreciate Influenster and Sephora for allowing me the opportunity to try this product, and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a light, SPF-free moisturizer. I’m pleased with the results I received after derma rolling and, for that reason, I would be inclined to invest in the product in the future.I received these products for free from Influenster for testing purposes. #complimentary Cica Recover & Repair Multi-Use Balm
