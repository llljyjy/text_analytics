The cooling metal applicator is great. That paired with this serum is a stellar combination. I used this day and night for two weeks and didn’t think it did too much, one day I didn’t wear it in the morning, and that’s what I noticed my eyes looked puffier that normal. Used again, and it blends flawlessly under makeup and is really relaxing as part of my daily routine. Not greasy or oily, soft and light Cooling applicator for a relaxing daily routine
