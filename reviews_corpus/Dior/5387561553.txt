I started using this product and at the time my skin was super dry. I love how soft and silky my skin is after using it but not greasy. I use it as a cream under my makeup daily and just recently started using it on my dry hands as well. Love, love, love this product and will definitely recommend this to any that asks me. I have sensitive skin and it does not bother it at all! Felt like silk but not greasy.
