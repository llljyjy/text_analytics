Your definitely getting your moneys worth as far as results and feel. A little does go a long way. I did not end up liking the applicator, to rough for my delicate undereye area. Just pat it on with your ring finger. It does moisturize the undereye area, mine tend to be dry. I wouldnt spend the money on this tho. I’ll stick with more affordable eye creams, cerave’s for example. This was gifted through influenster. Its a great high end eye cream.
