I was skeptical about this product until I seen it works for senstive skin & itâ€™s fragrance free. I thought I should give it the ultimate test of trying on my hands first. My hands get super dry in the winter months and leaves me with rough patches. I only used about a good dime size amountand rubbed it in. The scent is so light, and the product itself is lightweight. And to my surprise it really moisturized my dry rough patches on my hands. Leaving them really soft. Totally impressed.! nan
