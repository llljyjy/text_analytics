This Dior Cica Recover and Repair body balm is the bomb! I tried out this balm 2 separate times. Both times it made my skin instantly hydrated and soft I have combination skin and it’s somewhat sensitive This product did not irritate my skin nor leave it oily or greasy.I used dots of it on my face and a little goes a long way.I put an application on this morning at 6am and at 5pm was asked what I do to my skin to give it such a nice complexion. I used nothing else on my face except a bit of concealer on two red spots. I am super impressed by the way this product worked on my skin and plan to try it more often as well as other parts of my body.I would recommend this for anyone with combination skin, that needs hydrating, brightening and to soften the rough patches. I feel the price point is fair as you don’t need much to get the job done. I will try more of their products in the future! Dior Balm is the Bomb!!!
