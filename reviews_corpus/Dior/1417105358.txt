I can’t express how happy I am with this product. I used this as a facial moisturizer, and I can honestly say that this is the best moisturizer that I have used in a very long time. That’s saying a lot because I’m always trying different moisturizers. My search is over. This is it, the one. Before I used this, I had flaky patches, even after exfoliating. After using it, the patches were gone, and my skin felt so soft.  Am I going to buy this? Absolutely!!! As a matter of fact, I’m stocking up. I love that there is no scent. This is extremely moisturizing without causing breakouts. I just love it and I’m speechless. Where has this been all of my life!
