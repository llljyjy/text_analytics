This cleanser does what it intends to do. My skin does feel clean afterwards but doesn’t do much to hydrate or correct any skin concerns I have. The formula and texture feel nice on the skin. It has an overwhelming perfume scent that I feel is unnecessary.. but if fragrance in skincare doesn’t bother you it shouldn’t be an issue. I don’t think I would purchase this product again. Just okay
