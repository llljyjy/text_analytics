I received this complimentary and quite honestly had low expectations only because Dior skincare has never quite impressed me. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved this from the get go! It is heavily fragranced just like EVERYTHING in the Dior line, so sensitive skin and noses beware. It is a mousse just like it says and you don’t need much for it to do it’s job. I love that it foams/suds up really easily and plenty and I feel it really cleanses your skin and any leftover makeup from oil /gel cleansing exceptionally. If you were really rushed for time I can even see this as being enough of a cleanser to remove a full face of makeup with on its own. It’s just under $50 but you get a giant tube on top of the fact that a little goes a long way with this product, so it is a win in my book! Unexpected Go to!
