The recover and repair balm  is absolutely luxurious. It feels wonderful.  My skin feels moisturized and hydrated with out any greasy feeling.  There is basically no scent,  which I really love.  I have sensitive, combination,  acne prone skin.  Which means products that work for me are few and far between.  This works for me.  This balm leaves me feeling pampered and my skin well taken care of. Luxury in a product!
