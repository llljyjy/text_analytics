The Dior OFF/ON Foaming Cleanser is now my new favorite cleanser. I still mostly use Cerave for my day to day, but I specifically use Dior when I have makeup residue to remove. It works like a charm. I’ve never had my makeup come off so easily since I’ve used this cleanser. It also smells super fresh! Truly debating making it my go to cleanser in general, not just for makeup removal. Great for makeup removal! :)
