Iâ€™m pretty picky when it comes to moisturizers, but this one did not disappoint! It felt amazing & gentle going on (I used it in place of my normal moisturizer) and the softness of my skin carried over into the morning. Bonus points for a dual use product that works for both face and body! Love it - would repurchase. nan
