I love the applicator tip of the serum tube. It’s cooling and massaging, and since the tip is flexible, I think it’s pretty gentle to my eye area. I have pretty sensitive eyes and this serum did not irritate my eye area at all! I thought it was pretty nourishing and I didn’t even notice much of a scent, which was nice.  The only negative was that I didn’t notice much of an effect on my eye area but I don’t have dark circles or puffy under eyes either. I did like the massage and application instructions, so I would have preferred them to be in the box as an insert instead of accessing it online. Lovely eye serum!
