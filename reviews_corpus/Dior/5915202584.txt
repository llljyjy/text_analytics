The Dior Off/On foaming cleanser is so simple, yet quite lovely. My skin is on the sensitive side and with that being said I had no issues at all with this formula. I love how the cleanser turns frothy while massaging and cleaning my face with it. The water lily really does take my makeup off without feeling like I am having to put tons of effort into it. Unlike other washes that are suppose to remove makeup, this Dior face wash actually does the trick! Also, there is a sweet flower-like smell that the foaming cleanser has for those that would rather have unscented washes. The fragrance is not overpowering though. As for the Dior cleanser removing impurities, this face wash left my skin feeling so clean! My face felt so smooth, rejuvenated, and fresh after using this product. I highly recommend using this in the morning to perk up the start of your day. :) Overall, I am highly satisfied with the Dior Off/On Facial cleanser. My reviews are 100% honest as always whether the item is bought by me or sent to  me for review. Thanks for reading! Frothy and Fresh
