This luxurious face cleanser has a pleasant fragrancethat is on the stronger side. The scent reminds me ofCamay soap bars. It has a whipped creamy textureand is easy to lather onto your skin. It leaves a littlebit of tackiness after rinsing which I’m going toassume is the moisturizer. This cleanser removesmake up really well and leaves the face with a tightclean feeling. My face feels softer after using it. Thescent lingers for about a day so that’s a heads up forthose who are sensitive to fragrances. Dior OFF/ON Foaming Face Cleanser
