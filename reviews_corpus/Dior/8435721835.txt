I am so thrilled that I got the opportunity to try this multi-use balm. I am always on the lookout for great moisturizers and this product did the job! It is moisturizing, yet light and does not have a harsh smell. It made my face have a soft glow. This is a moisturizer is worth recommending. Impressed!!
