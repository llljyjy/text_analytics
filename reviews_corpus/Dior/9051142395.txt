Since I received this cleanser, I have totally changed my thought about foam cleaner. Usually other foam cleansers will strip all of my face natural oil after washing my face, even though it felt clean at first, after awhile, my face will produce an excessive amount of oil. However, this foam cleanser from Dior has changed the game. It makes your face feel clean but very hydrating. Not a big fan of fragrance skincare product but I love its very light floral scent, so far, my skin hasnâ€™t experienced any break out yet. I use this with my FOREO, and it does a good darning job taking off make up. Technically, it meets all necessary criteria of a face wash. Loving it New Favorite Foam Cleanser
