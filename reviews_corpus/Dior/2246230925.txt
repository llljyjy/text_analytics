I live in New York City so I was skeptical about the promises of reducing the effects of pollution on the skinâ€¦ that being said I noticed a huge difference. For me this product is a game changer in how my skin feels and the textual difference of my skin. Furthermore, a little bit goes a long way, (a pea size amount is enough for the full face and neck), so it is actually at a reasonable price! game changer.
