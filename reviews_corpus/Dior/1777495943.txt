I was super excited to try this product as I usually love all things Dior. This serum is silky smooth and I love the applicator on the product but I’ll admit that I haven’t seen any noticeable difference. I feel like these products usually take some time to see any improvement or changes and thus far, not much. But a good eye serum is important so I’ll keep using and see what happens! nan
