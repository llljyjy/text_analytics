Lovely multipurpose product! I enjoy this most as a 10 minute mask (wipe off with cotton pad soaked with toner after) before makeup. I tend to get dry patches and this stuff makes my makeup go on soooo smooth! And it lasts all day because my skin is properly hydrated and prepped beforehand. I have also used as a hand cream, which it works amazingly for. Even though I constantly wash my hands, they are still super soft! My fianc√© also enjoys this in his hands as well, so points for that too. nan
