I was thrilled to receive this complimentary balm from Influenster to test and review because I am a huge fan of Dior products. I have used it for a week now and absolutely love the way it feels on my skin. I’ve replaced my nighttime moisturizer, daytime moisturizer, under eye crème, and face serum to see if this one product would be comparable to those four. My honest opinion is that it is very comparable. To me, it looks like a moisturizer, but feels like a serum. Lovely, smooth, and non-greasy consistency. Extremely moisturizing without leaving my face looking wet. Absorbs so nicely! I used it on my face, neck, and hands to give an honest review …. But then I found another use! I had hand surgery a few days ago and the cast on my arm has been driving me crazy with itching. I woke up in the middle of the night desperate for relief, and the Circa Balm was already sitting on my bathroom counter. I took some and rubbed it between my skin and the cast, and the relief was immediate!  All in all I think this is a fantastic product and the description is spot on! It truly gives wonderful hydration to not only your face, but other areas of the body. I highly recommend it, will most certainly purchase it in the future! Multi-use is an understatement!
