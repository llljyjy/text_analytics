I have never stuck with one certain brand of face wash, it seems like I was trying a different brand every couple of weeks because I couldn’t find one that I truly liked enough to buy again. The DIOR LA MOUSSE is absolutely phenomenal! I was astonished after the first time I used it. In the pictures I posted you will see a tiny, pea sized drop on my hand. Trust me when I say that is the amount I use on my whole face and neck. That tiny drop turns into a fluffy, light lather that makes my face softer and brighter almost instantly! Then there is the scent, it smells so clean and refreshing straight from the bottle. After rinsing I can still smell it all day long! I’ve been using this for over a week, twice a day and the bottle is still full, this one bottle will last so much longer than the brands I have bought in the past. I highly recommend this to everyone I talk to because it works better than anything I have ever used before. I am 46, I have gotten more compliments about my face being softer and brighter then it has ever been. I absolutely love this face wash and I can finally say I have finally found my favorite after looking for 30 years! Simply Amazing!!
