I enjoyed the metal applicator because it created a cooling effect when applying the eye cream. The eye cream was thin enough to spread easily without heavy rubbing but thick enough to feel like a quality cream. I did notice a slight decrease in the fine lines under the eye and a slightly plumper under eye which minimized darkness. I will continue to use. Cooling Applicator
