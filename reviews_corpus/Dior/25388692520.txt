This Dior On/Off cleanser is pretty awesome. It’s a super creamy, somewhat thick cream to start off, and as you mix it with water and rub it onto your skin it feels creamy and foamy all at the same time! It glides across your skin and literally feels comforting. It does well at cleaning my skin, it even clears my mascara well! It rinses off well and literally gives my skin a ’squeaky clean’ feeling. It feels smooth and not dried out at all.  The only complaint I have is that the scent is pretty strong and while not a deal breaker I am not a big fan of it. SO creamy and literally comforting to my skin!
