Absolutely in love with this cleanser, and I never imagined saying that about a cleanser, but I mean I’m obsessed with this one. It leaves my face feeling soft and clean, there’s no strong scent, and it’s not irritating at all. This is a game changer for my skin care routine. It’s going to be my new go to cleanser. It’s worth the price tag. nan
