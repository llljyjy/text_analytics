This is a nice cleanser, however for someone with dry skin it is pretty drying. I wouldnâ€™t repurchase for that reason but for someone with oily skin it could work great. It cleanses really well, gets makeup off and does make your skin feel really clean. It foams to a luxurious lather and has a pretty strong scent. nan
