I was really looking forward to use this to help with the baggage and puffiness under my very tired eyes. The application itself is pretty easy though I did have a hard time figuring out how hard to squeeze the tube to apply the right amount of serum. The applicator is nice and cool and immediately starts to reduce puffiness around the eyes. It also acts as a nice massage while rubbing in the serum.  After a few weeks of usage I noticed a bit tighter skin but nothing significant. I hope that with some more usage I start to see very drastic results. I have noticed no redness or irritation after using the serum which is great and look forward to continued results. This was received for free in exchange for review. Soothing Application
