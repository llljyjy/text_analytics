I received this product complimentary from Influenster for my honest opinion and review. I was excited to try this product because I’m in my mid-30’s and have begun to notice fine lines and dark circles and loss of collagen under my eyes. Right away I really loved the application process. The rounded applicator is part of the tube and it allows you to squeeze the perfect amount of serum onto it. The formula is not thick or sticky and blends in nicely without any yucky feeling. I will continue using this product to see how it does with smoothing out my fine lines. Overall I have been pleased with this product. Love the applicator and serum formula
