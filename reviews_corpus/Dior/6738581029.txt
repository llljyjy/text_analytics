I really liked this product. It is gentle and it freshens up the skin. It does have a mild scent to it, which is not by any means overpowering. It works well as an everyday cleanser as well as a makeup remover. The formulation is creamy, not liquidy so youâ€™re less likely to waste the product. It lathers quickly and easily and a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend it. Worth it
