Holy Grail cleanser for maturing skin!!!! Wowza!!! I waited nearly a month after receiving this product to be sure I didn’t have any type of allergic reaction and to be sure I gave it enough love to write a factual review….The Water Lilly is a main ingredient and is heavenly!!!! From the scent down to how gentle and hydrating it is to the skin I adore it in this cleanser!! I overused this cleanser at first because I was using cheaper cleansers that had a lot of fillers and junk in them so I had to use a lot more product… Once I was able to hit the sweet spot with a nice pea size dollop this instantly became my holy grail!!!! It effectively removes makeup and debris, you feel amazingly fresh and clean but not tight (because that’s a bad sign), so I know it’s not overly stripping out my oils and causing another problem down the road….It immediately plumps and hydrates my skin and it feels sooooo smooth and supple!!! I will definitely keep this cleanser in my arsenal from here on out!!!! For anyone with mature/aging skin do yourself a favor and grab this gem of a cleanser!!!!!!! HOLY GRAIL
