I received a free sample in exchange for an honest review. I really liked this product. It felt a little thicker than my usual moisturizer, which made it almost like a primer. I liked that it wasn’t greasy, and it didn’t have a fragrance. I mostly used it during the day. I might have liked if it had SPF. Great product
