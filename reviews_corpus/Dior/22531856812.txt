This cleanser left my face feeling fresh and clean! It had a smooth consistency and wasnâ€™t too heavy on the skin, and left my skin feeling moisturized and not dry. It has a nice scent and is made of cleaner ingredients as well. I would definitely recommend this cleanser although it is a bit pricey! I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Great cleanser!
