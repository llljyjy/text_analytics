This is one of the beat eyecreams I have ever used. This is the second Dior skincare products I have tried. The packaging is luxurious, and has a nice pale pink color that I like. I have dry under eyes, and this cream kept them hydrated. The applicator to apply is a really nice treat. The cream was smooth and feels nice. I didnâ€™t notice any scent which was a plus. The bags under my eyes seems to have gotten a little better. Yes, I would recommend. One if the best...
