Oh how I hate to be writing this review...but others need to know.This is NOT the iconic product I used for years, that had a texture of a creamy primer, that would somehow mattify my shiny spots while luminizing my dull spots. That I could literally put on and WATCH my skin transform in the mirror.This is a lighter-colored serum with what looks like microfine shimmer in it, that does not do ANY of the things it promises--or any of the things it used to. Does not “blur“ anything, does not even skin, it doesn’t even work as a primer anymore. In addition, the fragrance has changed, and it smells so bad, like cheap hand soap.I was so excited to see a refill only to be horribly disappointed. The only reason it got one star is because I couldn’t give it NO stars. Horrible--NEW FORMULA, NOT THE SAME
