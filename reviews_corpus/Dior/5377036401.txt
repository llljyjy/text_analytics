With the winter I started getting annoying dry patches. Oils, creams, serums - nothing got rid of it. I decided to splurge on this and will def be purchasing again! It feels amazing and goes on perfectly over serums/oils. When my skin is dry I use it solo, otherwise I use it on top of retinoid serums. I do see a difference after using for several weeks. My skin overall just looks nicer. Feels like I’m really treating my skin to something nice every night now. There’s a scent, but I don’t find it overwhelming. The price is a bit much IMO, but the tub lasts a few months. Wait for the VIP sale or use points, def worth the splurge. nan
