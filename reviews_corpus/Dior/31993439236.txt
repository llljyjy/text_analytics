I received a complimentary sample to test from Influenster, and I liked this product! I mainly used it as a moisturizer before bed, and it felt very firming and not too oily. I tried it as a mask, and I like how it felt, but the thickness did make it a little hard to get off. Iâ€™d definitely continue to use this! Soft and smooth!
