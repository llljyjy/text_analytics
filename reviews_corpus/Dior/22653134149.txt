I waited until the last minute to write my review on this  balm by Dior. For those who buy products in this price category of $60 or higher will find it affordable.  It is a multi-use balm for sensitive skin types. Fragrance free. Infused with centella asiatica. Chamomile wax. Hyalauronic acid to renew and hydrate the skin. I found it  to be rich and creamy. For me, when I applied I felt soft and silky. After it settled in the cream left my face, neck, decalotage dry and slighty irritated. This was not one of my favorite #voxbox from #influenster. Thank you Dior and Influenster
