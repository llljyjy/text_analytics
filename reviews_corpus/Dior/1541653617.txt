This product was the holy grail in my routine — note the “was”. It is beautiful, luxurious, smoothing. Even my husband noticed that my skin looked different - my complexion smooth and glowy and all my imperfections (pores, uneven skin tone, dark spots) seemed blurred, dare I say skin on a beauty filter?? It lasted a long time, a small pump covers the entire face, and just gave me an all around healthy youthful glow. I bought it religiously because it was worth it!!! But after 6 full sized bottles and over 2 years of use, I stopped seeing any effect. It did not have that dreamy glow as before, not sure if my skin just got used to the product, but I’ve moved onto a different product since. Dreamy and glowy skin
