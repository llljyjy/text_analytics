I received this product for free to try and give my honest review. I have very dry,  sensitive skin.  I wore the cream under makeup with no serums, primers or other moisturizers. It performed  very well. I also used it by itself on my face, neck and hands. This product quickly absorbed into my skin with no residue. My skin was super moisturized and felt smooth to the touch. I also love that it has no added fragrance.  It has a very faint skin care scent. I do recommend  it. Good  for my dry, sensitive skin
