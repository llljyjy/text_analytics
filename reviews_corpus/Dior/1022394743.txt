This product is just a notch above the others. Let me tell you why. I have other eye specific products with the metal applicator. They do not compare to this larger, ridged applicator. It glides in smoothly but also gives a little massage to help move any swelling, fluid build up under the eyes. It is cooling and depuffing. It does a slight scent which I’m not a huge fan of but it’s very subtle. Highly recommend this esp if you have more mature under eyes or deal with puffiness. nan
