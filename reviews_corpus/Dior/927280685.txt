This is a lovely  to use product and did wonderfully under my la roche-posey melt in sun screen and my La Prairie Foundation.  I also used it on my winter dry skin on my knees and shins and back of my hands.. Smooths instantly and by the second day skin is smoother.   I plan to use the whole tube daily !  The other miracle is that even though the weather dropped 40 degrees and we had chilly winds, my face did not get rosacea nor dry out.  I received this as a free sample and it will go a long way as the texture of the balm smooths on very easily! First Time User of Dior Skin Care
