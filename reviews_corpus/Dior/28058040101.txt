I was scared to try this because I havesensitive skin, but was happy when I hadno bad reaction. I first tried it by washingwith my hands. It was creamy and latherednice. I had to use about a dime sizeamount. I then used my silicone face brushwhich I loved the results even more. My facedidn’t feel tight or dried out. Mostimportantly my face felt clean. I doesn’thave a strong but smells clean. I willdefinitely continue using and highlyrecommend if you want a more naturalcleanser and have sensitive skin. Love!!!
