I really liked the product I could really notice a difference in the first 10 days of using it my expression lines were less visible I am 38 years old and personally I think it is a product that is worth having I recommend keeping it in the fridge since the applicator is made of metal and gives it that cold touch to help deflate a little more perfect for my routine
