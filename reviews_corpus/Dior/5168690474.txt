After using this product for the past 2.5 weeks, my face is feeling so fresh and soft. I struggle with rosacea and many high end brands trigger it, but Capture Totale Le Serum did not trigger my redness during my use. I typically do not like scented serums, but this one smells so fresh and rich. I am obsessed with Miss Dior perfume and this Serum gave me low key hints of it. I also really like how light the serum feels after applying. Thicker serums tend to trigger my skin issues, and this one tended to go on well and be absorbed quite nicely. Love this Serum!
