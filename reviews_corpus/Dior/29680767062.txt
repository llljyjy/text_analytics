I liked how it made my skin feel smooth, for me it is a great cleanser before makeup. I have acne prone skin and it seemed to clear it up the more I used it. The product and the purpose of it is really really good, but if you have sensitive skin or if you don’t like scented products, then i don’t think this product is for you. It smells kind of like lavender and it doesn’t dissipate for awhile. I used it before I put makeup on and on a day where no makeup was used at all, it also takes my makeup off really well after I use my wipes. My only faults are that when you apply this product you kind of have to work fast with it since it melts into the skin really really fast and it doesn’t really foam up like in the name or the video on the website. It’s great to use before moisturizer (of course) since it really made my skin feel hydrated. I would recommend this product to some people, but not all, try it if you must and I advise you get a sample before buying the full thing. Thank you Influenster for this #Voxbox! Would love to try more! ☺️ Great
