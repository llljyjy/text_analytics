I got the Dior cica recover and repair multi use balm from influenster to try. Firstly, I loved the packaging. It’s very simple and looks clean. The balm really does help my dry skin, and when I found out you could also use it as a mask I was so excited. It left skin feeling very soft and looked glowy. You don’t need to use a lot of product and it melts right into the skin. I definitely recommend this product if you have dry skin!! Fragrance free too, which is a huge plus nan
