Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum is amazing! I noticed a difference after a week and a half. My eye areas were dry, with super fine lines, and had a lightly dark circle under them.  This serum goes on thin and the flexible application head males sure to get into every crease.  The smell is light and has a floral fragrance to it. I would recommend this to anyone struggling with fine lines and dark under eye circles. Capture those fine lines!
