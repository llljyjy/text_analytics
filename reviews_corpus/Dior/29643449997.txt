WOW! When I tell you that this Balm is amazing, that’s an understatement. I adore everything about this product. The texture is unlike any other Balm I have ever tried. Most are thick and have a petroleum like texture. This product is more like a soft lightweight cream. It’s not greasy at all but it’s a true powerhouse moisturizer. It definitely delivers on its promise. The fact that it has many natural ingredients is always a plus and it’s fragrance free. My skin is very dry now due to the dry cold air of the season, but this has truly helped me with my battle against this harsh drying season. I use it on my face, my hands, my arms, all over basically. I need a large jar of this! Because this product works extremely well but it’s not greas, sticky, or oily. I can see myself willing to use this in the summer which I am usually opposed to using lotions and creams due to the seasonaly warm months. I love this product. Definitely a staple for me and higly recommended.  . nan
