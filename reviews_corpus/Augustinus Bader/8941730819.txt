If you have dry skin and fine lines, then this isabsolutely the cream for you! It is so rich and creamy, it goes on so smooth and makes my dry face so moisturized. I waited several weeks of using it and do feel it helps the fine lines on my face fill out and they are less noticeable. There is not scent, which for a face cream I prefer. This absolutely will be a staple in my nighttime routine, especially during cold Chicago winters when my face dries out! Soft & Buttery!
