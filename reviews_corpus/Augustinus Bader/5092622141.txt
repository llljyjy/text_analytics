I have used this both day and night in my skincare routine. I absolutely love it. My skin eats this moisturizer right up and doesn’t leave a greasy feelings. It’s not scented, so if you hate scented creams, this is for you. I personally don’t mind scented creams. Overall impression- feels luxurious and hydrated my skin beautifully. The price tag on this bottle is steep. The packaging is gorgeous and you can buy the refill pods instead of the bottle.  ✅No irritations✅ works well on sensitive skin. ✅ Hydrates your skin✅Keeps dry skin moisturized✅non greasy formula luxury!!!
