My new obsession! This lightweight, luxurious, and moisturizing soothing cram is a miracle worker! With skin that can be sensitive and easily break out when I try a new skincare product, the Augustinus Bader Ultimate Soothing Cream was a seamless transition. The redness in my creeks was minimized, my skin had better texture and looked softer and smoother. A little goes a long way… I have been using this cream for several weeks, and haven’t made it 1/2 way through the jar! At the price point, it is definitely a luxury brand, but it is worth every penny! Additionally, the interior of the blue pot has a “pod” that contained the Ultimate Soothing Cream; it can be popped out and replaced with a new pod, making recycling easy (and saves a few dollars on the replacement). This has become a staple in my skincare routine! nan
