Was looking for a new lux cream to try. Used to use the la mer gel and a Korean sleeping mask. Saw the before and after with acne. Tried it for myself and I think this and my Sk-II clearing lotion cleared my skin. Now I only get pesky blackheads but no zits! Face feels plump and packaging is clutch. The .5 size lasted me about 6 months. i. love. her.
