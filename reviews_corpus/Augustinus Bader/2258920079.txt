I received this product for free for my honest review. I have mixed feelings on this product. The texture is very thick and nice and does absorb quickly which leaves a smooth finish and is not tacky at all. The product sits well under sunscreen and there are no interactions to cause piling. The only thing I am not a fan of is the scent. While I know most like fragrance free, the scent is not appealing to me at all. And a suggestion I would have for the company is to provide a little scoop that attaches to the jar so there is no risk of contamination with use of hands. Especially for a price point of this nature, there should be a spatula/scoop of some type. Good but have a suggestion
