I received this product free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. This cream is definitely lightweight and more of a serum than a cream. It definitely mattifies and I found make up application much easier after using this product. The packaging is quite nice and feels luxurious (for the price, it should!) and the pump dispenser works quite well. My one issue is the rounded bottom, you have to store it on the cap so it looks kind of strange on my beauty shelf. Overall, this product does what it claims to do! Lightweight and mattifying!
