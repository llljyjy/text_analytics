I was so excited to get this free for my honest review! Unfortunately, this moisturizer was not for me. The packaging looks nice except the bottom is rounded so you need to store it upside down. I found out from another review that you can remove the rounded casing but there wasn’t any instructions about that so I would have never figured that out myself. That upset me more though because it’s just additional packaging for no reason. I find that very wasteful and not eco friendly at all. The cream has a slight medicinal smell that didn’t really bother me and didn’t linger. The cream is very light and feels nice and smooth going on. It absorbs well. I could only use this at night because no matter how I layered my products, whatever I put over this cream would completely ball up, even if I waited 5 minutes for it to dry! I didn’t notice any noticeable differences to my skin after using it for a month and it doesn’t really mattify. It isn’t moisturizing enough for my dry skin. I don’t think this cream is worth it’s price tag. Doesn’t Work For Me
