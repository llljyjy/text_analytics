I have never heard of this brand but I’m so happy I got to use it.  It’s not too heavy and smoothes in wonderfully.  It works great under makeup without leaving any kind of cast.  I’ve noticed a more even skin tone and a softening to my fine lines.  My face feel truly hydrated.  It’s not oily or drying and absorbs quickly.  It’s packaged beautifully and you really feel like you’re using something fancy.  Thank you Influenster for allowing me to try this product for a review. wonderful face cream
