I received a sample to try. I have very dry skin and I loved it. I used it once or twice a day. Initially I didn’t see much difference, but after about a week I noticed my pores looked smaller and my skin just feels... silkier, less dry, soft. Honestly I can’t believe there isn’t silicon in it as that’s the kind of silky feeling I got. I don’t know about the price point as I received it to try, but it is a really nice product Heavenly for parched skin
