I’ve tried both The Cream and The Rich Cream, and this formula is by far my favorite Augustinus Bader moisturizer. I love the thick texture, and how soft and smooth it makes my skin feel. The smallest amount is needed, a little goes a long way. I’ve been using it regularly at night and wake up to clear, soft skin. I also love that the jar can be refilled. As with all the Augustinus Bader products, this formula is relatively unscented. nan
