Ok so I’ve read mixed reviews on this product and every product is not for everyone as we have have diff needs/concerns. This is just enough moisture for me along with a good moisture serum and I can get dry but more so combo. For me, it’s a must have. I have tried just about every product/brand out there I feel like(close to!) from high end to low. I tend to use higher end skincare and this works for my personal needs. If you want to work on texture , fine lines, firmness, and hyperpigmentation then this is for you. For me personally I cannot use a super greasy moisturizer or it ruins my texture, so for me this is great. If you are looking for just an amazing basic moisturizer because you have extreme dry skin then this is prob not for you. The rich cream is great also and more so suited for those looking for something heavier without the retinol and vit c. My Personal Fave for Texture & Wrinkles
