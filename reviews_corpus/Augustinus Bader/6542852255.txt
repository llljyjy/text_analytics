I so wanted to love this but it did nothing for my oily skin, immediate or long term.  I mean NOTHING.  There is nothing special about the texture, look of the product itself.  I used it for 2 weeks before giving the reviews.  It did not irritate my sensitive skin, doesnâ€™t have fragrance and non greasy but I could find a ton of products that would do the same.  It did not mattify anything on my face.  It is almost like outting water on my face.  Sorry, Augustinus, glad I got it for free before spending so much money on it. nan
