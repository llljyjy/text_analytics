I’ve been using this cream every morning for a month. I use tretinoin at night and couldn’t seem to get rid of the chin peeling (it’s been going on 4+ months). Now I’m seeing that tret glow with barely any peeling and the purging seems to have plateaued too. I have adult hormonal acne + melasma and am well versed in proper skincare but I got so tired of trying different hydrating toners, night creams, day creams, soothing serums and tret application routines I finally broke down and bought this and I’m glad I did. Ouch to that price though thus 4 stars. Good to balance skin when using strong treatments
