I am in love with this cream. It has lightened my hyperpigmentation and soothed my dry patches. A little goes a long way so for the price tag, it’s worth it. I put on a little dab on my trouble spots and go about my day. Can be worn under makeup without a greasy feeling. If it wasn’t so expensive I would stock up and never run out! Amazing
