have previously considered buying the rich cream but was never quite sure. I received this to try and I honestly really hoped it was over hyped. Unfortunately it has lived up to all expectations. It moisturizes while also slightly mattifying. Itâ€™s great for daytime but I think the rich cream will work better for nighttime. The only negative was there is a strange hard plastic scent but not a deal breaker Definitely worth the price
