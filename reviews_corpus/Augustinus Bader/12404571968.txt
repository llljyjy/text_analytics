My skin tends to be combination skin however i find my face runs a little more oily and breaks out without a lot of products. I didnt have this issue here. Pricy yes however I’ll say it’s not gunky and think like alot of moisturizers I have tried. Typically I feel like I can never get them to rub in or they feel heavy or greasy. I haven’t had that issue with this one. The bottle is too cute the outside is like a gunmetal blue then you have an inner tube that sits flat on a hard surface if you prefer. I did notice pores to be minimized and it has virtually no smell at all which is also nice. No smell and blends well very light
