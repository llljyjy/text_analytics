I just have to say that this product is the most amazing thing I have ever put on my face. I am 57, have some fine lines, loss of elasticity and texture. I got a couple of little samples from Sephora and only use it the night before when I want my skin to look good the next day. I wake up feeling like I have new skin! I canâ€™t afford to buy these products but if I could, I would be hooked for life!! nan
