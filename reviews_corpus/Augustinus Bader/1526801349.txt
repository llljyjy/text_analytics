I’ve been using this cream for about a month. It is very light weight which I like a lot.  It spreads nicely and does not clog  pores. It’s really hard for me to tell if creams help with wrinkles or not but I feel like this cream is doing good for my skin. I do feel like it has some pore minimization and it matte so my face does not look greasy afterward. It’s a quality product with high end  ingredients. The packaging is beautiful,  however it does not stand up because of the tube like shape of the bottle. The bottom is rounded. If you want it to stand upright on your dresser you have to put it upside down. I thought that was kind of weird and so it kind of just rolls around on my counter which I don’t really like.    overall I am pleased and would recommend. nan
