This cream is very light on the skin, it delivers a decent amount of moisturization. For me, it was good but not great. My skin leans on the drier side, so this worked pretty well during the summer months, but will not withstand winters. The price tag is quite high, but my skin texture improved over the month I tested it. Also, it does provide a perfect base for makeup with no pilling. Worth a shot if you want to try one of the Bader products! Another hit from Augustinus Bader
