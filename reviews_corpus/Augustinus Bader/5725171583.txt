Purchased for mostly dry skin and dark spots. The first day I noticed a difference in skin texture and my skin looked fabulous! I decided to apply at night given the cost. The second day I woke up with a whitehead on my chin. I’m not prone to acne but didn’t think anything of it. The third day, woke up with a whitehead on the side of my nose. I skipped a day and did not wake up with any whiteheads. The 4th day, I applied a lighter amount on my nose and chin but I still woke up with two huge whiteheads on my nose. I did some research and found that whiteheads were common with some people. After the once a day application for 4 days, aside from the whiteheads, I didn’t notice any other improvements as others have mentioned with minimal use. Happy Sephora accepted my return. Gave me whiteheads
