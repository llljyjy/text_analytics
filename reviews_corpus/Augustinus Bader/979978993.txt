Not worth the hype/price. Thought I’d give AB products a try after all the amazing reviews. Using this along with the face wash and toner for a few months now. Honestly, I’m not impressed and see better results with Sunday Riley, Tata Harper or Drunk Elephant comparable (and significantly cheaper) products. Will not be repurchasing. nan
