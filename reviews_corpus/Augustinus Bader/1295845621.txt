This is such a luxurious cream! I received it in as exchange for my honest review and I’m very glad to give it. To my skin this is a miracle worker. It is rich and thick and so super moisturizing and soothing. I prefer to use it at night when my skin can be nurtured and rested. Although even during the daytime it soaks right in and let’s me apply makeup very easily. I honestly love this cream and am looking into purchasing other items from this line. Wonderful cream
