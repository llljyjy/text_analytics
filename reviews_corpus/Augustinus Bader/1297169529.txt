I received this Augustinus Bader The Light Cream from Influenster and Augustinus Bader for free, in exchange for my honest review. As this face cream comes from a prestigious brand, I have high expectations for what it can deliver to my skincare routine. This Light Cream version promotes a mattifying, moisturized, radiant complexion that aids in minimizing oily skin. As its high price indicates, this cream is to be far superior than similar prestige brand products. This cream felt light, fresh and instantly absorbed when applied. However, within minutes this cream made my skin dry and seeking extra hydration. A disappointment, to say the least. I expected much better from this cream, and therefore can’t recommend given the price point. Expectations Weren’t Met
