Pricey splurge to reduce the crepe look under my eyes. It’s not an under eye cream, however I use it all over my face and neck. When this runs out I’ll have to make a decision whether to reorder this or La Mer. I like that this has a pump so it seems more sanitary, however for the price the other seems to last longer.
