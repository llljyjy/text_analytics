Love this bottle of magic. A little goes a long way and it does wonders for the skin…it preps it for the next step of this product like which is “The Rich Cream.”  Before using this product; my face had a lot of texture, but after using it; I can say that it visibly shrinks pores and helps with texture while taking care of my sensitive skin. nan
