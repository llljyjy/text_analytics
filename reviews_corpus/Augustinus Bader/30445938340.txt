First impressions when I received product from Influensterto try for my honest review- the packaging was sobougie and just a step above anything else I’ve evertried. I had never heard of this brand but instantlywithout even trying the product yet I knew I was going tobe trying an expensive product that might exceed allexpectations. I was so eager to try this out after readingall about it. First thing I noticed was it’s creamy textureand lack of any scent whatsoever. Which I can trulyappreciate. Next was how velvety soft it felt on my skin.After a couple hours I noticed that my skin still felthydrated to the touch! The claims they make are no joke!Their telling the truth! Your skin will drink this in like water.I’m afraid to go back to other moisturizers. But I’m afraidat $175 a bottle I will have to. Thank god for Influenster orI wouldn’t ever have the luxury of trying this little luxury! Oily skin girls, this one is for you honey!
