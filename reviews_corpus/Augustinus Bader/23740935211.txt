I was very excited to get this from Influenster and give it a try. The light cream seemed like a great option for the very hot humid summers where I live. I liked that the cream had no smell and felt very light once on my face. Some moisturizers just seem to make your face more greasy when it is humid out but this one didn’t. It went on nicely and didn’t make me feel greasy.  I did not however see any improvements to how my skin looked. It was just a nice cream. Also the packaging looks nice and makes it seem more luxurious, however the rounded bottom makes it impossible to stand up. You can twist the rounded part off and it just becomes a regular flat bottomed bottle. So the rounded piece seems like a waste. Overall this is a decent cream, but not one I would pay that much money for. Good cream for summer
