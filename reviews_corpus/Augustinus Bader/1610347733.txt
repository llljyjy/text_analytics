I received this product for free for testing purposes. I was really excited to try this much hyped product as I know it’s very popular with celebrities. It did the job but wasn’t perfect for me. This is a lightweight cream moisturizer that claims it “hydrates, balances, visibly renews, and protects while improving the complexion’s appearance and preventing unwanted shine”. I have combination skin and usually require a slightly thicker moisturizer. I definitely saw that it was mattifying and provided moisture but not enough for this skin! My complexion did look a bit better when used so maybe if I used it longer, I would see better results. I didn’t use this under makeup so can’t comment on how it combines with foundation, etc. Overall, I liked this product but needed a thicker formula for my skin type. I think over time, it could do as it claims. I am not sure it’s worth the cost though at $175 per 1 oz/30ml. Also, the packaging is beautiful but why have a rounded bottom!? You would either have to store it upside down or laying on its side. Good but not sure it’s worth the price
