I use Tretnoin and have very irritated dry skin because of it. This was SO soothing. I can’t even believe how gentle and moisturizing this is. It has an odd scent, but it doesn’t stick around long. I love that there is a refill option so I don’t feel as wasteful throwing the jar out every time I purchase a new o e. Soooooo soothing!
