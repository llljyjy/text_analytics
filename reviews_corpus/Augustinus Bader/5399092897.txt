I’ve literally switched out 85% of all skincare products to AB. I was skeptical of this because of the price, but omg. It’s the third time I’ve used this since purchasing and my skin feel so much more firm. I really wish Sephora carried refill options because I don’t see why I would need to repurchase a nomad? I am switching out my LaMer serum once finished and this will be my only, holy grail serum. AB is reigns supreme
