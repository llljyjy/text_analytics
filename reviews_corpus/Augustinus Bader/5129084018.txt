I have such annoying oily skin. As much matte or oil control products as I try, by end of an evening, any photos of me is just  my glaring t-zone.This cream has been a game changer. After applying it, my face felt moisturized but not heavy. I applied make up on after (and I use full coverage liquid foundation) and everything blended well.And a few hours later, my face was still holding up, a lot less oily than usual by that time frame mark. Though the bottle is nice, the curved bottom did make it a bit hard to maneuver as it has to be placed on its side (where it can roll) or upside down.The product is a costly penny so it comes down to if you are willing to invest in your face. Product wise, it works! nan
