Oh my goodness serum is amazing. It melted into my skin, my skin drank it up! I only use it before bed just a couple time a week to conserve due to the price and only after I exfoliate with Dr. Barbara Strum enzyme powder cleanser (you can get a cheaper alternative with same formulation on Amazon - Dr. Babor to try before u splurge) This serum is gold for me. I always rub on my neck and chest any left overs on the backs of my hands. Gotta spread the love with skin care. Love this serum for a couple times a week
