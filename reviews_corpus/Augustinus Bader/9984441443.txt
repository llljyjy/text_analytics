It helped my dry skin so much and didn’t irritate my skin.  Lately a lot of skincare items have bothered my skin and made it itch.  This stuff was great. I had flakey super dry skin before and after using this, my skin feels and looks healthy again. My only complaint is the scent. It has no added fragrance which is awesome but it has an odd smell like maybe it’s shelf life is almost up.  I’m curious if it’s just my jar or if that’s what it smells like. If you are desperate for dry skin relief and nothing is working, you should try this. I know it’s expensive but it’s worth it if your face is uncomfortable.  A little goes a long way too. I’ve been using it daily since it arrived a few weeks ago and I still have about 85% of it left. I’d recommend this cream. If your face is dry, this will help!
