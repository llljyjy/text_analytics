I’m in my 60’s and decided to try this. My skin looked and felt great, but it only lasted 6-8 weeks because I’m so dry. I loved it but because it was so expensive I couldn’t justify it until I layered it with Paula’s 2% BHA exfoliant. It made it go so much further and the results in my skin are nothing short of miraculous! The little bumps I kept getting are gone and the rich cream is moisturizing enough now to use a little less and put on makeup. Whether I wear makeup or not, I get complete strangers complimenting me on my skin. I was able to get 5-6 months out of my last purchase. I also supplement with the Bader body cream on my face at night with Paula’s Choice 2% BHA. Too heavy for the day for me but great as a night cream! nan
