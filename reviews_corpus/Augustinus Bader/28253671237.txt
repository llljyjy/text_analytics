What a nice and thick cream that doesnt make your face greasy feeling. It goes on nice and smooth and blends very well. You dont have to use very much because it is thick and a lot goes a long way. Even though this is a bit pricey it makes up cause you get to keep the glass container and buy refills to put in there. nan
