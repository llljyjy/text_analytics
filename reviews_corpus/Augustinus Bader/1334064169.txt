This is a nice, light moisturizer.  It feels nice going in, absorbs nicely and it doesn’t seem to make my breakout prone skin any worse. I only gave it 4 stars because for the cost of this, I don’t know if it is worth it.  Even thought I have combination to oily skin, I do have some dry patches, and I don’t know if this does much for them. Also, the rounded bottom on the metal packaging makes it very difficult to store this without laying it down. Light, non greasy moisturizer
