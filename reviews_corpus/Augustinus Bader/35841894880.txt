it’s a really nice and lightweight texture, and is perfect for humid, warmer temperatures in the summer! it’s a nice formula however honestly kind of overpriced for what it is. i understand it’s a high end brand and i’ve been loving it for some time however there are a lot more affordable and effective ones out there. but if your willing to spend a bit of money, this is the product for you. loved everything about it except the price
