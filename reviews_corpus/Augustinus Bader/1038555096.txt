I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  I used this product daily as directed for a period of 5 weeks. At the outset I was pleased with the product. It has no smell, which is nice. I was further impressed with how the product moisturized my face and made my face feel smooth. However, I did not experience and reduction in fine lines and/or wrinkles, nor did I find the product to be mattifying.  The attached picture is me, after showing and cleaning my face, with the product on and nothing else. I also found the productâ€™s packaging difficult, as it was curved on the bottom and would not stand up. I resorted to storing it upside down. In conclusion, I do not believe that the product is worth the $175.00 price given that, to me, it was just a good moisture. nan
