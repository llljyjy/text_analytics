I have never tried this brand before so I was excited to sample The Light Cream. I was concerned because it is labeled as a mattifying cream. My skin is dry so I don’t like a matte look. The finish isn’t dewy, but it looks like clean hydrated skin, very natural. I apply this after my serum. My skin drinks this right in and it doesn’t feel like it is sitting on the top of my skin. It feels like nothing at all which is great when it is so hot out. My skin felt nourished all day. The consistency is almost serum like and one or two pumps is all you need. The container is odd, it has a rounded test tube shape bottom. You have to store it upside down or lay it down on the counter. Not a big deal but a weird design for a high end product. I would definitely recommend this product. I received a free bottle in exchange for my honest review. The Light Cream
