*I was gifted this product by the brand via Influenster in exchange for an honest review* I was really interested to try this product, as I’d tried the Rich Cream and did not feel it lived up to the hype. The Light Cream, however, was a pleasant surprise! I use it over serum and sunscreen in the morning (I opt for something heavier to use over actives in the evening) and it provides just the right amount of moisture to make my combination skin feel not too tight, not too oily, and to prevent it from going either of those directions throughout the day. Normally creams this light leave me feeling dry in spots, even during a humid summer, but this almost-gel-like formula is my Goldilocks: just right!I didn’t give it five stars for two reasons.  First, the packaging - it comes in a while beautiful, very impractical bottle that’s rounded at the bottom (like a capsule) that prevents it from being able to stand up on its own. Another helpful review tipped me off that you can remove the capsule (twist and pull) and find a normal bottle underneath, but that normal bottle isn’t anywhere near as attractive. For this price (my second reason - WHY is it so high!!), I don’t want to choose between counter real estate and pretty packaging. If these two things don’t bother you though, I definitely recommend giving it a try!! Better than Expected
