Disclaimer: I typically don’t trust incentivized reviews. However, this cream is AMAZING! I have always struggled to find products that work for my sensitive skin. You name it, I’ve tried it and I have to say I prefer this over the other high end creams. I’ve been using this cream for over a month now and visibly you can see the difference. It feels like with each use, my skin is becoming healthier and more vibrant. I even wake up looking refreshed despite only applying it after my morning shower. My best friend even asked me what I have been using to clean my face because it’s been a noticeable difference. I truly love this product and would recommend to everyone. This is my new staple. Worth every cent
