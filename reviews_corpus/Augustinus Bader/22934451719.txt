I got a sample of this with my order and I was not happy. I tried it by itself, and it started peeling nonstop all over my face and neck. It is extremely watered down and doesn’t have that thick, luxurious feel. Complete waste of a sample and unneeded hype around this product. Don’t waste your money on such a poor cream. Don't even think about it
