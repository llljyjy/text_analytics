I am accustomed to using high end moisturizers, so my skin already looked really good prior to using this product. I loved the bold packaging and bottle aesthetics, although it sort of messes with my organized nature to store it upside down due to the shape of the bottle. I’ve been using it twice a day for three weeks, and my skin hasn’t experienced any drastic changes; however, I do notice a reduction in hyperpigmentation after viewing my before and after photos. It’s scent-free and consists of a nice and light formulation that doesn’t clog pores. The dispensing pump is also easy to use, but due to the opaque bottle, I’m not sure I’ll be given a warning shot before it runs out. Lovely light moisturizer
