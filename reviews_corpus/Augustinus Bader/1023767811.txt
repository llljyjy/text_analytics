I wanted to give this 5 stars but I found that my skin was still a bit dry after using this. I’ve been told it’s the niacinamide and to alternate with another lotion to ease it in. That helped significantly.  I want to try the soothing cream next to see if that works better. The eye cream is amazeballs! Yes but ease into it.
