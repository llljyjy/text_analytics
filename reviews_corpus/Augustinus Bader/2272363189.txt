My skin was a complete mess when I received this product! I was having a reaction to something and also I am post menopausal and I was put on hormones and began to break out. This was a life save the cream is smooth not greasy at all! Not heavy either like some repair creams. I used it every evening and within a few days my skin began to calm down and get clearer. You can use twice a day but I decided for once a day! I have sensitive skin so I am usually hesitant to try new products this was a winner. In two weeks my skin was back to looking great and it just continues to get better. The first picture is the after and second the before. Awesome
