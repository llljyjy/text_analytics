I’m always on the lookout for a light yet moisturizing cream and this certainly did the trick! Comes in a luxurious blue pump bottle, I use this as my last step in my skincare routine.

This seems to absorb quite well into my skin.My only gripe is that the bottle is round on the bottom so it doesn’t stand lol. Moisturizing without feeling heavy
