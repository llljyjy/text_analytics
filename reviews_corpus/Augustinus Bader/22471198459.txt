Augustinus Bader’s The Ultimate Soothing Cream is a wonderful cream moisturizer that soothes and hydrates my skin perfectly. I have normal to dry skin with redness from rosacea and after using this my skin is less red and so soft. I only need a small pea-sized amount to cover my entire face. This didn’t leave my skin oily at all. It soaks in and left my skin dry to the touch, but hydrated and firm. I could actually feel my skin firm up, as if I had a mini face lift, especially around my eye area. It plumps up from within the skin as opposed to leaving a layer of moisturizer on top of the skin. The blue glass jar is beautiful and I love that you can purchase a refill container that snaps into the jar. I would definitely consider purchasing this product in the future. Since I only need a small amount, it should last at least 3 to 6 months with daily use. Perfect Balance of Hydration
