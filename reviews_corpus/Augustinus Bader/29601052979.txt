I absolutely love this Cream, it drenches the skin with moisture. I love lighter skin creams sometimes because they soak into the skin better. The packaging is really nice, and there is not a strong fragrance so you can wear it around that one who always has allergies . Haha I love this and I got this as a sample for my opinion. I would recommend this product. Itâ€™s great for me. nan
