I love that it has no scent. It really does hydrate your face. Doesn’t leave a sticky or nasty film. since it’s only been a few days I haven’t noticed a dramatic change but I do see my pores not as big. I’m sure in a couple weeks I’ll see a difference. I have no complaints with this cream. Must try!
