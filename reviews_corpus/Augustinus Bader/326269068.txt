Purchased once, hoping it would be all hype but noâ€¦.this is the real deal for me. It is the only thing I have found that removes the dry/scaly areas I have and leaves me glowing.  When I stopped using this, they returned.  It also is very healing on abrasions or acne.  Leaves a really beautiful glow and I believe there are cumulative benefits to using it.  Tried to replace with a couple of really great, high end, natural ingredient products from a brand I love but not anywhere nearly as effective.  Spots still dry and actually got worse.  So I will grudgingly continue to purchase.  Great stuff! Love this in spite of the hype!
