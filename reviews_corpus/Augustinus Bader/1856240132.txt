I’ve been using augustinus bader products for 2 years now. There is not one I dislike, but they are each great for different times of the year. This is a great product for year round, and my new favorite from AB. I notice my skin is calmed within minutes of use, and I’m no longer getting the little breakouts. The smell (lead pencil) is interesting, but not bothersome. I am noticing my skin is tolerating the acids in my routine a lot better. I like the rich cream (great for summer), but this one is so much better. This cream pairs really well with the Victoria Beckham AB Serum. That serum did not pair well with the rich cream. Great for calming - does what it says
