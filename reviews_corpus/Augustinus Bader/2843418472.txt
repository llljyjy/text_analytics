Mystified why this cream is so raved about, after a months use it has done absolutely nothing for my fine lines, pores, redness, or dryness. It is absolutely nothing special and has actually lead to a bit of milia around my eye orbitals which I have never experienced before. Almost relieved this isnt actually effective so I dont feel the need to purchase this insanely overpriced product again. Dont waste your money, nothing special!!!
