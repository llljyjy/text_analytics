It’s just a regular serum. It’s nothing special. You’re paying for the brand name. But it’s pretty humorous to see people still fear mongering, pushing the false “clean beauty” agenda. Not to mention the shaming of ppl who can’t afford a nearly $400 skincare product. You don’t need this, smth like the inkey list is perfectly acceptable. Only pay this much if you WANT to, wanting high end products is completely relatable. but don’t shame the ppl who can’t or won’t. It’s definitely a serum! lets stop exaggerating <3
