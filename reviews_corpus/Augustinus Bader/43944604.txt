I received a sample tube of this cream. I am really happy with what’s it’s doing for my skin. I apply it on the morning, and hours later my skin still feels moisturized and looks glowy. It’s expensive, but it might be my birthday present to myself. I’m also thinking this one product may be able to replace 2 or 3 other products I’m currently using. Great hydrator
