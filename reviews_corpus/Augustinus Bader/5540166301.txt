I really like this cream. It’s light weight and controls shine. My T-Zone gets oily and can be hard to control, but this cream did a great job at mattifying these areas. When my nose gets oily my pores appear larger and this reduces the appearance of my pores a lot.  I found this worked great alone and with make-up. Something I don’t like about mattifying products is that it typically makes mature skin look worse, but this is moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and plump. It’s a clean product and addresses multiple concerns which is a winner in my book. It’s on the expensive side, but a little goes a long way and the performance makes it worth the price. I definitely recommend this cream. I love Augustinus Bader's “The Light Cream”!!
