was hoping to love this. It was a light cream that absorbed nicely into the skin and kept my skin matte, as I have battled with my oily skin; however,  for the price point, I did not see any other additional benefits that would make me want to change from my usual moisturizer.  I have been using this cream for a little over a month, so I may need to use it longer (and will update my review accordingly). It worked well under makeup and did not cause any reactions/breakouts like most products do for me, so that was another nice thing about it. nan
