This is an un-incentivized review! I’ve been using this product for over a month and see no more positive results than any other upscale eye cream. It’s just OK and at that price, it should be a lot better. Any good peptide/moisturizer eye cream would work just as well. I just bought the inner refill and keep it my own ceramic container. It’s just OK
