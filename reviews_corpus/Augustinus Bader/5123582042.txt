Ok, yes, I’m impressed. I don’t say that often. This cream is remarkable. The results are both instantaneous and long term. I’m not a believer in miracle products, I think creams can only do so much. I rarely wear daily moisturizers because I dislike having a coat of cream on my face and I honestly prefer the natural texture of my skin — I have very good skin but still, creams never give the skin a nice texture. You can always see it. I use masks and treatments. Anyway, this cream (provided that you don’t expect miracles) is really the best I’ve used (and I have tried everything from Lara Devgan to Fresh to Lancôme to Glossier to Sisley to cheap pharmacy brands to French brands unfindable in the US). It is scentless (yay!), comes in a pump (great!), and it just gives you skin the most seamless ‘improvement’ I’ve seen. After a few minutes, you can’t see it anymore it just melts away and your skin is smoother. But what’s impressive is that the instant effect actually improves the more you use it. I’m more impressed now than the first time I tried it. I’m in my late 40s, so my skin shows fatigue more easily and is prone the hormonal changes — let’s say I have good skin and bad skin days. This cream is a sort of stabilizer. And my skin is sensitive (rosacea) and my eyes prone to styes. This is a very, very good product. excellent product
