Perfect fall/winter cream! I tried it in the summer for 30 days and while it gave amazing results and kept me hydrated for 24 hours, itâ€™s so thick it makes my face sweat on hot days. You can feel the protective layer it gives when trying to wash your face. It seems like a waterproof layer on my skin locking in all the moisture. I would definitely recommend but I wish it was more affordable. Best winter cream I've tried
