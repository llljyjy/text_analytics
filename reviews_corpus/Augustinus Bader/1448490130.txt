I really enjoyed the packaging of the cream. It was very luxe. The cream itself was of a gel like consistency, wgich is good for me since i have extremely oily skin and live in a very humid environment. A con I found is that it had an almost automotive smell to it...it reminded me of going with my dad to Auto Zone when he needed to get parts. The smell does not linger however, which is good. Once the cream is on, you need to make sure you let it sink into your skin for a good 5 minutes before putting other products on top. If you donâ€™t, it may peel up. Yet, there is something beautiful about my makeup when I have this cream on that I can not explain. It looks flawless and lasts all day. The Gel Cream
