I received this product as a promotion. I have mature skin that is normal to dry. Sometimes it can be sensitive, but this Light Cream didn’t bother me at all. This cream has a very light, almost gel-like texture. The pump only dispenses a small amount, but it spreads very easily and a little goes a long way. I did find that I need 2 pumps to cover my face and neck. I like that it isn’t greasy or perfumed. It soaks right into my skin and leaves no sticky residue. It would be perfect for daytime use under makeup, but I wish it had an SPF. For nighttime, I prefer something more moisturizing. I think one of their creams that weren’t matte or light would have been a better option for me. Regardless, it works great under makeup, and my skin feels super smooth after using it! Great moisturizer under makeup
