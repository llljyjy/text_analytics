I have struggled with oily skin for years. My face is generally an oil slick by mid-morning, no matter what I do, but this product has given me hope! I apply it right before my primer, which leaves my face feels moisturized, much less oily, and my makeup looking great. I was also able to push my mid-morning makeup touch up back by several hours. Definitely worth the money, and will be adding this to my routine going forward. nan
