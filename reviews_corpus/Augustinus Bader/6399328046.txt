LOVE!!! So lightweight. Iâ€™ve been using all there products for over a year. I went on Accutane twice and pretty much EVERY brand is too strong for my skin except the brand. I really love this moisturizer for summer. Definitely plan to keep it in stock. One thing to not is I always take of the round cover so that it can stand alone by itself. perfect for summer!!!
