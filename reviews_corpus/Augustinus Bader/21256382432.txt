I loved The Light Cream. It was so quickly absorbed into my skin leaving it soft and hydrated. I love the mattifying effect as well. I also appreciate the fact that this cream is fragrance free as well as a vegan product. This was my first time using Augustinus Bader and I canâ€™t wait to try some other products A great cream
