I recieved this product for free from Influenster and Augustinus Bader in exchange for my honest opinion. My skin has always been slightly sensitive and somewhat prone to dryness and angry red patches. At 37, I also have those lovely fine lines creeping in. The Light Cream has a consistency that I would describe as silky cream. It is not thick or tacky when you pump it into your hand and not so runny it runs through your fingers. There is a slight medicinal scent to it when you first apply it but it quickly dissipates as does the product itself, happily absorbed by my skin. In roughly a minute my face appears dry but is hydrated. It’s unlike any other cream I have tried thus far in that while being moisturized, my skin does not look dewy. The mattifying affect is really something else. It’s almost like a lens filter for your skin. Gone is the shine other creams leave, and left instead is happy, healthy looking skin. Somewhat hard to describe but it’s like a skin perfecter. After 3 weeks of use, my skin has not felt dry or had any angry red patches. It’s soft and beautiful really. So natural and healthy looking.The reason I did not give The Light Cream 5 stars is because while it is an attractive bottle, the bottom is rounded and it sits upside-down on my vanity making it somewhat of an odd duck (someone please tell me if there is a better way to store it). It is also somewhat pricey and without knowing what it does, the price point might scare some off from even trying it. I wish there was 1/2 star increments as I would only dock 1/2 a star. Unlike any other
