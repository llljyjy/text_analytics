Overall, I found this face moisturizer to be just ok and would never pay full price for it. I have semi-dry skin and when putting it on at night, I often felt like I needed additional moisture. I think maybe the matte nature contributed to that feeling. It’s definitely light weight but maybe too lightweight. I used it every evening for several weeks and I liked it but I can’t say I noticed any significant changes to my skin versus my regular moisturizer. Finally, it’s super cool that the container is refillable and I look forward to using it for travel in the future after I use up this product, but the fact that the bottom is round is really silly. I had to either store it in a bin on its side or upside down on my dresser. Plus, it kinda looks like a vibrator, which just makes me laugh. nan
