Okay, first off, the packaging for this product is EVERYTHING. Y’all, this comes in recyclable metal container and feels super expensive. I really, really like the recycle factor. So, here’s the deal. As the name suggests, this is a light cream, and that’s how it feels. Don’t expect some heavy night time cream. I’ve been wearing it under my make up in the morning and I’ve been very pleased. I have combo skin, so I often end up with dry flaky spots at the end of the day and other areas that are super oily. This cream just evens everything out: no dry flaky spots (honestly, I get those even with heavy creams, but not with this one!!!!) while the normally oily areas don’t feel super slick. This product is an unscented, which is a plus for people with sensitivities. I’m sold! Great for combo skin
