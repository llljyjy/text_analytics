I have used Augustinus Bader skincare and hair care before - and liked it - and this did not disappoint! As this cream is rich, thick and heavy, it is a sore thing post sun exposure, lasers or skincare peels/treatments. It may be quite rich for other purposes or should you have oily or acne prone skin. For the purpose of healing and soothing, five stars. Excellent. The lightest fragrance which is in no way “perfumey”. Excellent luxurious cream
