I received this as a sample (2 small tubes). have combination skin and have always disliked deep moisturizers that just sit on the surface and look greasy. This one takes the cake. It does not absorb at all. My hair stick in it. Looks like I smeared Vaseline on. Honestly can’t understand why someone would WANT to put this on their face let alone pay the exorbitant price. Super Greasy—does not absorb
