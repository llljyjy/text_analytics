I was very excited to be gifted the Augustinue Bader the light cream by Influenster. Augustinue Bader is a brand I have been wanting to try. The cream is fine. I have been using it for a little over 3 weeks now and havent noticed much of a difference in my skin or tone. It does leave a film behind that I dont love so I dont think it feels super moisturizing. The cream is light and doesnt have any smell which I like. Overall, I probably wouldnâ€™t add this product to my routine because of the price and I dont feel like it has really done anything for my skin. Just ok for me
