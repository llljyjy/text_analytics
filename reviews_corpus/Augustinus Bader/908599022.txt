This would be great for individuals with oily skin, because it has a semi-matte finish. I (40 yo) have combination skin, and tend to be on the slightly drier side so I need to prep this with a hydrating serum and follow with a moisturizing sunscreen. The consistency is smooth and absorbs quickly, and requires 2 pumps for my face. The pump dispenses a small amount which is good because there’s less wastage. I don’t love the packaging because I can’t tell how much the bottle really contains, and it will be difficult to get any residual cream from the container once the bottle is empty. The packaging does make the moisturizer more luxurious though. I don’t think I’d purchase this cream again, but if I did, I’d opt for the rich cream. It’s an expensive moisturizer, and I think there are creams out there that are comparable for less. This is only after using the product for a few weeks, so it may take a few months to actually see a difference. If you have the money to spend, then it may be worth trying. nan
