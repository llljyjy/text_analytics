I’m a big fan of Augustinus Vader’s The Rich Cream.  However, in the hot Texas summer, my skin was ready for something lighter. The Light Cream has a lovely texture similar to a serum and a little goes a lot further than you would think. My combo skin was having some mild summer breakouts and they seemed to go away after a couple weeks of use and my skin texture improved. There isn’t really much of a scent, which is great. I took off one star for the shape of the container. I like when I can set my products upright. This is curved like a test tube, so it rolls off the counter. My skin leans quite dry in spots and I personally need a little more moisture  in those areas than this gives.  It’s also pricey. That being said, I did really like it and would use again. Lovely, light moisturizer
