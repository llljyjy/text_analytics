The Ultimate Soothing Cream by Augustinus Bader is a perfect example of luxury meeting efficiency. Not only does it feel delicious to apply, with its dense and silky texture, a little goes a long way and delivers instant, noticeable results. I’ve been using this for a couple of months now and during that time I’ve spent weeks making a movie in the frigid Alaskan winter, then flown long haul to Australia and back and battled the jet lag on both ends, endured a wicked case of the flu, and commenced the dry, hot California summer. All of that is a lot to ask your skin to tolerate and I swear, the product that has gotten me through and kept my skin hydrated, firm, even in tone and smooth is this cream. I absolutely love it. The blue jar is eye-catching and chic, and I also love that Augustinus Bader offers eco-friendly, refillable packaging to reduce waste. All in all, I highly recommend this product. Whilst it’s on the higher end of the price spectrum, its quality and effect absolutely makes it worth the investment. A truly luxurious cream of the highest quality
