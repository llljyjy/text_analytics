I received this product for free from Augustinus Bader and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this product for the past month. The eye cream packaging is very luxurious and it was a very special experience to open it. The cream itself is in a small tube. The price point of this cream is very high, but I have noticed a huge difference in the fine lines around my eyes since using this product. I am 32 and just starting to see noticeable crows feet. The lines are visibly diminished. Weirdly, I have also received more complements on my skin since using this product. I wish I had taken before and after photos! I love that this product is clean and backed by science. Although it is expensive, I would and have recommended this product to my friends. I will very likely try more of the Augustinus Bader line in the future. Noticeable Difference!
