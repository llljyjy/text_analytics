I was super excited to receive The Light Cream from Augustinus Bader in exchange for my honest review. I’ve heard such great things about the brand that I couldn’t wait to see if it lived up to the hype. I’m happy to report that for me, this product absolutely did!The first thing I noticed was the beautiful blue and bronze aluminum packaging. It’s stunning, and feels significant (not cheap or flimsy) in your hand. It definitely has a very luxe feel and appearance.The cream itself has a lightweight consistency, more like a creamy serum than an actual cream. It has no noticeable scent. It applies like a dream and absorbs quickly, leaving a natural finish. My dry skin feels moisturized and even at the end of a hot, humid Florida summer day, not the least bit greasy. It wears well under sunscreen and makeup, but can get a little pilly if I apply too much.Since this is so lightweight, it may not be enough moisture for winter, but during the summer it’s been my holy grail daytime moisturizer. It’s spendy, but if the budget allows, I will definitely be repurchasing.My only complaint (aside from price) is that the packaging is rounded on the bottom so it doesn’t stand up. Not sure what the purpose of that is, however, it’s certainly not a deal breaker for me.If you can afford it and are looking for a lightweight moisturizer that works well in humid climates, I definitely recommend giving this one a try. Lives Up to the Hype
