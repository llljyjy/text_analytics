Soft and nice feel when resting on them. Nice packaging. Love the zipper idea but itâ€™s game over when you wash them because the material rips away from the zipper. My $110 pillowcases look a horrid mess. Not worth the money and I would not buy these again until they fix the performance and quality around the zipper; prevention of them from ripping to shreds after a wash. No slip 2nite
