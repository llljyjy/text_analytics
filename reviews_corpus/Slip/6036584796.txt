I have the envelope case and it’s the second one I’ve purchased in a few years. The first one accidentally ended up in the washing machine and dryer so I kept it and used it for the days that my second one is being laundered. I NEVER put it in the machine and always always hand wash mine with a clean silk specific detergent. I know that might be too time consuming for people but I don’t trust silk in any kind of machine no matter what kind of bag or cycle it’s on. It’s buttery and almost rubbery silky soft and will for years this way. I let it soak in cold water for 15 min after I’ve agitated it and squished it with my hands and the detergent for a few min, rinse it with cold, lay it flat on a towel and roll the towel up, squishing it as I go. It dries after that in less than an hour and really is simple. I can’t sleep without this case and my hair almost never sheds in bed anymore. nan
