I love how this eye mask feels. It states it’s supposed to help absorb less product (if you skincare junkie) than other materials and be better for your skin. The mask is completely silk inside and out but my biggest pet peeve is that I got a marble shade and you can kinda see light through??????? What’s the point of an eye sleeping mask? That should be like the first point in wearing it no?! For someone who likes to travel and avoid light without necessarily making other people live in darkness (lol sounds dramatic but you get my drift) why spend 50 on a eye sleeping mask and it’s not completely blackout? Don’t know what’s the momme of the silk either as it’s not stated so who knows if it’s low density (aka cheaper, more prone to last less) but if it is it could probably explain why a lot of reviews complain about it ruining so fast. However, silk is delicate so thats important to note. Agree with everyone else. Could pay less for something else. Grab one if you find it for the price of a typical one. That’s when I’ll recommend it. Good product but it’s missing a couple things
