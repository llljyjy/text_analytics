I can’t actually review the product’s quality because I never received it as described. The caramel case is NOT an envelope case, it is a zipper case. I contacted Sephora when I received it and they re-shipped another to see what would come and once again it was a zipper case. Reading other reviews about the zippers steered me away from wanting a zipper so I’ll be returning both and looking for an alternate brand elsewhere. Super disappointing. I don’t want to keep mine and hope I’m one of the lucky ones whose case doesn’t fall apart… Wrong Product
