Not advertised correctly. I specifically purchased a slip one because it said it had an envelope closure, not a zipper one. It arrived this morning and has a zipper closure. This is not good for the silk as it will warp over time. Not worth the price if it is not an envelope closure. It is very likely to rip Not pleased
