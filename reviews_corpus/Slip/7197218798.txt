I have two of these. One has been used for about a year and is fine.  It is comfortable and stays cool.  The second one has developed a long tear along the edge after only a few months of use.  Clearly something is lacking in the quality control department.  This product is way too expensive to take my chances that I wonâ€™t get one that tears easily as is described in so many other reviews. Edge torn after only a couple months of use
