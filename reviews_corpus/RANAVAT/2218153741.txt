I had been on the search for a face moisturizer for a long time and was so happy to find this Ranavat cream. It’s got an wonderful consistency (not too thin or thick) and glides on my face very easy. It also absorbs into my skin very well and doesn’t leave a sticky or oily residue, which I’ve experienced with some other facial moisturizers. It’s also not so thin that my skin feels dry after a few hours and needs reapplication. I’ve used it now for several weeks and have really seen a different in how hydrated my skin is and the evenness of my skin tone. I’ve had no issues with acne with this cream, and my skin is so soft now. I put it on once in the morning and once at night. It has a very luxurious feel to it- the cream itself and the heavy glass bottle it comes in. I know many people on here didn’t like the smell of the cream, but I would it to be very delightful. It was a light floral fragrance which I very much enjoyed. The first time I put on the cream, my husband even asked what smells so good! I definitely recommend that you give it a try. Moisturizer that works amazing and feels luxurious
