I think I’ve found my forever cleanser. After struggling with acne since my teenage years, I’ve tried a few cleansers. However I wasn’t satisfied until I found this. After using the sample, I ordered the full-size product. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean without leaving it dry or irritated. in addition, It has definitely helped prevent further breakouts :) Favorite Cleanser
