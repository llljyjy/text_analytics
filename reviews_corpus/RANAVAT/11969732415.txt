I truly hope the producers of this read these reviews and reconsider their fragrance recipe of this because it’s one of the worst scents I’ve ever experienced with a beauty product. And I have had some stinky products! Maybe some like that old, rose water scent, but from the looks of the other reviews, not enough to warrant its overpowering use here. I too want to like it since it goes on nicely and has a velvety touch, but honestly, it’s also quite heavy and I just can’t get past the smell that stays with you since it’s on your face. I rarely have ever thrown away a sample but will be doing so with this one. Smell is just terrible :(
