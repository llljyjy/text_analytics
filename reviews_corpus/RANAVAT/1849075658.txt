I myself would not pay the $$ for this cream. Got a free sample jar in my order and while it smells nice the cream itself is a very thick dry textured cream. I found it hard to spread. For that reason I do not like it. Much better products for less that do a much better job at locking in my skincare that are occlusive and hydrating. Iâ€™ll stick to Tatcha Indigo overnight serum repair cream if I want to splurge. It was nice to try though. nan
