This is definitely a luxury item and splurge worthy if you’re trying to invest in a product that actually works in brightening the skin and has great ingredients. I like to use it in combo with my kansa wand for max self care. I will say it’s not too hydrating for someone with super dry skin such as myself - I always needed to add on a separate hydrating serum or additional moisturizer. This isn’t something I would say is essential to my skin care routine but truly only a nice plus if I want to be bougie. nan
