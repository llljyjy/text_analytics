I want to like this cream, but the smell is horrendous. It smells like roses and a thrift store. I donâ€™t knew how else to describe how terrible the smell is. This is unfortunate because I do like creams that have a thicker texture to them. It would be great the company would consider making this fragrance free. It smells like roses and thrift store
