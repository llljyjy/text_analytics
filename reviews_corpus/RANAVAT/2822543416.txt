Honestly one of the best products to use along with the Kansa wand. Consistency is key to noticing change. Iâ€™m in my 40s and this product has me hooked. I suffered from adult acne as soon as I turn 40 and due to the stress of the pandemic. But this serum is got me through it, with consistent use the occasional pimple is curbed, and heals easily! Amazing with consistency
