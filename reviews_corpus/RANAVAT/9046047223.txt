Have been using this from last 6 months now every day and its very generous size. I can still go on with the bottle for another month. SO total worth the money. Also I have lot of acne prone skin so I was initially hesitant about the pill nature of the product but turned out really well. I am doing laser for my face and my specialist totally approved this for daily use as it ha son harsh chemicals - thatâ€™s another great thing. I see much cleaner and clear face now. I can easily layer it with my daily sun screen and it doe snot make face look oily. Fantastic for every day use.
