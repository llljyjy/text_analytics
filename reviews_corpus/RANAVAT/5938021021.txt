First off, this smells incredible. I was a little hesitant at first because I thought the scent would be really artificial and cloying, but it’s not! It smells like actual fresh jasmine flowers. The spray is also really nice and distributes the product evenly. I can’t say that this is super hydrating, but it feels really nice putting this on right before my serum. If you don’t mind the high price tag for what is essentially just scented water and want to pamper yourself, then I’d say get this. nan
