I tend to forget to leave skincare reviews because it takes time to know if it works, then I forget and if I post, it won’t be “purchased verified”because it has passed the 90-days window. However, This deserves its flowers that it also is! I have sometimes sensitive, combo-skin that is exposed to drying chemical exfoliation. So I need something that will balance oil production w/o being too heavy to clog or too superficial that it will not actually absorb. It’s the reason I’m into gels/liquids more than creams. After looking through products, I bought this as it seemed to have a lot more pros and it surely does. It is simple, vegan, non-essential oil, non-irritant working with the acids I use, fine-misted, non-greasy/sticky, with no artificial fragrance. All packaged in a dark glass container, which is best to avoid rapid degradation and better for the environment when disposing. Most importantly, this jasmine mist has the ability to absorb into the skin to quench it rather than sit on top. Very soothing and the jasmine scent is not bothersome to me. I’m not a fan of jasmine scents sometimes, however, this one is natural and disappears shortly after misting!I keep it in my fridge to preserve, since it’s a more natural product composed of jasmine essence. 4 mists after the shower, when my face dries, is what I do even though 2 is really only needed but it feels great applying on the skin. Even topping up throughout the day is refreshing. My face doesn’t feel tight or sticky and my skin doesn’t over-produce oil to compensate for the lack of true moisture, usually the result from other products. Also, I haven’t broken out after incorporating this into my routine. I use it before all other skincare, my goat Ordinary Niacinamide serum, Glycolic Toner, sometimes AHA mask. So glad I bought 2 during the rouge sale so it can last me a while. Natural is not always better when it comes to skin products but here it is. Effective
