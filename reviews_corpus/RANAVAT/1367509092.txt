Ranavat products smell devine. An absolute treat if you love florals. This cream cleanser is quite lovely. I was a bit hesitant at first since I have oily/blemish-prone skin, but it surprisingly rinses clean, no remaining residue!  I especially like using it when I’m traveling to dry/cold areas or if I had just used a peel mask the night before. I appreciate that the packaging is recyclable after use, and because it’s a tube, you can get every bit of product out. The photos are literally me waking up, and after washing! FYI… the Ranavat site sells a gorgeous ‘ritual key’ that makes the tube look luxurious in the bathroom. An indulgent purchase… but hey, we all deserve it! Gentle and rinses clean!
