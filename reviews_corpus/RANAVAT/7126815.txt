I just love this cleanser. I had a sample and I never use cream cleansers on my combination, breakout prone skin. They never seem to get my skin clean enough and leave a residue. This is gentle yet my skin feels clean. No break outs, and I noticed a nice rosy glow after using. I actually have a back up tube so I don’t run out. Not sure how it manages to clean so well yet make my skin feel hydrated, but I’m not complaining. Favorite Cleanser!
