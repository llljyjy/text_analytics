This is the most luxurious mist I have ever tried! A lot of times a mist is more of a spray. It is more clumpy and lands like a droplet as opposed to mist. But this is like no other and that is just the application! It is so hydrating and leaves my skin dewy. The smell is pure divinity, Jasmine heaven! I think I found my ultimate mist. Love it! Get it. You need it! nan
