This is one of the best exfoliating products I’ve ever used and trust me I’ve used a lot of them. After using Wishful papaya enzyme scrub for a year I decided to give this beauty a shot and it worked wonders for me! Tatcha Rice Polish exfoliator is great but what sets this product apart from the rest is it’s luxurious fragrance and Ayurvedic properties. This product is definitely not for those people who are looking for strong chemical formula rich in lather and high number of rice granules. It’s formula is rich, soft and feels Royal on your skin! It definitely brings out the glow and is gentle on your skin. Best part is it comes in a cutesy travel size container as well! Hope this is useful! :) <3 Ranavat Product Review
