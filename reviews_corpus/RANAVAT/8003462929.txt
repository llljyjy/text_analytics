Though ranavat sent me a sample for review, I am already a dedicated user of this cleanser. I LOVE this cream cleanser - especially in the mornings. It is creamy, hydrating and reminds me of everything beautiful in my Indian childhood. The Subtle scent is so amazing and not cloying in any way. It takes off most make up, but not eye make up, so I usually use it as a second step in a double cleanse at night. Gorgeous, luxurious, I save it as a treat for myself in busy days nan
