Thisssss! This is the creamiest most luxurious cleanser. I need a cream cleanser that doesn’t dry me out any more than I already am but also doesn’t have any synthetic strong fragrance and this checks all the boxes. My skin feels so hydrated and clean after not striped at all. The smell is subtle and wonderful. It definitely feels like a ritual I’m excited to see how it helps my recently struggling skin. I took a before photo and one immediately after so not a lot of difference in 5 minutes that you can see but my skin feels soooo good. Not irritating and just great. nan
