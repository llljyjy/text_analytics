First, I did receive a sample but I had paid for the full size bottle well before it came, along with Kansa Wand. So opinions totally honest.Its beautiful facial serum with very strong saffron fragrance. It can be overwhelming if you do not prefer strong smelling facial product. Having said that, it absorbs very well. I have used other facial oil based serums and have in general broken out from daily use. Not with Radiant Rani. I was concerned, but it didnt happen in 4 weeks of regular use. A couple of drops was all I needed to massage and my skin felt invigorated. I have normalish skin with couple dry patches. I was careful not to layer with other heavy moisturiser and it worked well. So TLDR, lovely saffron smelling serum that absorbs well on massaging. If layering, I used light weight moisturiser after. Lovely serum!
