I got this cream and the EADAM cream as they were both recommended to me.First off, I have a very sensitive sniffer but even I didn’t ~mind~ the scent. It’s mild and barring you slather this under your nose it dissipates well enough to not be bothersome if you do mind the smell. It’s pretty thick and the heavy oils may turn off oily or acneogenic skin however I am using this as a neck cream and it has done a nice job of softening the skin. Is it expensive for a décolletage cream? Sure is - I would tend to recommend this for dry skin and/or skin during the winter. I like it but I do think it’s overpriced. I might recommend the EADAM cream for oilier skin or if you just want something more lightweight and fragrance-free. Good - but not $95 good
