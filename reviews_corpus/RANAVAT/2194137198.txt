I love LOVE!!! how this makes my skin feel ~ absolutely so good, therefore the 3 stars ~ but….Omgoodness the smell. It is so bad. INDESCRIBABLY AWFUL. If this formula was changed to fragrance free, easily a holy grail product. I can’t get past the smell. Did I mention it was bad??? ( This was a sample with a code.) Fragrance Free ~ PLEASE!
