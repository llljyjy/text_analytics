Hands down worth every penny. Iâ€™m on my 6th bottle and so glad RANAVAT is at Sephora. Not only feels luxurious but has worked wonders on my skin for overall plumpness, glow and hydration. It is amazing under makeup and pair it with the Bakuchi Creme at night. I have a lot more makeup free days these days because of it! Magic in a bottle that smells and feels divine!
