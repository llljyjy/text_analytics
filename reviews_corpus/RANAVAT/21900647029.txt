too expensive for what it claims.  it doesn’t absorb into the skin. just sits on top of the skin. all the reviews were given free product so its hard to trust the reviews.  I paid for it with my own money. just buy the ordinary B oil and trust me it’s much more effective and affordable!! don't buy into the good reviews
