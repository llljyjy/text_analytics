This is a really lovely rose cream cleanser. Typically since winter I started doing cream cleansers and that has helped my skin stay more supple & hydrated. This is a splurge to me and I was hesitant to get it however it is lasting long. That being said it does clean your skin when used in certain ways. I find I almost always have to use a cleansing tool of some sort to get my minimal make up off (mascara & lipgloss and sometimes sunscreen). I work it in on dry or damp skin and then use a wet konjac sponge/facial sponge and gently rub my face and eyes. This is the only way to get my face clean. Would I buy it again I’m unsure other more affordable lux feeling cleanser out there. Maybe discounted. The rose scent is there. So if you want subtle or no fragrance I wouldn’t suggest this. It feels like a spa to me. Also after awhile the cap has become tricky to put back on maybe the metal is warping by the screw too bit. Lux
