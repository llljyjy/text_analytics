I got this as a sample many years ago and loved it. With a recent order I saw I could get a sample again and was excited to see if it was as good as I remembered. Sadly the sample was at best a third full, and it was a much darker green then I recall almost like it’s oxidized.  Hope these issues don’t translate to a full sized product. nan
