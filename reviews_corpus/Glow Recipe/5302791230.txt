First of all the packaging on this is so cute!  I tthought there would be a harsh fruity scent from this but surprisingly there isn’t. It feels very moisturizing and hydrating on my eyes, and gives a nice glow but I haven’t noticed any crazy difference as yet. I’ll continue to use and see if there is any major difference! Very moisturizing!
