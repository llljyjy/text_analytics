So I have used 2 other products from glow recipe and love them and I have repurchase them. Over all I love their products.  I have been using this SPF now for 2 weeks. It gives you amazing glow and your skin is so hydrated. Doesn’t leave a white cast. And it’s not oily if you have oily skin. My skin feels and looks so soft I love it. I like the consistency, its light weight and watery like so it absorbes into the skin good. The only CON is that it peels with a lot of other products. I have layered this on 3 other products and it peels. I have layered on 2 and it peels. I have waited about 5-6 mins after applying other products to put it on, and it peels. So it’s either I wear it alone. Or just put on my vitamin C serum and that’s it.  And I have to pat it onto my skin, not rubbing because it start to peel. Other then the peeling I really love the glow and the hydration. Has a light watermelon scent that I absolutely love. Amazing glow, but peels with other products
