I’m very excited for this cleanser! I use many of the products from the glow recipe line (the plum plump line is a staple for me), but I was only able to rarely use the blueberry bounce cleanser because it’s more drying. This isn’t. I was sent some samples to try, and I can tell you, this is super silky and light plus it smells amazing- very light and fresh but still CLEAN. It’s not stripping  at all. It’s the middle of winter, the heater is on all the time, so I am dealing with a little bit of sensitivity from dryness. This was so soothing to use (but still dealt with my oily t-zone very well). I’m super excited to round out my glow recipe routine with this one. Yay! Smells amazing!
