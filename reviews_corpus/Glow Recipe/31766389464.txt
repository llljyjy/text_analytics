I was a bit hesitant to try this mask out because I have sensitive skin so I donâ€™t tend to try out products with  AHA since I find them stripping and drying. However, this mask was not drying or irritating and I love the way it makes my skin have a nice, healthy and natural glow. It is very hydrating and easy to apply. I use it before bed and wake up feeling very refreshed. I recommend this to everyone who wants to achieve a glowy skin and smooth skin texture without the hassle. Just apply, sleep, and wake up to a glowy you! Great product!
