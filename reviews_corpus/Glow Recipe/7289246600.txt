I was a bit nervous to try this because I wasn’t really a fan of the original watermelon might mask (because of stickiness and pilling). They have definitely improved the formula. Although this new mask feels a little sticky when you’re first putting it on, it soon absorbs into the skin really well,  and I didn’t feel like it was going to rub off on my pillow.  The morning after I used it, my skin did look brighter and more supple and glowing. I will continue to use this a few nights a week for moisture and exfoliation. Much better than the OG watermelon night mask
