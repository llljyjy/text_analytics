Since using this toner I have seen a gradual difference in the skin. Each day skin is looking and feeling amazing. It’s gentle enough on my skin to use in the am and pm and love that it does not irritate my skin or dry it out like some toners do, especially as they have alcohol in them.  With this this toner my skin is left feeling hydrated! It has been giving me glowing skin, smoother complexion, pores look minimized and feels so soft which makes it great base for foundation application which gives me great results. It has a beautiful watermelon scent that isn’t over powdering and love the packaging.  Definitely recommend this. A toner that will leave skin hydrated not dry
