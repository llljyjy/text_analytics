I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to reviewGenuinely made me love the Glow Recipe brand even more. In the past, I’ve used the watermelon moisturizer, and this works just as well but is an even thicker formula. I live in Colorado, and it’s so dry, and I’ve already noticed a huge difference in my skin! Love love love - especially for the winter months
