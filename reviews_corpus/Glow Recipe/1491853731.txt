This product was ok. I’ve got some hyperpigmentation on my cheeks and forehead and have had some success with vitamin c products in the past, but this one doesn’t seem to do anything for my darker spots. It has a nice consistency and smells nice, but I used the entire bottle within a month and it did not help my dark spots. Just ok
