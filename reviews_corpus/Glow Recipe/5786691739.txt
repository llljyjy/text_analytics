Alright so I tried this in all the ways I could have thought of 1) Bare skin with no makeup but just my moisturizer (high end to drug store bought) - 10/10 no peeling and made my skin glow 2) After like my 20- step Korean routine (I know lol)  followed by moisturizer (again no makeup) - 10/10. I was totally blown away cause I knew this step will be a definite deal breaker.3) FINAL TEST - I tried it this after my 20 step routine, then applied this sunscreen followed by makeup (I used my Dior foundation which is what I normally use) followed by blush, bronzer you name it. HUGE risk I took where I was going into work- RESULT 10/10!!! My skin looked amazing!!note - Usually my skin starts getting oily with sunscreen which is why I always carry blotting paper to wipe away the oil but this baby right here is my life saver!!!I so love this product that I bought two more during Sephora sale.Sorry to hear for all the folks this is not working out which is why I would recommend Glow Recipe to come up with sample size or something so folks can try before investing in the full size. That will not have impact on their supply chain as well to be honest. WHAT IS THIS!!!!
