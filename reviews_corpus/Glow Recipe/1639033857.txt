Overall this product worked as expected as step 1 in a double cleansing routine. After rinsing all of my makeup, including mascara, is gone. Please note that I do not wear heavy makeup, I typically wear a skin tint, light eye makeup, and mascara. I took off 2 stars as this product leaves a residue on my skin and in my hairline after rinsing requiring the use of a facial cleanser as a second step, and leaves an oily film on my eyes blurring my vision.Prior to trying this product I used Farmacyâ€™s Green Clean and I will be switching back to it after I use up this container. Works, but not the best IMO
