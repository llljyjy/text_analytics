Wanted to love this product however for the insane amount of pilling, this is a waste of money 1000%! Does NOT play well w/any of my skincare on no-makeup days no matter how much I test various products to prevent pillling. Same goes for my make up (foundation, tinted moisturizer, or cushions) I used a variety of make-up techniques (brush, sponge, fingers) to apply but this sunscreen is terrible. Much prefer SuperGoop or Shiseido SPF. Waste of Money
