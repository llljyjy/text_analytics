My skin is the oilyest of oily. I used to get those blotter sheets as a teenager and could use a whole pack in a few days. My skin has calmed way the heck down since then, thanks to Niaminicide and chemical exfoliants, but my skin still is oily always. So finding a moisturizer that won’t make me breakout is a feat in and of itself. This moisturizer is not as light as a gel cream is, but it has benefits and key ingredients those don’t have. It’s ever so slightly heavier than a gel cream, so much so that you probably won’t even notice. It’s formulated so well it can be used at night to keep your skin hydrated. I am trying gel creams out now, but I don’t think I will find anything to replace this moisturizer. Great for oily, breakout-prone skin
