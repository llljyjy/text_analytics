This is a huge no for me and I will be returning this soon. I wanted to like it very badly because of the high SPF and dewy finish but the formula pills horrendously. I found that it wasn’t moisturizing either and I suspect the pilling has a drying effect as well. The finish is quite tacky for awhile. I’ll be sticking to my innisfree sunscreen, half the cost and 10x the quality. Pills horribly
