Honestly I can’t say that I have had many issues with large pores but I will say I have dry skin that’s sensitive and acne-prone, so I’ve dealt with issues of uneven texture and clogged pores. This is so so good, when I used this in my routine with a product mix that has worked for me I’ve noticed my skin be smoother and glowing literally the morning I wake up. I think this is what I was missing. It helps so much with my acne as well! And it’s so gentle, so my sensitive skin handles it so well. Just make sure you’re also moisturizing cause this is also a gentle exfoliant. Started with a small bottle and I will be getting the larger one when it runs out. It does have a strong watermelon scent though which I don’t mind too much, but if you have an issue with fragrances maybe keep that in mind. This is what was missing from my routine!
