Glow Recipe has DONE IT AGAIN! If you were looking for a gentle exfoliant with a serum like feel that smells just like strawberry candy then you have found it. There are so many great things about this product itself and the first thing I noticed is the bottle. The bottle is a strawberry jar with a nozzle that pumps you the perfect amount the whole face. Also, when using this serum it sinks in not so fast and not so long which makes my skin feel plumped and hydrated. It exfoliants gentle enough where you don’t feel any stingy or nothing at all. You can see the difference in your skin in a week. My skin became more firmer and stronger. I also wore this with SPF to protect my skin. Overall a very great product that I’ll be using from now on out! nan
