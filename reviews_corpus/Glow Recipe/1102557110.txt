I am a huge Glow Recipe fan and I always run to Sephora when I find out they’ve launched a new product.  This Guava Vitamin C Bright-Eye Gel Cream is lightweight and silky smooth.  I love gel creams because they feel lighter on the skin and allow for easy layering of products.  I’ve been waiting for a good vitamin C eye product to come out so that I can apply in the morning under my SPF.  To me, this does not have a natural fruit fragrance like most of their other products do.  It smells fragrance-free.  The texture is nice and light. Perfect lightweight eye cream!
