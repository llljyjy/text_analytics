Guava vitamin C eye cream from Glow Recipe contains niacinamide and vitamin C. It has a soft gel texture that glides smoothly. I loved the texture and it gave my eyes a nice pop. I use it with my glow recipe hyaluronic acid and glow recipe avocado serum. I used during PM skincare. Love glow recipe products. Soft texture
