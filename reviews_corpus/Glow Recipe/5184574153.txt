This product was just okay. I’m an esthetician and I usually don’t mind glow recipe’s products, but I felt that this was very lackluster. It made my skin extremely dry, it didn’t really help with any breakouts, and I don’t think the price is really worth it for the very very little amount of product you get in the bottle. esthetician opinion
