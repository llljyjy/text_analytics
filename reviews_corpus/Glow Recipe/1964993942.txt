I have tried the old formula of this product and I’m preferring this one! I notice my skin is really clear and soft when I wake up in the morning. While I like the watermelon scent, I’m glad they chose not to include it in the new formula. It makes my sensitive skin much happier! Definitely an improvement for OG formula!
