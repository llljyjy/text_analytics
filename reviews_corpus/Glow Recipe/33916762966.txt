I started using the Avocado Ceramide Moisture Barrier Cleanser right before the cold weather hit and I have already noticed a huge difference in how my skin is handling the cold, dry air. I haven’t seen even a hint of redness or flakiness on my cheeks (my cold weather problem area). The cleanser lathers into a creamy, dense foam (even with VERY hard water) that doesn’t run everywhere. Although it’s very gentle (I have experienced zero irritation using acids afterwards), it does a great job removing overnight mask residue in a single wash without harsh scrubbing. I struggle with keratin plugs on my cheeks and chin (contributed to by dry skin), and those have diminished greatly in both size and number after just a couple of weeks of using this cleanser. I would definitely recommend this cleanser to anyone with dry or easily irritated skin. Get the Avocado Ceramide Recovery Serum (a long time fave of mine) to go with it for extra skin barrier goodness. A New Fave
