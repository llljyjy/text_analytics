I want to start off by saying that I love Glow Recipe and use multiple of their products daily (I love the pore tight watermelon toner, plum plump moisturizer, the clay mask, and the watermelon dew drops) and I was really excited for this product. I only applied a patch test to my arm but the smell was so off-putting I really didn’t want to apply it to my face. I’m not sensitive to scent and I love the smell of their other products but this strawberry scent smells very cheap and stale to me, like a little kids perfume or a dollar store lip balm. The amount of product you get for the price is also very little, it’s only 30ml which is the same size as a small bottle from The Ordinary. You can buy other full sized Glow Recipe products for the same price (or less), and for whatever reason the ml is not listed anywhere that I can find on this Sephora page. I decided to return it even though I did not actually try it on my face yet, but the smell and price just weren’t worth it to me. Small amount and cheap smell for big price
