I’m a huge glow recipe fan and I especially love their watermelon line it has done really great things for my skin. So when I found out that they were coming out the AHA mask that you can sleep in overnight I was really really excited. So I tried this out for a couple days now and let me just say I absolutely love it. I wake up in the morning and my skin is so glowy just kinda like with the other products in the watermelon line you get that really glowy skin, I get that from this product and more because it contains AHA’s! Smells so good
