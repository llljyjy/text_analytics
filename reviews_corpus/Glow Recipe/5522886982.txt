I wanted to love this but it doesn’t work well with my skin type. It’s extremely difficult for me to find a lightweight, oil-free, moisturizing that sits well under makeup and while this product does sit well under makeup, I found myself blotting my face more throughout the day since I started using this. Sadly, this isn’t the product for me. Lightweight but not good for oily skin
