I wanted to fall in love with this as I love the smell that glow recipe has to their products but unfortunately this product wasn’t for me. This is a chemical / mineral sunscreen as soon as I applied it on my skin it started balling up. I use the mist from glow recipe and love the smell but some how I ended up with little dots over my face? Very similar to super goop (I wanted to love it due to it being popular but it also fell short for me) I feel like the concept was great mixing skincare with an SPF but realistically... the SPF should protect against the sun and your night time routine should help you with your pigmentation. I returned this and bought my josie maran SPF which I love and allows me to go out bare face or with cosmetic and doesn’t ball up. I gave it two stars because the smell is great and concept is but it didn’t work for me. smells great but a pass for me
