I love this wash so much. I struggle with aging oily skin and while I need moisturizing products but they can’t be oily. This was the perfect fit. It has made my skin look youthful and healthy. I’m not wild about the smell, it’s not bad but it doesn’t smell good like their other products. I highly recommend this wash. Must have for dry or aging skin
