I had the opportunity to test this serum out for a few weeks before the launch in exchange for an honest review. I’ve tried their niacinamide dew drops and both versions of their vitamin C serum. This will replace both in my routine. I have sensitive skin, and the Paula’s Choice 2% BHA solution was too strong for me. I used the Strawberry Smooth serum once every other day, and it has been PERFECT. I had the smallest purge that quickly healed and then disappeared without hyperpigmentation. I couldn’t ask for anything more than that. My New Favorite Serum
