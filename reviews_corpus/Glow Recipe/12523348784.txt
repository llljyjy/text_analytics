I did not like this at all. First the smell is not like their normal watermelon smell. I don’t know if mine was bad or what but it smelled like dead, moldy watermelon. I pushed past the smell but then this toner left a weird sticky film on my face. Also I felt like once I got it on my cotton round, the cotton round would soak in and I would have to keep going in for more to get my whole face covered. Glad I got the mini and didn’t waste my money buying the full size. Nope!
