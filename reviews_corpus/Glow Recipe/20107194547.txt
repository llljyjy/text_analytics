I’ve been using the new Glow Recipe Guava Vitamin C Brightening Eye Gel Cream for the last week or so.. and oh my gawsh - they just keep nailing it every product launch! This eye gel cream has a gorgeous pink bottle, which keeps in line with their Guava serum, and the aesthetic is beyond stunning. The formula, consistency, and texture is so unique with this one. I love how beautifully it sinks into the skin, and how dewy, radiant, and nourished my eye area looks after applying. I have most definitely noticed that my under eye area appears more awake and brightened.. and my eye area overall appears healthier, more hydrated, and glowy. It layers and performs amazing with the other products in my routine, and wears beautifully under makeup. This is hands down my new go-to eye cream in my daily routine. I’ll forever be obsessed with everything Glow Recipe.. because of the quality and care they put into each product. Hands down absolutely recommend! Utterly Obsessed!!
