Literally ‘Glow Recipe’ this sunscreen is going to be perfect buddy for me this coming Spring/Summer (I hope it last that long bc a little goes a long way!) The texture is light and v v hydrating. It doesn’t leave your skin heavy or feel thick at all. I’m a light to no makeup kind of person and this seems to work great under makeup during the hotter days! Literally GLOW Recipe
