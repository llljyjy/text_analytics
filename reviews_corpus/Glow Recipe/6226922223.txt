I went into this when I had a bit of birthday money/gift cards to blow and thought it would be a nice skincare treat and cut down my morning routine as I usually stick to single main ingredient serums (inky, the ordinary) and layer. I absolutely love this serum…it cuts three steps out and it just smells so good and applies and sits on my skin so well. It lasted a surprisingly long time with once daily use and I am so mad about how much I like it because I’m now hooked on it. Honestly hate how much I love it.
