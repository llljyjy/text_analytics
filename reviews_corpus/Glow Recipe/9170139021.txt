I see so many reviews about this not being for dry skin but man I have dry sensitive skin and this is the first cleanser to ever work for me. This in combination with the watermelon moisturizer has completely saved my skin. Itâ€™s light and smells so good and a little goes a long way which I love. I bought the mini size to give it a try and it has lasted me so long even though I use it twice per day. nan
