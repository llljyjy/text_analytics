So I’ve tried a good bit of Glow Recipe products and I’m definitely a fan. Glow recipes delivers with that GLOW ✨ their dew drops are a staple in my routine, like a top 10 can’t do without product. First off this product just on unboxing is so nice. Such a fan of their glass packaging. I applied a generous amount of the product on my skin after my usual night time routine and it felt so nice on my skin. Absorbed quite nicely. Not sticky, or messy, and no pilling.  Woke up to such glowy skin! This is for sure a new essential in my night time routine. Love it! Great product, must try!
