The product pills up on itself every single time I’ve used it. I tried it on bare skin, prepped skin, after letting my skincare “set” for ten minutes. I even tried using an entire regimen of all Glow Recipe products and nothing keeps it from pilling. It also stings my eyes, and I tried really really hard to keep it away from my eyes. The texture of this product is lovely and if it didn’t pill I would probably love it despite the eye burning. pills on itself
