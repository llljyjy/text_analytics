I have some dark spots from acne scar and saw this and bought it, first week try noticing my skins flair up and make me break out. I used a night time cuz at the time I didn’t wanted to used in the day due no sunscreen. I was planning to return something I needed, but the Sephora skincare told me give another week and I did… I decided to not used it for 3 days.. my acne isn’t flair out and  0 break out. So I did return to get something I needed. I think this vitamin c is a little to much for acne prone and sensitive skin I read from the q&a saw the employee reply the answers said the vitamin C is 11.6% which is pretty strong. Wanted to work…
