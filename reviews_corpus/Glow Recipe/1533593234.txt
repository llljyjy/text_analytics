Everything from this brand is amazing. I love the packaging and always think it’s so cute and the product is great. It doesn’t feel irritating. My skin feels super smooth after using it and I didn’t put moisturiser on so I definitely had to say it does have a hydrating quality while also helping blemishes nan
