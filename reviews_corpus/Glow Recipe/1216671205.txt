This is such an amazing serum for your face… It really smooths out your texture and hydrates your skin and prepares it for your moisturizer and then make up! I went through a stage where I stopped using it and wasn’t as Chloe and Dewey and moisturized. Now I am back to using it and wow, my skin is absolutely loving it! I’m not sure if there are any skin health benefits but it really does make your skin look and feel beautiful! What a difference!
