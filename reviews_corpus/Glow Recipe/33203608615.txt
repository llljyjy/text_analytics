I have combination skin, and haven’t found a moisturizer until now that is perfect *for my skin.* Everyone’s skin is different, but this one should definitely be one you try. For me? I struggled to find a moisturizer that wasn’t too thick (this one I’d weightless, which I love), sticky (not at all sticky), fully moisturizes (no dry spots!! I had two I’d always have to focus on more often, not know!), not burn and maybe even help with my acne. THIS fits the bill 100% There is a noticeable difference in my acne, my skin glows and literally have been having random people compliment my glow. I do use a retinal as well, but I have for years, and it is way too harsh without a good moisturizer. This is an amazing combination for me and works better than any I’ve tried before. nan
