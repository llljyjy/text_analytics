Iâ€™ve used several times as the last layer in my night routine, making skin smooth & bright.  This satisfies my dry skin with hydration & feeling moisturized, in the morning my skin is nice & smooth & still feels hydrated! I love the glass pot, even the side indentations fit your grip making it easy to hold.  The runny,  gel texture is cooling & feels good on my skin.  Of course, it smells fantastic without being over the top watermelon! Love the cooling texture!
