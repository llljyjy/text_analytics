If you’re a fan of Glow Recipe, then you’ll love this product! I doesn’t feel heavy or greasy on my skin. It gives you the signature Glow Recipe glow. I love how it doesn’t have a regular sunscreen smell and how it doesn’t make me anymore oily than I already am. Also, if SPF tends to burn your eyes when you wash your face, this one won’t! My favorite SPF so far!
