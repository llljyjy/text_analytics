Compliments of Glow Recipe has created the most adorable salmon colored packaging, triple threat Strawberry Smoke BHA+AHA’s and Salicylic Acid to help out our skin. This is a lightweight creamy serum that plays well with others and worked perfectly for under my makeup.  Believe me that’s always a plus! Girl this is a great product with great ingredients from a fabulous company! From what I’ve read about other products they’re doing amazing and continue to improve products. It’s a great one, 1 fl/oz especially if you’re looking for a single product that packs a punch to your skin leaving it smoother and turn over quickly! Aiding skin with resurfacing and a inner glow, you’re going to love it, she’s pretty pink and smells like strawberries too! So Good!! Fabulous formula!
