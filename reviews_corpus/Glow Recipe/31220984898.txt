Good sunscreen. More on the thick side, but you don’t feel it after a few minutes. More importantly it didn’t cause acne (I have sensitive skin). I put the two-fingers amount on my face (underneath makeup) and it doesn’t pill. I will buy it again (love the glow), but it’s not my favorite sunscreen because of the thickness - that’s why I’m giving it 4 stars - I prefer an ultra-light/fluid sunscreen. Great sunscreen that didn’t cause any breakout
