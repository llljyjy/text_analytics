I donâ€™t love the smell of this, but you can definitely feel it working. I normally have clear combination skin, never break out on my cheeks, sometimes get blackheads on my nose really bad and the occasional hormonal chin zit. This stuff made my skin purge so so so Bad. Zits everywhere including my cheeks, but then three days later it all cleared up and needs to fade and now my skin is looking better and better. I used this with the watermelon toner, and that probably caused the extreme purging! I have to use this stuff after a moisturizing serum because it is very drying for me. Now that my skin is calming down and improving I will keep using. It works
