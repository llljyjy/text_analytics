Horrid as far as cleansing balms go. The amount of rinsing it took to get this one off my face was insane. For those who haven’t done a two step cleansing method before this is NOT normal with oil cleansers and they normally emulsify and rinse off easily. I had to use so little of this product to get it off my face that it nullified any benefits as far as makeup removal. When I used what I would consider to be a ‘normal’ amount I found myself having to use my finger nails to scratch product off as it would not rinse away. Banila, Farmacy and Youth to the People all offer far superior cleansing balms for similar prices. This one is not worth the trouble, the only good thing I can say about it is the packaging is cute. nan
