I have not tried the original sleeping mask to compare but I’ve heard a lot of people experienced pilling with that and I did not with this. It’s really goopey and lightweight, not really moisturizing on its own to use at night. I honestly prefer to use it in the morning because I already use a retinoid at night. It contains glycolic and lactic acid to exfoliate the skin as well as niacinamide and hyaluronic acid. Glow Recipe also claims that the quinoa extract contains peptides, but it’s really hard to say how many peptides are actually in a plant extract as that can be highly variable, and I don’t know which peptides are actually in quinoa. Remember that not all peptides do the same things, so it’s really best to look for specific peptides added to an ingredients list to get the most benefit. Overall I don’t think it is an awful product but it’s not my top choice for a chemical exfoliant. Lightweight serums and toners are better for the daytime when I like to use a product like this. It's not awful but not my top choice
