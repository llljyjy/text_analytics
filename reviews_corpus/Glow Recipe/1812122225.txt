My dermatologist put me on a cleanser and moisturizer only skincare routine so I have been exploring moisturizers. I really like this Plum Plump HA moisturizer. I have very dry and sensitive skin but do not like heavy cream moisturizers. This is a really nice consistency that just melts into your skin and doesn’t feel heavy. It has a very light fragrance but it smells really nice. The packaging is nice and heavy and I love that it is refillable. This product just feels good to use and makes my skin feel good. I recommend trying it if you’re on the fence. nan
