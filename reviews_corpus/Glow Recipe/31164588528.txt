I really like this product. It feels more like a serum than a cream, which initially felt odd since it comes in a tub. I’ve tried the Watermelon Glow Dew Drops in the past and knew that I had to try this! It’s very hydrating and soothing. I love how supple my skin feels after application…which lasts into the morning. Added bonus, I love how pretty the tub looks on my counter and how thoughtful the packaging is. Get this into your nighttime routine
