i love when a resurfacing product keeps hydration + maintained skin barrier health in mind in addition to the exfoliating aspect! This mask feels SO gentle, veryyy hydrating, + my skin feels smoother & way more supple when I use it; I think this is such a perfect option if you have sensitive skin but want to start gently incorporating AHAs in your routine! Another W from glow recipe ladies and gents!!
