Not only does the product feel and smell great, like all Glow Recipe products, but it was super calming to my skin. I was a little unsure if some of the ingredients might be a little harsh for my sensitive skin, but it was definitely the opposite. I also struggle with redness and it did not add to that. Definitely recommend this and all their products. Another great serum!!
