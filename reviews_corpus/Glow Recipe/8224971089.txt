I am a big fan of most GR products that I’ve tried but I am undecided about this one. With oily/acne prone skin and fine lines it’s hard to find anything that will be moisturizing without breaking me out. While this certainly wasn’t drying I am not sure it did anything  more in terms of breakouts or skin texture than the MUCH more affordable serum from The Ordinary I was using prior to this purchase. Cons- It definitely leaves your skin a bit tacky and isn’t a stand alone product. Moisturizer applied too soon afterward takes forever to absorb. It is a noticeable step in my routine now. I have also experienced pilling of my skincare under makeup for the first time ever, I have to assume this happens when applied a bit heavy. Pros- smells great, packaging is super cute. My advice, wait for a sale… and don’t expect miracles. On The Fence
