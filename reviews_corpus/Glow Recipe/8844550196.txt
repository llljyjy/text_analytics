I wanted to like this.. I have fair skin that’s of average sensitivity. I wouldn’t say it’s acne prone in my 30s, but I did struggle with acne through adolescence and hoped this would help brighten some of the spots and scaring left from those days. It feels smooth when applied, dried nicely and layered fine with my moisturizer and foundation. However, it broke me out repeatedly after several attempts to work it into my routine. Sadly outside of return window and very disappointed in this product. Repeatedly caused breakouts
