I use to use old school physical exfoliates but have since stopped that, and my routine has only been consisting of a cleanser, treatment, and moisturizer. I have combo skin and get break outs in my t-zone and I always have texture. My skin is also very sensitive so I have to be careful or else my skin breaks out in hives. I used this product for the first time and I stayed in front of the mirror for 20 minutes after applying to see if I would turn red or get hives and I did not! I was shocked, I slept in it and woke up the next day to baby smooth looking skin! The few pimples bumps/pimples I had went down, and the roughness of my surface layer skin was gone. I felt and looked amazing, and followed up with my morning routine. My mother told it me that for the first time in a long time my skin looked like it had been cleaned, and it looks clear and bright. Letâ€™s not forget I clean my face daily twice a day, but now with this it looks clean and bright. I love it and plan to use it weekly, it is a gentle game changer. Gentle Game Changer
