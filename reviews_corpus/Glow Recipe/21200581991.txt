This product is wonderful! Not all Glow Recipe products work well with my skin as I am very sensitive, my skin is dry and acne prone and I suffer from rosacea. This exfoliating serum is gentle enough that I can use it twice a day! The salicylic acid is formulated very well and does not set off any redness for me as with some other products. I have been using it for a month now and have seen a major improvement in my pores and my skin texture. I want to note, almost all new serums, especially an exfoliating one will cause an initial purge! (Your below the surface pimples and blemishes will surface) My purge lasted about a week, stick with it, itâ€™s worth it. If you want to try this product remember it takes 28 days minimum for your skin to adjust and have a full cell turnover on average. Gentle enough for sensitive skin!
