So i wanted to try Glow Recipes items, and i have Melasma *hyperpigmentation* and i keep hearing wonderful things about this brand. Ive got a small left, less then a quarter left and i dont see any different in my skin. No lightning of dark spots what so ever. I cant say it smelled good or anything positive about this. Wait the bottle is pretty. Thats about it. So needless to say i do not recommend. But i am using a different serum by Glow Recipe so maybe this product just wasnt for me. Very Meh
