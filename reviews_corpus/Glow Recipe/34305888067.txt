The products I use is Tatcha and got the Glow as a sample. I must say….. in just 1 day I can definitely feel and see the difference. I washed my face with my face washer and afterwards used the Glow at night before bed. It has no smell, does not feel sticky or as if you have something on once it’s penetrated onto your skin. My face the next day had a beautiful glow and less blemishes. This is wonderful and I will be purchasing. Even 2 days later my face is still clear and looks much healthier prior to this. I definitely recommend this product. Especially if your the type that don’t like anything heavy, sticky or weighing on your face. LOVE THIS. LOVE THIS PRODUCT IN JUST 1 USE
