This strawberry serum smells so good and never ever felt sticky to the touch, which I appreciated so much. I have hormonal acne with whiteheads, blackheads, and large pores. I would apply this once at night and the next morning my acne seemed calmer and less visible. Throughout the week I did notice my breakouts getting better and surprisingly it NEVER stung! I have such sensitive skin sometimes so this really surprised me because I half expect AHA/BHA serums to sting upon application. I loved this serum and think most people with acne could probably benefit from it. Strawberry please!
