I’m 33 with combination skin that gets flaky & textured in the dry winter months. I received a small sample to try for 10 days in exchange for an honest review. So far, I’m really enjoying this product. It cleanses gently with a mild scent. After, my skin does not feel stripped, dry, or stiff. It has noticeably helped with flaking. It’s comparable to the Cerave Hydrating cleanser. My only word of caution is that this is a water-based cleanser. So, while it will remove light makeup, it will not remove heavier makeup. For context, I generally use GR’s Papaya balm or Farmacy Green clean for makeup removal. For this reason, I don’t think it should be listed as a makeup remover. That being said, I love using the cleanser as the 2nd cleanser in my nightly double-cleanse routine or in the morning after a heavy workout/to wash of any overnight masks. I’ll definitely make this a part of my regular routine. Overall- a great cleanser
