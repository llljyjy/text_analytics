Makes my skin look instantly better/healthier. I definitely recommend it. I have sensitive combination skin and have not had any issues using it once a week. It does exactly what I wanted it to do, which is help even my skin tone. My spouse has some small wrinkles and fine lines, this mask helped diminish them immediately as well. AMAZING!
