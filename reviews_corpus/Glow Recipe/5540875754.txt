I have to be honest and say I don’t normally use a facial sunscreen. Mainly because my face is so oily and I’m afraid to make it worse, especially when it’s warm outside. I was so surprised by how much I love this sunscreen! I doesn’t have that traditional sunscreen smell and melted right into the skin without making me feel greasy! My skin looked glowy, but not in an oily way which was nice! Will def keep using! Amazing!!
