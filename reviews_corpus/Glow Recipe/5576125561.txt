I have sensitive, dehydrated, combination skin and have been struggling to find an exfoliating product that didn’t freak out my skin but this turned out perfect. This actually delivered an amazing amount of moisture that I’ve been struggling to get and I feel like my other skincare products absorbed way better after using this. I woke up with brighter clearer skin and my makeup went on better and I wasn’t as oily the next day (guessing because it moisturized really well and my skin wasn’t over producing oil). I liked using it with a cotton pad better than with my hands. In love with this product. Try this if you have dehydrated skin
