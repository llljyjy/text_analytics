Really mild, pleasant strawberry scent. The formula feels really soothing on the skin, and seems to work well with the Watermelon glow spf 50! I definitely feel like my skin is getting smoother, as I am noticing that my makeup is going on easier. Overall, this is a new staple in my skin care routine! nan
