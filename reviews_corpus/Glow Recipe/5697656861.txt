I was nervous at first because of how white the sunscreen is but it really rubs in nicely and doesn’t leave a white cast! even with two fingers worth of sunscreen! the texture of this is AMAZING but i wouldn’t recommend using it under a full face of makeup. This sunscreen also smells really really nice! It gives a very glowy look to the skin which i loved. nan
