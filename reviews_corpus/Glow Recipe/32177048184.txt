I’m not one to spend to much money on skincare and believe drugstore brands or the inkey list and the ordinary can do better than more expensive brands but… this is literally the best facial sunscreen I’ve ever had- doesn’t irritate my sensitive eyes- has a cooling effect for a very long time somehow- not a fan of fragrance in general but this one has just enough where it covers the sunscreen smell without being obnoxious and love the high spf- also no white cast at all and not heavy on skin THE BEST
