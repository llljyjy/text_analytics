This is my favorite cleansing balm!!! It doesn’t feel like oil like some do. It’s smooth and takes off all makeup. The only thing is it’s expensive and I went through it pretty fast. I probably won’t buy again I will buy the inkey list oat cleanser which does the job for $10. If you have the money though this stuff feels amazing I would consider it a luxury item. nan
