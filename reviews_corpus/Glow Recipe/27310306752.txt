I was really looking forward to trying this product. I saw many people on YouTube raving about it. I find this balm to not be very moisturizing and the exfoliant that’s in there feels so gritty on the lips (think beach sand mixed into a chapstick). It tugged on my lips upon application. The color is ok (I got the Blueberry) and the smell is fine, not offensive, but not “oh this smells so good I want to eat it!” For the price I expected a bit more than this product delivered. I will use it up of course because I spent my hard earned cash on it (lol). I definitely won’t be repurchasing. Nope
