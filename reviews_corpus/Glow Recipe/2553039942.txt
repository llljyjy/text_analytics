This is the main product to help my full lips when I am dry or flake. It immediately helps my lips gently exfoliate and helps other lips treatments I follow up with such as a lip hydration mask. It’s also nice to use before lipstick. It helps apply nicely. I ordered the blueberry to use next since I used up my watermelon one. I really like this and I think it works well. I think I’ll like the blueberry one better due to the color. The watermelon does look pink on my lips. I think the purple blueberry will be more neutral. Currently digging the last of the watermelon out as I wait for the new one to arrive!! See pic— I use it all up! lol Use daily and love it
