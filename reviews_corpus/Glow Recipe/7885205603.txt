Glow Recipe’s Strawberry Smooth BHA + AHA Salicylic Serum is amazing! It’s gentle and clarifying. It is great to combat blemishes. Skin is more smoother and even toned. What I like about this serum is that it is water gel. It doesn’t leave the skin tight and dry. It does exfoliate a little. It is a blend of BHA & AHA, so it does help to smooth the look of bumps. I suggest applying this once in the morning. Then, after a few minutes,  apply a moisturizer.  After the moisturizer, apply sunscreen. Great Strawberry Serum!
