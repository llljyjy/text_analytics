Not worth the money. I bought a full sized bottle and have not noticed a difference and do not want to re-buy just to see if it’ll eventually work. It feels heavier than how an eye cream should feel (IMO). The small glass bottle is also heavy, not great for travel, and I really do not like open products where the applicator dips in repeatedly, a huge source for contamination. Overall, would not recommend. There are much better eye creams on the market if you’re spending this much. Would not purchase again
