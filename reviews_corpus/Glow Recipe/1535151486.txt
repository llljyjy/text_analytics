This is my first glow recipe product. Honestly from all the hype surrounding this brand, I was sort of expecting a let down, but I was not disappointed. I have used about five other vitamin Cs from other brands before trying Glow recipe and this is hands-down my favorite vitamin C formula I have tried so far. The application is lovely, lots of playtime, spreads evenly, and is non-sticky after applying. I am thrilled this product is fragrance free as I have relatively sensitive skin. Some have commented on the natural smell of this product because of the guava extract. This smell is very minimal and dissipates quickly do not let that deter you from buying this awesome products favorite vitamin C
