After consistent use of this serum for two weeksmy skin overall has slightly improved in terms ofthe texture and oil production. My facial skintends to be on the oily side and pores tend toclog easily if not taken care of. I started to usethis serum and immediately noticed a matteeffect on my face. After a day I realised thisserum has a slight drying effect on my skin so Icombined with glow recipeâ€™s hyaluronic acidserum to retain the hydration levels. This serumhelped in maintaining the oil production and alsoprevented clogged pores to grow into acne orblackheads. I would definitely recommendpeople with oily skin and issues with acne orblackheads. I would also suggest to combine thisserum with a hydrating serum or moisturiser. Prevents acne/blackheads
