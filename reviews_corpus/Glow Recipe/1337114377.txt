I love Glow Recipe and was so excited to try this new serum. I like it has a light strawberry smell.  I have been using this daily for 2 weeks and love it is a light serum with AHA, BHA and salicylic acid. It is lightweight and my skin feels more glowy in the morning. The packaging is so cute too! Glowing!
