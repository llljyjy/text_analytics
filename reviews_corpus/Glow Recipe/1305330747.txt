I’ve been using using Glow Recipe’s Guava Vitamin C Bright-eye gel cream for several weeks now and really like it. I don’t have anything bad to say about this eye cream. It’s more of a creamy texture than a gel. It’s moisturizing and blends well into your skin. It pairs well with other products. I haven’t had any issues with pilling. I loved that it didn’t have any added fragrances, which I like to steer clear of around my eyes. My under eyes look plump and we’ll rested when I use this  eye gel. I’m excited to see my process with continued use. nan
