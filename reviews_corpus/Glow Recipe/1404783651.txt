I have been on the hunt for a daily sunscreen for forever and I think that this is it. I’ve been using it for about a month now, and while I do find it has VERY minimal pilling sometimes, but overall I am enjoying it! I find that it absorbs quickly, is not greasy, does not break me out, and leaves no white cast. It also plays very well with makeup. For reference, here is my routine:- wash face with fresh soy face wash & foreo luna - juice beauty vitamin c serum - saturday skin eye cream (this makes the sunscreen pill so i don’t use the sunscreen around my eyes)- laneige cream skin toner / moisturizer 2-in-1- dr jart ceramidin cream - and finally, the glow recipe sunscreen So Far, So Good!
