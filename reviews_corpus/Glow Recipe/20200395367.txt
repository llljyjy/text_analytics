One of my favourite cleansers ever, I’ve gone through two small bottles and half of a full sized one. I use it as my second cleanse, and I find it very gently cleanses my skin without stripping my skin.I use this on days I don’t have any specific problems I’m wanting to treat with my cleanser but just have a very luxurious experience. My boyfriend always can tell when I’m using it because I spend so much time just massaging my face with a happy look.The fragrance in it, while subtle, is not for everyone. I have a tank for skin, but my boyfriend has very sensitive skin and can’t use it. One of my favourite cleansers
