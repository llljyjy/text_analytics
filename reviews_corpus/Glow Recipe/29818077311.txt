I wanted to love this… I have a problem with the product peeling and trying to master the technique of patting it and being gentle requires a lot of time in my routine. Which isn’t ideal making this product not very ready and go friendly. I am also not even going to try to layer makeup on top of this product. Like it does look great in areas where the product and my skin cooperated. Peeling and not quick to apply
