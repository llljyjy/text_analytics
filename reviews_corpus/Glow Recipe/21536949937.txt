I got this as a gift for my mom but I honestly really enjoy using it for myself from time to time. From the packaging to the texture, this moisture really stands out to me. I love how easily it melts into your skin and gives you that instant supple look. A little goes a long way so I don’t need to use much of this product. It’s amazing under sunscreen as well! For reference me and my mom both have highly sensitive skin but this didn’t irritate our skin at all perfect lightweight moisturizer
