I love the 2 pumps of the product I was actually able to get from the bottle.  BUT...this packaging clearly did not go through any type of UX.  You get 1-2 pumps and then it stops working.  The product is too thick to even shake out of the bottle.  I’ve ordered 2X and returned 2X - I was hoping the first time was a fluke but it wasn’t.  Hoping Glow Recipe revamps the packaging so one can actually get the product out to use.  I like the product itself. Terrible Packaging - Can't Get Product Out
