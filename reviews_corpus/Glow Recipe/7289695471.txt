Best serum ever to put on right before moisturizer before putting makeup on. The less skincare you do before makeup, the less your makeup will break up and melt down after a few hours. This and a moisturizer is all you need. I also like to use it on my upper chest area for a gorgeous summer glow. A must-have in morning routine
