I am pleasantly surprised by this product! I typically have to steer clear of Glow Recipe because of the unfortunate inclusion of artificial fragrances (which breaks me out). This product does have an extremely subtle watermelon scent, but it is so faint that my skin doesn’t seem to mind. It didn’t leave a white cast on me, it sunk it well but still left a beautiful glow without being greasy. My makeup went perfectly over top of it and my skin stayed feeling hydrated throughout the day. Very much enjoy this SPF! Pleasantly Surprised
