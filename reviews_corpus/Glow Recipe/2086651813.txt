This product is not a need, but it is certainly that extra something to elevate your already good skincare routine. Mine was very good without it, but its a bit better with it. And I donâ€™t want to minimize how good it is, I just want to be clear that your routine can be great without it. I have normal skin, am not acne prone, and do not currently struggle with hyperpigmentation; I cannot attest to how it, specifically the Niacinamide, would impact someone who does. The added moisture in here is great, it pairs well with all my other products, and the finish is very pretty. You don't need it, but you want it
