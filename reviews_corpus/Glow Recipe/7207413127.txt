I loved that this version feels more gentle on my skin and it doesnâ€™t cause any tingling sensation during the night. Despite feeling gentle and smooth, the effect is definitely real specially after the second week using it 2x week my wrinkles looked less visible and for sure the blemishes on my chin. I have to say I alternate with a vitamin C serum during the day and some other nights I use retinol, but adding this to my routine definitely helped boost the healing of my dark spots. Dark spots less visible!
