I bought this bc of ig and it’s praise of it. I have oily skin & acne prone(very rare). This was just sooo greasy and not light weight. It also made me pill a little and gave me dry patches. I went right back to my Elta md spf… if you have hyperpigmentation Elta md will literally take away your red cheeks in 1 minute of application! Don’t believe social media!
