I feel quite neutral about this product as I had no issues at all, but also had no change in my hyperpigmentation. I used this product for around 3 months (until it finished) but my dark spots remained the same. On the bright side, this didnâ€™t make me break out or made my skin oilier. Had no issues but also saw no changes
