It pills so crazy if you don’t follow the steps. I don’t like a sunscreen that is tricky to apply. I gave it 3 stars just for the formula itself. The skin feels nice afterwards, after getting rid of those particles. The fact that it has less than a year expiration date is another ridiculous thing about it. I would not repurchase this. I don’t like applying very little at a time, tap them apply a little more then tap. I don’t have 2 hours in the morning to wait for this thing to be ready for application. Not worth the time and money
