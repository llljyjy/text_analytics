I still want so badly to like this, it sounds like the perfect sunscreen. I’ve only used it a few times, but it pills no matter how I try to apply it, whether whole face at once or in sections, and whether rubbing it in or lightly tapping. This morning it looked so bad that I washed my face and started over, using a different sunscreen as my last step. My morning routine: cleanser, vitamin C serum, moisturizer, SPF. Maybe if sunscreen is all you apply in the morning, it’ll go on smoothly, but that isn’t me. I threw out the box already, otherwise I’d return it. This is not it.
