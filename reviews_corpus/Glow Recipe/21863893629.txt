I absolutely love this sunscreen! I love that it is packed with extra skin care properties. It feels so good on the skin it’s very light I didn’t notice any white cast or greasiness. One of the main points that really stood out to me was that it was reef safe SPF, and it’s also super moisturizing and wears well under make up. Highly recommend! You will not be disappointed in this SPF!
