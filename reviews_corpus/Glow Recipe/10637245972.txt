I was pleasantly surprised with this product.  First, I am obsessed with the packaging. It is so cute. Second, I love how it feels on the skin; it has exfoliating agents but it doesn’t feel like it’s stripping your skin, it feels hydrating and leaves skin dewy and plump. I was a little bit scared because the product has a scent (strawberry scent, it smells amazing) , but it’s not harsh and it didn’t break my skin out. Smells like strawberries and leaves skin dewy
