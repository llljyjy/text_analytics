I wanted to like this product and use it in place of Drunk Elephant’s Protini moisturizer. I have very oily skin and this exacerbates the problem. This is the only product I’ve changed so I know for sure it’s the moisturizer. I also have noticed a really odd sort of dusty smell on my face a few minutes after I apply it which makes it even worse. not for oily skin
