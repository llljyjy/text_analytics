I must admit I bought this because of the online hype. For an SPF, there are definitely better choices out there. The only thing that makes this SPF unique is that it has a fruity scent.It does have a tendency to pile if youâ€™re using other skincare products with it, or foundation. It is best by itself, and with a thin layer moisturizer & foundation/conceal. glorified pink bottle. mouth watering scent tho
