I was dying to try this product once I saw all the sneak peaks. This is a hybrid sunscreen with both chemical and mineral filters.  This is pretty lightweight lotion consistency sunscreen, as in I can’t really feel it on the skin once I blend it in. However, it does take a LONG time to blend compared to some of my other hybrid sunscreens, and I experienced some pilling since I wear moisturizer underneath my sunscreen. It definitely gives a glow with no white cast or irritation to my eyes. There is a light watermelon scent like the other products in this line, but it doesn’t linger on the face.  This comes in at only 50ml for $34, so I think it is quite pricey for how much product you’re getting especially if you have to reapply throughout the day. Dewy Hybrid Sunscreen
