I can’t believe I haven’t tried Glow Recipe before this, the Strawberry Smooth BHA + AHA salicylic serum has definitely converted me and I want to try more products now! First off, smells AMAZING. I look forward to using this serum everyday, I’ve found it best to use it at night time so it can really soak in and work overnight. I wake up in the morning and my skin is super soft and glowy! I can’t wait to play around with it more, but definitely recommend for clarifying + retexturizing the skin! Love this stuff!
