Wasn’t sure how I was going to feel about this product, but I am pleasantly surprised! It’s super innovative and I really like the formula. It’s super lightweight and blends into the skin easily (unlike my other sunscreen). It has a scent of watermelon mixed with sunscreen, which I actually enjoy! There is a slight white cast at the start but it blends in super easily. It’s lightweight and not greasy (my least fav thing about sunscreen), but also gives me a subtle glow! I haven’t seen any results from the niacinimide, but can’t wait to see if I see any results! Lightweight & Blendable
