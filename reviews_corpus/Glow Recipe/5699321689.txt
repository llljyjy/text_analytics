I recieved this GUAVA Vitamin C Bright-Eye Gel Cream from Glow Recipe in exchange for my honest review.  This Vitamin C eye gel cream has a wonderful lightweight creamy texture, a pale pink color and a light and lovely guava scent. It glides beautifully onto the undereye area and absorbs well. I have just started using it so I have not noticed a huge difference in brightening yet but I can say that it is incredibly hydrating and moisturizing. I notice my undereye area appears more hydrated. It works well under my makeup, which is a huge bonus, and does not pill or cause settling. I would definitely recommend this eye gel cream. nan
