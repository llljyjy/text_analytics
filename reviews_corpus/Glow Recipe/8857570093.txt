I have been waiting what feels like forever for Glow Recipe to release an spf, and let me tell you, she was worth the wait! This spf has a beautiful ingredient list! I especially love that it has niacinamide and hyaluronic acid. It has a subtle watermelon scent. The texture is lightweight and easily blendable, and does not leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy. It DOES leave me glowing and hydrated. It leaves no white cast on me, and doesnâ€™t sting my eyes. Plus, an absolute A+ for the packaging. This is an absolute home run for me! A glowy dream!
