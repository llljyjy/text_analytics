This was the first GR product I disliked…enough to warrant me bothering with a review. I can only use this on my “work from home” days because I can’t put makeup over it as it pills - even if it’s the only thing I put on my clean skin. Also I can feel a slightly oily film over my skin (compared to my Asian SPF creams/milk). So sadly, I can not recommend this. I gave it an extra star for cute packaging and pleasant scent. Pills, period. :/
