It’s a pretty good product for makeup removal. I would say it’s not the best I’ve used, but I’m not upset by it. The one thing it has going for it over my previously used cleansing balms/makeup melts is that it does not break out my skin. Drunk Elephant works better than this, but it destroys my skin. So I think it’s a good trade-off considering. I’ve also tried Farmacy’s balm and I still like this one over it. very good product - doesn’t break you out
