I bought this because I wanted to use a salicylic acid in my skincare, and I’ve only been using it twice a day for about a week, and I already see a difference. I mix it with the Glow Recipe niacinamide dew drops and it’s sits so nice on my skin. I have dry skin in my t zone, and I’ve noticed this has really helped with it. OBSESSED.
