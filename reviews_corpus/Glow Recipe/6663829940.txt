I really wanted to love it, but unfortunately it broke me out so bad. It took me awhile to figure it out because i bought this with along with a bunch of other new skin care products. One night i decided to switch out my moisturizer with my tatcha, and the next morning my skin cleared up almost completely. I continued my routine without this product and my skin was cleared completely by the end of the week. I love glow recipe so much but this product did not work with my skin sadly. Always remember what works for one person may not work for you Test before purchasing
