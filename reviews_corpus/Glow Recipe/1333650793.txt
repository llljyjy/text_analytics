I have tried many glow recipe products and my daughter absolutely loves the brand.  I also have used many AHA and chemical exfoliants over the years to brighten and smooth my dry, mature skin.  I was so ready to love this overnight treatment but unfortunately, it just didn’t work for my skin.  I wonder if it is actually TOO gentle for my skin which is accustom to acids and retinols?  Or perhaps the gel lotion formula wasn’t hydrating enough for my dry mature skin?  I think for someone younger, or new to chemical exfoliants, or with combo to oily skin this might be a wonderful product and I would recommend that they try it.  There were no negative effects, no irritation or redness, but there also wasn’t the exfoliation or smoothing that I have gotten with other products. Wanted to love it
