This is an effective under makeup sunscreen/primer. It’s “glowy“ in that if you wear it by itself your skin has a glow, but it does not show through when you put foundation over it. It’s light weight, dries down quicker than normal sunscreen, is not greasy at all (I have oily skin so that is a concern for me). Amazing
