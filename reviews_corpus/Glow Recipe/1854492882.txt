I have dry skin and was hoping this would help with that on top of providing a nice dewy, refreshed skin look. Unfortunately, it didnâ€™t do much for my face. Ended up using the entire bottle on my body instead to avoid wasting it... looked great on my shoulders, chest, and legs though! hah body? yes. face? not so much
