My skin feels moisturized with this Spf. After applying my skin looks radiant and glowy. This Spf makes my skin stay hydrated throughout the day.  The texture of the product is very thin and reminds me of korean Spf which are my favorite for combination skin. This spf blends effortlessly in my skin without leaving a whitecast. I love the scent as well! So happy GR finally came out with an Spf!
