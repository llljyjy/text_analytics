Pros:- very nice consistency that absorbs well- wears well under makeup- pleasant fruity smellCons- broke me out (my skin is very sensitive to a lot of vitamin C products so take that with a grain of salt)- smell is a little strong so if that is a problem you will not like thisOverall, I really wanted to like this because the pros were great, but the breakouts came on super quick and have stopped since I stopped using it. Just not for me and my skin. nan
