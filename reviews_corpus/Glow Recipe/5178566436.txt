I just want to say most of the reviews are missing some of the best benefits of this moisturizer!!! The combination of ceramides and fatty acids found in this blend are incredible for repairing the skins moisture barrier. It’s definitely not just an average moisturizer! Unfortunately, redness in the skin isn’t always caused by the same condition. This description of this product CLEARLY states that it will help with redness IF it is due to being parched and dehydrated. Sometimes you have a condition that causes redness, sometimes it’s irritation or inflammation or maybe dryness. I would say if you’re looking for a good, nourishing, clean, and effective moisturizer to help balance the skin and boost its hydration then this is a great product. Maybe it’s not a miracle worker for redness and if that’s what you want then I suggest Dr.Jardt camo drops those are the shizz. SUPER NOURISHING MOISTURE BARRIER POWERHOUSE
