I really like this product, I actually returned a different Vitamin C serum and replaced it with this one. It’s very light, goes on smoothly and leaves a natural feel to the skin. Didn’t pill up with any of the other products I used on my face, so it wears well under makeup and sunscreen. I do feel like my dark spots are lighter, but I also haven’t been to the beach in several weeks, so that might be part of it! The container could be better, it seems like it’s really glass, so I was terrified I’d break it. Great Vitamin C serum
