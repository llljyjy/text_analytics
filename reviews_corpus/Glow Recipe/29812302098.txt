I have been a diehard Glow Recipe lover from the beginning of my skincare journey so I was soo excited to try this new overnight treatment! Iâ€™ve been using this 3 times a week and wow is my skin looking better than ever! I love the texture and the signature watermelon scent! The nights I use this I wake up to soft, glowy skin and my skin feels so smooth ! I love this and 1000% recommend! OBSESSED!!!
