My skin really loves BHA and AHA products, so this was already something I knew I would love. I even think if your skin gets a little bit dry from those products that this would be a good alternative because it does feel hydrating and almost plumping after you apply it. That is probably the hyaluronic acid that is helping with that. Honestly, the blend on this is really fantastic because it also has a bit of vitamin C from the strawberry extract, so as you are healing your breakouts with the chemical exfoliants, you are also helping fix the dark spots that can be left behind. The hyaluronic acid helps keep the skin from being dried out. This is definitely an amazing blend, and I donâ€™t mind that it is a little bit more expensive than other options on the market because the blend is so good. Amazing blend!
