This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used for my super dry, dehydrated skin!! I get really flakey in the winter, so I wanted a daytime moisturizer that would address that - this works amazing for both day and nighttime, and will leave your skin feeling SO SOFT and SO HYDRATED. Scents usually irritate my skin, but this has a lovely and subtle scent which hasn’t caused irritation yet. I’m so scared it’ll become one of those products that’s always out of stock because I want to keep buying it forever!!! Also love the refillable packaging, and I think this stuff is definitely worth the money! BEST MOISTURIZER I’VE EVER USED!
