Omg the cutest little bottle! I’m a huge sucker for glow recipes bottles and this one’s so cute! I do wish it was see through glass like the others, but that’s okay. The scent is hardly existent which is great since you apply right under your eyes. My eyes perked up one the first use! Sleepless nights, who?!
