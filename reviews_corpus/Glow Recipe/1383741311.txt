This was my first time trying out a hoe recipe product and I must say that I’ve really enjoyed this product. I love that this product is an SPF; however does a great job at moisturizing my skin and leaving a nice glow. It worked well under my makeup. It does smell like a sunscreen with a hint of watermelon, but luckily the fragrance hasn’t broken me out. nan
