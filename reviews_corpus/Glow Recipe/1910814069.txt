Since this product is a replacement of the old Glow Recipe Watemelon Sleeping Mask, I can’t help but compare the two. The old mask honestly didn’t do anything for my skin so I was excited to try this. The first (and biggest difference imo) is the lack of the watermelon scent. I get why they toned it down for people with skin sensitivities, however I do miss the smell! It feels the exact same in texture and sat nicely on the skin overnight. Overall, I didn’t notice my skin looking or feeling noticeably better the next day. I’m giving it 3 stars because I haven’t had long enough to try it, but we’ll see! Similar to the old mask
