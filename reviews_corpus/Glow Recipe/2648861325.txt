This is one of the best Glow Recipe products that I have tried so far. On top of the amazing watermelon scent that I like, this product actually works. My skin type is sensitive, so it’s tricky to find a product that won’t irritate - it has to be strong (when my skin is rough), yet gentle at the same time. I applied it as the last step in my PM routine and the next day my skin literally glows and my skin tone appears brighter and smoother! Highly recommend for those with sensitive skin and occasionally have rough skin texture like me!! Finally an AHA treatment for sensitive rough skin
