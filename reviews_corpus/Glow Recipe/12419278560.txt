This is the best serum that I had a chance to try in my life. The Glow Recipe strawberry serum has a smooth consistency that hydrates and smooths my skin. I like that it has BHA and AHA acids that gently exfoliate my skin and decongest my skin without making it dry and flaky. All the previous acid treatments would dry my skin and make it very uncomfortable. This acid treatment in opposition to others has hyaluronic acid, which moisturizes the skin and gives a soft healthy glow finish. And the strawberry smell of the serum is incredible. I want to eat it, haha. I usually apply 1-2 pumps once or twice daily before my moisturizer, and I already see good results. The texture and color of my skin improved after only a few days. Iâ€™m excited to continue using this product. I love this serum
