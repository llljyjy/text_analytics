I received this item for review from Glow Recipe. I’ve tried this sunscreen a few times and I’ve come to the conclusion that for best use, you need to apply a thin layer. If you have too much product on the skin, it pills. I like how it feels on the skin and the watermelon smell is amazing but I want to be able to load up on the sunscreen. So, while I like it, I think it could be better. Easily pills but when it works, it works!
