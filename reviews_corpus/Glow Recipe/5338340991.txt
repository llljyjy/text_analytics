I was so excited for this! I recently got into sunscreen at 33yrs old and have been on the hunt for something glowy and moisturizing for the upcoming Winter season. It was a blind buy, meaning I didn’t bother reading reviews or do any sort of research, which was my first mistake. I had slight irritation throughout the day, it most definitely has white cast and from my experience, you CAN NOT use it over other skincare. The first day I used it, I applied a Hyaluronic Acid Serum first like I always do every morning. I let that dry down and then I applied the Glow Recipe. It looked fine to me, but then i had gone to do my brows with my magnifying mirror, and that’s when I saw all the small piles of pilling scattered on my face. I thought maybe I did something wrong so I looked up reviews and sure enough, it was a common issue. Another review stated to use it on a clean face without anything underneath so that’s what I did the next day and I had no pilling whatsoever BUT I still had slight irritation throughout the day. Giving it two stars because the glow it gave me was *chef’s kiss* but not worth it to me to keep. There are better options out there
