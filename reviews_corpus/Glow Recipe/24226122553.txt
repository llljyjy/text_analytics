Not only does this new serum smell amazing, it is a great gentle exfoliator for those who want to skip exfoliation that strips the skin. It is smooth and lightweight, keeping the skin hydrated while also providing pore care and skin re-texturizing. I like using products that simplify and combine skincare steps, it is more efficient! Excellent gentle exfoliating serum
