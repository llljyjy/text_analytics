How can they so comfortably lie about the whitecast? The whitecast is insane. Look at my tattoo, its black and looks grey. On my face i am NC 20, still leaves a white cast. Aside from the company straight lying about no white cast, This is not a glow this is pure grease. I have oily to normal skin (used to be dry) and i HATE how heavy, sticky, and greasy this looks. If I wear anything else underneath it pills. I have no idea how this one made it out of the testing stage. How does this have 4 stars?
