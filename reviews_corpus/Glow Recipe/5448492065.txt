I was skeptical of this product having such high ratings due to all the incentivized ones, but I really have fallen in love with it. My skin is really sensitive so I usually get a rash of some sort when trying anything new, but it absolutely loves this serum. My skin tone looks even and I haven’t had a breakout since using it. My skin feels soft and looks refreshed. I took off a star because the value is quite sad, it’s only 30ml and when you use it twice a day, you’re going through it quickly. It sucks to fall in love with such a pricey product when it won’t last long. lives up to expectations
