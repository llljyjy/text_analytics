Ok eye cream, hydrating but no real brightening despite regular use. The real downside is the packaging. After using the product for a week, can no longer get product out! There is so much left in the bottle and pump does not work. Having to scoop it out with a toothpick to not waste it. Such a shame. Love other glow recipe product, but they really need to redesign the packaging. Packaging awful, can't get product out
