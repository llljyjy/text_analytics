This Glow recipe gel eye cream is such a beautiful gelish/creamy texture that glides nicely under your eyes. I love the light pink color and does have a slight scent to it. I noticed after a few uses that my eyes seem brighter and less puffier. I will continue to use and see my progress. Beautiful texture
