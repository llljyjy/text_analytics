I have been using the glow recipe papaya cleansing balm and blueberry bounce cleanser combo for years but I will be replacing those 2 products with this one.  It removes eye makeup so easy yet it rinses away completely leaving my combination skin feeling clean and soft. A tiny bit goes a long way too. Nailed it!
