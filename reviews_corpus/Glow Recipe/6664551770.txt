I didn’t get this for free to write a review. I went out of my way to buy this with my own money. First of all the scent is amazing it doesn’t smell like typical smelly sunscreen. The texture of this is not watery and not too thick it’s a perfect in between . It does not leave a white cast at all and leaves your skin looking dewy . I could definitely see myself wearing this under makeup as it doesn’t make my skin feel like I’m wearing a mask. Definitely will buy back ups! brown skin friendly !
