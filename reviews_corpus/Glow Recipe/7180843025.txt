Super excited to see how this works on my skin, but I definitely should have listened to the other reviews about the scent. I have the drops glow recipe also make and the smell is strong and artificial, but I actually quite like it. However the smell of this mask is almost revolting to me, I’m not too bothered by smells so I can ignore it after awhile. Definitely be cautious if you don’t like heavily scented products Strong Scent
