About a year ago, I was using this random nights throughout the week in my nighttime routine. I would wake up the next morning and my skin would look amazing. Even, with no redness. I finally tracked down what product it was, and it was this one! I can tell in the mornings, when Iâ€™ve used this the night before. Love it! Only product that evens my skin tone!
