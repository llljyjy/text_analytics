My New Favorite!!! I love the way this feels on my skin. Itâ€™s the perfect first step after cleansing and before applying serums. It has the consistency of a thinner serum, thicker than water and other toners. I pour about a tsp into the palm of my hand and pat into skin with fingers. It has a very light, natural, fresh fruit scent. My skin texture and tone has much improved since  using twice a day. I love this product!!! My New Favorite!!!
