I wanted to love this product but I had a couple of issues with it. First, I didn’t love the artificial watermelon smell the sunscreen has. It was kind of off putting but eventually you get used to it. Second, my skin feels slightly greasy after I put it on but the feeling does eventually fade away. It just uncomfortable and annoying to deal w the feeling till then. The product feels like it drags on your skin a little but the good thing is that it doesn’t leave a white cast, it’s easily blendable, and it does give the skin a nice glow! Overall though I don’t think it’s a sunscreen I would recommend I wanted to love it
