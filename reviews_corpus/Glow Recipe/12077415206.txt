This is my very favorite first cleanse, and I’ve tried quite a few. It doesn’t irritate my eyes when I use it on my eye makeup, and my face feels so smooth once I rinse it off. I’ve never had an issue with it clogging my pores either. Make no mistake, this is only a first cleanse, so you’ll need to follow it up with another facial wash once you rinse this off. Also be mindful that if you are sensitive to scents, this product may affect you. I personally find the tropical scent amazing, and it doesn’t cause any issues with me. Overall an excellent product!
