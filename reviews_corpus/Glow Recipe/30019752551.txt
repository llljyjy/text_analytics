I like it. It’s lightweight and REALLY does give you a glow!! It’ll make you feel good. Just be aware there is a little fragrance and be careful not to apply too much or you will feel greasy. I have combo acne prone skin and I realized a little goes a long way and it keeps me hydrated throughout the day. Worth A Try
