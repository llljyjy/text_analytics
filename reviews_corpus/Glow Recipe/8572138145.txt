I like this a lot! There’s a pleasant smell right of the bat, and it isn’t so intense that it really lingers on the face if you’re sensitive to that. I do prefer this under makeup rather than alone, because I find the texture to be quite tacky. It does make me feel hydrated enough, but I have oily skin. I think if you have dry skin you might honestly feel this to be tight just because of that tacky feeling. Overall I like this! It doesn’t make my makeup look pilled up or strange and offers a healthy and natural glow to the skin. Def curious if the niacinamide will make my skin more even in a few weeks! Only not giving 5 stars because I’m not sure how universal this would feel on dry skin. Nice option for oily skin
