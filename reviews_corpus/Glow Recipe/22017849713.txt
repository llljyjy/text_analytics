I recently made a Sephora purchase and chose this product as on of my free samples. I’ve been using skinfix cleanser, ytp toner, this as my serum and skinfix moisturizer. I had horrible mask acne around my chin area and within 4 days of using that skincare regimen my acne has SIGNIFICANTLY reduced. I’m so happy with the results and how my skin feels. I’m going to purchase the full size right after I post this review. As someone with oily/combo skin it’s hard to find skincare that doesn’t dry me out causing my skin to produce more oils and break me out or something so moisturizing where it clogs my pores. Finally, after 26 years I found a skin care regimen that works for me and I couldn’t be happier with the results. So far so good
