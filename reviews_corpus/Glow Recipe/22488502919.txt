I like how thick and rich this toner is! I struggle with larger pores and I feel like this will definitely help! I just tried it for the first time this morning and I really like how it soaked into my skin without feeling sticky or oily. BHA is really good for my oily to combo skin. Will definitely update yâ€™all on the blog soon to see if it reduces the appearance of my pores! Amazing!
