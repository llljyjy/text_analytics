I received a sample of this cleanser and used it twice daily for two weeks. Previously I was using the Blueberry Bounce Cleanser (same routine). I have combo skin (very oily everywhere but dry, flaky, and red around my mouth) and breakout easily. The smell is not as good as the Blueberry Bounce - it has a clay-scented undertone. It feels very smooth when applied and lathers up, but it doesnâ€™t get quite as foamy as the Blueberry Bounce. I think my complexion has improved over the past two weeks. My skin is not as oily, the dry area around my mouth is still dry but not flaking, and I have fewer breakouts. I plan on switching to this cleanser and would recommend it! I will miss the pump bottle of the Blueberry Bounce and wish this cleanser also came in a pump bottle so I could better measure how much I need to make it lather up. Overall skin texture improvement
