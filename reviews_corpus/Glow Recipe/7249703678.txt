Glow Recipe does not disappoint! This eye cream is ultra hydrating and does not irritate my dry, sensitive eyes. It’s the perfect prep before applying makeup that helps keep makeup from settling into any fine lines. The consistency is a light gel cream and overall it does the job it’s intended to do! Plus, it comes in cute packaging. nan
