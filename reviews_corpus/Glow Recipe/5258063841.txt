This is a nice gentle chemical exfoliating serum. Gentle enough to use daily. I don’t get any intense burn with it like I do with other chemical exfoliators. It does have a light strawberry scent but nothing that’s irritating. I do think this helps with texture and acne when used consistently and is a perfect everyday serum. Nice and not too harsh
