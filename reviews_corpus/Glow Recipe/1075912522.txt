I’ve been a Glow Recipe fan for years, so I had high expectations for this new formula. It didn’t disappoint! It gives me the same dewy, glowy look I come to expect from the Watermelon Sleeping Mask, and I love the added benefits of the actives. I’ve been using this every night for over a week, and I’m definitely noticing better texture, smoother skin, and a hydrated, glowy look and feel in the morning. glowy goodness!
