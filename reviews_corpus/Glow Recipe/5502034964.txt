I recently finished a jar of this and I thought it was mostly fine while I used it. It wasn’t until I started using another balm that I realized it did a lot for my skin. I have dry skin so I am normally worried about how much a cleanser may strip my skin, but compared to the results I’m seeing using another cleansing balm since running out of this, this was pretty good at keeping my skin hydrated and soft.I didn’t use this to take off eye makeup, but for face makeup, it worked really well. It smells nice, comes with a little spoon so it’s easy to take enough product out so you don’t have to dip fingers in, and it lathers up nicely. It worked really well all throughout the time that I had it.I would absolutely repurchase this and plan on doing so once my current cleanser runs out. Don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone
