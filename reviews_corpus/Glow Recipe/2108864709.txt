Okay I seriously love this sunscreen. I think the best part about this sunscreen is that it’s more like translucent rather than white. Sometimes sunscreen will leave my face looking white (which who wants that lol) and this one doesn’t do it at ALL. It is so beautiful and gives your skin a nice glow. I will definitely be mixing this in with my moisturizer. It also smells amazing - like watermelon of course! So happy!!!!!!!! OBSESSED x1000
