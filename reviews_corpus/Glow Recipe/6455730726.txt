i love this Watermelon Glow PHA+BHA Pore-Tight Toner. The packaging is gorgeous as always. It has a light scent of watermelon , which is really amazing. The consistency is little thick for toner but it absorbs quickly into the skin.  I have been using it for a few weeks and I am seeing improvements already. My skin feels hydrated and pores are shrinking after using this toner regularly. It has the perfect balance of hydration and exfoliating for my skin. I highly recommend this. nan
