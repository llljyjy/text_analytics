I of course caved in to this product when I saw it all over Tiktok. I knew it would be worth it, and it is!! I have extremely dry, sensitive, and acne prone skin. I have to be careful when choosing skin care products. No breakouts, and this keeps my skin hydrated all day. I haven’t had a chance to wear my makeup over it yet, but I’m excited to see how it will effect the finished look! I love Glow Recipe, their products aren’t harsh for my skin like most skin care lines. Highly recommend. Stunning product
