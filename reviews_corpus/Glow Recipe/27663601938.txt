I don’t usually write reviews at all really, but I wanted to say that this product is definitely worth the price. It helps with acne, pore size without drying out the skin.  It is also a thick formula so you can apply it like a serum, saving you money on cotton rounds or balls. It also helps with sustainability. Also, the product is appealing on an aesthetic level -smells amazing- so you’re really paying for a great product that looks great and works great. If you’re nervous, try out the travel size, and you’ll fall in love like I did! :) Worth the price!
