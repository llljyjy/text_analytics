This is my new favorite cleanser! First off, the smell is incredible! Second, I have combination skin, and I find this fits me perfectly. My skin doesn’t feel stripped or greasy afterwards, and I haven’t noticed any breakouts or reactions to this product. I had a free sample that convinced me to buy the full size, and I actually look forward to using this every night! I have been using this with the cleansing balm on occasion, but that hasn’t really made the results feel any different. I’m mostly just obsessed with the scent in this, it’s very fruity but not overpowering (to me anyways). I will definitely repurchase! Loved it!
