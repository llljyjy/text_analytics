Even though my skin can get a bit oily, I moisturize religiously and I swear it makes a huge difference, I still need to go for like lighter daytime moisture in the warmer months though and this is iiiiiit! It has many forms of hyaluronic acid and helps keep my skin feeling moisturized all day. This cream feels very gel-like and layers amazing on top of my serums as well as under my sunscreen and cosmetics without feeling oily, siliconey, or sticky. It also has a very light but yummy fragrance that hasnâ€™t caused me any irritation but you may want to patch test first! Amazingly lightweight gel-cream
