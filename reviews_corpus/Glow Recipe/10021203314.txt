The watermelon line from Glow Recipe has always been my fave of theirs. With a subtle yet pleasing watermelon smell, this resurfacing mask gently hydrated and brightened my skin after just a week of using it. My skin’s texture looks more even, smoother, and firmer as well. With ingredients like this has, you can’t beat it! nan
