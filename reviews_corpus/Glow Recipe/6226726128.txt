I wanted to love this, I really did. I love Glow Recipe but this is a HARD NO. It isn’t POC friendly, you’ll like Casper the ghost at first. Also made my face so itchy…. I tried it with all different moisturizers and alone and still not good. I’m dark deep black woman and normal to dry skin for reference. NOPE NOT IT
