Ive been using this for about 2 years and really enjoy it. I use at night right before bed and slather in under-eye and eyelid. No burning or irritation.  I find myself missing it on the nights i use something else or travel.  I do wish the spatula was magnetic as i find it easy to have it fall on the floor or in a drawer. Its hard to find because its clear. Other than that i love this! very rich and moisturizing
