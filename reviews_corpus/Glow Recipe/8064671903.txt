I love the way my skin feels after using this cleanser. It feels soft and smooth, not stripped of all moisture. I enjoy how the toner and serums I use apply after using it. It did sting my eyes a little but I just avoid getting it in my eyes and to me itâ€™s worth it because the cleanser is that good! Soft, smooth and moisturized skin! Love it!
