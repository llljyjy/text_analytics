I received this complimentary in exchange for a review; these are my honest opinions. Another note - I never tried the original version of this product, so I can’t offer a comparison between the two formulas.PROS:- I recall the original version having a strong watermelon Jolly Rancher scent, which I didn’t notice in this formula; it has a very faint watermelon scent that I really only notice if I sniff the open jar directly - great news if you have a sensitive nose like I do- the formula spreads so easily across the skin & absorbs quickly without leaving any tackiness behind - a little goes a long way!CONS:- sadly, this broke me out, so I can’t attest to its exfoliating/smoothing claims since I have had to stop using it no strong fragrance anymore, but broke me out
