I personally love this lip balm! It leaves my lips the perfect shade of pink (but isn’t too bright for my medium skin tone) and also doesn’t have too much shine so it’s perfect for everyday. It moisturizes my lips well and I don’t feel like it dries my lips out causing me to need more and more of it. Love adding a little gloss on top for the perfect juicy lip! One of my staple lipbalms!
