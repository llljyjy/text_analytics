I was very hesitant on buying this as I get so anxious trying new products. I have pretty sensitive skin and I have been normally using the Belif creams for moisturizer but was getting a bit bored of my skin care ritual & wanted to shake things up. I really do love Glow Recipes packaging- it’s always good quality and sturdy, lotions come with pumps that don’t quit on you so that’s a bonus! The scent is beautiful, it’s a very light watermelon whiff- perfect to wake yourself up on a summer morning. The lotion is very light and a little goes a long way. It doesn’t leave an oily feeling and it’s not a thick lotion so it doesn’t feel heavy. However, after you first apply it, it does seem to stay a bit “tacky” on the skin, almost sticky. That does go away as it absorbs into the skin & I personally only use it at nighttime, but if you were using it in the morning you’d want to wait about 10 minutes before applying primer or makeup on top of this. As far as keeping my face hydrated it has done a wonderful job throughout the summer. I have zero dry patches and my skin looks even. I also love that it doesn’t get slimy or gross feeling as you sweat throughout a hot day. My one fear is that it might be a bit too light for a winter moisturizer, at least for myself personally, and I have combination skin, more so on the dryer side. I definitely recommend trying this product! it’s good stuff here.
