I’m a big fan of this sunscreen! It’s hard to find a product with a high SPF that doesn’t tint your face white and this one doesn’t do that. It actually leaves a nice glistening glow that I truly appreciate! I have olive oily skin and this product blends in quickly but does feel more dewy. The smell is very light and not overpowering. Nice sunscreen!
