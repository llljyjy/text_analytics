Love the strawberry concept for this serum, but I was not able to see much of a difference after using it for a few weeks. But this serum is gentle enough to use every night, which I enjoyed. This may be a product that needs to be used for a long period of time to really feel and see a difference because itâ€™s so gentle. I hoped it would smell like strawberries but it smelled more like artificial cherries. (I received a free sample for my review) Cute Concept
