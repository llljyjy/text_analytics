I was so excited to try this, because I love niacinamide. I love their line of watermelon glow products, and this is the perfect addition. It gives your skin a gorgeous glow, and makeup layers flawlessly on top. I also love how lightweight and easy to blend it is. It doesn’t feel greasy or heavy, like sunscreens sometimes do.Throughout the day I noticed that it kept my skin feeling hydrated, which is so cool that a sunscreen has that type of benefit. It doesn’t have a white cast which is very important.I also stopped using my regular niacinamide to see if this product evened my skin or lightened any scarring, and it did! It definitely has the skincare benefits that niacinamide usually does.It’s my new favorite product right now, highly recommended! Favorite sunscreen
