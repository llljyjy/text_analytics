I am obsessed with the Glow Recipe AHA night treatment! I used it at night as an overnight treatment and I loved how tighter my face felt the following day after the first use! Because it contains 2.5% AHA, I like to use this at night right before moisturizing. I appreciate that my pores appear smaller, and my skin is so much brighter and glowing. It’s very hydrating, it’s cooling and very light and it doesn’t dry me out at all. It’s such a great overnight treatment; it’s a gentle exfoliant that supports cell turnover so I love that they came out with this product! So far after using for the last couple of days I have seen dependable results! Love how this smells!
