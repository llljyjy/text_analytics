I really wanted to like this product and was really hoping it would clear my breakouts. I think this had the opposite effect and made my breakouts worse. I had clear skin before using this product. Iâ€™ve had better experiences with their other serums. I feel like their vitamin c serum did a better job at keep my skin breakout free compared to this serum. Not my favorite serum
