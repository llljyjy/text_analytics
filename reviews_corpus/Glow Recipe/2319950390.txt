I love this so much! I’ve been trying to be better at wearing SPF daily but my skin is prone to acne – this doesn’t cause any breakouts for me at all. I also love the faint watermelon smell, it’s so calming! The texture is perfect and the niacinamide helps my skin feel moisturized. It glides on smoothly without making my skin feel greasy! Needless to say, I think I’ve found a new addition to my daily skincare routine. In love
