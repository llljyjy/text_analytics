I absolutely love Glow Recipe’s skincare products, so I was so excited to learn that they were coming out with a sunscreen! And with a high SPF of 50. The texture is creamy and absorbs well leaving no white cast. I love how hydrating it is as many sunscreens that I have used aren’t hydrating enough. I look forward to seeing further benefits with daily use! Full of hydration!
