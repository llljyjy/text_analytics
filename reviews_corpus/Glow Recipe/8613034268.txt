I was recently diagnosed with rosacea, and being a skincare enthusiast, I knew what key ingredients I needed to look for in products while building my new rosacea friendly skincare routine. I started out simple, but was looking for something to add that extra oomph that my skin needed to heal overnight. I’ve tried this product before, and remembered I liked it, but didn’t have a specific skincare concern at the time. Knowing that rosacea flare ups are caused by a damaged skin barrier, and that ceramides help to heal it, I decided to give this a try once more, and thank God I did. I still tend to have redness, but my main concern were the flare ups, and they have been kept at bay after incorporating this into my routine. Magic serum for rosacea
