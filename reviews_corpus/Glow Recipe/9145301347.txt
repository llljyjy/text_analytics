absolutely not. I should have taken a photo of how BADLY this pilled on my skin. maybe if you don’t mind that or aren’t applying makeup on top it’ll be fine. it’s a thin formula so I didn’t anticipate it to do so. but for $34 no thanks. I’ll still to Korean or Japanese formulas this is so disappointing. nope.
