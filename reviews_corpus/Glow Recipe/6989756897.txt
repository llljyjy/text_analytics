At first I was a bit skeptical of the product but after trying it for a few weeks I can say it works well. For me, it works better in the daytime with my drugstore moisturizer/sunscreen. At both day and night time I use a majority of glow recipe products including their watermelon moisturizer (nighttime only), toner and dew drops & for some reason on my skin it made it feel super matte like those matte foundations and so I feel like my skin would make extra oil to compensate because there was none. My skin is already oily so I think this cut back on the oil I had but only for so long. Doesn’t really feel good to wake up to extra oil on the face anywhere. I got a pimple (blackhead) while using the product. I don’t know if that was my skin purging or not, but as I said I switched to using this once a day in the daytime and my skin is much happier with that. There is a scent there but not unbearable although if you have sensitive skin or don’t like fragrance in skincare altogether, you might want to skip this one Decent
