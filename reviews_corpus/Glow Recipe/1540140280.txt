A very good night time treatment to brighten your skin! I found that using it a few days a week is just right - skin is very fresh, supple and visibly clearer in the morning after the use. I find that using it more often gives me skin redness, so beware if you have sensitive skin. Sludgy gel-like texture is okay, I am not a fan, but the product absorbs real well and doesnâ€™t leave a sticky residue on my pillow. All in all, a convenient product that delivers. Give it a try. Very good
