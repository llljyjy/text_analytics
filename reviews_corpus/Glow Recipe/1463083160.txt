Really works to moisturize. Maybe it brightens? The moisturizer is so good (got rid of my fine lines) that I do not care if it brightens (and it might, just finding it hard to tell one way or another). The other draw back is the pump lets you pump way more than you need and the jar is ultra mini so you could run out way too fast. Amazing eye cream for sensitive eyes
