I have been using the gel cream for a little more than a week and omg it feels amazing, you honestly just need half pump because it glides and applies like butter so a little goes a long way. I love how it doesnâ€™t irritate my eyes and as soon as I apply it my under eyes feel very refreshed. Definitely adding it to my daily skincare
