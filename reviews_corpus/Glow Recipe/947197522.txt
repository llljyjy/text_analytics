It is thicker than you would anticipate. A little tacky too. I used it for a few days and it began to break me out. Waited a month or so and then tried it again and within 2 days more breakouts. :( If you don’t have acne prone skin this could be a fun product for you otherwise you may want to steer clear. not for acne prone…
