Another home run for Glow Recipe! This is the ultimate night treatment and you really see the difference with just one use. I love the milky texture and that instant cooling effect the second it goes on the face. My skin felt dull, dry before I applied and when I woke up, I had baby skin! It was so hydrated and I noticed it was more glowy then usual. If you suffer from dryness or dullness in your skin like I do, you need this product! The Ultimate Night Treatment
