this product contains watermelon extract which hydrates, smooths and supplies crucial vitamins and amino acids! it also contains hyaluronic acid and catus water which functions as a humectant and holds water molecules onto the surface of your skin to keep it nice and hydrated and the catus water carries electrolytes. in addition to those ingredients, this product also contains PHA which gently exfoliates and BHA which penetrates the pores and gently break up blockages that cause clogs leading to a more smooth, glow-like skin. after 3 weeks of use, i noticed that this product was very hydrating and caused a glow like look without look oily or shiny. there is a slight scent which reminds me of plants rather than watermelon but it is very subtle and not too noticiable in my opinion. this product is very lightweight and somewhat sticky but not too sticky and lathers on very smoothly without any residue. i have noticed that with using this product my skin has looked more hydrated as well as clearer and my pores have been minimized I loved
