I purchased this to decrease the rosacea in my cheeks. Has a very light smell to it. Doesn’t irritate my skin and I have noticed it has made a bit of a difference already. Taking one star for the fact that it doesn’t absorb very well, I find that I have to wait about 3 or 4 mins before applying my moisturizer which is annoying. Nice!
