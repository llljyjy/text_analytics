I’m normally super sensitive to fragrance but this smells so good! I love the scent, the packaging is adorable (as all glow recipe products are), and I love the way it makes my skin feel. It feels super soft, glowy, and still hydrated! I love pairing with my watermelon toner and moisturizer before going to bed. I’m excited to continue to use this to see better results but so far am liking it! So far loving it!
