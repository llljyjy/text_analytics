This is a regular part of my routine.  Although it says that you need to use a second cleanser, I do not always.  In the morning this cleanser is plenty on my prior night skin routine.  That being said, I often do facials and may use something like Fresh Sugar Scrub or MILK watermelon brightening mask/stick after this and before using a facial device.   I also do not wear a lot of makeup in general, and may be simply washing off tinted sunblock with a little cover up.  At night, this is often enough depending on what I am doing.  I may follow it with the Dr. Dennis Gross peel/wipes.  In these cases, a second cleanser would be too much for me.  I do love this product, my skin feels very clean afterwards and I never feel like there is a residue.  I love the way that I can tailor it with other products. This is a regular part of my routine.
