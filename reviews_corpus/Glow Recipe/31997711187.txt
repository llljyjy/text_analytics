I’m really disappointed about this. I was really hoping it would smell like the rest of the watermelon glow like but it has a strong sunscreen smell and it’s super greasy and sticky. I had to wash my hands after because they felt disgusting. My face also looked super shiny and greasy afterwards. The packaging is really small for the price. I won’t be purchasing again. Wish I wouldn’t have gotten this because I probably won’t keep using it either. nan
