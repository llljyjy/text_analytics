This is a great cleansing balm! I love the Wishful Clean Genie but it’s not avaliable anymore so decided to try this one. I have extremely sensitive eyes and this never irritates them and taked off waterproof mascara very easily with no tugging in your eyelashes. This is a great replacement for the Wishful balm. It emulsify great. I do find that you do have to use this with water tho. if you don’t it will leave you skin a little tacky. The Clean Genie you could use with or without water and it left your skin feeling great. Great
