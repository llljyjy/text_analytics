Applied nicely on skin. It makes your skin glowy and very little white cast. I feel a cool sensational on my skin. Everything looks great until 2 hours later I check the mirror and shockingly find it pilling. I have to rub the pilling off my skin. I canâ€™t imagine how much it will pill during the winter month when my skin tends to get drier. nan
