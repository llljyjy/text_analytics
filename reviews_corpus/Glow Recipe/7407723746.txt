Helped me clear my skin!!! I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on products to clear my acne and blackheads on my nose. This product is amazing for sensitive skin (I have really red skin). Along with this product I like to moisturize and slug with Vaseline. This may not work for everyone but it worked for me by also helping me heal my skin’s barrier. My holy grail but it does have one downside and that would be the fragrance. It doesn’t smell bad but it is strong IMO. clear skin :)
