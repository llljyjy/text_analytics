I’ve used this as a every other day toner. I used Murad’s toner on the off days as I felt the need to have a more abrasive toner. UNTIL I realized I needed more moisture, I quit using Murad altogether and use this as a every day toner. Ive seen a major difference in the elasticity and clarity of my skin. My pores are way smaller, and my skin has a healthy shine to it. I use a “ exfoliate “ face cotton pad with the toner for a “ abrasive “ tweak. I apply my retinol OVER this toner, and so far, my skin loves it. I get the most compliments now for my skin. ELASTICITY's best friend
