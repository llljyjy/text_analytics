This product does everything it says it will and then some. You only need to apply a very small amount on the back of your opposite hand and then gently pat on your face with the other with a light touch. It really blends into your skin effortlessly and smooths out evenly across your face bringing you an immense amount of hydration. I’m impressed. I will def re-purchase this item once done. I love all of glow recipe’s products but this one might just be my fave after their sleeping mask. So hydrating and refreshing!!
