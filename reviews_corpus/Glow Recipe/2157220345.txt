New favorite SPF and new fave glowy base product! I reapplied on a day with no makeup after 4 hours and the layered affect left a sort of white cast tin man situation so maybe wouldnâ€™t do that again. Under makeup Is amazing and one layer without makeup is amazing. The smell is great. I usually have a hard time finding SPF that works well under makeup but this is it!!! nan
