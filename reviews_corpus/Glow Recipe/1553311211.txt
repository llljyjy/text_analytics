i have had an interesting experience with this spf. i figured i’d share my story and advice, in case you’re considering buying, or struggling with this product. i have extremely dry skin during winter. my skin drinks up moisture and creams like crazy, and can still always take more. i got this product at launch, and i had zero issues applying this spf over a full face of creams, and even another moisturizing spf. i was surprised when i heard that people had issues with pilling, and i figured that people were just rubbing this product in too much, instead of applying a layer and letting it dry. and then spring came. my skin returned to more normal hydration levels. the first day i applied this over my normal skincare, i saw exactly what other reviewers meant. it pilled like crazy! it’s a shame, because this spf is beautiful and glowy. i have since reworked what i do before i apply it, and thought i’d offer some advice: use this spf over minimal moisturizing skincare. it is a very hydrating product on its own, so you can get away with using it either over a lighter moisturizer that’s absorbed into the skin, or the spf on its own, depending on your skin’s hydration level. apply your two fingers-worth in an even layer, and don’t rub it in, just apply and let dry. it wears well under makeup, surprisingly, and i like how the product shows up as a beautiful glow on the skin. i only wish that the product was water resistant, and not so finicky. i hope this helps :) great for dry skin, use caution otherwise
