While the ingredients were right and the smell was HEAVENLY (like Jolly Ranchers), I found this serum wanting. I have to admit that always feel sticky on my skin and I’m encountering some problems getting the product out. With the 5 forms of Vitamin C, I feel they’re gilding the lily and I’m paying for actives that do the same job (or not at all). Furthermore, my fakespot checker tells me the reviews aren’t as good as they appear to be.Honestly for the price point, I’ve had more luck with the stinky stuff (breaks my heart). Give it a try, but it wasn’t right for me. I wanted to love this...
