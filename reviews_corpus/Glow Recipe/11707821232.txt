Let me tell you, this girl went through ALOT of cleanser and face soap in finding the perfect one. I have t bone combo skin, and pores on the nose, chin, and cheeks. Plus my skin is sensitive. I love the feel and smell it leaves on my skin, so fresh and clean without drying or being too harsh. I also use this to clean off makeup. Just the perfect feeling of AHHH when your day is done. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS IS MY FACE CLEANSER
