This product has saved my skin. I have combination, acne-prone skin and tried hundreds of products. This is on my top 3 to prevent and get rid of acne, while protecting and restoring the skin barrier. It is gentle yet effective. It calms redness and acne and restores the skin. It’s pricey, but worth every penny. I believe it’s the combination of 5 ceramides (ceramide NP, NS, AP, EOP, EOS) and avocado oil. It’s lightweight and non-greasy. You can use it everyday or as a rescue serum for acne breakouts or to soothe redness. I highly recommend. IG @honestbeautyreview_canada Holy grail for combo, damaged, acne-prone skin
