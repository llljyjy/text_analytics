This serum is ok. The texture and light scent are very nice, absorbs well and doesn’t make my skin look or feel greasy. It’s hydrating and offers antioxidant benefits, but I didn’t notice any results in fading dark spots or even overall brightening. I’m glad I tried it and enjoyed the experience of applying the product, but wouldn’t repurchase given the price point. nan
