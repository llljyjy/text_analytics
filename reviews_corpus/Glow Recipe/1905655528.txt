I bought this sunscreen the day it was released. There was already so much hype around it, I couldn’t wait to try it. I have now been using this for about a week and when I first got it yes, I thought it was nice but it was only because I used a very small amount. If you use a the correct amount it sunscreen needed for good protection—this sucks. IT SUCKS. its thick, goopy and leaves you very greasy looking. it feels heavy on the skin and theres a very slight white cast. and this pills. it pills on first application, it pills when you go to reapply. this doesn’t dry down fully for me either. it stays sticky and feels heavy on my face throughout the day. the sunscreen smell is slight, but you can def smell it. so much for being a sunscreen you’ll actually want to wear. THICK, HEAVY, STICKY, GREASY.
