I love that this serum include low percentage of the acids so it’s not tingling and can use on a daily basis. The texture is pretty on the light side and very easy to spread. My skin absorbs immediately. I love to use it at night just because of many active ingredients in this gorgeous bottle. I couldn’t see any effects at this moment but I’d love to keep using it for the lovely texture! Cute products!
