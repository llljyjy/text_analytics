I’ve never had a toner do anything for my skin, so I didn’t expect this to, but I am amazed by it!! I have somewhat large pores on my nose and my skin has some texture. After only one night of using this, my pores are visibly smaller and my skin is softer than ever!! I didn’t think it would soften my skin at all, even if it did shrink my pores, so I’m super happy about that. I bought the full size because my Sephora was out of the mini size but I’m so glad I did. It’s a little thicker than most toners I’ve used, so you do have to shake the bottle a little. I cannot recommend this product enough it is so worth the price tag if you struggle with large pores and texture!!! (I also use a AHA chemical exfloliant after this) Shrinks pores AND softens skin!
