I have acne-prone and oily/combo skin and this product did not irritate my skin too much (when used in combo with my regular acne cleanser and topical). This cleanser did however help smooth/heal up dry, cracked winter skin. I like the feel of this product as well, it feels light and moisturizing and lathers softly. There is no signifcant smell. This is a good product to have in your collection for times when your skin is dry or sunburnt even. Good cleanser for winter skin
