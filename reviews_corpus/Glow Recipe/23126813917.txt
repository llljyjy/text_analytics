I’ve gone through about three of these. this is my absolute favourite Niacinamide serum. It’s light and feels like nothing on your skin but you know it’s there. This cleared my skin texture issues. I Love that is a skin care make up hybrid and you can wear it as a step in your skin care routine or as a highlighter. nan
