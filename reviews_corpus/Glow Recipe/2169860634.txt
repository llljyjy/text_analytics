Trying a new product is always a struggle for me so when it works without making my sensitive skin reacting, I’m soooo happy. I use it with the serum Plum Plum and my skin still feel comfortable. No reaction. The texture is mid-cream mid-gel, the smell is neutral, don’t expect an incredible smell. But as a sensitive skin person, I rather have an efficient product without smell that really moisture my skin.After almost a year being a mom, I stopped most of my beauty routine until I had to go back to work 2 weeks ago. My skin was ok. Not much. It’s been only one week I use it with the Plum Plum cream and I already see a difference. I would say even after 3 days I saw a difference and I felt my skin more comfortable after one use only. nan
