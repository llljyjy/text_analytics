I heard so much about this product that I had to buy it.The scent is amazing, literally like a watermelon popsicle. It has a good consistency, not watery but little bit sticky, so it gives the dewy look that’s advertised. This is definitely what to buy when you are wearing just mascara and natural brows as it doesn’t do great over or under foundation. With that in mind, it does great. Only complaint is that it leaves my skin feeling slightly sticky after application. nan
