I love the package of the SPF, it’s super girly and pink which I love! The SPF itself works well in combination with the Plum Plump moisturizer. Your skin will be glowy, but most importantly protected! It’s lightweight, and it has a soft watermelon fragrance that isn’t too overpowering. What I love most is that I can put it on all areas of my skin and it’ll glow! If you want glowy skin this is it!!
