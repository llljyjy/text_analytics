My skin really enjoyed this product. I was hesitant at first with it having vitamin C in it because my eyes area tends to be extra sensitive with vitamin C serum‘s around it but this one was really nice and didn’t cause any negative reactions. The jar is cute as all glow recipe products are, and it was a very hydrating product and worked as a fantastic base for layering other skin care and make up products on top. nan
