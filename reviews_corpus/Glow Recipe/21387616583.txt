This makes me look so glowy! I tried it with my regular face cream (clinique gel & also with ceramidin) and no pills. I also tried it alone and it was nice. It smells good and I love how my skin looks!!! I have olive skin and it leaves no white cast and doesnt get weird around edges of face. Did not try with makeup. Great!
