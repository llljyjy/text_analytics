This is my first time using it. Usually I wait until after a few uses, but I don’t think I’ll be using it anymore or at least not buy another one bc the smell is not pleasing. Not that I was expecting a fruity fragrance, if anything I thought it wasn’t going to have a smell or at least a strong one. I’ll finish up the jar and reuse it bc the jar is nice the smell.
