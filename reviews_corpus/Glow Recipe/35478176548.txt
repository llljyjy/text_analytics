As always Glowrecipe has another great product!  This eyecream is very lightweight and wears well with makeup.   Even though it a vitamin c serum, it works well on my sensitive skin.  My eye area looks bright and smooth.  I prefer to use this gel cream in the a.m and the avocado retinol mask in the p.m.  A great addition to your skincare routine. A great eye cream!
