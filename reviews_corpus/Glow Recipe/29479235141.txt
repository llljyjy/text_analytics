Honestly, I was extremly excited to try this product because I’ve heard and seen many positive reviews of this product. I have a normal to dry skin combination and this product was not for me. I gave it a try for a while but I would wake up with a lot of redness and pimples on my face, this hasn’t happened with any other product I’ve used before. There’s something in this that’s not made for sensitive skin. The texture is a little weird, sort of like jelly, and it leaves your face feeling sticky, heavy, and a little greasy. It seems like a light formula but it’s not. Maybe this product is made for another skin type. I don’t recommend for everyone!!!!!!!!! NOT AS GOOD AS IT SEEMS
