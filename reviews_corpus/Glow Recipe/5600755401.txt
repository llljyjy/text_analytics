Only my body can tolerate this. On the second day of use, my face and neck broke out in tiny whiteheads within hours. I gave this sunscreen a break and revisited it later only to have the same issue. It also has enough white cast to not be friendly for most skin tones. Like other reviews, I also experienced pilling. Gave it 2 stars because it feels nice on the rest of my body.
