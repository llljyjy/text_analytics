After using this product for a few days, I haven’t noticed drastic change yet, however, I am seeing some small immediate difference such as the eye area seems to be more hydrated and soft. Compared to other eye gels such as the Cheer Up eye cream I’ve been using, the application of this goes on so smoothly and dries quickly. nan
