Best cleansing balm ever! Make sure to always get it out with dry hands if you don’t have a scoop or it will ruin the product. I have used it for everyday makeup, stage makeup and full glam it never disappoints removes everything and leaves skin feeling great. I tried versed when this one was out of stock at my store and it doesn’t even compare. best cleansing balm
