Truly LOVE this face mist!  It’s my ACE!  I use it when blending in my foundation… perfection every time!  So far I have used it with 3 different foundations and it has blended beautifully.  I also keep it in my purse so that I can spray through my day.  It’s not only a mood booster but great for touching up your makeup and refreshing your dull face.  I have extremely sensitive skin but have not had issues with this product.  This product in my opinion is very expensive for the amount you get.  If it was less expensive I would repeatedly buy it. Give it a try
