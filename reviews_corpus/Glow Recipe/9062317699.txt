I very much enjoy this product I have a lot of gl recipe products I mix this with another serum that I’ve used for years and it just makes the other serum even better my skin feels smooth and my texture is no longer there. And it does smell like strawberries but it’s not an overwhelming smell you can barely smell it. If you’re looking for a serum that smooths your skin this is amazing to add to your routine Very smoothing
