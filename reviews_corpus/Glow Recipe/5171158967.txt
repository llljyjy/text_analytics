I wear this on top of a load of skincare since I have very dry skin and haven’t experienced any pilling. I start with their toner, then my bhydra, vitaminc or other treatment, and then farmacy honey moisturizer/ plum plump moisturizer. I apply three fingers length and work it in quickly, I let it sit for 15 minutes before applying makeup on top. It gives a really nice glow. It leaves a white cast until it sets, that’s how I know it has set and it’s ready for makeup on top. It’s easily in my top 5 fave sunscreens :) recommend if you have dry skin
