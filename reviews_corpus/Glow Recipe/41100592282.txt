I’ve been using this product for two weeks and it has saved my skin from the dryness of winter! It cleans so well, is hydrating and nourishing, and soft and creamy. When I’m lazy its a great one step cleanser and never leaves my skin quenching moisture. I highly recommend this product as most cleansers break me out so easily. PS, it’s neutral in scent. Must have cleanser!
