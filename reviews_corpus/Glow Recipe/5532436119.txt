How have I not tried this before?! itâ€™s sooo good! It actually feels more like a serum than a toner. I have dry skin. and this was extremely nourishing. I was shocked when I woke up and saw my skin looking glowier than ever. I received this through the brand, but once I use it up, I will absolutely be purchasing this with my own money! So nourishing. Try it cold!
