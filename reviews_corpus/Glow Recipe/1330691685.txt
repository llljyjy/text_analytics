Overall my skin looks brighter and smoother. I’m always skeptical of multi-use products, especially when it comes to pores. I have oily skin, and my pores are a concern. I have added one pump of this lightweight and creamy, strawberry medicine scented (the scent doesn’t last) serum to my nighttime routine. Applying right after my toner, it layers well with all my other products. Influenced.
