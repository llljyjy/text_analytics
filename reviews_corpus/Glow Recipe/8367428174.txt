The glow recipe under eye cream is currently my fave I love the consistency it’s thick that little goes a long way doesn’t feel heavy on the skin. I also love the cool feeling it gives when I apply it to my under eyes . It makes the makeup under my eyes look flawless and not dry at all which I struggle with definitely recommend to add to your skin care routine. Glow recipe has my heart
