Love the consistency of this products as it is not to heavy or too light! The morning after I used this product, my skin felt nicely hydrated whereas other products have been a little over hydrating. My skin also glows in the morning which gives me so much confidence going into my day. It layers well with other products I use, including glow recipes other products I use as needed. My skin definitely feels nice and soft, and overall renewed after using this overnight mask. I will definitely continue using weekly when my skin needs a pick me up or reset! Couldnâ€™t recommend this product enough. Amazing!
