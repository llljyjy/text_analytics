It’s a nice serum but it’s not transformative. I mainly was using it for the vitamin c benefits not the dark spot benefit, but either way it didn’t change my life. It does last a few months which is nice because it doesn’t seem like that much product when you get the bottle. The scent is very fresh and subtle. Overall, it’s nice but I won’t be repurchasing because I think there’s better vitamin c products at a lower price. nan
