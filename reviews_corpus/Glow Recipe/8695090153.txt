Tried it last night & I’m very happy with this new formula! Loved the OG watermelon sleeping mask, so I was a little worried at first. I did use a moisturizer on top of this, almost treated it like a treatment serum, to keep my skin hydrated as I am a dry skin type. The texture is light but fluffy, so I think if you’re skin is oily you might be able to get away without a moisturizer. My skin immediately looked glowy & bright, not sticky & no pilling issues! Played well with my other skincare so that’s a plus. I woke up with soft,even & happy skin. I think I’ll be using this 1-2 nights a week as a treatment in my bright skin journey! Treat your skin!
