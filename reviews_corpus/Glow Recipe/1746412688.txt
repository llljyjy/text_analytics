I will not live without this serum!! The ONLY thing that helps my cystic acne. You need to use it at least once a day and give it time. I noticed some reviews saying it piled… well, any serum will pile under CERTAIN moisturizers. It will not pile on its own and there are plenty of moisturizers this works well with. Yea the bottle is cute but don’t let that fool you this is serious stuff. I’ve used retinol %1.0 for acne and it super strong but this is better and VERY gentle. Absolute best!!!
