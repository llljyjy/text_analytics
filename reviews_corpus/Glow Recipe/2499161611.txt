Does exactly what it says-- gives a very glowy, VERY shiny finish to your face. My skin texture isn’t the greatest, so I find that sometimes the shine looks more oily than dewy as a result, but I’ve noticed after several weeks that my skin is brighter and softer from using it as well. Great for bare-faced days. I also sometimes dab on my cheekbones and nose as a kind of no-silp highlighter as well. I got the mini version of this and will be re-buying. Big fan of the shiny finish
