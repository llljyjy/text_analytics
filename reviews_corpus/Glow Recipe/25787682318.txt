On the plus side, lovely smell and it’s a lovely texture to apply and you’re left with a radiant glow. However, my biggest issue with sunscreen is while you get the best of both worlds when it comes to broad spectrum protection considering there are mineral and chemical filters, you also get the worst of both worlds too. It left the sorta gross sticky feeling a mineral sunscreen does with a slight white cast, but also stung my eyes like a chemical sunscreen sometimes can. Not to mention its expensive compared to other sunscreens. I won’t be repurchasing. Not bad, but not great
