I tried out the mini version as part of the Sephora Favourites set and was very pleasantly surprised! Don’t usually wear a ton of makeup but I’d use some BB cream for light coverage. Didn’t notice much of the dewy effect but it definitely made my skin look very healthy and I found myself not needing to add on any coverage at all on some days. After using this for about 1.5 weeks with the Pore Tight Toner (also a sample), my complexion evened out a lot and had a subtle glow as if I had a beauty filter on. You’re pretty much good to go with just one pump and I highly recommend taking your time when applying, making sure it’s very well absorbed (use your whole hand to gently pat your face). The watermelon scent didn’t really bother me that much so I used this as a serum in the nighttime right before my moisturizer and as a primer in the day. If I had to critique something, it just would be the product build-up on your fingers after applying that I’d always have to go to wash my hands afterwards for, but that’s just me being nitpicky. nan
