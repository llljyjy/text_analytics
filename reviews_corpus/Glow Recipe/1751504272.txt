I was hesitant to try this product because I’m not huge on strawberry scents and this definitely does have a candied strawberry smell… that doesn’t linger. However, the product is very lightweight and sinks nicely into the skin while giving you a glow. It’s got great ingredients with ahas and bhas without being harsh on my skin. Looking forward to using this longterm to see if it continues to work on my skin. After about 2 weeks, I notice my skin feels smoother. Nice product
