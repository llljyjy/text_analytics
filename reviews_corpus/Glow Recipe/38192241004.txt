ok, have been using Hyaluronic serums for a long time - and I wasnt sure how i would incorporate this as im used to using a liquid serum for my Hyaluronic step.  im obsessed with this. I can now layer my peptide serum/retinols/niacinamide serums underneath, then I use this ultra plumping and hydrating hyaluronic cream over the top which is a little more nourishing than a straight Hyaluronic serum. In winter I follow with an oil-based cream and a face oil over the top of this as the Glow Recipe Hyaluronic Cream is more like a gel moisuriser. Am delighted with this product, will be refilling for sure. NEW STAPLE
