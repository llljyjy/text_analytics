Searched for years for something to help smooth out my skin, hydrate it and brighten. Yes, it might feel weird but itâ€™s not that different that the texture of aloe. Give it time to dry down. This is amazing especially for combination skin. It hydrated and exfoliates and whatever else your skin needs lol. Best Toner. Actually.
