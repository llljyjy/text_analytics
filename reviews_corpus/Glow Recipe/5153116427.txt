I have been using for a little over two weeks and it’s incredible the difference in my pores, and how makeup is now sitting so much smoother on the corners of my nose and chin.  I love that it’s a bit more of a serum texture to it because I can apply easily by patting on my face with my fingers.  I have very sensitive skin and this does not sting like other toners have, and it’s very well tolerated for once daily use for me as long as I stay away from under eye skin. Lives up to the hype
