I am on my third bottle now and have to say i really do see a difference. My skin is brighter and sun spots lightened. It’s very gentle and doesn’t sting or irritate like more potent vitamin c serums can. The only downside is her packaging. It’s super cute but the shape of the bottle makes it tricky to get every last drop. It stops pumping at a certain point, the pump mechanism can’t seem to reach every drop so i wind up having to unscrew the top and pour some out into my hands. I do wish they’d revamp the packaging to address that but the product itself is so good I’ll continue to buy anyway. Definitely a recommend regardless,just know when it stops pumping there’s still some more in there you can access by unscrewing the pump and pouring it into your hands. Third bottle now
