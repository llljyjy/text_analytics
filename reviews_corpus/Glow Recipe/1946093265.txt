Best cream I’ve ever used! I’m honestly just waiting for it to blow up. Thanks to Tik Tok I learned my skin personally was dehydrated and not dry. Now that I switched up my products to reflect that I’m left with more hydration than I have ever seen in my life with none of the acne. I want to address some reviews that complain that the refill is smaller than the jar, these products go by WEIGHT, not volumetric measurements. The main container will give you 50ml and the refill pod will also give you 50ml. Dehydrated vs. Dry Skin
