I like how long this product lasts. A little goes a long way. It’s not too special in what it does. At least I didn’t feel a difference, but man this product lasts a long time. I bought a regular sized bottle and it lasted me more than a year. I wash my face twice a day, everyday. All I need is a small dollop, and you can get that from barely pumping the bottle, and I can wash my whole face with it. It’s no wonder it lasted so long! A Little Goes a Long Way
