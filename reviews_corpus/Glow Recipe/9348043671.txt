I’m obsessed with this product. It is so versatile and makes my skin feel amazing. I use it on my cheekbones as a dewy highlighter, I use it all over for a dewy glow, I use it before bed to lock in moisture overnight. My favourite use for it is I make a 50/50 mix of this with Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue Tinted Hydrating Gel Cream (which sucks on it’s own, btw), and put that all over my face for a dewy glow with sheer coverage. It makes my skin look glowy and even for the whole work day. It also smells AMAZING, which as someone with sensitive skin, is a real treat, since I often can’t use products with fragrances or perfumes. I can’t say enough good things about this product. Obsessed
