I’ll be the first one to say that I haven’t liked most of the Glow Recipe products that I’ve tried, but this serum is different! I’ve tried other AHA/BHA serums before and they’re always too intense/harsh on my sensitive skin. This one is gentle yet effective. My skin tingles for 2 seconds when I first apply it but then it quickly goes away. I wake up to really smooth and glowy skin. The best part is that all the ingredients in this serum are safe for fungal acne sufferers! nan
