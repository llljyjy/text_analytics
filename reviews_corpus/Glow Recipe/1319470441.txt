This is hands down my new favourite serum to use, it is so versatile, it works well under my makeup as a primer, as a night serum or just alone by itself. My skin is bouncy and glowy just like a glazed donut you need this in your life! Also it smells DIVINE just like a juicy watermelon and I have sensitive skin and didnâ€™t react badly at all! Where have you been all my life?!
