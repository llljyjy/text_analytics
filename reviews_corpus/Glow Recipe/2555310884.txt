This is my holy grail moisturizer. I use it every morning as a primer before my foundation and it helps smooth out any fine lines prior to foundation application. I love that this is a clean product so the ingredients aren’t harmful. I’ve gotten multiple comments on my face since I started using it. People will be amazed how it makes your skin glow and look “tight” :) Note - if you have dry skin this product probably won’t be moisturizing enough since it is oil-free. Glow Recipe has lots of other options that are more concentrated and focused on deep moisture. Best lightweight moisturizer out there
