While I have noticed a slight improvement using this toner, I wish it came with a pump or a different top as it gets messy.  There is a ring that forms at the top of the toner, but if you shake the bottle, the toner leaks out all over inside the lid.  The consistency of the toner is thicker, which I like, but you can’t really put it on a cotton pad.  I usually try to put some on my finger tips and apply, but this gets messy and you lose a lot of product.  For these reasons, I probably wouldn’t rebuy this item. I wouldn't rebuy this toner...
