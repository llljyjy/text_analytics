I really enjoy the Watermelon Glow AHA Night Treatment on top of my normal PM routine. It is a very thin consistency that spreads really far and hasnâ€™t caused any irritation with 2x week use. The scent is less noticeable than the the other members of the Watermelon Glow line and this is overall a great addition to my lineup! Non irritating and juicy!
