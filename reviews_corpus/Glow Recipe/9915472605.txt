I use accutane and am having difficulty trying to keep the moisture on my face without looking like a shiny faced doll. I find after I wash my face, I add the moisturizer and it burns a little, like a tingling/stinging sensation. It passes quickly but it’s annoying. It smells very good and applies smoothly. I’d recommend it for someone who doesn’t have already rough skin. nan
