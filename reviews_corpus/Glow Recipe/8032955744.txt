I never knew what people meant by sunscreen pilling until I tried this product. I don’t wash my face or use any products in the morning besides sunscreen, so I don’t think that’s the issue. I do like the glowy finish, but it’s a bit greasy so you’ll probably want to keep your hair away from your face. nan
