My skin took a while to like this, it was almost too heavy I’m not sure but I had to use a drier toner (Averr Aglow Luminous Complexion Toner) I had first and then follow it up with this one. After my skin got used to it, it started liking it and my skin felt the hydrating benefits. Initially though, my skin would freak out and break out, after I played around with it, used it, stopped, and tried it again, my skin did finally enjoy it. There are so many toners I want to try so I’m not sure if I’ll repurchase this anytime soon, but I probably will eventually, it’s a fun toner. Nice to have a PHA toner when wanting to exfoliate gently daily and with the BHA being good for acne prone skin (which I have) is a nice option. Which is why I’m surprised this toner would break me out in the first place. Glad I gave it a second chance because I finished the bottle :) I LOVE using my skincare to the brim. Fun hydrating toner
