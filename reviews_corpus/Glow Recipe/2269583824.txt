I was so excited when I saw that Glow Recipe came out with a new watermelon mask that targets pores and skin texture! I love how this brand focuses on creating products with clean ingredients. I cleansed my face and used my usual face oil before applying a generous amount of the Watermelon Glow AHA mask. The maskâ€™s texture was gel-like and it absorbed nicely into my skin. After applying the mask, I went to sleep to allow the mask to continue absorbing into my skin. When I woke up, I noticed my skin felt noticeably firmer AND hydrated. Usually products that firm the skin do so in a dehydrating manner but this product left my skin feeling amazing. My pores also looked smaller, and my overall skin texture was noticeably smoother. This is a great product to use multiple times weekly, and especially before special occasions! Firms AND Hydrates Skin
