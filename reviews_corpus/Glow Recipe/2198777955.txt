The sunscreen absorbed quickly into my skin and wasn’t at all greasy. It wears beautifully and gave my skin a healthy glow. I didn’t give me an oily appearance like some other sunscreens do which I really appreciate. Upon application I noticed a faint fruity scent that quickly dissipated and there was a slight sunscreen scent which lingered for a couple hours but it wasn’t overpowering or unpleasant. My skin tends to look oily in certain areas and dry in others but it looks more balanced when wearing this sunscreen. I am a huge fan of glow recipe and am so happy to have this sunscreen in my collection. Glowy but not greasy!
