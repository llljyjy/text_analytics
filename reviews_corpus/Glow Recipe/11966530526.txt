I honestly really love this product on my dry sensitive skin. I’ve been using it for about a week and a half now and have noticed a difference in my scarring. I haven’t been a frequent user of sunscreen in the past because I can’t get over the smell but I love this one. It’s really light weight and sits perfectly under my makeup. It’s really dewy and makes my skin look so glowy under my makeup. It’s honestly my favorite sunscreen I’ve ever tried and I think I’ll finally consistently be using sunscreen in my every day routine. Glow recipe NEVER misses! nan
