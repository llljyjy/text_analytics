It’s not bad but not a must-have. People with dry skin will probably like this much more than those of us with oily or combo skin, because the finish is noticeably shiny. It also feels tacky to the touch which isn’t something I like in a sunscreen. I haven’t observed any whitecast after application but I’m fair-skinned so take that with a grain of salt — I recommend watching video reviews by people with darker skin to confirm how it looks on nonwhite complexions. The price of this is also way too high to become a go-to sunscreen, because in order for a sunblock to be effective, you have to apply a decent amount and you should reapply throughout the day. With such a tiny bottle and high price, I think most people will be inclined to use less product than they’re supposed to in order to make it last longer. All in all, not a terrible product but far from the best. nan
