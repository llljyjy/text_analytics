Received it as a gift. I used to have a super dark outline around my dead-no-color lips, which I disliked very much, as I had to use concealer on the edges just to get an even look when applying tints/lipsticks. This balm actually lightened my dark lip edges and gave my lips a healthy color naturally within a month! I now don’t feel as conscious of my lips to color it every time I head out. I would have bought it again and again forever of it weren’t for the price. Gave life to my dead lips.
