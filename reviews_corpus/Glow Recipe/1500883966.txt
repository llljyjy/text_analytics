this product works. I was using it in the am and the pm everyday. day 3 I had to stop using it because I realized I was over using it. I could feel the over use. my skins was a bit sensitive and I don’t have sensitive skin. to me that shows it is in fact working and I just don’t need to use it as much. my skin looks nice and exfoliated. I only need to use this product 3-4 times a week 1 or 2 times in the pm and 1 or 2 times in the am different days spaced apart. I also use a milder daily exfoliant twice a day but other than that I wouldn’t use another exfoliant at all while using this even on off days. I think it’s more about nourishment on the side with this. I just tried glow recipe because it looked fun and cute but I’ve been pretty impressed by their products I find them to actually be really good. nan
