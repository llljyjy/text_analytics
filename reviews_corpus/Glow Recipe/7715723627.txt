I wanted to like this product so much. It doesnâ€™t get absorbed by my skin at all. It sits on top and leaves my skin sticky and still dry somehow. I feels slimy on application. It breaks me out on my cheeks and it breaks up whatever makeup I apply over it. I have the avocado serum which is amazing. No clue why this one is such a dud for me :( Such a disappointment
