Glow Recipe helped me get into skincare and get serious about my skin. The Watermelon Glow Mask was my first product and I am so excited to have this new product. The scent is not overwhelming and the product glides onto the skin effortlessly. My skin feels glowy and supple after use. I am excited to incorporate this into my skincare routine! nan
