I have dry skin that is prone to break outs so I love using products with AHA in it to help remove the excess dead skin. This overnight mask has been amazing in keeping my skin clear and it’s been slowly reducing my scars/hyperpigmentation issues as well. I love how smooth my skin feels the next day and how amazing this product smells. It’s a must have if you struggle with dry skin, dull skin or acne prone skin! Great for scars and acne
