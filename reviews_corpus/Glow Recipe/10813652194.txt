I have been looking for a sunscreen that works well on my oily and combination skin. This sunscreen worked so much better than expected, absorbing quickly into my skin without leaving a cast. I feel that for the price it is a little steep, so definitely test at Sephora before deciding to purchase to see if it works with your skin! nan
