I’m usually not a fan of eye creams but I really enjoy using this one. It doesn’t burn, isn’t sticky, and a half a pump is plenty for both eyes. I like the texture of the gel cream and I find it pleasantly hydrating and plumping. It actually makes a great base for my eye makeup too! My husband gets big bags under his eyes and even he’s enjoying using it. HANDS DOWN the best eye cream I've tried
