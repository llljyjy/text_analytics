I’ve always loved glow recipe products, but I genuinely dislike this sunscreen. I was expecting it not to leave that white residue that makes me so mad, but out of all the sunscreens I’ve tried, this one leaves the most. Don’t spend your money on this product, there are many more that are cheaper and doesn’t leave that white stuff behind. nan
