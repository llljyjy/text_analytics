So I was one of the first ones to try this serum before it came out. I am a fan of glow recipe because everything they make is just simply phenomenal. There is no denying they make great skincare. I have hyperpigmented skin and also have black spots under my chin so I decided to try this. Loving it is an understatement. It is so gentle yet very very effective. You actually see a difference. This is worth the splurge trust me. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT WORKS!!!!!!!!
