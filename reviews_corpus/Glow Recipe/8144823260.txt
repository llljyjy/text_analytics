I had the opportunity to try  Glow Recipe strawberry smooth BHA + AHA salicylic serum and I’m very impressed how well it performed on my dry skin. It did not cause any  irritations or dryness. It’s very lightweight and melts right into your skin. Once it dries my skin did feel a bit tight so I use it every other day.  I had a few blemishes and after a few uses I could see the difference and how it minimized the appearance. I was able to integrate this in my skincare routine and used before my moisturizer. It smells amazing. It’s a fruity scent but the best way I could describe it would be the smell of fruit punch. It smells amazing
