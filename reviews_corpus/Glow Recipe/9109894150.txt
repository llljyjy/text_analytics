This overnight mask has a lightweight jelly-like consistency. The product gets absorbed nicely into the skin without pilling or leaving a tacky finish. I was slightly hesitant about using it because I have dry and sensitive skin. Thankfully, it didnâ€™t cause any skin irritation. I also woke up the next day with hydrated and glowing skin! Wake up to hydrated and glowing skin!
