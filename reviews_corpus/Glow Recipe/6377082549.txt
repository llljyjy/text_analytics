I’m not sure what kind of sorcery this is but my skin absolutely loves it. I’ve been struggling with stubborn hormonal acne that won’t quit and also has been leaving nasty scars/dark spots on my cheeks. My derm prescribed winlevi assuming it would help…didn’t do anything. I was getting really discouraged until I started using the glow toner, this serum and the new moisturizer every day and night (along with my tretinoin) my skin is so much smoother, the dark spots are definitely lightening up and the breakouts are slowing down!!!! I’m so happy, I hope it continues to work. I love this brand so much! a life saver!
