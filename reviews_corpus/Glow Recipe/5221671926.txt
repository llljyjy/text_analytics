i love it! i’ve been using it for about a month now and i’ve only had a few tiny pimples pop up during that month! I usually have fully clear skin for about a day before more pimples appear so this is unusual for me. Fading of dark spots is gonna take more time but the fact it cleared my acne is amazing :D and a little goes a long way! cleared pretty much all my acne
