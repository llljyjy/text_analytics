I saw this on a YouTube review and had to purchase and try! I’m glad I did! I spray this after my make up and after I wash off my make up for the day and my mask to replace the moisture. I love how unique the sprayer is and just how yummy it smells. I get compliments about my skin at work the first week of using it. The glow is on point! Definitely a repurchase! I might even send one to my Aunt! She’ll love it! The Glow is on Point
