I liked the packaging and there was a decent amount of product. I usually use about one or two pumps for my whole face. I like to mix it into my moisturizer for added redness relief. Or, my own personal little life hack, I actually enjoy using this serum and a facial razor to get rid of peach fuzz! It’s very delicate and I notice my skin feeling so much better when I shave with this serum versus without it, plus the redness after shaving goes away a lot faster! Overall, pretty good. If it was a little stronger i’d give it 5 stars immediately, but it does help with redness. Face Shaving God Send!
