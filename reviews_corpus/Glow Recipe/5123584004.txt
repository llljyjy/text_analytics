Iâ€™m a huge fan of BHA/AHA treatments via serums vs any type of texturized exfoliating products. I find that they achieve their capabilities while being more gentle on the skin. This serum absorbs well and wears well under makeup while layering it with a moisturizer. My texture feels smoothed and skin feels nourished. Another hit from Glow Recipe! nan
