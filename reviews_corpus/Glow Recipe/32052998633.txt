I wish the container was bigger. It is very delicate and not drying although you can feel it working like a slight tingling. Feels like a nice cleansing step after taking off makeup and a day in the hot weather (I have oily skin and I need to cleanse it deeper). It is suitable for daily cleansing and I leave it on for 20 minutes very delicate but works for daily use
