I’ve been using this product for about a month and I don’t notice any difference in my skin. To be fair, I do only use it every other day because I can’t use my niacinamide serum with vitamin c. But on the days I use the niacinamide (from The Ordinary) I notice a HUGE difference in my skin. The days I use this product, I feel the need to wear makeup. My skin looks oily and discolored. Im going keep using it until it’s empty because it’s expensive. Ehhh wouldn’t repurchase
