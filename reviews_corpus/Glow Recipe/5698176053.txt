This is Glow Recipe’s newest product that’s a reformulation of their watermelon sleeping mask. This one adds some acids in it to promise you clearer and brighter skin after waking up. The texture is a soothing gel feel and I was sad that the watermelon scent wasn’t really detectable! After applying on the face, there’s a tingling sensation right away but goes it away quickly. It feels slightly sticky but too bothersome. The next day I didn’t really notice a huge difference in brightness and my skin wasn’t too dry after. Since it has acids in it, I wouldn’t use this more than 2x a week so any improvement in brightness would take a while to notice. I did enjoy using this though because of the texture and how my skin looked glowier in the morning. nan
