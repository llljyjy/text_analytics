*Was given a trial test for a review*If you have combo/sensitive skin, be careful. It does help with acne and acne redness almost immediately after a day, but for me personally, it caused even more acne to show up. Also, after consistent use, I couldn’t tell if it was causing my dead skin or the product itself to rub off after application. I don’t think I will buy but hopefully it works for someone! Works, But Be Careful!!!!
