The bottle was much smaller than I anticipated when I received this. Itâ€™s 50ml and it retails for $34. Using the 3 finger method, I feel as though you would blow through this product. Upon first impressions, the scent is a mix between watermelon and sunscreen, but the watermelon smell does dissipate quickly. It is very glowy on the skin and feels somewhat tacky before drying down completely. I had minor pilling on my hairline when first applying, but it wore fine throughout the day. nan
