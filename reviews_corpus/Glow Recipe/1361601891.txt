I am a huge fan of Glow Recipe specially their Dew Drop product which I use on a daily basis. So when I saw this product I had to try specially because I love using night masks. This new version of the Watermelon Glow AHA Night Treatment is really good! Iâ€™ve been using for a couple of weeks now and I noticed that the overnight results keep getting better and my skin looks brighter, firmer and refreshed day by day! nan
