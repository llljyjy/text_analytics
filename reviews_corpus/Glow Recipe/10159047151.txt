So far so good! I have very sensitive, dry skin, and have had no issue with this product. I thought it might be a bit gimmicky but I’m impressed with it. It is very hydrating (especially during winter) and definitely leaves a visible glow on your skin! It has no scent or silicones which is amazing and it is fungal acne safe as far as I know. It’s not very often I introduce a new product into my very tailored routine and this passed the test! I like it!
