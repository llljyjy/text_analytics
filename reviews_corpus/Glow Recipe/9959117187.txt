I love everything and I mean everything Glow Recipe but the sunscreen is not it. I have very dry sensitive skin and I fully understand some sunscreens will peel up but this one…. There was no compromise. I wear very little makeup just spot concealer and it wouldn’t stay on my face. Plus it feels VERY heavy on your face. That is a big no no for me. I don’t like feeling makeup on my face. The smell is straight sunscreen with a hint of watermelon. Overall there’s nothing great about this sunscreen at all and unfortunately I returned mine. Just stick to the sunscreen you already have
