We all have different levels when it comes to sensitive skin. I’m in my 40’s and have rosacea. I try to avoid fragrance in my skin care because I don’t want anything stinging my face. I had dry patches on my forehead and using this took care of it! Honestly, I was skeptical when I saw this gel like whipped cream. Because it seems very light. I tend to gravitate towards heavier creams like Cerave or Embryolisse. I am soo happy with this product! My skin literally is hydrated and makes my skin feel great! I prefer not to wear makeup bc I love to be comfortable in my skin. This worked for me. I hope it can help you too! I purchased the plum plump serum, can’t wait to use them together! If my skin continues to behave this way then I will have found my HG moisturizer! I also love that it is refillable! Thank you to Glow Recipe! Sensitive Skin People
