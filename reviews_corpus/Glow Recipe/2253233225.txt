loved this, mostly. the packaging is so cute...but almost annoying because i could never get just half a pump of product...seems like it will run out very quickly. however the cream itself is a great consistency, feels hydrating and smooth. i had success putting make up and sunscreen over it with out piling....but personally felt it was too strong for everyday undereye use - i have sensitive and drier skin though ! nan
