I have been using this cleanser for MONTHS now and still have so much left. I only wash my face at night though and don’t do a morning cleanse. A little goes a long way with this. Of course there is a slight fragrance, but it isn’t overwhelming. This leaves my skin feeling fresh without drying it out. nan
