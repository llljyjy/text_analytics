This is very unlike me, but I want to start with praising the jar. She is SO cute! I’m obsessed. Like it’s a jelly, this is art, truly, The product itself is also good - it is moisturizing, yet not greasy. The smell is one love. And yes, I’m keeping the jar once I use it all :) Good inside and out! Check out the jar :)
