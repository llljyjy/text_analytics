I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks and I’m obsessed. I took off a star because there is some dryness and it’s a little thick for a toner. But the results I’ve seen from this are great! I have really bad chin acne from the mask I cannot get control of and this has ended up being the savior for me amazing
