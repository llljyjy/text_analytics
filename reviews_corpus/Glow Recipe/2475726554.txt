I love everything Glow Recipe and this is no exception! This overnight treatment has a really nice light scent to it, it’s lightweight & absorbs nicely. It’s a much thinner consistency than I expected & not sticky which I love. I use it as the last step in my nighttime routine & in the morning my skin looks & feels incredible! 10/10 recommend! nan
