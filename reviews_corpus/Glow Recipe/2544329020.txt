I love an overnight product - especially one you wake up and notice a difference. My skin looked nice and even and smooth the next day and it only got better after continued use! My only “issue” is I have very dry skin and this is supposed to be used in place of a moisturizer before bed so it took me some time to adjust to the texture as I’m used to the feeling of a thick, hydrating moisturizer but it’s not sticky and after a little bit I didn’t even notice! nan
