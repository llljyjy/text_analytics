The product made my skin more red than when I was using blueberry bounce, so I will likely stick with that one. It did smell great and lather well and was enjoyable and easy to apply. Removed makeup well too. It also hydrated my skin without flakiness. Not sure why I was slightly more red after use. Decent product, but doesnâ€™t beat blueberry bounce for me! nan
