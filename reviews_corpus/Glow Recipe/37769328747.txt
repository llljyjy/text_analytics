I really wanted to love this cleanser and for the first few days, I did. It is creamy and lathers on the skin nicely. However, as someone who is not acne prone, this cleanser caused me to break out. I continued to use the product hoping it was just my skin purging. But after two weeks of use my skin was worse off that it was prior to use. I think someone with very dry skin may really love this product. It feels nice and is unscented. It simply isnâ€™t the best fit for me. Not the right cleanser for me
