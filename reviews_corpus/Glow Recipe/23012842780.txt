Incredibly soothing, it seems like the perfect cleanser to use when you just want something reliable and calming for your skin. I see myself using this especially in the summer when my skin is at its most troublesome but it has also been very nice during this cold snap over the past few weeks. I highly recommend! Very gentle, feels good
