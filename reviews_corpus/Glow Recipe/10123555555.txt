Glowy, tightened, smooth skin overnight? Yes, please! This stuff smells amazing but no surprise because I haven’t tried a glow recipe product that doesn’t. This stuff is amazing. It goes on the skin and is very soothing. I love that it doesn’t have to be rinsed off and works while you sleep. It doesn’t take long to absorb either. I feel like I saw a small improvement to my skin with just one week of use doing twice a day. I really look forward to the results with continued use. Soft smooth skin.
