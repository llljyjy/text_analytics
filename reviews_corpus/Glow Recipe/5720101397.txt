I was so excited to try this out. As a forewarning it does have fragrance and does smell like watermelon. But to me I absolutely love it and I donâ€™t think the smell is too over bearing. However onto the product, it made me feel hydrated in the morning while also making my skin look more glowing and diminishing the look of my pores. My skin also felt very good and smooth. I am thoroughly impressed with the new formulation nan
