I had purchased the original watermelon glow mask multiple times over the years and loved it, so I was shocked when it was discontinued and replaced. How could it be improved? It was already perfect. This new release had a lot to live up to for me. Honestly, it seems very much the same. The packaging, formula, consistency, application, and results are almost identical, in my personal experience and opinion. Except this new version is completely unscented, which is actually disappointing to me, because I absolutely adored the refreshing watermelon fragrance. If you want a lovely experience with a cool, gel / jelly like overnight sleeping mask that has zero irritation and leaves you with super soft, smooth, glowy skin in the morning, you need to buy this and I think you will love it. Even without the scent. Almost the Same as the OG
