I received this overnight resurfacing treatment as a complimentary gift from glow recipe. I’ve been using this treatment for a week and the first night the treatment left a fresh, cleaned and soft feeling on my face, when I woke up the next morning, I noticed that my skin still had that clean and soft feeling! (  Also my face looks brighter and feels like I’m adding moisturizer every hour during my whole day! Of course I washed my face in the morning but after that I still had that feeling on my skin during the whole day. Glow recipe never disappoints me! Wonderful overnight treatment!
