I don’t know if maybe I just got an odd bottle, but I’m experiencing a little pilling with this which I’ve never experienced with other sunscreens I’ve purchased on sephora. With that being said, this sunscreen is great, it’s very lightweight and glowy! It has a very faint watermelon scent, very inoffensive. Doesn’t feel sticky or greasy on my skin! Glow Recipe has done it again. finishes beautiful and glowy
