This product is adorable, as always from Glow recipe. It smells good and has a wonderful texture. It dries down nicely and quickly, leaving an immediate hydrating feeling. After I woke up my skin felt hydrated and brighter, it also calmed my sensitive skin as I noticed less redness in the AM. It also layered well with my other PM skincare products, I did add it last in my routine. Be careful when opening the product! I almost spilled mine everywhere! Wonderful Product!
