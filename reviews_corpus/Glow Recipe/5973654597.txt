Really beautiful product and lives up to my love for the past formula. It doesnâ€™t smell as watermelon-y as the old version, so if you prefer lighter scents this would be ur jam. Leaves the skin super glowy and hydrated in the morning. Love that this is an even gentler version of a beloved product of mine, overall 10/10 Awesome new lighter formula
