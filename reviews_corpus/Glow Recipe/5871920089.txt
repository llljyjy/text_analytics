Oooo… I like this! It’s gentle, yet effective, with a light pleasant scent. Kind of like bubble gum, which smells MUCH better than most exfoliants I’ve tried. lol And I always appreciate a cute little glass bottle! The pump works great & we love that! Haha The texture is a lovely thick gel & feels really nice going onto the skin. So far this is another Glow Recipe win for me & they’re quickly becoming one of my favorite skincare brands :) I love everything about it!
