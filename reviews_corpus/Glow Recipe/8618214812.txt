I bought this product as soon as it came out.Best for normal to oily skinThe finish is a soft dewy glow with a very slight white cast on darker skintones (acceptable whitecast imo) its gorgeousThe wear is nice and it feels cooling on the skin, but can dry out the skin bc it has high % of zinc oxide, my skin is always dry after wearing this all day.Application is annoying and sticky. The product seems like its balling up or pilling into little clumps no matter what product is used underneath it (it’s not pilling but it seems like it). You have to really work it in to get that nice finish.Scent is classic glow recipe watermelon+ classic sunscreen. Not my fave but idc either.Overall, I think it’s worth it for oily skin people who like a dewy finish it’s a really gorgeous finish but it dries me out too much The finish is PHENOMENAL but...
