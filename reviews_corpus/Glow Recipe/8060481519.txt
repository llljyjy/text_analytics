If you’re following my skincare journey, you’ll know that Salicylic Acid is my FAVORITE skincare ingredient because it works!Glow Recipes Salicylic Acid Serum is uniquely effective due to the addition of an AHA blend known as Clarity Acid Complex that visibly diminishes blemish-causing pore buildup, gently exfoliates dead skin cells and smooths the look of bumps and fine lines. Strawberries impart vitamin C, reduce excess oil, exfoliate, and tones skin. Hyaluronic Acid hydrates keeping skin visibly plump and young-looking.I used the serum for a couple of weeks in my day and night skincare routine—the silky, lightweight, fragrant serum pairs well with my moisturizer and sunscreen with no irritation. The serum is quickly absorbed with no tacky residue, leaving my skin feeling supple, smooth, bright, and moisturized with no heavy or oily feeling, unlike typical acid solutions that feel stripped, tight, dry, and rough. I will continue to use this skin-loving, clear skin solution. Thanks, @glowrecipe Time To Glow Up!
