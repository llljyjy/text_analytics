This is such a nice eye cream with lightweight texture and fragrance free. It has the cutest packaging, absorbs fast but very hydrating. After few weeks of use I noticed that my under eye area looks brighter. It works really great under makeup or any other skincare products you might want to use on top. very hydrating
