I switched over to this product when I began using retinol in my whole routine, to start off this eye cream is rich and hydrating for the under eye, without making  it feeling greasy. Leaves you with a bright and hydrated under eye. My advice is with this product is I would not recommend those with sensitive under eyes to use this product daily at first. My first few nights it left my under eyes a bit tingly very well made product
