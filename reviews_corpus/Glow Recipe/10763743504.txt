Wow what a mask this is definitely different from the og watermelon mask I used from GR. I feel this mask definitely does more and even gives more hydration. When I usually wake up in the mornings my skin can be very dry and dehydrated now due to the extreme heat. Ever since I have started to use this my skins moisture is returning and overall just looking better. The texture of this reminds me of the og but just a bit more jelly like. I guess the other was more lightweight this one to me is more thicker and enjoyable. Still soaks into the skin and still smells divine I really love using it. Yes to better skin
