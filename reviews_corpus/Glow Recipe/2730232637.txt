This sunscreen has a lot of positives.  I am a brown skin girl and finding a sunscreen with no white cast is a challenge. This sunscreen has NO WHITE CAST!! I absolutely love that. I enjoy the beautiful glow it provides and the lovely scent. I also think the amount of product is great and the packaging is cute. Oh and skin doesn’t look or feel super oily. However, the pilling is horrible! It might be one of the worst I have ever tried when it comes to pilling. Because of it’s fast drying, you can’t continue to rub as it will pill super easily and you won’t be able to apply the 3 finger rule at the same time. It’s helpful is you apply one finger at the time and pat the product quickly. Wait a bit and apply the next coat. Wait again and pat more. I hope this tip helps. DONT RUB. PAT IN.
