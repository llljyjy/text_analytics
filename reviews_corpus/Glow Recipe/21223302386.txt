I’ve been using this consistently since October (5 months of use), and haven’t noticed any significant changes in dark spots. I have post inflammatory hyperpigmentation from previous acne and was hoping this would help. I found the versed vitamin c serum, a far less expensive option, to be far superior and show near immediate results. This added hydration and glow to the skin but honestly any other hydrating serum could do that if not an even better job. I didn’t find it irritating tho and I have sensitive skin so that was good as a lot of vitamin c can be quite irritating. Overall, would not repurchase. I enjoy many other glow recipe products this one was just not for me. nan
