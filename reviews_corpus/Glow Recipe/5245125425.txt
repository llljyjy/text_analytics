This is such an upgrade from the original watermelon mask. It keeps that same great watermelon scent, but with a much better formula in my opinion. This exfoliating mask is gentle on my skin and applies without pilling over my moisturizer. The next morning my skin looks brighter and Iâ€™m excited to see long term results! Major Upgrade
