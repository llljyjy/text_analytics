This is my first time trying out this product and I am shooketh!!! it is awesome. At first I was scared because of the consistency it has. It feels sort of like egg yolk at first and I was scared it was going to be leaving my face feeling sticky. It was not sticky at all on my face and immediately you feel your skin so soft and refreshed. My skin feels amazing in the morning You cannot go wrong with this product. It does not smell like watermelon lol which I thought it was hahaha. Also, mine didnâ€™t come with a little spoon. Super great product
