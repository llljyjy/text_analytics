I originally bought this moisturizer because I had seen it on Instagram and I thought the packaging was absolutely adorable. I have pretty balanced skin, but I typically opt for heavier creams because I like the moisture given from them and how they layer with serums.When I first tried the plum plump moisturizer, my skin felt so wet and oily the morning after my PM application. I was so disappointed that it seemed too heavy, especially for a gel cream.However, after sticking with it for a good month, I’ve grown to love it! My skin adjusted in about a week and it genuinely makes me feel so confident in my natural skin. Being a gel cream, I’m pretty sure it would work amazing for all skin types.I love patting my cheeks after applying, and for hours after, because my skin is soo happy with me for using this. I will definitely be repurchasing. I just recommend giving it time for your skin to adjust, because it is a heavy hydration formulated gel cream which seems rare. Plus, a little truly goes a LONG way!! Long Story... but ended up loving!
