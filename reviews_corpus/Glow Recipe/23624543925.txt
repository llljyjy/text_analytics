This product goes on good. If you have oily or combination skin I’m thoughts are you will not like this! Unless you actually wait the entire 20mins for it to set. I have dry skin and this was what it says GLOWING. I expected it to be that but dang, not that much. It typically dries down but the first few mins after application are shiny shiny shiny!! It has a fant smell right at first of maybe watermelon really just something sweet but as soon as you rub your hands together it rub it in your face it goes away. I also noticed peeling with this. I tried a different skincare routine and it didn’t do it as bad but still peeled and my neck a little. It truly differs from person to person like every other skincare product. But I hate I spent this much money on it and I will not be putting this back on my face. I will use it up on my body like legs and arms. I haven’t tried any other products from this brand but this will not stop me from trying it. I think I just go excited and had high hopes. After the dry down and if it doesn’t peel it could be a good sunscreen under makeup maybe for an extra glow. Dry skin only
