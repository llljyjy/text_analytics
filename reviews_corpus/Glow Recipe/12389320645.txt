Love this sunscreen. It has not made me breakout, does not feel greasy or oily. Really comfortable wear! It did pill the first time I used it but I did use a mattifying moisturizer before so I would recommend you use a normal one. It did not pill again. Make sure your skin is moisturized! PERFECT FOR ACNE PRONE SKIN
