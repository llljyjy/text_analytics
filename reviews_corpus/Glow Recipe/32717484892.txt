Plump Plump hyaluronic cream is my very first Glow Recipe skincare product. I received it in my Trendmood volume 14 box. This cream is wonderful , I wished I would of tried Glow Recipe’s skincare line a lot sooner. This plump plump cream has the consistency and texture of a water cream , simular to Beliefs aqua bomb cream. It has a light weight formula that absorbs beautifully into the skin. Doesnt feel heavy or oily and it doesn’t clog pores or cause break outs. I have oily break out prone skin so that’s a big plus in my book. This hyaluronic cream is very hydrating and moisturizing , it has given my skin it’s plump back. My skin feels really soft and silky , I can’t keep my hands off it!  Can’t wait to try Glow Recipe’s other skincare products ❤❤❤ Plumping madness
