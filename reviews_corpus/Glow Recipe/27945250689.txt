This sunscreen worked really well for my oily/extremely sensitive acne prone skin. I’m am shocked I haven’t broken out. It keeps my skin hydrated and the “oily”( it’s not that oily) feel goes away after it drys down. I genuinely have not experienced pilling and I use a lot (2 fingers methods with no products underneath)   It’s a really good sunscreen + no cast(I am white but warm tone) + calming feel going on No cast and my acne prone skin loves it
