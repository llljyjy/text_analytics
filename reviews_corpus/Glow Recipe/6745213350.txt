I usually love Glow Recipe products and have several on my shelf, but this is not it for me. Pills terribly and is way less blendable and more streaky than many other hybrid sunscreens I’ve used. It also has some sort of menthol ingredient that gives that cooling sensation which I absolutely despise on my face.  It had a nice light watermelon scent, which is about the onlyRedeeming quality for me. It’s A No From Me
