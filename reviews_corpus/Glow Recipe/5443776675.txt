I was partial to the Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce face wash but after trying the Avocado ceramide moisture barrier cleanser I love it, especially when my face feels drier than usual. It’s creamy light weight cream rehydrated my skin without leaving it feeling oily in my t-zone. My skin texture also feels smoother. The smell doesn’t exude avocados to me but the benefits are definitely worth it! A face wash must have!
