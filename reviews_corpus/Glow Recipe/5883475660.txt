This is an amazingly hydrating toner that also feels very light and gentle on the skin. I love that it absorbs well into my skin and also has helped to smooth its appearance. You don’t have to use too much, a little goes a long way. My skin honestly felt softer and looked more luminous after using this. I didn’t notice a major difference in my pores but they did seem a little less pronounced. The bottle design is also beautiful and this smells good as well! nan
