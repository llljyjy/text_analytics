Got this sunscreen because I enjoyed using the glow drops serum, but I would have to apply them with an spf everyday which interfered with it’s scent and the silkiness. Unfortunately, this product does not have the same smoothing/illuminating effects. The solution tends to leave me feeling dull and uneven in texture, it is pretty grainy if the bottle is not thoroughly shaken. This gets 3 stars because it works for sun protection and still improved skins appearance, it just didn’t work as well at hydrating and softening. Unsure
