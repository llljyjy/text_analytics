I’ve tried a lot of vitamin C serums, and this one is by far my favorite! I’ve found in the past that with my sensitive skin many vitamin C serums have caused breakouts. This one is not oily in texture and has only improved the look and texture of my skin. I have a few dark spots on my face from acne over the years, and this serum has helped reduce the appearance of them. It also adds a nice glow to your skin as well! I highly recommend!
