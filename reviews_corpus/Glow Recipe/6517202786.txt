This mask is a lightweight, gel texture that glides on the skin and dries down nearly invisible. My skin felt smooth and soft. I woke up to treated breakouts and smoothed texture. It’s gentle as far as AHA treatments go, particularly overnight treatments and was hydrating for my combo skin. However I don’t think it would be the best option for super dry skin! Overall I enjoyed this mask and will use again! Lovely mask!
