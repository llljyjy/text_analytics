I love glow recipe products but this one is just okay. I have the original with the watermelon scent but this one does not have the scent. The texture is liquidy, careful when open because I spilled a quarter of the jar all over my vanity. I like the ingredients so I’ll keep using it. When I wake up in the morning my skin feels soft which is good. This won’t work for me for winter because I have dry skin. It’s okay
