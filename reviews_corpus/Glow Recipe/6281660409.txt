This is the first glow recipe product I’ve tried and I really like it! I was a little worried about the scent because I tend to get only products without fragrance, but the scent is not overpowering and doesn’t irritate my skin. This is super easy to use and layer on top of other serums and under your moisturizer. A little bit goes a long way, and it sinks into the skin so well. When I wake up in the morning, my skin looks clearer, brighter and softer, and any breakouts are diminished. l would definitely recommend this product, and will continue to use it 1-2x a week. nan
