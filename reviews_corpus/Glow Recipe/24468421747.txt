This product is perfect for the cold winter months. My skin gets dry with the cold and windy weather. It goes on smoothly and does not leave a greasy residue. I wear it under my makeup and it does not disturb my foundation or other makeup products. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft. Love!
