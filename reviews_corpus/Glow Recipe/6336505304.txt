This cleanser left my skin feeling unbelievably tight and dry. I don’t have super dry skin either, my skin is combination and every time I used this product it would bring out rough patches on my cheeks that I didn’t even know were there; keep in mind this is in a very dry winter climate. There’s really nothing special about this cleanser in my opinion and for the price you could definitely get something way better. Would not recommend. Made my skin so. dry.
