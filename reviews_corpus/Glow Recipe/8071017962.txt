I was so excited for this! I love a good sunscreen, &  a watermelon scented one sounded heavenly. Upon receiving my package, the bottle is so tiny! Super small for the price you are paying, that right there isnâ€™t worth it. Then I tried it out for the week & noticed it was piling really bad! Constantly trying to pick it off of my face throughout the day. I love glow recipe, but this product was a total flop. Super disappointed in this
