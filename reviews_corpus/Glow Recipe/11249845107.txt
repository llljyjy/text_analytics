I am always on the hunt for good skincare products with Salicylic Acid in them. Having acne prone skin, I always notice that Salicylic helps to control my breakouts. This product was the perfect mix of having a great acne-fighting ingredient without drying my face out too much! I just wish there wasnâ€™t fragrance on the ingredient list. Helps to fight acne!!
