I’ve been using it for a few weeks and it’s definitely one of my favorite sunscreens I’ve tried. It is gentle, Blends in easily, leaves my skin very dewy without greasiness or stickiness. It works perfectly under makeup and it really hydrates my dry skin. I love that the scent isn’t very strong. It's perfect and dewy!
