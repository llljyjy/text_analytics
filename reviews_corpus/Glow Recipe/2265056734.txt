I have oily skin so I was a little hesitant to try out this product because I thought I would end up looking like a grease ball but I really love Niacinamide so that is was suckered me in. This product definitely gives me a glow but when I apply foundation on top, it does tone it down quite a bit but still gives me a slight healthy glowly look. It doesnâ€™t make me look to oily. It can leave a white cast if you apply too much but it blends in easy. It does not have the smell of sunscreen at all, just a faint watermelon scent. It is not too overbearing. Overall, I like this product. I love that it has the mixture of Niacinamide and Sunscreen, two products that I love. Love the mix of Niacinamide and SPF
