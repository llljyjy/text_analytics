Avoid if you have sensitive skin. I used this four times and I now have a rash on both of my eyes that hasnâ€™t gone away! I wish I had never purchased this. I returned as soon as I could and now I am hoping my eyes recover soon. I might even have to go to the doctor now to get this healed up. Please avoid! Do not use if you have Sensitive Skin
