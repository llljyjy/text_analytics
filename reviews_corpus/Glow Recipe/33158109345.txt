i tried this for two months and i had no improvements. it is advertising as a dark spot serum but i would recommend this for people who have light blemishes. my dark spots and acne scars did NOT fade. could be my personal experience but i wanted to give this a fair shot. i saw improvements with other products. (in the photo im dealing with a breakout but this was after a bit of using it and my skin was the same) not worth it
