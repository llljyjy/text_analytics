I have very dry sensitive skin, I’ve always used the Laneige moisture cream and it’s done wonders!!! I used up a bottle of the plum pump serum so I thought I’d give this a go and I was so disappointed! My skin went downhill fast, dry patches around my mouth and nose. This product was incredibly drying for my skin… this would probably be good for normal and oily skin but not for dry or sensitive. However! Do give the serum a chance! nan
