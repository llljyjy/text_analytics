I had really high hopes for this sunscreen but it’s not for me. I have oily skin and it just makes my skin feel heavy. It stings and it transfers to my eyes. I wear contacts so for most of the day I’ll have a film over my contacts or if I’m not wearing contacts then my eyes will sting all day long. Also it burns for a good 15 minutes after putting it on. I won’t be repurchasing this. Not for oily skin and stings my eyes.
