I love this serum so much! I had some dark spots and blemishes due to some breakouts so I tried out this serum and I’ll def be getting more. It has reduced the marks and brightened my skin tone. I have noticed that my skin looks healthier and less congested. The serum is very hydrating and it’s perfect to apply right after a toner in the evening. I highly recommend it: Works great on acne prone skin!
