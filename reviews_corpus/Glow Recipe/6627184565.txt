I am loving this sunscreen! It is light and not very oily/greasy. It is blendable and doesnâ€™t flake off when I put my make up over it. The packaging is cute too which is always a plus. For reference I have combination skin with semi sensitive skin. PS I LOVE THAT IT HAS Niacinamide in it!!! Overall great product!
