Y’all I’m not going to lie: I adore Glow Recipe, but the old version of this did need an upgrade. And I’m happy to say: they delivered with this product!The consistency is shockingly similar to the former generation. It’s still lightweight and having a feel most similar to a Korean Sleeping Mask. However, it applies a bit more smoothly and is not as prone to pilling as before. Definitely a texture upgrade!I was SO surprised that this stings less than the old version!! Initially, I found myself questioning whether this meant a downgrade in terms of efficacy; however, according to Glow Recipe’s instagram, it’s actually more powerful? They claim this new version has 2.5% pH-balanced AHA, which is supposedly as strong as 10% glycolic acid (whaaaat)I doubted this - because I’m a skeptic at heart - but lo and behold, I found myself purging within days. Heads up that this formula increases turnover, so know that could happen (the ol’ “skin getting worse before it gets better”). Frankly, while this may seem frustrating, it really is a sign of a strong formula. Within a few more days, my skin cleared and is looking clear and bright - all without the product stinging!!I’m not sure how GR did it, but wow - I’m pleasantly surprised! nan
