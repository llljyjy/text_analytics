If you have sensitive skin, I would probably avoid it. I used this moisturizer on three different occasions, and each time it broke me out into the worst rash that wouldnâ€™t go away for a few days, and sometimes weeks. It works differently for other people - some people I know used it and it was fine, but for someone with super sensitive skin, I would be wary. nan
