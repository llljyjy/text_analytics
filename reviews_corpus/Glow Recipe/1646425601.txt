I have been a big fan of Glow Recipe products for awhile, and this new launch is no exception. This serum has a subtle strawberry scent and a thin consistency. It absorbs quickly and layers well with my other skincare products. After using this serum for the past few weeks, I have noticed that my skin is looking extra clear and even. My skin is dry and somewhat sensitive, but this didnâ€™t irritate it at all. Another fabulous Glow Recipe product that I would definitely recommend! Strawberry Serum
