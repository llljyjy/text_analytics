i wanted to like it, but it’s… just fine. i think if you use just a little bit (ie < two fingers!!), it settles in nicely, and it definitely doesn’t leave a white cast. however, it’s important to use the right amount; when i do, it pills like CRAZY. also has a weird cooking effect on the skin, and i’m personally not a fan of the watermelon scent here. it’s definitely hydrating and i do see a bit of a blurring effect, and it’s not greasy which is really nice — when it’s not pilling up, the skin feel isn’t bad. i think it’s okay, and i’ll be finishing the product, but i will not be repurchasing. eh…
