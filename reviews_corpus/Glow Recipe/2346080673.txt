I was excited for this but I didn’t love the smell or consistency (I guess I was expecting more of a gel — it’s def a cream) — and then I broke out in a rash all over my face after one use so back it goes. A lot of people seem to love and I do like this brand but this was not for me. Be cautious with sensitive skin. nan
