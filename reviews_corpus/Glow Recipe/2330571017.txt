I was gifted this product by glow recipe. I normally don’t wear sunscreen on my face but I loved this! It was easy to blend, left my skin glowing in such a healthy way and I didn’t leave a white cast on my face! The watermelon scent was nice but you could still smell the sunscreen! Overall I highly suggest this product! New summer favorite
