If you’ve tried the original watermelon mask - the texture is basically the same. However, I’d you are expecting it to smell like the original - it doesn’t. I smelled next to no watermelon. I didn’t notice any brightening but my skin was hydrated as it usually is after a leave on mask or moisturizer. This layers ok with my eye creams, serums, and mists but I usually just apply it instead of my moisturizer. This overnight treatment is different because I’ve only ever done hydrating mask and this one has actives. Overall it’s ok but I will probably not be purchasing this myself as I prefer sticking to the strawberry serum and a moisturizer. nan
