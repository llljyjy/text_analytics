I have dry combo skin. I struggle keeping up with my skincare the past two years due to depression. /:  I just have no energy to do a routine. So I never fully see results from all the products I buy as I will abruptly stop when depressed. This however, is probably the first product I’ve ever used and noticed a drastic difference. My skin was glowing, my pores were smaller, my skin looked like glass. It made me want to keep up with skincare! And it did! It’s a little sticky, but I never cared about that as it’s really not a big deal. It’s a workable product. I finished this until it was completely empty. Need to buy my second bottle. No scent at all, feels luxurious while still feeling that it’s a clean product. 10/10. Don't Read Reviews, Just Get It.. Seriously!
