It’s a thick serum with a lovely fruity smell. I use this during the day and the avocado retinol at night...they work wonder together! It has absolutely helped to hydrate under my eyes I look so much more...alive! Love this. Ladies & gentlemen: For all complaints about dark circles, as an aesthetician, I can tell you that NO MARKETED PRODUCT will correct dark circles--don’t put the blame on Glow Recipe. The only solution for dark, deeo circles, is fillers. But if you do not have massive dark circles, I still recommend this  as a day eye cream paired with Glow’s Avocado night retinol eye mask. You cannot make a proper review after “two days.“ A proper review takes months.  I’ve been using this for two months, and of the day eye creams I’ve had, Only eye cream I prefer La Mer, but it isn’t that much more impressive. This is affordable and WORKS. Again, deep dark circles cannot be corrected by ANY eye cream. They are shadows due to crevices in the eye are. This product deserves a 5 star revew! Perfect day cream
