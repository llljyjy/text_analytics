My skin feels slightly encumbered with this on. After applying it I look a bit like the Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz! I really wanted to like this product but it pills so there’s no pretty glow that some sunscreens can give. The product coming out of the tube is nice and smells like juicy watermelon on a sunny day but it does not blend well. I tried this with my normal essence underneath and it pilled. I tried it with absolutely nothing on my fully dried face... and it pilled. Sunscreen is essential but I’m not sure this is the best one for anyone who: is in a rush or is low maintenance, wears makeup over sunscreen, or has olive or brown skin. nan
