I was lucky enough to test this serum for a month and I love this serum!  My skin is now very soft and has a brighter completion.  was able to see results fairly quickly. I have an oily T-zone and dry everywhere else.  My drier areas tend to have uneven texture.  This serum smoothed those dry patches within a day or two.  I have noticed 2 blemishes healing faster as well. This serum has a very light candy strawberry scent that fades quickly.  It also absorbs quickly into the skin. I would definitely buy again. Love love love!
