The texture of this is perfect, and goes on so easily! Also great that you donâ€™t have to use a lot of it to get full coverage so the bottle will last a while. Did not have issues when sweating that it ran into my eyes which is a definite plus! Smells like classic sunscreen, was hoping for a more watermelon scent but I still love it! Perfect addition!
