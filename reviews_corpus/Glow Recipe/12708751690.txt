I like this a lot however the only way I can use it is bare face with no other products. If I use with ANYTHING else it pills up very badly. When used alone it’s the PERFECT face sunscreen. Light scent that doesn’t linger, rubs in beautiful without leaving any white cast and most importantly protects amazingly from sun (and artificial sun). I use tanning bed regularly but never ever tan my face and always slather it in sunscreen and this is the first facial sunscreen that I have used that has completely protected my face in the tanning bed… not even a little redness when I get out. Love it but…
