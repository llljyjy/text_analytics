I’ve been using this cleanser for almost a month and I love it! It is creamy, smooth, and gets most of my makeup off after the first wash, even waterproof mascara! I always double cleanse because I use a primer and setting spray, so getting my makeup off can be a challenge. I have tried a gazillion cleansers and never had results like this before. My skin feels clean, smooth and refreshed afterwards. Take the plunge! It’s worth it.
