Glow Recipe’s Watermelon Glow is probably the prettiest sunscreen I own! I like that the sunscreen is like a light weight cream. It has a faint scent of water melon and blends clear. I really like that there is niacinamide in it which is wonderful for brighter, glowing skin! It’s comfortable and wears well. On it’s own, the sunscreen sinks beautifully into the skin and doesn’t feel greasy or tacky. However, it can feel tacky or pill depending on the other products in your routine.  For example, it doesn’t seem to work too well with facial oils or certain hydro based serums. I also prefer using it with a simpler, pared down skincare routine as it’s quite a moisturizing sunscreen. Decent but can feel tacky based on your routine!
