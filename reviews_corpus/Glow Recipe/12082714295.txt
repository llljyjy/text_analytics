I love glow recipe products and this sunscreen is not an exception. I love that it’s light weight and easily blendable. I can wear it under makeup without any piling issues and it absorbs quickly without making my skin feel greasy or oily. I have been using niacinamide and hyaluronic acid for a long time now and the fact that this sunscreen has both these ingredients is a plus for me. It’s gives me a subtle glow without any break outs. Definitely worth a try. Amazing new sunscreen - worth a try !
