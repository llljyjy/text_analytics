I was gifted Guava Vitamin C Bright-Eye Gel Cream, and I’m so impressed! I’ve been using it about two weeks and I feel like my eyes are more hydrated, less puffy and my under eye circles look less defined. I have dry skin and dark circles typically, so this hydrating gel cream is right up my alley. I can’t wait to see the long term effects! Hydration!
