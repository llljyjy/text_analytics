As a flight attendant i am required to wear cosmetics for work. I use long wear products that soap or cream cleanser doesn’t completely remove. I can see it on my cleansing brush. Since I am a big fan of apricot oil decided to try this. Removes everything in one step and no more flaky, dry patches. I usually massage it in the leave for a couple of minutes to soften and allow the enzymes to work then massage again and rinse. Not a trace of mascara or long wear foundation. Best part is it’s cruelty-free! Removes everything in one step!
