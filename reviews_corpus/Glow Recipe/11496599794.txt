This is a nice, light moisturizer for summer. My skin feels nice with it. I am using it along with The Ordinary buffet w/ copper peptides. I give it 3 stars because it doesn’t feel luxury for the price. It’s just so watery and the “experience” of it doesn’t do much for me. I won’t repurchase. But it is a nice product. Just too expensive for what it is. (I have normal skin in summer/ dry in winter. I could never use this in winter as it is so light.) overpriced but nice for summer
