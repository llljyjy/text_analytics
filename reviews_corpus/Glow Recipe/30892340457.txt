this moisturizer has been AMAZING for my skin. it’s perfect for my in-between, combo skin that isn’t dry enough for a super intense hydrating cream, but also isn’t oily enough for a gel moisturizer. my skin texture is incredible and has never been so smooth. definitely will be repurchasing, and i love that it’s refillable! 10/10 dare i say it’s my holy grail?!
