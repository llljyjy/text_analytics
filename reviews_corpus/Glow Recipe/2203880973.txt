Can you believe this is my first ever product from them? I never got to try the original but I love anything watermelon scented even though the faint scent disappears right after you apply it. This is a runny gel texture, not sticky and gives a little hydration to the skin, but it’s so gentle that it doesn’t seem to do that much- the texture that I had was only faintly smoothed out by morning. Still testing to see how it goes but I’m unsure about the results so far. I feel like if I used it several times a week I would have less texture, but I’ll have to see. For sensitive skin, this would be perfect for you or for anyone who wants to use a gentle product on a daily basis to keep pores clear. Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow AHA Night Treatment
