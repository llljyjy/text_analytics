With 2% encapsulated salicylic acid to greatly recuse irritation, mandelic acid, strawberry extracts, azelaic acid, succinic acid, hyaluronic, and more. This serum has a lot of powerful exfoliating ingredients and none of the irritation. I took a long break from all actives in preparation of trying this serum.My skin did not react negative whatsoever at any point using this. It is EXTREMELY gentle, it is mildly hydrating, and smells so SO yummy. Thicker milky/gel consistency, soaks in with no tackiness or greasiness. In just a few days there were very noticeable improvements in my hormonal acne. White heads dried out, deep nodular pimples shrunk and flattened. Unfortunately not much effect on my super stubborn blackheads, but Iâ€™m going to give it more time. nan
