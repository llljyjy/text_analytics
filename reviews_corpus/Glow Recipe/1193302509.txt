Love the lightweight creamy texture. Pleasant light watermelon scent. Really applies nicely, blending easily and absorbing quick. Leaves a soft, smooth finish- not heavy or greasy. My skin feels hydrated, nourished, and silky with a nice glow. I didn’t experience any white cast or chalkiness on my fair skin. I found it to layer well over my skincare and reapplied nicely too. Didn’t irritate around my eye area. I like that it includes the added benefits of niacinamide. This might be my favorite product from the brand! Works great with dry skin!
