I was So excited to try this toner, as I had been on a search for a toner that doesn’t break me out.  The texture is slightly thicker than water, feels a little tacky going on, but smells amazing. It’s definitely strongly fragranced if you’re sensitive to that, but I love the watermelon and citrusy smell. I’m happy to report that it has not broken me out, and is the first that hasn’t. My skin feels smooth and more primed for makeup after using it. I definitely recommend it. Finally a toner that doesn’t break me out!
