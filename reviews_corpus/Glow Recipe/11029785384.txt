The glow recipe sunscreen is my new go to. It smells absolutely amazing and I LOVE that it is reef safe! This sunscreen is so lightweight and doesnâ€™t leave my skin feeling greasy. I can easily put make up over it without feeling like it changes my application.  Even when I wear it alone it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and gives it a beautiful healthy summery glow without the fear of clogged pores. Looking forward to wearing this one all summer long! The perfect daily sunscreen!
