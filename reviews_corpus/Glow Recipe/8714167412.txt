Product helps a lot with texture and exfoliation but isn’t for sensitive skin types! I was hesitant to try this toner because I have such sensitive skin and after just 2 uses I start breaking out in tiny pimples all over (not acne prone). This is a great treatment toner for someone with more resilient skin but wouldn’t recommend for everyday use. Not for sensitive skin types!!
