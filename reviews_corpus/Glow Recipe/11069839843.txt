It was meh for the cost. I ended up breaking out from it even though I normally do not break out. as for hydration it was less performance than the serums that costed 10s. But maybe my skin is just that hella dry. HOWEVER, the smell BUSSIN! still recommend it for the rich normal skinned homies out there who just want good time. 3rd star for the nose blessing
