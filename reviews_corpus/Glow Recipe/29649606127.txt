This strawberry serum is amazing as all of glow recipe products are wonderful.  The packaging is gorgeous and smells fabulous as well. The Strawberry enzymes reduce oil and help gently surface my skin it also works with the lytic acid to smooth like blemish or scarred skin. I am so happy this works on my skin is gentle as well I have sensitive skin you donâ€™t get a tight dry feeling with this Definitely worth the money
