This sunscreen applies so smoothly! It comes out white but as you blend, there is no white cast. The smell of this sunscreen smells like any other type of sunscreen but what I like about it is that the smell isnâ€™t as strong. Overall, this is a nice product and my skin feels softer after using it too! nan
