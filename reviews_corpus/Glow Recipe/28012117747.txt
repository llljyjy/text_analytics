I’ve always been skeptical of glow recipe because I thought for the longest time it was just another good marketing and cute packaging type of scheme. Decided to buy the trial size of this toner and wow I’m amazed. Then bought the niacinamide dew drops and it blew my mind even more. I have oily skin, big pores, sometimes acne prone, and these have done wonders for my skin. Can’t wait to finish my trial size to buy the full size! Only complaint is the smell of this one isn’t as pleasing as their other products, very lemony and sour. it actually works!
