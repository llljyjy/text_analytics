I love this stuff! The main way I use it is mixed with foundation. I have quite a few foundations that just didn’t work at all with my dry skin, no matter how I prepped my skin. But adding a few drops of this to them totally made them work for me. It adds just enough hydration to make the foundations wear really well on my skin. So yay for not having product go to waste because they were too drying. Works really well as a primer too because it does have a little tackiness to it. I won’t ever be without this product. nan
