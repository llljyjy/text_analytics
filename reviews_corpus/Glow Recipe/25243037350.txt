I love all glow recipe products so it was no shock to me when I became obsessed with this one! My skin was instantly brightened, and I noticed my dark spots lightening up after only a few uses. Like all GR products, the packaging is adorable, it smells so good, but has potential to be overpowering for some. I would say the price point is reasonable; all vit c serums tend to be on the pricier side. This one really works! Goodbye dark spots and dull skin!
