I got this as a free sample and it felt like a DREAM to put on. My dry winter skin felt incredibly hydrated and plump. I was ready to make the splurge on the full size but unfortunately this caused me to break out; I still don’t know that I’d rule it out for the future as it was one of the most effective hydrating creams I’d used on my winter skin. nan
