had to return this one. it gave me pimples on my cheek, which I practically never got prior to using this. as soon as I stopped using it, they went away but they did leave scarring unfortunately. I gave it 2 stars, because it felt very nice and hydrating going onto the skin, it was very serum-like. but this did not minimize my pores, and it left me with scarring from the breakouts it gave. wanted to love, but my skin did not. cheek breakouts!
