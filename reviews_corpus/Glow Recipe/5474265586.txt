Obsessed! First off I did not have crazy purging like products normally do to my skin! I use it morning and night after toner. Feels and smells amazing! Absorbs right into the skin. I’ve noticed my skin texture being smoother, dark spots fading, and less breakouts. I’ve been receiving compliments on my skin too, and this is the only change to my skin care routine by. Absolutely my favorite product from glow recipe! Favorite Product!
