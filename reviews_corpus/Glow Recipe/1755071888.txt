Now I understand why the reviews are so split for this spf. If I put this on a completely bare face (no skincare beyond cleanser), it goes on beautifully, no white cast, and gives a glow without looking greasy at all. One might even say it is mattifying, but with a glow. But as soon as I try to put it on with any skincare underneath, it pills like crazy. The problem for me is that while I can go without serums and all that stuff, I at least need a moisturizer underneath since the zinc oxide in the spf dries out my skin. But even a very light moisturizer under this causes it to pill. I could see this working for a humid day spent outdoors in the middle of the summer, where I wouldn’t worry about other skincare and probably wouldn’t need the moisturizer either. But, I’m not going to spend the $$$ for that niche type of situation, I’d sooner just get a cheaper and more versatile waterproof spf. Rating this was hard, I landed on 3 but it could be 4 or even 5 stars if all you do is wash your face and apply sunscreen after with nothing else. It’s just won’t work for me for most days during the year and isn’t worth the price for the few times I could use it. It’s too bad though, as I said, when it does work, the finish is beautiful.
