I was given this product ahead of launch to try for 2 weeks. I immediately loved the smell and consistency. It did leave my skin feeling smoother, but after a few days of using it consecutively my skin started feeling drier than I like it to be. I will keep it as part of my serum rotation and use it once or twice a week; definitely wouldnâ€™t use it every day. Not for every day use
