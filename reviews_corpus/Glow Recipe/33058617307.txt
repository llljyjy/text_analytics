Let’s start by saying I’m nothing close to a beauty guru, nor am I especially attuned to my skin. That being said, I LOVE THIS STUFF! I’ve been using it for half a year now (I apply twice daily and I’ve only used about a third of it). I noticed positive changes in my skin about three weeks in. I’ve found the toner for me. :) Holy Grail of Toners
