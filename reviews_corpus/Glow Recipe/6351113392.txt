I love this night treatment for helping repair my skin while I sleep. I could tell that even with one use that my skin was softer, smoother and way more hydrated. My skin tone felt more evened out and my skin felt and looked a lot clearer. This is a great treatment that can be used once or twice a week to help refresh your skin! Overnight healing magic!
