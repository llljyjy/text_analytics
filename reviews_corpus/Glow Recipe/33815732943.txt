Out of all of cleansing balms I’ve tried this is definitely the best one out there. Everything about it is perfect. It melts anything on your face and is very gentle. It doesn’t smell overpowering it is very soft and subtle. Also they give you a good amount of product as well as the packaging is very good and is not cheaply made. Definitely worth the price. best cleaning balm ever
