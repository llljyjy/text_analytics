I’ve had severe acne breakout since 2020 Feb and this is the first product that has helped me with my acne scars! I also had a very dull complexion and dark circles because of school since forever. The dark circles are almost gone and it’s only been 10 days since I started using this. I was already using my cerave cleanser and Cosrx moisturizer before I included this one. My skin care is very minimal as my skin is super sensitive and I’m still on the hunt for the right products for it. This serum is very expensive and I’m a broke uni student, but I think I’ll buy this again because I’m so happy with the results. I finally started feeling a bit better about myself so I guess it’s worth it. Loved it!
