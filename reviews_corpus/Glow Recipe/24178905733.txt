I love the texture of this product! Not sticky but has a beautiful buttery slip that makes it glide on like silk. I feel like this instantly plumps my eye area especially my fine lines. It so far works perfectly with my makeup..it’s almost acts like a primer. It doesn’t pill or make other products pill either. think it helps my concealer crease less. I have a ton of eye products but I keep using this because of how smoothly it goes on. The only con for me was it took forever to get it to come out of the pump. The texture is wonderful
