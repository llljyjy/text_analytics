I received a free sample of this product to try for 14 days in exchange for my honest review. I am 24 with combination skin, prone to dry flaky skin on my forehead and nose. Overall, I liked this cleanser. I thought it was very gentle and soothing with a mild scent, but it was not effective in removing all of my makeup. For reference, I use Tarte SEA Power Flex concealer and Tarte Maneater mascara. I still had mascara on and around my eyes after using the cleanser. I would use this cleanser either as the second step of a double cleanse, on days that I don’t wear makeup, or in the mornings. It was soothing and did seem to help with my flakiness which had worsened with the winter weather. The texture was pleasing and almost mousse-like, but it didn’t lather as much as I would have liked. It left my skin feeling clean, but not stripped, and supple. I would recommend this cleanser, and will continue to use it (especially during cold months) but I don’t think it should be marketed as a makeup remover. nan
