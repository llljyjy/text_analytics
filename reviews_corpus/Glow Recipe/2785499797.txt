I have acne prone oily skin. Overall, I didn’t see any noticeable results, maybe because I am already using other actives in addition to this serum. The use experience is OK overall, no pilling, not overly sticky. I don’t find the scent particularly pleasant or unpleasant, it’s just kind of there. The best thing about this is that it is one of the few products from Glow Recipe that definitely doesn’t break me out. I have tried their Watermelon mask, Watermelon mist (unsure if they break me out, but also their Papaya cleansing balm and Guava Vitamin C serum (both contribute to noticeably more acne). So a plus for sensitive skin there. No significant effect, but also no adverse effects
