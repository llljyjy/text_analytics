Honestly I’m not really into sleeping masks, actives, or fruit-themed products, but I love this! It makes my skin look radiant and hydrated. As far as the actives go, it’s really gentle (I use 2 x’s a week). I love the texture, it’s not too thick or too thin and is slightly sticky at first until it dries down. It doesn’t smell like watermelon (plus for me). Overall I really enjoy this product. nan
