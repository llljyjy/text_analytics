Love love love this sunscreen. It feels amazing on my skin compared to most sunscreens. I’ve figured out a thin application blends better and then you can build more if needed. It hasn’t caused any breakouts yet and feels quite lightweight under my makeup. I love the ingredients and I’m hopeful it’ll help my skin glow with continued use. Love it so far, no breakouts
