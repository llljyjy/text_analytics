This treatment is the new version of the famous watermelon mask.   It has great ingredients for moisturizing, exfoliating and brightening.  Itâ€™s also vegan and does not have a strong scent. I like the texture because it is not too heavy. My skin feels more soft in the mornings after use.   It also brightens and my skin looked brighter after use. The newest Glow Recipe product!
