I really wanted to love this product and I got it as soon as it launched. I was excited, only to realize it pills (balls up on skin) like CRAZY. I tried it one too many times with different products and I still get the same results. I’m very disappointed because Glow Recipe has a good record in my books and I love all of the other products I’ve tried. If you’re looking for a great sunscreen, I would suggest the Peter Thomas Roth broad spectrum 45 spf it’s way more hydrating, has no white cast & doesn’t pill! Pills like crazy
