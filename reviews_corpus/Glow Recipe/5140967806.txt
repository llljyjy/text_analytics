My skin feels amazing after the first use! My skin is so soft in the mornings!! My skin feels so hydrated and looks so much brighter! My skin feels so refresh right after applying it. Before using the watermelon glow aha night treatment, my skin was so dull. Using other overnight treatments, my skin is super sensitive and have to discontinue using it, but not with this one! So excited to add it to my skincare routine, Iâ€™ll be using it every other night. It layers so smoothly with all my other skincare products!! Something that I love! My skin thanks Glow Recipe, my skin is 10 times smoother compared to before!!! You need it!!!
