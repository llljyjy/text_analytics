Just started using this cream a few days ago and so far so good! This is a lightweight eye cream, with more of a thin lotion like consistency- not thick or balmy. For that reason I like using it in the morning because it absorbs quickly, and i’m able to use concealer on top without any issues. This has a pump, and the pump actually gives you full control to squeeze out even just a tiny drop so you don’t waste any product. morning eye cream
