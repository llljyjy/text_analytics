I was gifted this product from Glow Recipe. First off love the smell it’s a light watermelon scent and you really don’t smell the usual sunscreen scent. I have combination skin and this works super well. It’s very light weight and blends right into your skin. My skin has been very dry and this helps it maintain that hydration I always want! love it
