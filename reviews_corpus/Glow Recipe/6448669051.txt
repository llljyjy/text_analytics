I Receive this item in my Trendmood Box and I was really excited to try it. However although it was very nice and texture and smell I didn’t really see what the big hype was about this. It’s a good moisturizer especially to use prior to prepping for make up, but I just didn’t see how this would be any better than a cheaper moisturizer. I will continue to use this to see if I see any difference in my skin complexion but as of now I don’t really think the price point is worth it. It’s a great product but I think you can get other great products for this price point or lower. nan
