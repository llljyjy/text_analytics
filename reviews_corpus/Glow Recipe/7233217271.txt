I’ve never wrote a review for anything before but I HAD to for this product. Because I’m OBSESSED. It smells like sunscreen & summer (although the fragrance doesn’t leave my skin irritated like most scented skin products). It has a lotion consistency. It leaves my skin looking dewy and glowy. I was afraid it might leave my skin looking/feeling oily but it doesn’t at all. I’ve seen a lot of comments about it peeling but I haven’t experienced that at all. I put this on last after my moisturizer, I also let all of my skin care products soak into my face for a few minutes each so maybe that helps? Idk, but I LOVE this product! I have combo/sensitive skin. godly spf lotion
