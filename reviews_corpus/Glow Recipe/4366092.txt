I am 54 and am very happy with this after 2 weeks. I use this at night. it takes very little product and is so deeply softening. dark circles are not my issue so canâ€™t speak to that but I have tiny smile wrinkles and this is the first (of many) I have been really happy with. it has not reduced my wrinkles per se but has plumped and softened the under eye skin enough to make a visible difference. Will keep using and think it is reasonably priced compared to other mature skin brands for results. absorbs well and very soothing
