I won’t be repurchasing. The packaging is much larger than the actual product. The actually pod with the moisturizer is about half the size of the container. Just too expensive for the amount you get in my opinion. There’s so many more moisturizers that you can get at a better price. Pictures next to the milk hydro grip for size reference. Cute packaging tho, I’d probably put other moisturizers in the container. nan
