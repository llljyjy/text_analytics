I love this product. It feel hydrating and refreshing. The entire Glow Recipe brand is something everyone should try! But this product in particular has a great effect and works well under all sorts of products and even make up. I have never had really open pores but as Iâ€™ve aged and throughout the day, you can definitely see them peeking through. But this has really helped keep my pores closed especially in the area next to my nose. nan
