I have used about half a bottle of this product and I don’t know that I’ve seen any real benefits from using it. I use it in the evening and at times I’ve noticed a stinging sensation. I have very sensitive skin and rosacea, but I can’t say this product has calmed any redness beyond what I normally do to take care of my skin. Probably won’t repurchase. nan
