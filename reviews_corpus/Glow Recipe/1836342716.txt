Nice super light moisturizer. I absolutely love this line, the sleep mask and niacinimide are absolute heroes. This moisturizer is super light and refreshing, great for oily skin. I do find myself reaching for additional moisturizer after applying this from time to time though, it doesn’t always feel quite nourishing enough. Probably not the best for dry skin types. I like to use this on days that I’m wearing dewier makeup because it is so lightweight and completely absorbs into the skin. nan
