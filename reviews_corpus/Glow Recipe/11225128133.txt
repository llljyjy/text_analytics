I was gifted this product and it’s the best! It smells great and reminds me of summertime! After using, my skin feels so smooth and elastic. It layers really well with my moisturizer and is a great addition to my skin care routine. I like that the application is a pump rather than a syringe because to me that’s more sanitary. It hasn’t made my skin red or irritated so it’s a good option for sensitive skin. Overall, I recommend!! Summertime Serum!
