It’s thicker than your typical toner and a little goes a long way! I put the product on my hands, warm it up a little with my hands, then pat it into my skin. The smell is exactly like a watermelon jolly rancher so if your skin is sensitive to products with fragrance in it or you just wouldn’t like that smell, this probably isn’t for you but I loved it. It’s not too strong but after application it lingers for a little bit and then goes away after awhile. It’s very hydrating, didn’t break me out, helped keep acne off my dry skin. Would recommend & will repurchase. nan
