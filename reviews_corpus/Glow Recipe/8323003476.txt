I was so excited to try this reformulated version of their night mask! The smell is amazing of course! The texture is lovely, and more watery than I was expecting but that doesn’t bother me. It’s easy to apply. It layered easily with my other products and seemed to absorb quickly. I will probably only use this once a week due to my sensitive skin. It’s potent so might also use the sandwich method with another moisturizer. I woke up with incredibly smooth skin, and it looked bright and bouncy. Love the added hydration factor with all of the Hyaluronic acid. Love the new version!
