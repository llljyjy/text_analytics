This is probably one of the best sunscreens I have used. It was sooo moisturizing and it smelled amazing! The best part of this sunscreen is that it does not leave a white cast on melanin skin. Another pro about this product is that it sits very well underneath my foundation without being too cakey or greasy like some other sunscreens. I would definitely recommend! Not greasy and doesnâ€™t leave a white cast
