I’m not gonna lie, my first impression of this new formula was not good. The consistency is watery and it doesn’t have that watermelon smell I love… so I wasn’t impressed…. Until the next morning… I notice a much brighter glowing skin the first thing in the mirror and I think to myself huh glow recipe does not disappoint… but I really wish they’d keep making the old formula as well but I bought two bottle, one for myself and one for my sister before it ran out…. Glow Recipe does not disappoint…
