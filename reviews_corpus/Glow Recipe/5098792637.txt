I am already a huge fan of glow recipe! I love that I’ve been able to use their products and never experience a bad reaction! Their watermelon line is my favorite, so I was excited to try this mask. I’ve been using it twice weekly for almost three weeks and my skin looks awesome! It absorbs quite nicely and leaves the skin silky and soft. I highly recommend! nan
