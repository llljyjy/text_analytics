Very disappointed in this sunscreen. I wanted to love it so bad. The texture is actually very nice and lightweight, not too greasy or heavy on the skin. I did like the watermelon scent as it’s not too strong. However it’s a pilling mess. The first time I tried it I saw instant pilling by rubbing it in. I thought maybe I needed to let me skincare soak in first before applying so I tried that and it still gave me the same pilling results. I tried a third time and the pilling became unbearable where it was pilling all over my face that I had to wash it off with water and reapply with another sunscreen. Unfortunately I had to return it as I didn’t want to risk not having enough sun protection due to the pilling. Very disappointing. Pills Instantly
