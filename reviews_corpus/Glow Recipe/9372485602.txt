Love love love! I have combo skin (sensitive around eyes but dry-normal) and I’ve tried so many drug store, high end, korean and whatnot moisturizer and this is the by far best I’ve tried. I’ve been dealing with dry skin for years and this is the only moisturizer that keeps my face moisturizer through the day and night, it’s so lightweight (gel like).  I can’t say much for my sensitive side but I love it for dry skin. Only down side is when I notice I “over apply” or use lots (which I’m use to) it pills around my face (not a lot, manageable) won’t regret it!
