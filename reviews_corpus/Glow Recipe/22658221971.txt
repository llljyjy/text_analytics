I received this complimentary of Glow Recipe in exchange for my honest thoughts. Glow Recipe is one of my favorite brands. I use a lot of their products! It was so exciting to see a new fruit added to their line up. I personally have no issues with active products so this was very gentle, no stinging or burning. It smells like strawberry candy and has a gel consistently that absorbs easily.  So far my skin feels a lot smoother and softer and Iâ€™m excited to see more results in the next few weeks! Another Winner From Glow Recipe!
