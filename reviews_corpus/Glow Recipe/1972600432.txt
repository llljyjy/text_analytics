Pros: Absorbs well, light scent, glow is a sheen.Cons: Pills, pills, and pills so more! I can’t wear this during the summer because it pulled on freshly washed skin, with and without moisturizer. Only time it didn’t pill was over oil, which makes it less wearable (for me) during the summer months and probably decreases the effectiveness of the chemical sunscreen. I also have brown skin and found that it had a mild white cast that improved with time. I’ve only seen a few reviews mention these issues. I’ve tried MANY different sunscreens and this one feels good on, looks OK on, has pretty packaging, but takes too much work to get right. Not sure how there are so many raving reviews. I returned it.
