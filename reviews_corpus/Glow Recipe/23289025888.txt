As a tired mom I am always looking for a good products that brightens my under eye area! Itâ€™s like my top concern! And after trying this eye gel I am very impressed! It has a light sweet scent that is very pleasant and not strong at all. And it is a pretty light pink color and smooth in texture! I use this after my serum but before my moisturizer. I immediately noticed how hydrating this gel was and then after a few uses I could notice my under eyes looking brighter too! Which makes me happy! It layers perfectly with my other skin care and my make up! I just enjoy using this and love how it makes my skin feel! Another good one from Glow Recipe! nan
