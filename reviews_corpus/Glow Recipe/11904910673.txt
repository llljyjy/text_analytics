I’ve been using this night treatment as a little pick me up when my skin is looking dull, and I like it! It has a fluid, gummy texture and a light watermelon candy scent. Lightweight and absorbs nicely. In terms of results, my skin feels hydrated and smoother in the morning, but I have yet to see any noticeable changes to skin tone. Haven’t experienced any sensitivity. I feel like this would be great for those who want to try a gentle overnight exfoliation treatment. Gentle overnight exfoliation
