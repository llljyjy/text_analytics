I love this face SPF lotion. It doesnâ€™t have your typical sunscreen white cast or greasy feel to it, and it applies really smoothly under my makeup. It did not feel greasy at all and smells super good. It kept my skin protected when I went to the beach and it did not break me out which is a win because my skin is sensitive and breaks out easy. nan
