I received this Strawberry Smooth BHA + AHA Salicylic Acid Serum from Glow Recipe. I have tried a few products from them and liked the results. I have combination skin and have suffered from acne all my life. This serum calms the flare ups and soothes my skin. It has a light smell that is pleasant. It is perfect for someone who has not tried Vit C or Retinol and wants to start introducing some actives into their skincare routine. nan
