Smaller than I thought but honestly this night treatment is amazing! It has a lightweight jelly texture that soaks into the skin. It can feel a bit sticky but let it dry before you sleep. When I woe up the next morning, my skin was soft and glowing. My skin just looked hydrated and bright! It is definitely an upgrade from the original sleeping mask. I enjoy the AHAâ€™s to help with skin texture, which is perfect to use at night. This is something I just love to use in my routine! LOVE! nan
