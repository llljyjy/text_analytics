First of all, I love Glow Recipe packaging, all of the products are so adorable and I always save my empty jars! The product was phenomenal, too, it makes my skin feel so soft in the morning! It did sting a little bit upon initial application but the formula also has a cooling sensation that helps soothe the redness. The texture is gel-like and a little sticky, it leaves the skin feeling very hydrated and moisturized, and doesnâ€™t sink in fully, so you wake up with some product still on your face. I usually wash my skin with plain water in the morning and that seems to be enough. nan
