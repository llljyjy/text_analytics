The packaging on this is so cute and it has a light strawberry scent. I love the ingredients that help to moisturize and prevent acne. The serum absorbs pretty quickly into the skin and leaves a nice glow. My skin did not feel tight or sticky after. Excited to see results over time! Leaves a beautiful glow!
