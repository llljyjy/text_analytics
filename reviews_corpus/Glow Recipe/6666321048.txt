This eye cream is officially my new favorite. After just one week of using it, I can already see the improvement it’s made to my under eye area. The gel consistency in my opinion feels lighter and this one specifically targets more of the issues I care about for under my eyes. Also love that it’s not a super fragrant product because my skin is sensitive to things with scent and this did not irritate my skin. New Fave Eye Cream!!!
