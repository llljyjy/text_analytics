I don’t normally write reviews but I hope this helps someone else out before spending the money on this. I have tried this product and the super bounce by glossier (which I absolutely love). I figured I’d give this a shot and see if I liked this one any more. I can say to not waste your money and go straight to the super bounce. This product leaves my face so sticky and gross after using it. With the super bounce I had no residue left and my face was so hydrated. May work for some of you but wasn’t for me. nan
