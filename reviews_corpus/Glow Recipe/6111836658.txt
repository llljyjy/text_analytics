The AHA + BHA combo is not irritating at all and goes on super clean with no pilling, so you can layer on more serums and moisturizers without concern. I actually found that it had a calming effect on active breakout areas. Plus, Glow Recipe packaging does not disappoint. The little strawberry bottle is the cutest! Non-irritating acne fighter
