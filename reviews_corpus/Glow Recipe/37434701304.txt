I was such an OG fan of the original that I was nervous about the reformulation. I didnâ€™t need to worry because this is IT!! The addition of AHAs but still super gentle and hydrating is a serious upgrade. I love the jelly texture and I use it as my last step of the night. When I wake up in the morning my skin feels smooth, hydrated and bright. Plus the watermelon scent is so yummy, all the Glow Recipe products are! Better than the original!
