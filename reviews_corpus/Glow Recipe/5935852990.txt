I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now and am in love! Already a huge fan of Glow Recipe and their avocado eye melt (I hope this is not a replacement for that product!) and the Guava dark spot serum, so I knew I’d be a fan of this product. I haven’t noticed any major changes in my dark circles quite yet, but think it may still be too early to see those drastic changes just yet. I like the product’s consistency - it’s light, not sticky, and melts into the skin. This is a much different consistency than the avo eye melt, but I love them both! So far, in love!
