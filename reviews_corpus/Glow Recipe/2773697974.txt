I love this eye cream! I’m so happy Glow Recipe added a product to the Guava Vitamin C line, it’s such a nice daytime eye cream. First - the packaging is so cute! I love that it’s a pump so you don’t have to stick your finger in a jar, so much more hygienic. A little goes a long way with this product, and I love how it plumps up the skin underneath my eyes and gives me a brighter under eye area. Lightweight texture that sinks in beautifully and I look forward to using it. I adore this eye cream!!
