I haven’t tried a Glow Recipe product that I haven’t loved, and this one is no exception! Can you say glow smooth skin overnight? This stuff is amazing. It smells so good first off, which I love. I do tend to have sensitive skin, so I’ve started out only using this a few times a week and plan to increase over time. When I wake up, my skin is bright, smooth, tightened! I highly recommend. A new top favorite!
