LOVE this sunscreen! First off, the smell is amazing. The texture is light and smooth. This is my go to sunscreen for day to day use. I work out out a lot and was very excited that it’s not at all runny or greasy when my body starts to sweat. I highly recommend Glow Recipe and the products that they put on the skincare market, so it’s no surprise this was another home run from this brand! Luxury in a Bottle
