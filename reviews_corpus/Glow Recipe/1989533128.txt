Iâ€™ve been looking for an overnight treatment that can help exfoliate and make my skin glow, so I was excited to try this. I have some post acne marks on my chin and this does help lighten it. My skin looks smooth and glowing when I wake up. I also love the scent and texture. The cute jar is definitely a plus! nan
