I’ve been searching for a new sunscreen, and I really like this product! It goes on easily and leaves my skin dewy. I didn’t have any trouble with reapplication either. It’s a bit expensive for the amount you get, but I only use it on my face and neck, so it should last a little while. Plus, it’s worth it not to have a white cast. No white cast and glowy complexion!
