This cleanser is perfect for my face in the winter - it feels rich and creamy, yet still gets the job done to clean my skin well.  The “moisture barrier” certainly feels intact without leaving any residue or stickiness. Definitely my new cold weather face cleanser! Rich, creamy, gentle, and nourishing!
