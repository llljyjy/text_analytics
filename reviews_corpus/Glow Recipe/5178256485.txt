I loveeee this sunscreen so much! (Make sure to shake it before using it). It’s SPF 50!! I love all Glow Recipe products and this one did not disappoint. I have sensitive skin but I have been using this everyday and have gotten NO breakouts at all. It does not leave a white cast and absorbs so well into my skin. I look so glowy when wearing it, it’s so perfect! Love the faint fruity smell too! A staple in my routine for sure. Get this!
