This new SPF has a great watermelon scent, very light and easy to put on the face, non greasy also it seems bright up my skin tone in a very natural way (Good), going well with my following makeup steps! This is quite amazing part! However, I did a little bit research on the ingredient: Homosalate（pregnancy safe?), Octisalate and Octocrylene are not necessary the safest ingredients, they got some concern... Understand that it’s hard to find the 100% safe SPF products, but will love to see less chemicals... Like the result, texture, but still have concerns.
