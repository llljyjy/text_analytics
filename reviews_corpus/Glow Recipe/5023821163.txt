It almost doesn’t matter how good this product is, because you basically only get to use half of it... The pump only sits halfway in the bottle, so you miss out on a lot of product. The bottle is glass, which is very pretty, so you can’t even cut it to access the rest of the product. The product itself is meh, not hydrating enough. Terrible packaging
