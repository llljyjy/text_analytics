I had really high hopes for the product, I love the brand and have had great results in the past but I just didn’t like this product. First of all it smelled really bad. Not unbearable but like bleach. It also didn’t have enough spf for the price even though 30 is enough for the day i still think it could have been more. It also left a layer of white casting on my my face that didn’t go away. And the main reason I’m writing this review is the balling of the product. Not matter what I did I could not get this product to stop balling and peeling on my face. I have had better results from cheaper products. nan
