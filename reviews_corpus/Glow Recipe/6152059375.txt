Meh. This stuff really didn’t do anything, and the bottle is awkwardly shaped, so it wasn’t able to pump the product out after it was half way through. I had to take the cap off and drop it directly from the bottle to my hands. Probably wouldn’t have been a huge deal if the stuff worked, but in my opinion it was a waste of money. Still two stars because it smelled like starburst and had a nice texture, but this is a pass for me. I don’t understand the hype
