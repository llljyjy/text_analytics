Love this moisturizer and I use it along with the plum plump serum. My skin is dry in the winter so these two products make my skin look and feel amazing and makes my foundation look great. I also use the dew drops to make my skin look even better. This is well worth the money. I love how you can change the pod out so itâ€™s helping out with less waste. Great Product
