I should have waited and read verified purchase reviews before trying this! I like the thin formula, and it does indeed leave a nice glowy (not greasy) finish...eventually. However, it doesn’t play well with makeup. It takes forever to settle down and then either pills or gives my foundation that “polka dot“ look where the pores are noticeable depending on what I layer on after it. It also leaves a white cast initially. It does go away, but my HG sunscreen does none of the above and also contains a good % of niacinamide (Drmtlgy Tinted Moisturizer 46). I’ll make this work and use it up. Finicky with makeup - I have better options
