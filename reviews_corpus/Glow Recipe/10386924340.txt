the glow from this serum is real and beautiful BUT all the glow from the serum was dulled by the time i layered moisturizer and sunscreen on top.... to keep the glow, i tried moving this product into my makeup routine instead (like mixing it with my foundation, or tapping on top of a finished face) but i didn’t like this either ... the finishing feeling is pretty sticky and tacky i wanted to add this to my skincare routine (my main skin concerns are hyperpigmentation and fine lines) but after 3 months of use (1x a day, morning routine) i did not see any improvements. realistically, i should be giving this 6 months (or more) of continued use to see results ... but not at this price. there are other niacinamide options on the market at *much* lower price points. this product was fun to try but i won’t be repurchasing. overhyped & overpriced
