I was gifted this product from Glow Recipe! Although I was a little skeptical because I had already seen some reviews of the formula, I was pleasantly surprised that it worked great for my skin! I know some people experienced a little bit of pilling--but that was not the case for me! The sunscreen wore beautifully under my makeup all day. Hydrating sunscreen with no white cast!
