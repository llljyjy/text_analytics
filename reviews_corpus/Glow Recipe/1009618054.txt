I’ve been testing out the Guava Vitamin C Bright-Eye Gel Cream that Glow Recipe sent me and here is my review. First, my under eye area is extremely dry from my severe chronic dry eye condition. So my eye area is dry, very sensitive, dark circles & super prone to milia. I honestly like this eye cream a lot. I love the gel consistency that hydrates without feeling heavy. I haven’t used it long enough to see any longterm benefits but I’m hopeful. Sensitive, dry eyes prone to milia
