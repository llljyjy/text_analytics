If you have no visible pores (like me) then skip this one because it’s not gonna do much for you. I didn’t get this for pore tightening purposes, but there’s a lot of claims about hydrating properties for this product and I found it did not make much difference in my skin’s hydration level. I’m giving it 3 stars because it felt nice on the skin at least. nan
