Absolutely love this product! It’s so soft on the skin, smells incredible, and has such cute packaging. I’ve incorporated it into my nightly routine and my skin already looks radiant and bright. The formula is silky, smooth, and light. It works perfectly after cleanser and before moisturizer! I have had a recent breakout bc of wearing a mask to the gym and this helped clear things up and replenish my skin. My skin feels so healthy now! Absolutely loved the application and scent!
