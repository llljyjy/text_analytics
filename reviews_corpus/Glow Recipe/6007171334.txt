I have been using this religiously as a makeup remover and have felt a nearly instant difference in the texture of my skin. So smooth! I see a lot of other reviews saying things about a residue is leaves. I bet it would if I didn’t know I needed to remove the balm with a face wash… I’ll be purchasing again when I run out in a couple months. Smoother skin = Win
