I’ve been purchasing this product for a little over a year now and absolutely swear by it. I recommend it to all of my friends and family and they end up loving it to! I don’t experience any film being left behind on my face (make sure you’re emulsifying it people!) and it doesn’t make me go blind for a couple minutes, like quite a few other cleansing balms do (**cough cough Green Clean**). The scent is....something to get used to, but it does not linger after I wash it off and use a second cleanser. TL;DR: A great cleansing balm for makeup and sunscreen removal! My Holy Grail!
