This is such a great eye cream . I love the gel consistency because it feels really soothing on the skin but it also sinks in really well leaving my undereye area visibly more hydrated . I’ve tried a lot of eye creams and this one is really nice because I don’t find it to be heavy . It’s not one that just sits on the skin it actually sinks in and over time makes that area look a lot more supple . A must try
