I did not like the tacky, sticky feeling this left on my face. I think it would make a great tacky primer for foundation, but if you don’t wear a lot of makeup you probably won’t like this. The sticky feeling did not go away all day, and I have extremely dry skin, so most products skin right in. I ended up returning, and will incorporate niacinamide into my routine with other products. nan
