The Texture of this is beautiful, in the morning my skin feels super hydrated and plump. I can see an improvement in overall skin tone brightness. I suffer from texture on my forehead and this seemed to help with that. Overall recommend , I’m not a overnight mask use but this definitely changed my mind. I never tried the original so can’t compare on that front. Over nice overnight mask, see some improvements
