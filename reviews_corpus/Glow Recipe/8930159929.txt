I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review.I found a lightweight moisturizer that looks and feels like a fresh yoghurt . It’s Plum Plump Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer!  I love how glowy and soft my skin looks and feels. And also it’s refillable, scroll to see how it looks:) fresh yoghurt for your face
