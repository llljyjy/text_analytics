I had started to react to the lavender in the serum I was previously using and needed something new. After reading up on this one, I picked it up and have really been enjoying it. My only complaint is that this bottle is 30 percent glass bottom (you can see in the picture) and just goes too fast/feels like too small of an amount to justify the bottle size. For a green product, you should also be focused on how many containers a daily user will need to purchase in a year and the impact of the packaging/plastic pump. Up the size! Makes my skin feel fresh and no breakouts
