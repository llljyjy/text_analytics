Immediate results when I do use it. I’m 23 w combo skin slightly sensitive. I can feel my face is a little bit sensitive after using so I haven’t kept up with it but I am definitely trying to get into a skincare routine for the new year so I will be using it! A day later and my skin looks smoother and more hydrated even though my pores and face feel tight, definitely different. I spent a day testing it and only used this toner on my face and can still feel results. I love the consistency and smell. I have not had an adverse reaction, but my skin is slightly sensitive so I will be following up with protection. As someone who doesn’t have a full routine yet, I immediately see results w this toner. My pores are normally very large and my T zone gets oily but also dry at the same time and this solved it for me! Results
