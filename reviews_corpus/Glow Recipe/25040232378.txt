As an acne prone/ combination skin person, I am always hesitant to try new sunscreens as almost all of them have always broken me out. However, I have been quite diliigent with this one and I like the results of it. This sunscreen has a very light and milky (not too runny) of a texture. On the skin, it feels very lightweight and it is non- greasy and blended pretty well into my skin. I used it with my CeraVe PM moisturizer and Azelaic acid. Personally, I have had no issues with the sunscreen piling when used alone but I did see some piling under my makeup. After using the sunscreen, my skin has felt hydrated for most of the day although you do have to reapply it a couple of times. As the name claims, this sunscreen is glowy and will give you the glow! In addition to that, the spf has a very faint fragrance but it is definitely not as strong of a smell. Overall, I really liked the sunscreen but I think for others, it can be a hit or miss depending on their skin and itâ€™s needs. nan
