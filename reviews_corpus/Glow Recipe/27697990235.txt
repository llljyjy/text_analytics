I absolutely love this product!! The first time I put it on, it burned pretty bad but didn’t leave burn marks. If my skin is super dry, sometimes when I put it on it burns a tiny bit, but I love it. I expect products to burn because I have dry and acne prone skin. It makes my skin really smooth and soft, and it’s helping fade my acne scars and target breakouts. Would definitely recommend :) Fav serum ever
