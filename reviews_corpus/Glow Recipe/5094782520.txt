This is hands down my favorite serum by glow recipe! I have oily/acne prone skin and this has really changed the way my skin looks. It’s so much smoother and much more even toned. It’s a lovely texture that skinks in well without leaving me greasy. Plus it has the added the added benefit of being moisturizing. I would definitely recommend this to anyone! Hands down the best serum!
