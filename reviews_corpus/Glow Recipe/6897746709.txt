This eye cream did not disappoint! I loved the formula and texture of it! I have very sensitive skin under my eyes and a lot of eye creams and moisturizers can sometimes burn me, I didn’t have that sensation at all with this one. I have do have hereditary under eye bags but the darkness is something I like to treat so they’re not as noticeable. I did notice some brightening effect, mostly bc I felt like I needed less concealer for my under eyes! Great for sensitive eyes!
