I found this balm to be a let down.  I was expecting for it to glide across my lips, melting into a luscious hydration. In reality, it was very stiff. It tugged and pulled at my lips, actually causing a little discomfort. That was not at all the experience that I expected at this price point. I also donâ€™t care for the feel of the balm on my lips. It feels slightly rough when I rub my lips together. -I suppose that is the exfoliation factor to it.- It also feel waxy and somewhat dry. It reminds me of The old fashioned Chapstick that I used to use as a child (I hated it.), but with a less thick texture. I suppose that the thickness my brain a good thing in freezing weather, but it rarely freezes where I live. It also leaves my lips feeling slightly drier after the product has worn off, than they did before I placed it on. All in all, I would not purchase this again, nor would I recommend. There are many better two and three dollar balms in the drugstore. Overhyped, and the value was not there.
