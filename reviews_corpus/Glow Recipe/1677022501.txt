I really wanted to like this product because I love the glow drops and the spray, but this is unfortunately one of the worst sunscreens I have ever tried. It creates a film very quickly and if you continue blending it in once it has even slightly set, it will create terrible, gunky white pills. Dermatologists recommend applying an even layer of sunscreen, letting it set in for a minute or so, and then applying a second layer to ensure there is even coverage. This is impossible with this formula as it immediately turned into a terrible gunky mess and would be impossible to apply any makeup over.Maybe Iâ€™m spoiled from using Korean and Japanese sunscreens for so long, but this was the worst.
