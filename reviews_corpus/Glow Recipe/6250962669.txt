I’m so happy that I got a chance to try out the new glow recipe strawberry smooth bha and aha salicylic serum. I have oily and combination skin so I was super excited to try a serum that was supposed to even skin texture. The serum comes in a really nice glass pink/red bottle and definitely gives off that strawberry scent. The serum is a milky white color; not too thin or too thick. I have really textured skin from a lifetime of acne and picking my face and I know that this product has really helped me with my skin texture. I use the strawberry serum after I use my ordinary niacinamide serum and it paired beautifully with that serum as well. I didn’t have any issues layering on moisture or sunscreen while having this serum on either. Going forward I would like to incorporate this serum into my everyday skin care routine as I really am enjoying the results. My skin is less red and I can really see the texture minimizing on my face every day. It really seems to help neutralize and keep my oils at bay which is an a+ for me! You Should Try This!
