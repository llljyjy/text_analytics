So far, I’m loving this toner. It’s my first Glow Recipe product and I’m now excited to try more. This toner is more viscous than other ones I own, but it absorbs really quickly and leaves my skin smooth and soft.  After using this for a little bit, I can see some reduction in how large/visible my pores are. It also has a nice light watermelon cucumber scent. Overall, really happy with this toner! Great Toner
