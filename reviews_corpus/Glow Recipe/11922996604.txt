First off THIS SMELLS SO GOOD !!! I’m a fan of scent in products but only if it smells good . The key ingredients are Salicylic Acid, AHA blend, Strawberry, and Hyaluronic Acid. The texture on this serum is very rich and thick I like how it absorbs into my skin and gives my skin a nice glow. My skin usually gets very irritated using BHA’s but this so far hasn’t caused any dryness or irritation. I haven’t seen much physical change in my skin other than a nice glow it gives and makes my skin plump. This can be also be used for the AM&PM. Highly Recommend
