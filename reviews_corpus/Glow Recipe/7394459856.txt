This is a good moisturizer. I’ve been using it daily for a few weeks and I haven’t had any reactionary breakouts. I skew more oily and I haven’t had issues wearing this under makeup during the day. For reference, my HG day moisturizer is Clinique 72-hr moisturizer and Pump Plump is slightly thicker and doesn’t dry down quite as much as my go-to. However, I don’t think I would buy it again. There are many drugstore hyaluronic acid moisturizers on the market that are just as effective. And you get less product than you expect in this container. Just not worth it for me! Good but wouldn’t rebuy
