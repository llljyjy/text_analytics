I wanted to love this product but ultimately was not happy with the results. The jury’s still out on whether this did much to improve my dark spots.Pros:- The bottle is adorable.- The fruity smell is very pleasant. - The serum is a nice texture (not super sticky), felt nice upon application, and absorbed quickly.Cons:- As several folks here have already mentioned, the adorable bottle is also SUPER impractical. The pump tube does not go all the way into the bottle so you cannot get all the serum out with just the pump. Fortunately the pump comes off and luckily I have makeup spatulas handy (a MUST have, by the way), and I was able to get all $45 worth of product out of the bottle that way.- It’s $45, and based on other reviews as well as my own experience, the results are hit or miss. There are vitamin C serums out there for less than half the price of this that are just as effective if not more. I bought this product to see if paying more money would get me an even more effective vitamin C serum, but I don’t think i’ve concluded that that’s the case, and will probably go back to what I was buying from Amazon.Other notes:-The entire bottle lasted me one month with daily use (used it twice on a few days).I would say give this a try if you are willing to do a $45 experiment. Otherwise look elsewhere. Going to Try Something Else
