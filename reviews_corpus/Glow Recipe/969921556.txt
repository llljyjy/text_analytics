I received this treatment in exchange for my review. I’m a big fan of Glow Recipe and I had not tried the previous formulation of this overnight treatment, so I was excited to give it a whirl! I love AHAs and I found this to be a gentle treatment that would work well for many skin types. The texture is runny, but thick enough that it’s easy to apply. All you need is a small amount, and I found that it layers well with my other products. Leaves my skin soft and hydrated, and I think it’s a great treatment to use a couple times per week. It has a light scent, like all Glow Recipe products, but I find it pleasant (And I’m not usually one for scented skincare.) If you’re looking for a glow-boosting skincare treatment, give this one a shot! Leaves my skin soft and hydrated
