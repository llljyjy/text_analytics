The packaging for this product alone is a win! I love how hydrating this eye cream is and most importantly I love the phenomenal ingredients: 10% encapsulated vitamin C complex, niacinamide blend, green caffeine and firming peptides. The texture is creamy but also lightweight and has a very light scent to it, but itâ€™s nice! My skin looks very hydrated afterwards and brightened, I think using this longer will have an even drastic effect so I plan on committing to adding it into my routine even longer. Hydrating Eye Cream!
