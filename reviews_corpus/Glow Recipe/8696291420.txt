i bought this be use i needed a gentle cleanser that wouldn’t strip my skin since it is getting cold outside. i have oily skin but this cleanser simply made it worse. it didn’t remove enough oil, which made my skin start to produce more oily and after a week my face was greasy and i was beginning to develop black heads on my nose and forehead. it smells good like blueberries. it’s not horrible but if you have oily skin do not use. not for oily skin
