My skin loves this product! I apply it at night and when I wake up in the morning my skin feels baby smooth. The mask has a light watermelon scent but it’s very light, the texture is also super light and kind of on the watery side. Overall I would recommend if you’re looking for more hydrated skin. glowy skin
