I am a big fan of Glow Recipe’s products, I have not had a product that doesn’t work well for my dry sensitive skin. I have been using their Strawberry Smooth BHA+AHA Salicylic Serum for about a month now; it does so well keeping my hormonal pimples at bay. When I saw they have am AHA Night Treatment from the Watermelon Glow line, I was beyond excited. When I first tried it, I had a under the skin pimple on my chin. After just two usages (at night time, one night apart), the pimple was gone. Now I use this treatment once a week (twice during period). With the combination with the Salicylic Serum, my skin has been clear and looking hydrated. Recommend for all skin type. For any skin type!
