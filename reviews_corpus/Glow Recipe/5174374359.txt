Thankful for the opportunity to receive this glow recipe watermelon glow aha night treatment. I’ve used the original and though I didn’t notice much of a difference , I have to say that this mask is excellent just like the original. It really does the resurfacing work overnight. My skin is smooth, clear, radiant in the morning. I did not notice any breakage or irritation while using this mask. I have used this a few nights over the course of two weeks and I enjoy it. Great mask
