For my sensitive, acne prone folks. My skin was breaking out around my chin and cheeks. It was clear within 3 days of using this. Not only is it great for acne but also texture improving. Slight smell like a hit of watery strawberriesâ€¦is the best I can describe it. Stock up while the sale is still going! nan
