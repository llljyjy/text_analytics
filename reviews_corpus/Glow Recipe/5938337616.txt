I finally found my perfect sunscreen - something that works and doesn’t cause any reactions to my super sensitive skin. I have oily/combo skin and this doesn’t make me that oily. I’ve been using it for at least a month now and I will keep repurchasing this. It gives a very slight white cast but nothing too much. It’s great under makeup and does not pill. Not sure why it pills for most of the reviews here but I’ve never had it pill on me even when I put makeup on. It glides on smoothly and gives me a beautiful glow. I have nothing bad to say here. my favourite!
