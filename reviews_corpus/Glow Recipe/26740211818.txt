I always use sunscreens, some I have to stop using due to my sensitive skin but this has definitely been a must have for me! It does not leave a white residue and I can blend it with my foundation for a nice clean glow! Love how it does not feel cakey or makes my face look oily! Skin feels amazing after applying & happy that it has a gel texture to it. Love, love this sunscreen! Amazing sunscreen for sensitive skin!
