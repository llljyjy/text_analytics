I’ve been using this on and off for a few years but I’ve been really using it consistently these past few weeks and it’s definitely improved the texture of my skin. I normally gravitate (and prefer) towards BHAs but I love how clean this makes my skin feel especially with this hot weather/humidity. It removes makeup (mascara and eyeliner) pretty well too and I like how it lathers up. I’ve always bought/used the minis but I think I might get a full size for this season. I’m not sure about using it in the winter since remember it making my face feel tight, but I know I’ll continue using it for the next few months! Perfect Summer Cleanser
