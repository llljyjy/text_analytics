as someone that doesn’t like spending money on things, this purchase was the best thing i’ve purchased! it’s so lightweight & feels so refreshing on the skin. for someone that has sensitive skin, it didn’t burn putting on so that’s a plus. overall would buy again & convinced me to buy the Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer today. :) LOVED! GOOD FOR SENSITIVE SKIN :)
