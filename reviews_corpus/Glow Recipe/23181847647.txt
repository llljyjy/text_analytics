I really wanted to like this because I love everything else I have from this brand. So it didn’t pill for real, just a little bit of flaking off my nose + around my mouth. I had to keep trying to apply it to these areas :( I also felt that it never sunk into my skin, but was just hanging out on top. I can handle a little bit of a tacky feeling, but this was straight up sticky. It was sticky on my hands and my face felt sticky while - and after - applying it. It does kinda smell like sunscreen but that goes away super quick. It didn’t leave a white cast, gave me a cute glow, and made my pores less noticeable. So that’s why it gets three stars, but I will be returning/exchanging it bc I can’t deal with the stickiness. why is it sticky
