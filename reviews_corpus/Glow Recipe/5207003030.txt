The reviews on the product are highly incentivized and seem like a first impression. I spent my own money on this.. so this is an authentic reviewPROS: It does everything it claims IF you use a very sparing amount. It’s very glowy, with a little bit of stickiness great for under makeup. It has a watermelon (jolly rancher) and sunscreen fragrance. Depending on your senses it may smell strongly of watermelon jolly rancher or more on the sunscreen side. For the most part, I don’t smell it on my skin after application. CONS: If you are SERIOUS about your sunscreen application, and you apply the recommended amount or a generous amount… this does the exact opposite of all their claims. It will feel goopy, sticky, heavy on the skin and take forever to settle in. PLUS if you apply this amount, it WILL pill. And if you have oily skin, you’ll end up a grease ball by the 2-3 hour..A little goes a long way. You’ll like it or hate it depending on how much you believe should be applied. AUTHENTIC REVIEW
