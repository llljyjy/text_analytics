I love glow recipe and have tried every product In their line. Aside from the adorable packaging, the products are great! Iâ€™ve been using this new strawberry serum this past week and loving it so far! It actually smells like real strawberry and not artificial strawberry. My skin feels super smooth and firm when I use this! Loving it!
