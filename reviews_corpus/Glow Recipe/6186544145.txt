I love this serum and I have seen a significant difference since I started to use it: my skin barrier is better, my skin is more plump and bright, and the few light spots I had are pretty much gone (in less than a month). My only complaint is that the straw inside it is so short I could never finish a bottle without opening (which most likely oxidizes the vitamin C). I have been dumping it on my hands and applying everywhere for about 2 weeks now and I still haven’t finished it... really? It shouldn’t be that hard to use a longer straw inside it. I might switch to another vitamin C serum just because of how much of it is wasted even though I love it :( Fantastic but needs a longer straw
