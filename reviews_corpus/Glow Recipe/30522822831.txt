This is meant for your face, but originally I got a free sample and it just said ‘redness cream’ so I used on my underarms when I get rashes. It worked so great I bought this bottle and found out it’s meant for your eyes. Well I will keep using it for my underarms because it’s so soothing and helps get rid of the rash. Would recommend for any body redness! Not just for your face
