I bought this during the VIB sale with the intention of using it as a night time serum in the summer instead of my usual rosehip seed oil and I’m so glad I did. My skin is glowing every morning instead of being a greasy mess. It’s usually so oily that my mom has told me that she could use my face oil to fry an egg (thanks mom), but now it’s like glass skin. It’s expensive but way more effective than the nicinamide dew drops. If it wasn’t obvious I have oily skin. I can’t say if this helps with breakouts because I get breakouts from sugar and stress. At least get 2 samples to try it out if you’re skeptical because this did not work on me instantly. I usually use this after toner and before my moisturizer. My skin has never looked healthier
