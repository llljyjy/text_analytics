I enjoyed using this moisturizer over the past 2 weeks. It left my skin feeling soft and smooth. My husband noticed I had less irritation and fewer breakouts, even around my cycle. The only thing I did not like was the cleanser did not lather well for me, but it worked wonders for my skin. The texture is creamy like a light lotion. I did not notice a scent at all. Clearer skin
