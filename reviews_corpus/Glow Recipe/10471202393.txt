I mostly use product labeled as fragrance free, but I received a sample of this and gave it a shot. First, to me, the fragrance is quite noticeable. Ain’t no plum smell like that. This smells like Nyquil. Not here for it. Second, so much skincare has hyaluronic acid in it at this point, and the effect of plumping is mostly temporary and cosmetic, that not only are you likely getting the ingredient from multiple sources, it just doesn’t seem necessary to have a dedicated serum that again smells like Nyquil. Third, the reason I gave it three stars is despite the sickly smell, the serum did make my skin look very beautiful. I can’t and won’t commit to a product that has fragrance in it, but I did like how this looked on my skin. Layering it under moisturizer I didn’t care that it was a bit tacky. MEH
