I’ve used up about two bottles but I can’t seem to justify buying more at this price point when there so many other vitamin C products. I think I do see better skin tone but it could also be attributed to other items in my skin care routine. It is gentle as pure vitamin c causes skin irritation for me. decent but pricey
