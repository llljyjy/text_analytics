I have sensitive and and dry skin on my face and this Watermelon Glow Niacinamide sunscreen is the only that has worked with out breaking me out or drying out my skin more. I just use a little and it instantly starts to calms my face down. My skin feels super hydrated the serum is not heavy, it’s not oily and it won’t make your face look shiny. It reduces the look of hyperpigmentation and gives me a natural glow. Goodbye redness and burning. It absorbs quickly and the moisture lasts all day and it has a nice light scent. I apply one pump before makeup. Gives me a natural glow
