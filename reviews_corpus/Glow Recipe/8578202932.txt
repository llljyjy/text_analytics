This feels like the previous Watermelon glow mask, but less tacky and I think it absorbs better. The fragrance is also not as strong as it was in the previous version. It does a great job of hydrating my skin and leaving it glows, and in the  morning my skin feels nice and supple. I definitely will be using this in my nighttime routine 3x a week to get the full exfoliating effect. nan
