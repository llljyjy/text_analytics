I love this moisturizer. It’s lightweight and never feels greasy or shiny but still moisturizes very well. For someone with combination skin that is a tall order and this one does just that. It does have a scent, kind of like jolly ranchers, but the scent dissipates after application. Despite the fragrance, it is still one of the few products I’ve tried that doesn’t aggregate my super sensitive skin or cause breakouts. I use this in the mornings and a thicker moisturizer at night. It is a little pricey, but it lasts and is definitely worth it. I am already on my 3rd bottle, and will continue to purchase it when I run out. nan
