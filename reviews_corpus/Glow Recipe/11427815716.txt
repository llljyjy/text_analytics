For the past two months I’ve been really TRYING to make my acne-prone skin like this product. I really wanted my acne scars to go away but instead this product created new ones. It broke me out every time I used it, I was so disappointed because I couldn’t find any reviews warning me of this. Everyone kept talking about how great this product was and how much they loved it and I just wished I could’ve agreed with them too. Broke me out, Broke my heart
