This formula feels very silky and lightweight, but is still deeply moisturizing. I use this during my nighttime skin care routine so that it works overnight, and the next morning my skin feels moisturized and looks radiant. It works well in combination with The other products in my skin care routine and absorbs easily without pilling. After weeks of regular use, my skin has a visible improvement in overall texture and appearance. nan
