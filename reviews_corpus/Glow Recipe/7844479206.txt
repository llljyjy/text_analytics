I’ve liked other products from the Watermelon Glow line and expected this to be the same.But the smell. THE SMELL. The other products have what I’d describe as a light, pleasant scent. This is the worst smelling mask I’ve ever had the misfortune of encountering, and I was a 2000s sulfer mask girlie.This smells like sour milk and despair. Like cleaning out your fridge after a month long vacation. Like leaving groceries in a hot car. I have no clue if it works because I couldn’t stand to keep it on my face for more than 2 minutes. Maybe I got a bad batch but BEWARE the scent of this product. Worst Smelling Mask of All Time
