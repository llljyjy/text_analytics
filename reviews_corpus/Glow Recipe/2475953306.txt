I bought this instead of the Watermelon moisturizer since it had better reviews, but it wasnâ€™t for me. I loved the consistency and smell but it left my face feeling oily and after rubbing it on for a bit, it would make my face peel. Almost like rubbing glue, waiting for it to dry then rub it off. Not for me
