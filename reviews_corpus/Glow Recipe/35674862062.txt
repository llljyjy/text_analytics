I love glowrecipe because of their packaging. They’re SO CUTE!! This one looks like a little nail polish bottle and the cream has the nicest shade! It does have fragrance but didn’t cause any irritation. I think it’s a good serum to use for the day to day because other exfoliants are typically a lot stronger. Good day to day exfoliant
