I have used this everyday for around 3 weeks now and I love it! It has played nicely with all my products and I havenâ€™t had the issue at all of things pilling up? I use the snail line from peach slices and niacinamide/acids from inky list and no problems. I will say if you lean more oily skip your moisturizer when using this. Overall gives a nice glow, sun protection and works well with other products. P.s. maybe the pilling is from not letting each product like fully sink in? works like a charm
