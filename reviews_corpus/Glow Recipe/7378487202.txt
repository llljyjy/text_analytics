I really love this product! Has a light scent which I really like because it’s not overpowering and I don’t even smell it once I apply the product. Has a gel type texture which is my favorite. And I love that I wake up with my skin feeling more hydrated and already looking smoother, brighter, and just better. This is my favorite treatment I have ever tried because it’s easy to incorporate into my routine since you only use it 2-3 times a week and it absorbs into my skin quickly and doesn’t make it feel sticky or anything as I apply it right before bed. I’d definitely recommend checking this out and I’m excited to see my long term results with this product and might be the first skincare item I have ever repurchased after finishing because I usually like always trying new things but that’s how much I really love this overnight treatment ! My favorite skincare product I’ve ever tried!
