I have been using this product for the past 2 weeks and Iâ€™ve been loving it so much. I have incorporated it easily into my morning and nighttime skincare routine as it layers well with other products I use. After applying this serum I have a nice natural glow to my skin and it feels smooth and hydrating. Glow recipe always has amazing and cute packaging. One of my favorite skincare brands, easily! Definitely saw improvement of my skin texture Amazing serum!
