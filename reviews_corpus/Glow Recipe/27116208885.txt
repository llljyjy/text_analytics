This stuff is my all time favorite skincare product. It smells soooo good and takes off even the most waterproof of mascaras. It leaves my face feeling so soft and clean.   (Use before you wash your face.) I was concerned it would run out super fast, but it didnâ€™t. It really lasted me a long time. I was so sad when I ran out. You need only a tiny amount. THIS STUFF IS COMPLETELY WORTH EVERY PENNY. BUY IT. I was not paid to say any of this. I literally just like this so much. BUY IT!
