Let me start off by saying that I’ve had horrible experiences with vitamin C serums in the past. My normal but sensitive and acne prone skin reacts horribly to products that use L Ascorbic acid. However, this vitamin C serum is truly a holy grail for me. It doesn’t use L Ascorbic acid, but five other forms of vitamin C. The texture of this serum isn’t sticky and it absorbs super easy into the skin. It’s hydrating and leaves my skin feeling plump, smooth and soft. Most importantly, it helps fade my post inflammatory hyperpigmentation more quickly than if it were to heal on its own. This is one of few products I can say that my skin actually craves. I use 2 pumps of this serum before moisturizer and SPF in my morning routine. This serum is so gentle that I even use it on my “rest“ nights when I am not using a retinol or chemical exfoliator. This is honestly my most repurchased skincare product of all time. If you are looking for a pleasant and non-irritating vitamin C, I highly recommend giving this product an honest try. Gentle and effective
