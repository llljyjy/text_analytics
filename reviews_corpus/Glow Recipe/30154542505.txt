Iâ€™ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and I like how gently and thoroughly it removes makeup. It has a clean, fresh scent. It is a little more drying than I prefer for winter months, but I think it will be great to use during the summer when my skin tends to be more oily. (I received a sample of this product to try.) nan
