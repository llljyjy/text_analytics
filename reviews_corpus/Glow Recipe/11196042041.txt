I love this glow recipe sunscreen it peels on my face dont know why  but other than that its super refreshing feels great, keeps my skin super hydrated and the sunscreen adds that layer of protection we need. It goes on great under makeup once its fully dried. Just need to blend it in quickly to your face so it doesnt dry as it dries a bit quickly. Sunscreen is so essential for wveryday and this is a perfect product. You glow while wearing it and thats a big deal! And you can constantly blend it in until the peeling is gone and it goes beautifully under makeup. Great sunscreen
