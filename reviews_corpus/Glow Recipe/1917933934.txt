Hyaluronic is in so many products and there is a hype surrounding it.However, it can cause more harm than good if you do not understand the mechanism of how it works on the skin.In humid climates, HA will absorb moisture from the environment and make your skin more hydrated.This is the ideal climate for HA. However, if you are using it in dry climate/cold weather,you MUST follow it up (or “seal it“) with a moisturizer (I use Belif’s aqua bomb) otherwise your skin could get drier. Before you buy into the hype, make sure you know what each ingredient does. Works when used properly
