I’m not used to buying such expensive sunscreens.  I don’t wear sunscreen daily (I don’t wear makeup either).  This sunscreen is nice, in my opinion.  I have worn it a few times on days I know I will be out in the sun for any extended period.  It is not totally matte, but it’s not super greasy either.  I have oily skin, so this being oil-free and non-comedogenic is what drew me to this product (and because it smells like watermelon!).  I mix this with the Glow Recipe oil-free watermelon moisturizer to dilute it a bit.  The only time I’ve tried putting this on my face full-strength is when I am going indoor tanning, which is why I bought it.Overall, this is a great sunscreen for my needs and I may purchase it again, but for what most other people are using it for (under makeup, reapplying, hoping it won’t leave a white cast, etc.) I can’t be the judge of that because I don’t care about / use it in that way. I only bought because it’s a watermelon sunscreen
