Glow Recipe is one of my holy grail brands and I always enjoy products from them! This Strawberry Smooth BHA + AHA Salicylic Acid Serum have been great for my combo skin! I do suffer from a few unflattering texture spots on my face so I was super excited to try this serum to decrease them. First of all, this serum smells like strawberries! The serum itself is very lightweight (gel texture), absorbs quickly and didn’t irritate my skin. I used it both during my morning and nighttime routines (every other day) and it layered really well with my other skincare products too!! I love how this gave me a more glowy, smoother complexion and kept my skin feeling hydrated! It’s also a Clean at Sephora product that’s vegan & cruelty-free!! I will be repurchasing once I’m done with this bottle! Does wonders for textured skin!
