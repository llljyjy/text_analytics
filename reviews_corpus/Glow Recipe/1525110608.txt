Having tried both the new and old version of this watermelon overnight mask, I have to say that I prefer this new version! The original watermelon scent is now muted, but I think that’s better for those with sensitivities to fragrance. The new texture is more watery, but I find it to be noticeably more hydrating which I prefer! So far this overnight mask offers my skin gentle exfoliation without experiencing any sensitivity. I’ve been waking up to smoother, softer and healthier looking skin. I see less dullness and my oily skin appears slightly brighter! Better!
