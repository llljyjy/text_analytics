This watermelon glow was the first time I ever tried an AHA product - I didn’t know what to expect. I normally apply tretinoin and moisturizer at night so I skipped the tret and did the watermelon glow then moisturizer. I would definitely say I could see a difference in my cheeks, I felt more glowy. I would recommend don’t use this two days in a row right when you start, maybe ease into it. Right now I’m using it 2x a week, and I feel like my skin is alot fresher/brighter looking. Also I love the color/texture of the actual product, i almost want to eat it. Even the bottle is adorable. Love. great as a nighttime aha treatment
