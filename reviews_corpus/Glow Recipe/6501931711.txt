This product was incredible on my skin! This has been clearing up the texture on my forehead without making my skin feel dry or sensitive! It is powerful but hydrating. It feels like a thin hydrating serum and mixed well with all the products I already use. This is the first time an AHA product is so hydrating on me and I will continue using it! I highly recommend it! I love it!
