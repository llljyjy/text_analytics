Summer ready!Love how the watermelon scent just reminds me of summer! This spf applies super easily and is absorbed quickly. It doesn’t have the typical sticky residue. Also, I find it very lightweight and not too greasy on my skin so I barely notice I’m wearing it. This keeps my skin hydrated but I do notice I reapply it every 2-3 hours in order to maintain that hydration. Other than that, the packaging is super cute always and I know it’s definitely going to be a staple in my spring/summer and even traveling bag! nan
