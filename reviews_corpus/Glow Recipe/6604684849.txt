I am always nervous to use exfoliating products on my dry skin because sometimes it’s quite sensitive. I had a bad experience with the Paula’s choice BHA which also has 2% BHA and it felt like it really irritated my skin. This serum is significantly more gentle! It didn’t irritate my skin at all. I really like the watery gel texture. So far so good! Gentle enough for dry skin
