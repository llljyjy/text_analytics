Takes quite a long time to absorb into the skin and remains sticky. I will only be using this at night and not under makeup because it doesnâ€™t work well with my foundation. I like the fact that it is refillable, but the original canister is made with a ton of plastic--lots of unused space. Eco-friendly in name only, imo. Not for me
