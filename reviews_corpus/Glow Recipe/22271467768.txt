It pains me to say that I love this. I normally use the INKEY list oat cleansing balm and have only ever used that for an oil makeup remover. It’s significantly cheaper and I never had problems with it but they were out of stock and I needed a makeup remover. So I went with this one despite the price and YES it is worth the money. It rubs on more nicely than the other and it comes off much easier/removes makeup cleaner than the INKEY list balm. My only concern is I wonder if this will last me a long enough time with the amount in the jar. But I have sensitive acne prone skin and it hasn’t caused me any new breakouts. nan
