Made my skin irritated and break out in small bumps all over my face. Wasnâ€™t an initial breakout that cleared up with continued use either. Once I stopped this product the small bumps cleared up. Wanted to use it to help even my skin texture and hormonal acne. I do have sensitive skin though but have used products with similar ingredients without this reaction. Not for sensitive skin
