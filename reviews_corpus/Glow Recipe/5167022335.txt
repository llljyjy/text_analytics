I enjoyed the old formula of glow recipes watermelon night treatment, so I was excited to try the reformulated version. This has a thin, very liquid texture that’s a little awkward to apply- I think a pump would have been better than a jar. This doesn’t have a noticeable watermelon scent the way the old formula did. And this definitely left my skin noticeably softer when I woke up the next day without any redness or sensitivity- it’s pretty awesome. Smooths skin without drying it out
