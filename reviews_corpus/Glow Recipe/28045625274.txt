I’ve had a hard time finding a dark spot remover that wasn’t too harsh on my face and my sister in law recommended this one. It’s great and my skin loves it. The spots are lightening, my skin has strengthened so I can use retinol as few nights a week and the smell is lovely; light and fruity… NOT perfumery at all. I’d highly recommend giving it a try. Love it!
