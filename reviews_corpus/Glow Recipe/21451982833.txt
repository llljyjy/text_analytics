I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I gave myself 3 weeks to try out the product to give my honest review. In conclusion I will definitely will be buying a refill which is available so that’s a plus. It has become a new go to moisturizer. I have combination skin and i times it feels dull and with this moisturizer I felt hydrated and plump! I love that it’s clean for your face it does not become oily. The best part of this product is it feels lightweight on the face. New go to moisturizer!
