this hasn’t really done anything for my pores but since I’ve been using this, my blackheads on my nose are gone. It is sticky when applied and I have to wash my hand afterwards. I apply it with my hands and pat it, I don’t recommend using cotton pads to apply it. I haven’t noticed a huge difference in my pores and I’ve been using this for about a year now but It’s helped so much with my blackheads on my nose Great for blackheads on nose
