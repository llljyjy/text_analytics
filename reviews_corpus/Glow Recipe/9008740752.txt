I really wanted to like this sunscreen. It’s comparable to the biore watery essence SPF as it has a thin formula. It feels very comfortable on the skin but it does leave a slight white cast so darker skin tones be wary. It does leave the skin looking very healthy and glowy, HOWEVER it pills like crazy! I layered this on top of one of Glow Recipe’s moisturizers so you’d think the formulas would be compatible but they do not layer well together at all. I wouldn’t be able to wear this makeup with the crazy amount of pilling. Tried reapplying this a few hours after initial application and still ran into the pilling problem. Too expensive, there are better alternatives out there that don’t pill and don’t wash you out. Looks nice but pills like crazy
