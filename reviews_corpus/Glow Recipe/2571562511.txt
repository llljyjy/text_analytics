This was sent to me by the brand but my opinions on my own - i’ve added this night cream into my evening  skincare routine and I’m so glad I was able to try it. Has left my skin looking so bright and refreshed the next morning. I absolutely love the texture and how it gentle enough to use in my slightly sensitive skin. The packaging is also super cute! I always love everything from glow recipe and this is no different. I absolutely recommend it! Love this!
