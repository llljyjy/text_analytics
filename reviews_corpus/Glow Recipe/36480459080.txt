I absolutely love this product, I use it on days when I’m not using retinol. It’s like getting a mini facial and waking up with the softest skin. I use it after a hydrating serum and even though it’s more like a moisturiser, I still follow with an extra hydrating cream and it works very well. Definitely worth a purchase. Love!
