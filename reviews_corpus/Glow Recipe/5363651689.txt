After using the whole bottle I have to say it does the job of making my skin look very naturally wet and moisturized with just a natural water type shine … no actual shimmer or sparkle chunky flecks on your cheeks which I think some people are used to. I hate the heavy thick odd shaped bottle and feel like I go through this highlighter quicker than any other. No need for a full pump of it. The packaging is just too “extra” for me. You don’t get that much product.I like this more than Marc jacobs dew drops which seemed to be too thick creamy and like a skin overlay rather than a skin drink. I just replaced my empty bottle of this with saie glowy super gel. I love the saie bottle so much more and it definitely reflects more light … however I have to say it does NOT replace the glow recipe for me. By that I mean, the natural wet look from glow recipe is unique and I feel like a necessity now. I might have to use it as a base under any other highlighter . Ugh. Lol a very special substance in an obnoxious bottle
