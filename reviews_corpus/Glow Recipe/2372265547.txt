This gel is the cutest baby pink color and applies like a lightweight (but still creamy enough to be effective) gel moisturizer. The applicator is a bit odd - at first I didn’t know if I was supposed to use the long plastic part attached to the lid to apply to my eyes, but it is a bit of a W shape so it would scratch you. I guess it’s just a way to get some on your finger to then apply? Either that or mine is broken, i dont think it had the pump like I see in others’ photos. Otherwise I really liked how this applied. nan
