Do not let the pictures fool you the jar is tiny tiny tiny and it’s not even filled all the way up. $42 just blows my mind. I have purchased several different products from Glow Recipe and as much as I want to love them I don’t have any positive feed back. hopefully I’ll feel differently once I start using this eye cream. I wanted to post my thoughts with a picture just to show how tiny the jar is and it’s not even full. you can see how much is missing from the jar. I won’t repurchase not for this price. nan
