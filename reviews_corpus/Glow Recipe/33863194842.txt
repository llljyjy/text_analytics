I’m going to give AN HONEST REVIEW!!So, it is July, I got this product along with the avocado serum and the banana moisturizer for Christmas. Both the banana and the avocado have ran out, yet this plump serum has lasted me   For so long and I use it every day twice a day. I saw results in the first three months. My skin has never looked so good and felt so great. The texture on my skin is so smooth and I feel so beautiful and youthful. It’s shocking because I didn’t notice until one day I woke up and my skin looked so different. I never had that skin like active acne but I did have a lot of texture, dark spots on my cheek and forhead which this fixed!! For sure get this HONEST LONG REVIEW
