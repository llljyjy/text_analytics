I am absolutely loving this overnight mask lately. I have very sensitive dry skin and this has made my skin feel so soft and nice after using it. I’ve used it three times this week and notice a difference in how glowy my skin is. My skin is very sensitive and I always get nervous using anything but this hasn’t irritated my skin at all l. I have a lot of uneven texture and I’m hoping to see more results soon. I also love that this product has no fragrance since most of the time they irritate my skin nan
