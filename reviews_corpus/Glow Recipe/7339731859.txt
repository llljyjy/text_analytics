I found that this sunscreen pills no matter what product I used prior (even after just a cleanser + toner routine) and no matter how long I let my prior products absorbs into my skin! However, that doesn’t even matter since it leaves a white cast/ purple cast (melanated ppl u know what I mean)! Even tried it on the back of my hand after washing and drying my hands just to be sure, and there is a cast! Smells good (artificial watermelon scent) but I don’t believe this is meant for anyone darker than a tan-olive tone complexion. Might just be good for only under make up application. :/**I added a pic to show the slight white cast/purple cast on the right side of the back of my hand wear I applied the sunscreen and the left side which is dry bare skin. May not look like much on my hand but it’s very very noticeable on the face cause you’ll look grey-purple lol Pills + Leaves White Cast!!
