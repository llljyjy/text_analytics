Love this product! It lasts a long time and smells deliciously good. It makes my skin feel nice and refreshed. Honestly i do agree that besides smelling really good and making your skin feel refreshed it doesn’t do anything else, but since i’m a foodie and it smells magnificent i give it 5 stars. You couldn’t convince me to use any other mist. Even the tatcha one must take second place to this bad boi. This mist is da bomb!
