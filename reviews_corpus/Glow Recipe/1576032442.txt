I have only been using this product for a few days, both in the mornings and evenings, and so far I love it. After applying, my under eye area feels instantly hydrated. My favorite thing about this product is the consistency; the texture is lightweight and smooth and dries evenly so it’s easy to apply makeup immediately following without worrying about your foundation or powder sticking to the product. I’ve had issues with other eye creams in the past because of this but so far no issues here! I would definitely recommend this product. nan
