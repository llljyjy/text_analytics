This sunscreen has a lightweight, lotion-like texture. It blends into the skin easily without any white cast and it smells like watermelon candy. The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming at all. I found this sunscreen to be nicely hydrating and it leaves a dewy finish. This is easily one of my favorites. The only con I can find is the very minimal pilling if you rub your skin hard or wear a mask all day. But then again, the pilling is minimal and not visibly noticeable. Dewy & Lightweight
