Gently cleansing but exfoliating enough that you can feel it working. Makes my skin smooth and supple and lathers nicely to removes makeup very well. Great for a gentle morning cleanse or a longer, deeper cleanse at night; I also love using it as a mask for about 10 minutes to get some extra exfoliation. perfect for my skin
