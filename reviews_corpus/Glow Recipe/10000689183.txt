I received a free sample to try out. Let me tell you, when it comes to sunscreen I can be extremely picky. But this is it people!! Feels so nice on the skin and has not irritated my eyes! It has a very soft fruity smell but dissipates after awhile. It also mingles well with makeup and my other skincare. I havenâ€™t seen any weird pilling so far. I will definitely keep using. Might be my new fav GR product! great for sensitive eyes.
