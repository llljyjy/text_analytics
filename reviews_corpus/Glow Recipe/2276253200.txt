I’m so excited that glow recipes came out their sunscreen. This hybrid sunscreen has both chemical and mineral uv filters. Zinc oxide is a very stable uva filter that also great for sensitive skin. The only thing that I’m concerned is the watermelon fragrance. It burned my eyes as soon as I put it on. Not sure if it’s the active ingredients or the scent that causing the burning. Such a bummer coz it’s a very elegant sunscreen. nan
