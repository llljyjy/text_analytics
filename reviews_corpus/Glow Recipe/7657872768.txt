Love and hate relationship.. like everyone say when applying it and rubbing numerous of times.. it feels like you canâ€™t get it off of your face, so you keep rubbing and rubbing till your face feels clean. After using my face is super soft and no trace of makeup. It always cleared out white heads in my nose area. I love it.. it has a weird texture but my face never been this soft  and clean. give it a try
