This is one of the few cleansers that doesn’t irritate my acne prone skin. I have dry sensitive acne prone skin and love this cleanser. It’s gives my skin a glow after using it for almost a whole year I got the mini for traveling sinceI can’t live without this cleanser. Stay away though if your sensitive to fragrance. Luckily that’s the one thing that doesn’t irritate my skin. Even la roche posay, cetaphil, cerave burns my skin but this doesn’t. I also right away go in with a hylauronic acid serum and their pink juice moisturizer since that’s one of the few moisturizers that doesn’t cause a break out or irritation with my skin. yes!!! safe for acne prone sensitive skin!
