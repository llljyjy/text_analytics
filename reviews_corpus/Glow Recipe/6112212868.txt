I tried this with nothing on my face and still had pilling. I always use 2 fingers of sunscreen and maybe it’s due to putting too much at once and you may have to work in sections but personally I don’t wanna have to spend more time slowly blending in my sunscreen when there are so many other better and more affordable options. Also, this burns if you get it in your eyes so be careful if you put it around thay area. For something similar, I love the bellflower watermelon fresh sunscreen and there’s a fragrance free option. Overall I don’t recommend this Pilling nightmare
