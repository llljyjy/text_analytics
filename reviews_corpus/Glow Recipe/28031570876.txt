I know this is an unpopular opinion but I never really liked the Watermelon Sleeping Mask that this Watermelon Glow Treatment is replacing. I was a little nervous that I wasn’t going to like this one as well but I really do! This smells like real watermelon and has a great texture. I have been applying at night and the results I’m seeing are awesome! My skin looks bright, super smooth, and hydrated! My fine lines and wrinkles close to gone! (At almost 40 that’s seriously impressive!) I really really like this new version! Love this new version!!!!
