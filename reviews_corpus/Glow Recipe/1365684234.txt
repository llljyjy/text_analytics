I’ve used this product for a couple weeks and I like the hydration it gives to my skin. Also, I love the packaging and I’m glad there’s a pump.  I will say that I don’t notice any benefits so far for acne. I broke out so this product didn’t prevent me from getting any breakouts. One of the major downsides is this is very pricey for a skim serum. Good hydration!
