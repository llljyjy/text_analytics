This eye gel cream is another win by Glow Recipe. The formula is light enough that it blends fairly easily and a little goes a long way. I immediately notice my eyes are firm and brighter after using this in my routine. I apply it after serums and/or toner and before moisturizer/SPF. It helps my eyes look wide awake. It helped with fine lines (virtually gone) and slightly lightening the purple pink discoloration I have in my inner eye corner. Hopefully it lightens the skin with continued use :) Light weight gel cream firmed and brightened eyes
