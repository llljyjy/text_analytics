I have been testing this eye cream out for a week now and really love how my under eye area is looking. It looks and feels smoother. The texture is so lightweight and absorbs beautifully into the skin and doesn’t leave any sticky residue behind. I love the light scent. I apply this after toner and before other serums and moisturizer. My concealer goes on much more smoothly and doesn’t sink into those fine lines since I’ve been incorporating this eye cream. Really happy with the results so far and will continue using it. A definite must have GR product!
