A miracle worker! I’m a big fan of AHA products, and Glow recipe products have never disappointed me. It’s a very lightweight gel that gets slacked into your skin very quickly, and you wake up to a visibly clearer skin in the morning. It evens out both color and texture over time. It definitely helped me get rid of some clogged pores! My skin is silky smooth now. It’s also very gentle so it doesn’t dry my skin out. Honestly, can’t recommend it enough! nan
