I love everything Glow Recipe. I’ve had success with all their products and everything smells so good! The plum moisturizer is no exception. Nicely hydrating without being overly heavy for my skin which is normal to combination. I really like that it’s refillable too to reduce packaging waste, and that they use a lot of up cycling in their products. Not only does my skin look good but I can feel good at the same time. I received this in my Trendmood box. Another GR winner
