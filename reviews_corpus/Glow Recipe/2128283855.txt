This serum definitely leaves a nice glow, smoothes the skin. I use it under makeup like a primer and it works well, it doesn’t pill or leave an oily residue at all. My only complaint is that you don’t get much for how expensive it is. I’ll probably re-purchase but just not use it every day. great but pricey
