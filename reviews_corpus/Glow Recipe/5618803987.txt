I absolutely LOVE this cleanser. As someone who is prone to acne and thus uses lots of active ingredients which often leaves my skin overly sensitive or irritated, this face wash is a godsend. It feels incredible the second you put it on - it’s light, smooth, and refreshing. It feels incredible as you massage it into your skin, and it leaves your skin looking so refreshed and cared for when you wash it off! It did not break me out or cause any tingling or discomfort. It’s an amazing face wash! A cleanser that cares for irritated skin!!
