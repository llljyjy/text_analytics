I can’t tell you what this does, what each ingredient does or whatever. But every. single. time. I use this I get compliments, “oh my god your skin looks amazing. I have oily skin, I will say don’t use this if you’re planning on wearing a full face. It’s not a primer nor does it help with oil production. I use this when i’m doing a bare face with a few spots of concealer. Looks amazing Wow
