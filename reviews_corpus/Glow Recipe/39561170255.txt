Please heed my review warning of this wye cream and save yourself from buying  and using the overpriced waste of time product, so just to be clear I actually like a lot of glow recipe products and have several other products I use daily and I really was excited and hopeful that this product would be just as good as the other’s and I did give it more then a fair shot I used for 60days to absolutely zero results/ changes effects for my under eye area have dark circle not to bad but noticeable and some starting fine ish lines and was optimistic about reducing the overall appearance but it really didn’t cut it at all I’ve used drugstore eye creams that are far more effective for so much less  seriously , if u give a product a fair fighting shot and used it 60days you better come out with some results it is annoying whenever a pricey skin care product that promises big things fails you as it’s wasted your time and money and it’s essentially just moisturizer lotion like ,it’s also such small amount of product vs. The $ ,way disappointing  pretty much recommend you skip on this one and or just buy on glow recipe any other wonderful product then with your 2 free samples pick it out and use/ try before an impulse buy if u are still curious or interested in trying product and see for yourself what lame overpriced product this is Warning Warning ineffective over $ with 0 results!
