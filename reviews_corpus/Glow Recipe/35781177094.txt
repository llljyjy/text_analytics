This feels amazing as always I try skincare products for 5 days to give out my honest review, I ended up loving this my face feels so refreshed after adding it on at night and in the morning it feels like I had a mini facial overnight lol. The consistency is more like water based. It absorbs quickly my skin just drinks it . I have bad acne skin and this is just soothing on my acne scars and I wake up with no pimples! It is the best!
