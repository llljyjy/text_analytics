I’ve been using it for 2 weeks, only when I put makeup on to get a glowy look and it works AMAZINGLY! I really liked it and it has a nice watermelon scent to it, if you don’t like scents probably this isn’t the best for you since it does smell quite a bit, I personally like it! The glow is phenomenal and I would definitely buy it again. 10/10 It does give you a glowy healthy plumped look. LUV! Amazing for a glowy look!
