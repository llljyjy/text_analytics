i bought this after seeing it in stores, and since i really enjoy GR’s other products i was very excited! it is a good sunscreen, smells nice and has a good texture plus no whitecast! but, one major issue is the piling of it when i wore it under makeup. no matter what i tried, it did not sit right under it! i’ll just keep using it on no-makeup days from now on. this is probably not great for the frequent makeup wearing person :) good, but with one major issue
