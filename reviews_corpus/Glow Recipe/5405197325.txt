A little does not go a long way with this moisturizer. While I do enjoy the plumping nature from the hyaluronic acid I feel that the consistency of this moisturizer is too thin. You need a good amount to apply to get results. Typically I go through a 1.7 oz moisturizer in 1-2 months... this on the other hand I am finished after two weeks! It isnâ€™t bad, but if the consistency was thicker and more concentrated then this would be my daily go to! Too thin for my dry skin.
