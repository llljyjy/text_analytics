I LOVE this product, it has a very light scent of strawberries not too strong. I have pretty bad scarring and it lightened them up pretty quickly. The texture of the products is like most serums. It absorbs into my skin fast. It fits into my skincare routine seamlessly. I love how it’s almost a 3 in one. I’ve used other acid treatments before for my scarring and this one has worked very quickly. I use this right after I was my face. My skin is glowy and hydrated after using. I love, also I did drop it and it didn’t break so that’s a plus! PERFECT FOR SCARING
