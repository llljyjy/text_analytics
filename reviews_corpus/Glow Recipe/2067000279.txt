I was pleasantly surprised at how well this serum worked. Without make up my cheeks, nose, and chin are slightly pink/red. Using this a few times each night on clean skin and before moisturizer has made a huge difference. I noticed a significant redness reduction after 2+ weeks of consistent use. With cosistency it works!
