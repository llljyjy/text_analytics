Was looking for a somewhat hydrating cleansing balm that wouldn’t leave my skin too striped. I’ve finally found the answer. This balm smells amazing, and leaves my skin so hydrated, yet clean from dirt, oil, sunscreen and even color corrector! This is my new favorite product that I hope will be around for a long time. Beautiful Packaging, Amazing Product
