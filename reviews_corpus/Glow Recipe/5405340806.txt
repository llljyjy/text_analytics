I love the uniqueness of the watermelon scent when applying. It’s a very light scent. It applied easily and it’s actually lighter than most SPF creams. I wear it whenever I go hiking. Fortunately for an every day spf I haven’t used it as much because it makes my combination oily skin greasy through the day. I would love this in a non greasy formula. That would be so awesome! Still great option for the outdoors :) Sweet smell
