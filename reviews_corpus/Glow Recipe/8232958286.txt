First impression it’s very good I love the idea of iterating a current bestseller to make it even better. I love that they found a way to make this product even more innovative. It looks exactly like the old one just with more enhanced ingredients. I will say the scent is a little bit funky it’s mild but it almost was a bit plastic-like. It went on smooth, it felt refreshing & dried down without feeling sticky. I have super sensitive skin and this did not irritate me at all. I will say I think I still like the strawberry serum better- I think it works faster for me, however this is a great addition to my routine and I think that people are going to really like this. Going to be a favorite
