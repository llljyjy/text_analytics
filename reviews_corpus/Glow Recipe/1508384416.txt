I received a gift card to purchase this product.I am really surprised by this moisturizer! Glow Recipe has some hits and misses for me, but this is definitely a hit for my combo skin. The scent is light and does not irritate my skin. It has a gel-cream like texture and does not feel heavy at all. I think this is great for oily-combo skin. I am definitely getting the refill when I run out. Lightweight and moisturizing!
