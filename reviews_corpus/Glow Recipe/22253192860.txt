I’ve been using this serum for the last week and have really been enjoying it. The packaging is so cute. The fragrance is light and not artificial smelling. This doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky. But I DO have a tingling sensation after application that lingers for under 5 minutes. At first I was worried my skin was having a reaction, but I didn’t notice any redness or small bumps. Nothing happens besides the tingling, which eventually fades. But it does happen with every use and Im not sure this is normal cause I haven’t heard anyone else mention that. I felt my skin this morning and it felt sooo smooth.  I’m going to keep using this and expect to see even more results! nan
