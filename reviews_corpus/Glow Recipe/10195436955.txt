Wooow, Glow Recipe has done it again. Starting with the packaging - how adorable is this product? They incorporate the fruits so nicely in the package, it is a great size too.Glow Recipe is really listening to its customers skin concerns and needs. I have been using this serum for the past 2 weeks and it has changed the texture and dark spots on my skin. I love the light airy texture and letâ€™s not forget the light strawberry scent, yuuuuum. The serum soothes the skin without irritating it. I am very hyped about this new launch. Strawberry Dream!
