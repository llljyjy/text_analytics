This product was a free gift. I think this is a decent product but I see glow recipe as being an experience. So for me itâ€™s not just about ingredients but also texture and packaging which are amazing. I do really enjoy the more gentle exfoliants they chose. Overall I really enjoyed the experience of this product. Not my go to exfoliant but great experience
