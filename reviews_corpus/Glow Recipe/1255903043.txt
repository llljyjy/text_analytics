It leaves my face dewy and plump, but it also feels tacky to the touch, even after leaving it on the face for awhile. I would highly recommend using a product after applying this and that tackiness will go away. This is one of the few Glow Recipe products that does not pill with me. Works well with other products. I would not repurchase again only due to the fact that there are other cheaper and better products on the market. nan
