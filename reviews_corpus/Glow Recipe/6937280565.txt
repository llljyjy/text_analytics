After trying a bunch of different BHA toners that were formulated for sensitive skin, this is the first one that doesn’t irritate my skin upon application.  The scent might be a bit much for some, but I don’t mind it. I also like the consistency of this toner.  I will say I have noticed my blackheads don’t seem as prominent even though they are still there.  I have noticed my skin looking clearer. Even though I have combination skin, this toner doesn’t over-dry or irritate my dry zones.  I would say to gradually work up to using it daily if you have sensitive skin or it could  get too intense. Works well on my sensitive combination skin!
