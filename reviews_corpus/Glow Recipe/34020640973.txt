This is one of the best serums I have ever tried! Usually serums will break me out and make my skin very oily. But this does not do that at all! My skin is never oily anymore, it’s plump, glass-skin like, and my acne is gone! Seriously this serum is SOO great! I have oily/combination skin and I was skeptical this product would break me out but this did the complete opposite, it REDUCED my acne/pores by so much that it’s literally crazy; just in 2 weeks! If you’re on the fence about buying this, trust me you need to! It’s worth the price. You only use 2 pumps and make sure you PAT not rub it in. It smells like strawberries as well and has real strawberry extract! It’s full of skin-loving ingredients! AMAZING AMAZING
