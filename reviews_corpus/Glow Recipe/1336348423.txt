I am so excited for this new product, the Strawberry Smooth BHA + AHA Salicylic Acid Serum, that was just released by Glow Recipe!The Glow Recipe Strawberry Smooth BHA + AHA Salicylic Acid Serum comes in their typical glass bottle with pump applicator packaging. This serum promises to help with clarifying and retexturizing the skin with a combination of BHAs and AHAs in the form of salicylic acid and hyaluronic acid.Now, the first thing you notice about the Glow Recipe Strawberry Smooth BHA + AHA Salicylic Acid Serum is the amazing strawberry scent that is light and refreshing as well the texture of the serum! The scent dissipates shortly after application so I wouldnâ€™t think that it would be an issue for scent sensitive people. The serum has a nice consistency that is gel-like making easy to spread and absorbs into the skin nicely without leaving any tackiness or residue. The serum is very hydrating and I could notice an immediate difference in the texture of my skin after the first use because of the amount of hydration. The finer lines seemed to disappear giving me a more youthful look and my skin feels so soft especially the morning after if I use the serum in my evening skincare routine.I would highly recommend the Glow Recipe Strawberry Smooth BHA + AHA Salicylic Acid Serum to anyone especially people that may be combating acne and maturing skin. Another great product from Glow Recipe
