Having extremely oily skin, I had high hopes for this. But it’s not moisturizing at all! After a few days of using it my skin was flaking all over and I’ve never seen it so dry like that before! I’m only giving 2 stars because of the ingredients list, consistency, and packaging, but I can’t see this working as a moisturizer or a serum tbh. I’ll be returning it. nan
