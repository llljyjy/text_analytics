I love how gentle and hydrating this Avocado Ceramide Moisture Barrier Cleanser is! My skin is normal/dry and this cleanser was perfect at removing dirt & makeup without drying my skin out. I liked the amount of lather and there wasn’t any added fragrance or really much in the way of a scent at all, so if you’re someone sensitive to scents, this shouldn’t bother you at all. Hydrating and gentle!
