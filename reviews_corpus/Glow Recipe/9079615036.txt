I was pleasantly surprised at just how much I like this eye gel cream. I have issues with many eye creams not absorbing well and traveling into and burning my eyes.  This gel cream absorbed right in and I didnâ€™t have any issues with it traveling.  It feels lightweight but hydrating and I really appreciate that there is no added fragrance.  The texture is creamy and smooth and it just glides on.  I completely enjoyed this! Absorbs well and doesn't travel into my eyes
