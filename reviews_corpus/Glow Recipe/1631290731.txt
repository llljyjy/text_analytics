I have only used this a handful of times, so please take this review with a grain of salt. This is overall a good SPF. I love that it’s SPF 50. The texture is what you would expect of typical sunscreen (i.e not gel) but not sticky or greasy at all. I have combo skin but dehydrated and my skin is not dry nor is it oily with this. I don’t know why a lot of reviews are having pilling issues. I have worn this with different variations of skin care underneath and no pilling. I don’t wait for my skin care to set before putting this on either. Today I wore it with three serums and a moisturizer and it worked perfectly fine. I would also argue that it’s almost un scented, which I like. Certainly  nowhere near the other watermelon products that glow recipe has. Overall a good product! No pilling here!
