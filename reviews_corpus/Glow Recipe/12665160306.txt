I was using these drops as a moisturizing and it didn’t work for me. It left me a very oily finish which I don’t like. I stop using it. After reading so many great reviews I decided to give it another chance and started using the drops in my skincare routine. I must say, they are magical. Using the correct amount, my skin looks very hydrated with a glowing touch. Also, I am using them for a surgical scar and it has worked so great. My scar looks less swollen, using it daily for over a week. I have read these drops works for acne scars so I am giving it a try with my surgical scar. The drops work awesome as a highlighter, it gives you a natural finish. Magic Drops
