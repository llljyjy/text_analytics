Saw so much people rave about this so I decided to finally try it out. Stuck to my normal cleanser and followed up with this, replacing my previous moisturizer. Two days later, I woke up with all these little buttons on my face which I did not have before, I have oily skin and was therefore intrigued when I saw it was an oil free moisturizer but unfortunately did not lift up to my expectations. For the price, Iâ€™m extremely disappointed and wish I could give this 0 stars Gave me breakouts
