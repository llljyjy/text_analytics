I like the glowy cast it provides but it’s useless if you try to use any toners or serums underneath because it pills like crazy! Also it leaves a bit of a white cast which is not great if you have medium-dark skin. There are better sunscreens on the market like Shiseido or SuperGoop tbh. I will be returning this pills too much — AVOID!
