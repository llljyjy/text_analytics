This stuff was alright. It feels nice, but was a little too lightweight for me and I’ve been breaking out a bunch since using it for a month or so (it might have to do with me switching out cleansers though). I also went through it so quickly I feel like I didn’t really get my moneys worth! meh. overrated?
