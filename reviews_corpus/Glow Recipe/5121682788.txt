This eye cream comes in the cutest little bottle,the texture is smooth and just the right consistency for around the eye area without being too thick or heavy. I like the vitamin c in it and that it didn’t irritate my under eye skin like some eye creams do. Also it’s perfect under concealer. Definitely my go to under eye day cream nan
