I overall liked the mosturizer and it felt very good on my face. It isnâ€™t a heavy mosturizer which I prefer in the mornings under makeup but I would use a heavier mosturizer at night. My biggest complaint with this product is the packaging. The container is SO heavy and is such a pain to travel with that I would end up just taking another mosturizer. The container also looks like it holds so much but the actual pod does not hold that much which feels deceiving. If they had better packaging then I would repurchase, but will be looking for another choice. Good mosturizer, bad packaging
