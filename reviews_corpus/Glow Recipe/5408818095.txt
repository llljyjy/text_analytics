It’s always a treat to open up a Glow package, the packaging is so cute and I live for it. Because this serum contains strawberry, the package is adorned with strawberry images, and the jar itself has a very strawberry feel. As for the serum, I really enjoy it so far. The first use made my skin feel soft on application, it absorbed quickly, and didn’t leave any sticky or greasy residue. After a few uses I noticed a positive change in the look of my skin, my blemishes diminished and my skin looked far less angry than before, it was getting a good dose of hydration for sure. I highly recommend this as an addition to your routine! I love it!
