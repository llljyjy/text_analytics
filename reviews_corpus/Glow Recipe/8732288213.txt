FYI if you haven’t used this product before. Don’t use it if it’s orange/brown. I purchased a refill of the serum since I loved it and when I received it, the color of the product in the bottle was brownish orange. This raised concern because when I used the product before, it was light pink. I reached out to Sephora customer service and they shrugged me off and said it was the normal color of the product. It didn’t seem right so I directly reached out to Glow Recipe. They apologized and told me that the product went bad, and sent me a new one that is just like the product I’m used to. 2 star rating because of Sephora customer service
