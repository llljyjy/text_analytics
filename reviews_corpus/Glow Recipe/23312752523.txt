I am a Glow Recipe lover but I just can’t love this product. After a short while of this being on, it leaves my skin with a really weird texture. Also, I’m a contact wearer, and it always makes them cloud up. I even completely avoid my eye area and it still manages to coat my contacts. Luckily no burning with that. I want to love this product so bad but I just can’t. nan
