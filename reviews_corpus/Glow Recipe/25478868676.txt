I can’t express my love for this product. It’s pricey, but so worth it. With consistent use for a couple weeks, the stuborn blackheads on my nose and chin have disappeared. I never thought “shrinking“ the look of pores was possible, but this proved me wrong... It’s not that the pore shrinks, it just removes all the gunk from them. Doesn’t dry the skin out either. love!!! transformed my skin
