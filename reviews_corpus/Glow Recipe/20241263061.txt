I got this thinking it would leave my skin glowy and dewy, and it does, but for only 20 mins max. It’s a cute bottle and it smells like watermelon but that’s about all I like about it. It’s not really worth the money, you’d be better off getting the saie super glowy gel if you want a real glow. Not worth the money
