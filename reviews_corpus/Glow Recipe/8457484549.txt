The scent is very mild, neutral and almost unnoticeable. Once I added water, it worked well. I feel like it cut through my makeup better than the blueberry bounce cleanser. I always double cleanse with papaya balm and then blueberry bounce, but I felt like this product worked well alone. I did not feel dry following itâ€™s use and we are experiencing cold weather right now! Excellent stand-alone cleanser
