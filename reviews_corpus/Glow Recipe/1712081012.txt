This product claims to brighten, depuff, hydrate and reduce dark circles.  The key ingredients are:- 10% Vitamin C: an antioxidant that helps with anti-aging and brightens skin- Niacinamide:   reduces inflammation, improves redness, brightens skin- Peptides:   improves skin barrier and protects against pollution, UV rays, firms and plumps skinMy thoughts:This new eye cream has a texture that is on the thicker side. I just need to use a small amount and it glides onto my skin. I like how smooth and creamy this feels. Normally I prefer lightweight products but this feels very hydrating and protective for my skin. It absorbs quickly so there is no heavy feeling. I feel an immediate hydration to my delicate eye area as soon as I apply the cream. After using however, I don’t see any improvements with dark circles and depuffing. I use this as the last step of my skincare routine. After cleansing my face, I apply essence water and serum, followed by moisturizer. After moisturizing, I apply the eye cream. It absorbs well allowing me to layer on makeup.I like this eye cream compared to others because it’s thicker, which provides more hydration. It absorbs nicely and does not leaving a greasy feeling. Love the texture
