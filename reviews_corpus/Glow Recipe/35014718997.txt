I liked it for a few months. It had a sorts sticky feeling but i didnâ€™t mind that much. after a couple months i started getting closed comedones on my forehead. I thought it was something else making my skin like that but later I realized that the moisturizer was making my forehead really oily causing all those bumps. nan
