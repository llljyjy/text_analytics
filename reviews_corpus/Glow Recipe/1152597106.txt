This is a winter lip saver.  I searched and tried so many products and home DIY scrubs before buying this.  I used every am and my lips have been so soft with no peeling - all winter - even with running and outside activities.  The watermelon scent is very mild and doesn’t linger.  The ’scrubbies’ in the bullet are not too harsh and don’t stick to your lips.  I will never not have this on hand. New holy grail for soft lips!
