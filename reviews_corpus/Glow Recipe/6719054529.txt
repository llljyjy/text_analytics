This sunscreen feels smooth, lightweight and greasy initially upon application but once the product soaks in, the greasiness goes away. If you blend it too long, it will pill. My skin appeared hydrated and healthy looking all day. I don’t know if it really gave me a glow nor did I feel it evened out my skin tone after using it for a few weeks. There is a slight white cast but it’s not really noticeable. I think it’s pricey for what it has to offer. It’s just okay
