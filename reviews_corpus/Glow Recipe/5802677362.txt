I’m new to the eye cream game, so I’ve been trying different ones. I was very hesitant to try this because of the price point. However, I’m currently on my second bottle and I have to say I do like this. I like the consistency, goes on smooth and feels light. I like the results I can tell the difference the darkness around my eyes has gotten lighter. I’m not a fan of Glow Recipe putting fragrance in their products but this one seems to be scent free. It’s a bit pricey, if your willing to spend the coin I say give it a try. I think a good alternative would be the Inkey list eye brighten eye cream is a decent one especially for the price.  The one thing that is pretty irritating is that one the bottle gets low the product doesn’t come out well. So you’ll have to shake it or scrap it out. Glow Recipe needs to work on the packaging. Pretty Good!
