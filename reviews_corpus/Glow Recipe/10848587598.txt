I’ve used this twice a week and so far I really like it. The texture is like a watery gel cleanser that leaves a nice glossy finish without being sticky. There is a very faint fragrance but almost imperceptible.  I love AHAs but due to my sensitive skin I have to be very careful and have to stay away from harsh formulas. I haven’t experienced any irritation and in the morning my skin looks smooth and glowy. nan
