when I’m reading the reviews and every single review says, “I recieved a gift card to buy a product...“ and it just so happened to be this one and the review just happens to always be glowing and positive (ha).. that sketches me out honestly. a good portion of other reviews say they had breakouts. myself, I got this as a sample and I used it for the first time today and my first impression was that I loved it. I’m looking for a good moisturizer to commit to. I use the biossance repair cream everyday with the squalene gel underneath it on my cheeks only for for a bit of redness. BUT, its pricey. and this has a much more appealing price. but the other reviews definitely have me a bit bothered and I’m so confused now and still I’m unsure how I feel about glow recipe.... first reaction, I love it.. the other reviews tho.
