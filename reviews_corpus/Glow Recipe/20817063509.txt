This is my first glow recipe product and I am impressed! When first applying the serum it is a bit sticky but I do not mind. After applying my skin felt more plump and hydrated (sometimes acid treatments can make my skin feel dry. It layered well with my other skin care products that I currently use.  When I woke up in the morning my skin appeared more smooth and my acne scars were less noticeable as well as my pores. The only con is I am not a fan of scents in my skin care but I will continue to use this product! Blurring Effect
