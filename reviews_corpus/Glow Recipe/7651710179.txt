I used the old formulation in the past which I really enjoyed but I like this new formulation better! It still has that great gel formula but I find it not as sticky as the old version. The only thing is mine doesnâ€™t have that great watermelon smell like the other did but that also could just be my jar. My skin always feels so smooth after use. Love!
