I like how the product looks and goes on my skin. It gives me a very pretty glow and is not drying at all. One thing I can’t get over though is the smell. It isn’t super strong, but it’s not very pleasant either. It kind of reminds me of Elmer’s liquid glue. I swear to god, that’s the first thing I thought of when I smelled the product. I can still smell it even after I blend it in on my face. It’s a shame because I really like the look of this product, but I don’t know if I can stand to have my face smell like glue every single day. I will continue to use this sunscreen until I run out of it, but I don’t know if I’ll be repurchasing. I guess I would recommend you try it if you don’t mind the smell of Elmer’s glue because it does look very pretty on the skin. Love how it looks on my skin, but the smell...
