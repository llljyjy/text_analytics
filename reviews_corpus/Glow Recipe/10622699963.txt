I wanted to like this toner so much! It was hyped so I decided to try it. My skin is very dehydrated and is normal/combo. I hardly ever have reactions to products, save skin redness from chemical exfoliators. Maybe it’s my fault, but any time I use this product, it SEVERELY breaks me out. I last used this at the beginning of the month, stopped around the 13th because the breakouts were so bad, and now (it’s currently the 25th) am still dealing with the lasting damage. It smells amazing though! Not for me sadly
