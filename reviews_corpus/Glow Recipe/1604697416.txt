I love this multi tasking moisturizer! It has niacinamide,  HA and SPF 50 which protects skin from UVB and UVA! It also gives me a dewy, glowy look which I love! It slides easily and it doesnâ€™t leave any white cast or oily-look! It dries up easily which is perfect under makeup. This is my new favorite morning moisturizer! Multitasking Moisturizer
