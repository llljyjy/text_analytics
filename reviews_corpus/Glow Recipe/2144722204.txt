I received two small free samples of this as part of the rollout campaign. I used this cleanser in place of my normal GR Blueberry Bounce Gel Cleanser for about a week and a half and like this one a lot, but would only recommend this as a second cleanser. It does not remove makeup very easily and it doesn’t lather with just water and hands easily either—I needed to use a facial buff sponge to get it to lather richly. It’s quite gentle and hydrating, plus it doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight or dry or dehydrated after air drying, unlike the Blueberry Bounce Gel Cleanser. I have sensitive dry skin and get irritation rather easily, however this cleanser did not leave my face feeling flushed or looking pink like other cleansers typically do. It’s a very solid product, but should really only be used as the 2nd step in a double cleansing routine (if you wear makeup). I’d recommend an oil-based makeup remover for the 1st step if you’re using this as part of a double cleanse skincare routine. Overall, this cleanser is hydrating, gentle, nourishing, and does not leave my skin feeling dehydrated or irritated. It’s not an all-in-one cleanser, but it does minimize discomfort for dry and sensitive  skin types after face washing and I would purchase the full size of this once it’s released. Hydrating, nourishing, and gentle 2nd cleanser
