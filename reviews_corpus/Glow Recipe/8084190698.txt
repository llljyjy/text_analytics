This is a new found holy grail. This cleanser removes makeup  with total ease, while still being very gentle. My first glow product was the sleeping mask and I instantly had to try everything else naturally. Once I discovered this  cleanser I threw out the other brand that I was using. I love this cleanser because it’s gentle, really gets deep into my pores and my skin is left super clean, pores are tight, it’s light weight and it suds up for that deep clean feeling. It also doesn’t break out my sensitive skin. The very light scent smells amazing new holy grail
