It is a super cute packaging and the smell is good but very strong. It makes me concerned about what I am actually putting on my face with all of the synthetic fragrance. It is extremely light weight and makes my skin feel supple only for a couple of hours. I find myself having to use several pumps to get the same results I would with other moisturizers Iâ€™ve tried. frustrating since i just bought it but in a rush to finish and need a lot to make my skin feel supple. I would literally recommend this product based on the smell and lightness alone for a teenager. nan
