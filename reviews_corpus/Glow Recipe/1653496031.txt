I am loving products that have a lack of scent right now! However, a big negative for me is that they list “Fragrance/Parfum” as an ingredient and that is a red flag for me. Overall I think this product is hydrating and helps me wake up with refreshed skin AND glides on very easily. Works well! Not truly clean
