I received this just when acne was showing signs. Started using immediately to see if it could damage control the situation and save me from some scaring since it has Salicylic acid. It didn’t take immediate control but the acne didn’t become absolutely terrible. There is a slight glow after use and I apply sunscreen afterwards. I was using niacinamide during the day before starting this so the results in comparison with have been just okay and not extremely stark. Good but not incredibly strong
