So I’ve been using this product for a week now, so I haven’t noticed a dramatic difference, but there is a difference within the week I have used it! I love how it applies, it goes on smoothly and dries quickly which I love versus other eye creams that are more watery and take forever to dry. It glides on when applying, and I have noticed a difference in my under eyes, they started to get dark when school started as well as having a newborn and being woken up at all hours, this eye cream has definitely brought some life back into my eyes which I’m excited about, will definitely be buying more!! Loving it
