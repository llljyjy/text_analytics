Honestly, I don’t see the hype. It gave me dry patches (and I have naturally oily skin), and made my makeup look horrible. I only used half a pump in the evening. It didn’t do anything for my pores and also made my breakout. It smelled nice so that was a plus. Not worth the $40 imo not worth the price
