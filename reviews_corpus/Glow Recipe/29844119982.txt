I prefer fragrance free for fear of irritation. However this product smells so delicious and doesnâ€™t irritate my skin. Used up in about a month. Will repurchase because I felt as if my skin texture was improving- with the help of other products. Difficult to dispense towards end of bottle. Just turn bottle on head and unscrew repurchasing for maintenance
