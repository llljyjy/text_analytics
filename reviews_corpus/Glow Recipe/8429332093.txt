So I have extremely sensitive combo skin. It typically reacts to fragrances, and recently, after trying 3 other chemical exfoliants, I’ve had had reactions to AHAs (specifically citric acid, I think).I was about to give up on finding a toner because my skin was finally healed after nearly two months of rashes from other products that claimed to be gentle, but I came across this, and with the above of a chat specialist, decided to give this a try.Totally in love. It’s ultra gentle, and even feels hydrating. The event is extremely minimal and fresh, and doesn’t irritate my skin at all. I did have to slowly work this into my routine (I can use it once every 4 days without my skin getting angry), and I only use it at night, but it’s keeping my skin soft and definitely has made a difference in the visibility of my pores. I’m looking forward to the upcoming weeks to see how it affects my hyperpigmentation!If you’re looking for a gentle chemical exfoliants, this one might be for you! Sensitive skin?
