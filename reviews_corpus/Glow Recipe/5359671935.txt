I have been using this product for a week and loving it. I have not had any issues with pilling, was actually surprised to see some comments about that. I love that it leave a really nice glow to the skin and a bit of a tacky feeling to it. I almost feel I can use this as a primer under my makeup. Great product! No pilling issues
