I love this stuff, Glow Recipe’s releases feel like Christmas each time. I used to ignore my eyes mostly but now that I have more things to stress about, my under eye dark circles are becoming ever more prominent. I was very blessed to be able to try this Glow Recipe product prior to its official launch. The formula is incredibly smooth and silky and feels lovely on your skin. Only a little bit is needed so it’ll last you quite awhile and this brand is very affordable for the quality you’re getting. Because of GR’s perfect formulas all of their skincare products tend to have an effect you can see right away. Your eyes will instantly glow. Over time however, it becomes permanent and your dark circles become history. Of course after only a few days my dark circles were gone and I was a brand new woman. I don’t deal with puffiness that much but I’d have faith this would soothe that as well. Thanks for yet another great product!!! Going to stick with this for my eyes from now on. Glow Recipe hits the target yet again.
