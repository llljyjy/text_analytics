I had seen some reviews that talk about the sunscreen pilling but I’ve noticed that sometimes it does but sometimes it doesn’t on me. It seems like it doesn’t pull when I wear the sunscreen on bare skin or wait a long time after applying products before applying sunscreen. If I apply the sunscreen right after moisturizer, it will start pilling. But if I spray a toner or even apply a light layer of some Vaseline, the pilling stops. Also the glow it leaves even after a couple of hours is no joke. That being said it should be so hard to get this product to work for the price point/volume you get. works most of the time—trial and error
