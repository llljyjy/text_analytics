i did really like this one, it gave a really nice glow and i loved how my skin felt. refreshing kinda. smells really good too. buuuut sadly i can’t use it because it’s a bit harsh for my skin. it dried out the areas around my mouth and a bit on my nose… i’m so sad lol maybe not best for sensitive skin
