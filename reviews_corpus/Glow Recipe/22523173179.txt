I’m in love with this hyaluronic acid, it’s the best I’ve tried before, I thought mineral 89 was the best until I discovered this one. Compared to Vichy, the glow recipe leaves me more hydrated and with a sensation as if I had a super soft pillow on my cheeks I do not change it for anything I am already going for the 2 bottle and I do not get tired of acquiring it you definitely have to give it a chance although you must be careful because you will come to love it i use in the morning and the night is very friendly with the skin Must have in the skin care routin morning and nigh
