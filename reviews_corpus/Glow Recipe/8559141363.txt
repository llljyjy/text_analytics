I’ve always had really clear skin until last November (assuming it’s from the masks as I have to continue wearing them) they were just clogging my pores like crazy and nothing I did would really get rid of it much. Suddenly my cheeks, chin and jawline even some of my neck were covered with major acne I’ve never had in my life and they just would not go away until I started using this! I’ve only had it for about a week and used it twice a day with a good moisturizer after and my skin is 90% clear already and almost back to normal as well as my scars I’ve had from previous breakouts are almost gone fully too! A little goes a long way for this product I’m in love with my skin again :) Amazing for stubborn (mask)acne!
