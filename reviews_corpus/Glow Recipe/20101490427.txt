Maybe it’s just me , I hope maybe it’s just that my skin and the product were not compatible, anyways , I am really upset that it took me this long to figure it out . It started in February 2021 when I saw an ad for it and I purchased it for its pore tightening benefits or wtv . A week or two later , I see my skin break out like crazy , and I brush it off , because this isn’t the first time I’ve had a break out . I have a hyperpigmentation problem , but it usually disappeared in 1-2 months (the spots) . They never did . They stayed and accumulated and I got pimples in places that I’ve never had pimples in and dark spots that never left . I blamed the pandemic stress & masks . And mid December 2021 I decided to just stop using my toner and stick to my cleanser and moisturizer. And my hyperpigmentation started fading early Jan 2022 (now) . I know so because I started taking pictures of my profile and face the second I got a break out and hyperpigmentation due to the product. I took them every few months or so and I took them again today and I went back and compared to see what I did differently and it is all adding up . I don’t know . If the product doesn’t seem to like you at first, maybe it’s a sign & im just a fool. First pic is feb 2021 when I first started noticing & second pic is dec 2021 a week or two before I decided to stop using it. + it didn’t do anything special to my pores , I just kept on using it because I wanted a toner. This product messed my skin up for around a year
