I’ve been using this sunscreen for about a week now and it honestly has become a huge part of my daily skin care. I have extremely dry skin and really look for something that gives me a natural looking glow, especially when I don’t wear makeup. This SPF not only gives me that glow but doesn’t feel too heavy like a typical sunscreen. I will say the initial smell is so so good but after a few minutes it does have a more potent sunscreen smell. Super glowy skin!!
