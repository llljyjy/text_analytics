I normally hate wearing spf, I know I need to but it always feels so thick and heavy on my skin but this one is amazing. I’ve been wearing it every day for over a month now and it feels a little bit hydrating and really lightweight, I don’t notice it at all after it absorbs and there isn’t any white cast! Cannot recommend enough New favorite spf!!
