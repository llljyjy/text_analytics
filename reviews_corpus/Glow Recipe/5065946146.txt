While I love all Glow products, this one may be my all-time favorite! First off, the scent is amazing! It is a light sweet strawberry, like the first hints of summer, not too strong and very natural. In the first few days it cleared up the active breakouts I had and I have noticed significantly less popup since using it regularly. My skin seems more smooth and even, with fewer dark spots and even a little dewy. As a result, I have even been wearing little to no foundation! This product is not sticky, absorbs well, was gentle enough to use twice a day, and made my skin so soft. I would highly recommend adding it to your skincare lineup.
