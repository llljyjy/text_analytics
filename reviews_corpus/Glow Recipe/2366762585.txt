Been using this cream daily since Feb 2022. I have dry, sensitive acne rosacea skin and this really helped to keep my skin moisturized and it doesn’t burn or irritate my skin unlike the avocado recovery serum and watermelon moisturizer from Glow Recipe (still test with a small amount if you’re trying for the first time and have rosacea/sensitive skin and maybe avoid during active flares since there’s a bit of fragrance). A little goes a long way and it spreads pretty nicely, so it’s not horrible for the price if you get the refill pods. I probably would not recommend this if you have oily skin since it might feel a little heavy, but for dry skin it feels silky smooth and not greasy. love this for dry skin + safe for rosacea so far
