Wasn’t sure what to expect out of this product since I’m VERY picky about sunscreens. But I was blown away - I will continue to buy this product. It goes on so smooth and doesn’t leave me feeling oily at all! I have tried it alone and under makeup (if wearing under your makeup I would suggest allowing plenty of time to dry). Love this and it smells fabulous!! NEW FAV SPF
