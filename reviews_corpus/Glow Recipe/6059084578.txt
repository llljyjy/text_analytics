Leaves your skin super glowy in the morning! The scent is nice but not as over powering as some of the other GR products. Super easy to apply to the skin with minimal effort in the morning (it just soaks in and you donâ€™t need to rinse it off after a certain amount of time.) I definitely feel like it makes my skin feel more plump and hydrated and this will be a must-have as we get closer to the winter months. Super hydrating!!!
