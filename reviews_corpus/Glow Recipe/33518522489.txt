I really wanted to love this. It feels nice on the skin and isn’t greasy. I love the added skin benefits. But, even when I try to blend it into my skin very gently it pills like crazy. I don’t even have dry skin either. There’s no way I would wear this under makeup. I might be returning. :/ pills pretty badly
