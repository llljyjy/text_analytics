I’ve never really been a toner person, I always found them too drying but this one has changed my mind! I apply it with my hands, it’s not as watery as other toners it’s thicker and that’s one of the things I love! I have noticed my pores have gotten smaller and my face feels tighter and with a healthy glow! Definitely a staple in my skincare routine. Great toner!
