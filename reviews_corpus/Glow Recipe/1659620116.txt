Surprisingly impressed by this moisturizer. It checks off all the boxes for my dehydrated acne prone skin this winter: super hydrating without being greasy/heavy, makes my skin glow, and hasnâ€™t broken me out. I really am SHOCKED by the effectiveness of Glow Recipe products. This moisturizer + the Watermelon Glow PHA Toner are quickly becoming my holy grails, and I will gladly repurchase them over and over again! SO good and smells heavenly
