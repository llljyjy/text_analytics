I had no idea Glow recipe was discontinuing it’s OG formula sleeping mask to a new ‘nighttreatment’ until I ran out and had to buy more. I strongly believe if it isn’t broken..why try fixing it?! I absolutely loved the sleeping mask formula. This one, not so much. The lovely watermelon scent is gone, this smells like plastic. Also it doesn’t apply the same or dry like the other one did. This new one also gave me a burning sensation. I am hoping they are listening to the reviews and will go back to the OG formula. FYI I  have eczema and this worked so well on my skin. It’s too bad this doesn’t work for me anymore. I truly have no idea what I’ll use now. Not a good change!
