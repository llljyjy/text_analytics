I am absolutely in love with this new product from Glow Recipe. First of all, I love their watermelon product line. Second, I love a good SPF product. This creme feels lightweight on my skin and doesnâ€™t feel greasy. Also, there is a light watermelon scent without an overpowering sunscreen scent. I will be adding this product to my daily skincare routine for sun protection. Beautiful product! Wonderful Sunscreen!
