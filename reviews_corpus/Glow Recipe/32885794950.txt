I’ve been using this eye cream/gel for a few weeks now and I’m so happy to share that it’s one of the best undereye products I’ve ever used. It smells great, over the time I’ve used it it’s brightened my undereye area and lessened my dark eyes, even when I haven’t had a good amount of sleep you can’t really tell because of how effective it’s been in waking my face up, giving it brightness and being so easy to apply. It layers great under my makeup without creasing or causing fine lines, it’s been my daily go to for skincare in both the AM & PM, it gives the perfect amount of hydration that I need. Highly recommend Can’t live without it!
