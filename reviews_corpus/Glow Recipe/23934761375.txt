It smells artificial but I liked it. It does moisturize a little but I rather use facial oil if I’m continue using this. I used half of it and gave it to my friend. She liked the smell and how it works but said she wouldn’t buy another one after finishing the first one. Nice bottle and yum smell, but it wasn’t my favorite to use as a moisturizer. It's Okay
