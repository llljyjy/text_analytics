Holy hydration! I am in love with this new formulation. In my nighttime routine I like to cleanse with glow recipes blueberry cleanser then follow with the watermelon toner and finish with this. The texture is really interesting but feels really nice, silky smooth while applying on the skin. I like to pat it in until it absorbs fully and it helps to keep my evening skin care routine simple but also effective. In the morning after waking up, I found that my skin already looked visibly plump, hydrated, and so much softer. Not only does it smell amazing but it does amazing things for my skin too! My skin needed this!
