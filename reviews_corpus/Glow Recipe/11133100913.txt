This product has almost exact color and texture to their discontinued watermelon glow drops. I am disappointed that it had no watermelon scent. I love scented facial products. The next morning my face looks brighter. I almost look more awake, I should say. My skin looks plump and hydrated which is always a plus. I have dry skin and this product makes me look and feel hydrated in the morning. Over all this is a nice product to have. nan
