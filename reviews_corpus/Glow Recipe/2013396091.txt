This mask is awesome! I never tried the original but I heard it pills, this formula is perfection. It’s a very lightweight, almost serum-y texture that’s easy to apply so a little goes a long way. Also has a light, naturally-derived watermelon scent that smells amazing. It sinks right into my skin without a greasy feeling yet makes me look dewy and moisturized. The very first time I used this in my evening routine I saw results the next morning; my skin was glowing, smoother, and still hydrated! I’ll be using this a few times a week for sure! nan
