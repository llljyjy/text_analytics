I’ve never used a retinol before; I purchased this just because I ran out of my previous eye cream and love Glow Recipe’s other products. I will say, if you’re someone who’s never used a retinol, definitely pay attention to how you use it. I did not start slow, I jumped right in by using this every night and that caused some breakouts. Now that I’m on a schedule and actually following the product directions, I love this stuff! I really can see a difference in my under eye lines. The skin around my eyes looks smoother and brighter. Another win for Glow Recipe :) Really nice surprise
