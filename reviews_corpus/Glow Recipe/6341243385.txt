Living in one of the sunniest states and on high altitude, sunscreen is always a must, and I am always looking for a very good one. I was so excited about this Glow one! It does hydrate, it boosts glow, it protects my skin from harm. Very easy to apply, skin feels and looks better right away. And is protected. nan
