I have dull and stressed eyes after long day of work. This eye cream has everything that I was looking for. Texture is thick soft milky cream and it absorbed quickly into the skin. Formula with Vitamin C and niacinamide blend with peptides works great. My around eyes skin feels soft and hydrated. Dark circles and puffiness reduced. Very good eye cream
