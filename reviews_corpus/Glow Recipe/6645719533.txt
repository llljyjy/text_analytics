So I felt the need to write a review for this because I am seeing so many people have mixed feelings about it. Just to give an idea I am very fair with dry skin. After reading reviews/watching videos I was so worried this would pill on my skin! I have that issue A LOT with products so I was super worried. However it wasn’t an issue for me AT ALL.Their are so many creams, eye creams, makeup products, etc that I do not use because they pill. But this gave me no issues. Didn’t cause me to breakout. It has a light nice watermelon scent, and it gives an incredible glow to the skin. I use an oil infused moisturizer from Estée Lauder and I apply a little amount right after and it blends in smoothly. I’m curious how much others are using to cause the product to pill. However even I can tell it has a slight whitecast which is why I’m giving one less star. Guess it’s hit or miss? But I will and would repurchase. does have slight white cast - didn’t pill FOR ME
