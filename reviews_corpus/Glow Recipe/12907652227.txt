This product is literally a GAME CHANGER. No seriously, it makes me so excited to do my skincare in the morning. I have always been bad about adding sunscreen to my skincare routine because I always felt like it was too heavy and clogged up my skin. This sunscreen is great because it feels like skincare and not just a heavy sun screen. Also, I loved the smell of it...its super subtle but a hint of watermelon. My new fav!
