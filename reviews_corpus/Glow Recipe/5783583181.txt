I am a bit fan of Glow Recipe so normally I got really excited for this new product. The Watermelon Glow AHA Night Treatment comes is an aesthetically pleasing glass jar and it smells absolutely delicious. The texture is very lightweight, almost runny. I usually apply it as the last step on my nightly skincare routine and it feels really good, like a comfy blanket over my face. I like waking up with a hydrated, smoother and brighter skin. Itâ€™s a win for me! A WIN for me!
