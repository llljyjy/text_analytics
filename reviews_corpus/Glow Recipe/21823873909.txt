This eye gel feels more like a serum to me - it feels really hydrating and silky going on. I saw an immediate reduction in puffiness and an overall improvement to the eye area. My eyes look less tired and brighter. I’ll see if there are any further improvements over time. This is a new daily addition to my beauty routine.I’m using this for two weeks straight and I can see the difference at how dewey the skin looks around eyes.Love the lightweight texture. it actually bright up my under eye area!
