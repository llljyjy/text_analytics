Comes in an amazing/aesthetic glass container. This toner has a really interesting texture which feels nice on the skin - almost like a viscous water. Does have a light scent (watermelon-ish), although this fades after application.It leaves your skin looking dewy and hydrated. I find that it does leave my skin with a slightly tacky feeling. But after moisturizing, I don’t notice this anymore. Although it is a great product, I do have other favorite toners. Would recommend if the price point isn’t a barrier. Great, hydrating toner
