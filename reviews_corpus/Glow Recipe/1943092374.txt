I love eye creams in a pump over a jar so that was an immediate win. I also have super sensitive eyes that tend to water or sting when I wear eye cream but I’ve been testing this one for weeks now and haven’t had any issues! My under eye area is noticeably more hydrated and plump, and I am hoping to see the brightening soon nan
