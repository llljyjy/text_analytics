This is a great product for oily/combo skin and those with large pores. Steam your face for 3-5 minutes (no need to spend $$ on facial steamers- a boiling pot of water on the stove is just as great) and use this immediately after steaming and watch your pores disappear. I have spent $$$ getting hydra facials etc on the regular and this method has by far been the best for my enlarged pores. Skin is extremely smooth and glowing right after! Amazing Product
