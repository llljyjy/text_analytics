I am so excited that Glow Recipe has a new eye product. I suffer from milia outbreaks under my eyes, and the Avocado cream causes several bumps to pop up.  I really love the texture of this, and how it has brightened up my undereye area. I feel like this serum is the eye product Iâ€™ve been searching for! in love!
