I have so many favorites from Glow Recipe so I was excited to try it out. Itâ€™s a nice, thinner texture that absorbs quickly but still feels very hydrating. Sits well under makeup and plays nicely with all my other skincare. I can sometimes be a little sensitive to vitamin C but no issues after 10ish days of wear. Really Nice!
