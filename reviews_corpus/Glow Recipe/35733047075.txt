this can be expensive if you’re a broke student like me, but my god, is it worth it. i’m on my first bottle right now and i’m absolutely in love. i actually got it for free because my aunt bought it after seeing it on tik tok but never used it, so she gave it to me. otherwise i probably would’ve never bought it due to being poor. but now that i’ve tried it, i will definitely be getting it again. even after just the first time using it, i noticed an instant glow. ive been using it for about a month now and i get the same glow every time i use it. it’s definitely made my pores smaller and it’s made my skin so plump and healthy looking. i love using this in the morning, it feels so great on my skin and instantly feels refreshing as soon as i apply it. i’ve seen some people saying they don’t like the smell in other reviews, but personally i think it’s nice. it just smells like watermelon, which makes it feel even more refreshing to me :) this is just a god tier product honestly 1000/10 literally my one reason to get up in the morning
