I have been using this, one pump AM/PM for about 3 weeks.  This is a nice serum.  I enjoy the scent and how it feels on my skin.  My skin is looking more even toned.  The “shine“ it gives you only lasts about an hour, and it looks the same as rubbing a bit of cheap hair gel on the skin.  Based on the reviews, I was expecting something really spectacular. This is a nice niacinamide serum and I enjoy it, but I’m going to investigate some less expensive niacinamide serums as I purchased this for the “instant glow“ and it doesn’t deliver on that front.  Pictured are two swatches.  The one on the left is cheap hair gel, the one on the right is the Watermelon Dew Drops. Instant Glow???...Meh. Nice Long Term Results
