Another favorite from Glow Recipe! The smell is amazing!!!! I regularly use different acids in my skin care routine, whether it be in a toner or a serum form. One thing that stood out to me about this product is that unlike other acid products, my skin did not feel dry at all. In fact, when I woke up the next day after using it, my skin looked plump and hydrated. I do struggle with skin texture, and this made a huge difference in a single use! I am definitely going to use this product again, and I would not say it is for daily use but 2-3x a week would be perfect! Instantly smooth, plump skin!!
