I use so many of the Glow Recipe products and was hoping this would come thru like the Dew Drops, Toner and Hyaluronic Moisturizer. This is absolute garbage though. I’m always buying new facial SPFs thru here or snag them when they’re offered in the promos or reward bazaar. This one pills so badly and also leaves a terrible white cast. I have a daily morning and nighttime skincare routine as well to maintain the best hydration for my face as well so I doubt it’s anything I did that would have caused this product to flake off my skin the way it did. Do not bother with this. Nope!
