This layers amazingly with my routine of toner, essence, and moisturizer. It feels like it makes the hydrated feeling last even longer, and my face was so soft when waking up like it never has been before. I love how silky smooth this is, and it feels lightweight. It absorbs easily, and doesnâ€™t feel sticky or tacky during the night which was a big concern for me. I absolutely love this addition to my routine! nan
