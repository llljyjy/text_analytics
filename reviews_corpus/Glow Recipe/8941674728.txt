This is a very innovative product. I love exfoliating twice a week and this is the perfect addition.This is an overnight mask that I like to use on its own, after I do my whole night time skincare routine and right before I go to bed. It does not pill and layers well on top of other products even when I apply it close to the rest of my skincare routine. It does not irritate my skin and it gives me an instant glow, and I notice brighter skin by the morning, and even brighter after using it over time.The texture is almost a gel that also feels very refreshing on the skin and not sticky at all.I like to use this on my face and neck twice a week the night before retinol night. Also the packaging is very cute and I love to display it in my vanity. It also looks sturdy and well made. Great overnight mask for glowing skin
