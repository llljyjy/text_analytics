I’ve been trying this sunscreen for a couple days and I love the way it feels on the skin. It’s lightweight and hydrating and doesn’t make me breakout. I have acne prone skin and I have had no bad reaction. It blends effortlessly and has a subtle smell. It’s almost like the Dew Drops had a baby with sunscreen haha This is definitely going to be my new fave! Your new favorite SPF!
