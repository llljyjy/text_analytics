3 bottles deep! Bought this to try something new after my skin finally seemed to balance more normal/combo. I had been using Ole Henricksen oil toner for quite awhile for my stubborn acne (which worked great btw) and wow was I impressed! I don’t know how something could be do hydrating yet not make me oily. I slather this all over my face, neck and chest and it really it feels so nice! Dries fast and it’s not sticky or irritating which is also a plus for my eczema prone skin. More Please!
