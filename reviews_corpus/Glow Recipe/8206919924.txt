As a retinol user, with combo/ acne prone skin, sunscreen (that doesn’t break me out is crucial for me) is crucial for me.Initial thoughts: I hate thick sunscreen. This one blended out so nicely and gives a nice glow without the oily feeling. I do recommend moisturizing beforehand, as it works well with a moisturizer. you can tell that the sunscreen is a mix of chemical and physical but the blend is so lightweight, it doesn’t create a problem for me.after a week: It hasn’t irritated my skin, or broken me out. I like how the sunscreen wears and preps my skin for make up. I feel the effects of the hyaluronic acid. Niiaciamide tends to irritate my skin but this formula has not given me any problems. Not sure how high the percentage of niacinamide is, so maybe that’s why. my only bone to pick it that you need to use a moisturizer before this product, and give it enough to time to absorb into the skin or else it will pill. Overall, I do think this will be my go to summer sunscreen. good summer everyday sunscreen
