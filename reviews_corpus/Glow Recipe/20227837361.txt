sadly had to return this :( it pilled on me so badly. giving 3 stars because it was perfect to me in every other way. smells great, nice texture, beautiful finish. but no matter what i did, it pilled. i even tried patting it in instead of swiping with no success. was super bummed because i love glow recipe! nan
