This AHA recipe really made my skin glow! The packaging is just gorgeous in my opinion. It has a slight watermelon scent. The texture of the product is a little heavier than a serum.  I followed the directions and applied this as a last step to my night routine. I woke up with extra soft glowing skin. Will continue using this. nan
