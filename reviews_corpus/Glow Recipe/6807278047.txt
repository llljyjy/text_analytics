Tried these as a part of the “fruit minis” set & really like it. Anything to give my dull skin a bit of glow (haha). It’s subtle, & I noticed more of a consistent glow after a week or so of using (even had compliments on how good my skin was looking). I feel like it’s something you have to be consistent with in order to get that nice glow. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was its texture, felt a little gel-like & sticky on the skin & needs to be followed up by a moisturizer or else my face felt a bit stiff. nan
