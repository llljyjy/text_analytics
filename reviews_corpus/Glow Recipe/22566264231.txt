Unfortunately I had to return this. I was so excited when I saw GR was coming out with a sunscreen and truly thought it would be great but, it did pill on me a bit and I let every layer of my skincare routine absorb. Also I really didn’t like the finish, it’s very float which is great but it also looks too oily for my preference. I do hope GR will take in to account the reviews and come out with a different sunscreen in the future though. A mineral avocado one perhaps?!? Not for me.
