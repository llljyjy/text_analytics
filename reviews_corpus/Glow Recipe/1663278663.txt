Ok, so I don’t use this as a moisturizer and I don’t believe it has the qualities that make it one. I use this as a pre-moisturizer hydrator. After applying potent active serums I will re-dampen my face and apply two-three pumps of this product. It’s spreadability is beautiful as is the absorption. I feel like it is a great added step before applying a true moisturizer. I could see those with any skin type feeling like this is inadequate as a moisturizer but when used as I mentioned I feel like it could benefit many skincare routines. NOT A MOISTURIZER
