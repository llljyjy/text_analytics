I’d like to start off by saying I have sensitive skin and I’m just plain out picky about my skin care products. I got this as a sample. I saw some improvement with one use from that sample. I figured that it might be the sample but I figured I’d buy a small bottle and really test it. Just purchased the 5.07 oz bottle and this will forever be in my daily skin care arsenal. If you’re thinking about it just jump on it. buy it.
