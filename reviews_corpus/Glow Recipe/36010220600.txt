This product truly works wonders. I’d heard about glow recipe for a very long time and this was my first time trying one of their products. When I woke up after using this product my skin was SO SOFT. I could definitely see a glow and my skin felt so hydrated and moisturized. When I put my make up on it practically glided like I was painting. Definitely one of my favorite products I’ve ever tried! My skin felt firmer which is another benefit of using this product. I couldn’t recommend it enough! So soft!
