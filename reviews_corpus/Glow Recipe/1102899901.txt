Ok so here’s the deal-this is good for your skin and a glow IF BIG IF you aren’t part of the minority like me that breaks out using Niacinamide. I cannot use this ingredient no matter what formula it is in. But if you can use it with no problem, then this is great at achieving a nice glow and dewy look. It also helps clear the skin-again ONLY AIF YOU CAN USE IT. ITs great-just not for ME
