The serum is a nice thicker consistency like the other GR serums and has a light, slightly fruity scent similar to the guava serum. It absorbs quickly and is very easy to use with other products. I received it to test for 2 weeks before release - I did experience a small amount of purging on my cheeks but that’s not unexpected. I used it 2x a day and did not experience any discomfort, it is a very gentle formula. It makes your skin feel incredibly soft and helped control oil in my T zone. The only downside was that it made my pores on my cheeks and nose look very dark, but I stopped using my retinol for those two weeks as we didn’t know exactly what the ingredient profile was when testing and I didn’t want to over exfoliate. Knowing now, the ingredient profile is great and I do think it is gentle enough to use with your ret unless you have very sensitive skin. Overall I like the serum and will be picking it up when I restock my GR. nan
