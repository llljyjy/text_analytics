I had used the old version of this and was happy to try the new one this time around! The packaging and overall feel is similar - cute glass jar, mild but noticeable watermelon scent, a refreshing jelly texture that absorbs easily with just a little stickiness. This overnight treatment feels gentle but also effective at helping me wake up with slightly more plumped and hydrated skin. I used it as the last step in my night routine as directed and it didnâ€™t pill over my other products. No irritation in the morning, just soft and hydrated skin! I will continue to use this every few nights when I need an extra boost of gentle exfoliation and moisture - definitely a good summer mask! Cute and pleasant mask
