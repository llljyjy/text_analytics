I am absolutely in love with glow recipe! I am a big fan of watermelon & this overnight mask is the perfect final step to your skincare routine to wake up to hydrated skin.   I layer this as a final step of my skincare routine at night. The gel texture is this beautiful light pink. I place a generous amount all over my face. When I wake up I notice my skin very hydrated and smooth. I started using this product while I was on vacation and it kept my skin glowy after long days spent at the beach. This product is different than other masks- I love how it melts into the skin, the light watermelon scent, and how luxurious the packaging is. I love how well this mask layers over all of my other skincare products- I feel like it locks them all in and the hyaluronic acid keeps my skin hydrated throughout the night. My skin feels hydrated, glowy, and smooth. I have been using it every night & love how I have incorporated into my nightly routine. You will love this overnight mask. Wake up to glowy skin!
