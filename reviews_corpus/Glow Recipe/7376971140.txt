I was a little disappointed in this product because it didnâ€™t smell like watermelon just like sunscreen. I think it would be fine for a no makeup day but my makeup did not wear well throughout the day with this underneath. If you like glowy makeup this may work well for you but I like a matte finish and my face kept getting oily throughout the day with this under my makeup. nan
