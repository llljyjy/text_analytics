I have oily, acne prone skin and am always looking for a good salicylic serum to help reduce sebum build-up in my pore. Have been using this serum for a few days now. I like that this serum is lightweight. It has a sweet scent but doesnâ€™t bother me. I used this after toner and essence, before moisturizer. It layers well with other products in my routine. Upon application, I feel my skin is hydrated. I think it will take another week or two to see other noticeable results, but so far so good, my skin is hydrated and no irritation or breakouts.
