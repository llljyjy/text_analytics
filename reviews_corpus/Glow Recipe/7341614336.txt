I love this balm. It removes all my makeup/sunscreen and it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. My skin is so glowly since using this product! Iâ€™m on my third tub - new holy grail!I will mention that when using this as a first step in a double cleanse you need to follow up with a gentle cleanser. My sensitive skin became irritated when I paired this with a deep cleanser. All Time Favourite Cleansing Balm!
