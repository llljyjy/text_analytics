I have been loving Glow Recipe products so much. This new eye gel cream also did not disappoint me.  The texture itself is smooth and easy to blend without a thick finish and doesnâ€™t feel tacky. I love how light weight it is. oks better. After a week of using it, I feel like my undereyes look smoother and brighter. The key to make this work is consistency. nan
