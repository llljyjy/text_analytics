3 years was worth the wait! This collection of products just got an even better addition, and I am so honored to have been gifted this product by the brand to test its functionality. I love the creamy texture which is very lightweight on the skin. It also does not feel greasy or like itâ€™s clogging my pores yet moisturizing. The moisture leaves a glow which is also ideal for me personally. As a dark skinned woman, it was also important to me that this SPF left NO white cast - this SPF passed that test! The product blended into clean and moisturized skin seamlessly leaving a smooth finish. I am rating it a 10/10 as the price point, amount of product, and ingredient list really prove to be top notch in performance. Worth the Wait! Stunning Performance!
