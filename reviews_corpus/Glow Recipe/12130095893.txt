There’s a lot of “glowing” reviews on here for this sunscreen but they all received the product for free. Here’s my opinion: this is the worst glow recipe product, and I’ve tried them all. Like some reviewers mention, the pilling makes it nearly impossible to wear throughout the day. I pat it on like recommended, never rubbing, and the pilling has happened every day for about 8 days since I’ve been using it. Forget makeup; it’s just not a viable option if you’re out and about all day. I love the concept but the product doesn’t match up to the marketing and hype. Sadly, this was not a win. Worst glow recipe product?
