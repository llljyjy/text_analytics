I LOVE THIS!!! It is so gentle and feels incredibly hydrating. When I rinse my face with water in the morning, it feels so soft and like all of the dead skin has been sloughed away and it looks brighter/more glowy. I would wholeheartedly recommend this for anyone that wants to exfoliate but is very cautious about using exfoliants that are too harsh! Also, it isn’t really sticky which is a huge bonus. I use this 2-3 times/week and it’s made a very big difference! must-have!
