There’s no doubt about it that this product gives you a glow and its packaging is cute but I don’t think that the price is justified. You can find cheaper niacinamide and hydrating products. The smell is nice at first but eventually you get used to it so that doesn’t matter much to me. It was also really hard to get the last of the product out of the bottle. I don’t see myself repurchasing because of the price. nan
