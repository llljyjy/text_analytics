I’m amazed. Another great product from glow recipe. I work 12 hour shifts and noticed how dull and tired my skin looks especially around the eye area. This guava brightening serum made the surrounding skin around my eyes look brighter. It has a creamy/milky texture. Easy to apply. Blends easily with my other serum. It’s non-irritating, lightweight and non-sticky formula. It made my eyes look fresh and rejuvenated. I love that this recipe is vegan and clean. This will be part of my daily routine. I highly recommend it! Must-have in your skin care regimen!
