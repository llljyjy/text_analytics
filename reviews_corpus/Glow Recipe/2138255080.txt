I was very excited to try this and feel like it lived up to my expectations. The texture is very light, absorbs easily, and there is no white cast. It’s also hydrating without being dewy. I don’t find the scent too overpowering and I don’t notice it lingering throughout the day. I haven’t had any issues with the product pilling either, as many others seem to have issues with. I’ve had a little bit of stinging in one of my eyes, but I don’t know of a chemical sunscreen that doesn’t do that to me. All in all, a great SPF product. Of course, I only wish it more affordable or that they come out with a value size at some point. nan
