Only had to use such a small amount and lathered up very well and covered the whole face. Texture was smooth and creamy. Absolutely left my skin feeling smooth and looking refreshed. Skin felt so hydrated after washing. Smell was nice and not too much, just a natural scent which I love for the face. It took makeup off so easily. After a little over a week of use, I feel like my skin looks radiant and healthy. I am in love with the whole line of Glow Recipe and knew this product would be awesome! Hydrating and great for winter skin!
