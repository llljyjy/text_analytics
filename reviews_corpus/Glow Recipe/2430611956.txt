I was so disappointed cause I love anything glow recipe. Especially the watermelon line. The mist and Pink Juice moisturizer are holy grails for me so I had that expectation. Anyways it could have just been not for my skin.. It “sat” on my skin all day. And not in the sticky/tacky kind of way, it dried down but I could feel a film/layer on my skin all day. I don’t wear makeup so I can’t say anything about how it does with that. It only took one day of wear for me to know I had to return. It does leave a nice glow. But it did not really absorb and feel the way I like it to. It felt like a very thin layer of glue dried down on my face… sadly. really not for me :(
