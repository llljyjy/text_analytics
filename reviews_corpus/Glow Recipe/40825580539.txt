Cleansers are not a part of my skin care routine because of how harsh and stripping they are. I was fortunate enough to be on the tester panel for Glow Recipe’s Avocado Ceramide Moisture Barrier Cleanser and I’m so happy that I was selected! This is the cleanser we all needed but didn’t know could exist. It’s silky, not super lathery, provides good coverage with just a little bit of product, and seriously leaves my skin feeling softer and more moisturized after I rinse. I was shocked given my previous experience with cleansers in the past. The Avocado Cleanser didn’t leave my skin feeling tight or dry at all, quite the opposite. My opinion has completely changed. Not surprised that Glow Recipe achieved this feat… their line in incredible! Softening Moisturizing Cleanser ~ A First!
