I found the best way to apply this is right after your skincare routine and moisturizer. Don’t wait because then it will pill. I also use the glow drops before my moisturizer and I feel this helps. Don’t wait to apply this like you would a primer. I loved this at first but then my makeup started pilling so bad I was trying to figure out what was going on. Well I was waiting to apply this as a primer and it just doesn’t work as one. It’s definitely a skincare product. I will not be repurchasing because of this issue, but I know others have the same issue so maybe try to use it right after your moisturizer and see if that helps. nan
