I am really enjoying the new Watermelon Glow AHA Night Treatment.  The old watermelon sleeping mask did not work well with my skin, but the reformulation is incredible!  It has a nice consistency that applies easily to the skin.  It is very lightweight and I honestly wake up to a bright, glowing complexion! nan
