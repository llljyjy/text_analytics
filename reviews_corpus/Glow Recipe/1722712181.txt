Unfortunately, after a few uses, I have decided to return this. I feel this formulation was likely rushed and is a miss for Glow Recipe.The smell is unpleasant. There’s a light watermelon scent mixed with a strong chemical sunscreen odor, and something about the two just don’t go together and it smells sour and just off. Thankfully, the scent fades quickly. Each time I used this, I used it over my standard skincare routine of Vitamin C, Glow Recipe Avocado serum, and Glow Recipe Plum Plump moisturizer.My biggest gripe with this sunscreen is that it looks GODAWFUL under makeup. It causes pilling sometimes, and also sometimes causes my pores to look full of white gunk. The last time I used it, it was sitting on top of my skin in weird white patches, and when I tried to apply makeup over it, it was streaky and just awful. So awful that I had to wash it all off my face and start new, which I have never had to do.There are so many other sunscreens on the market that are not as expensive, not fragranced, and won’t cause issues under makeup. Glow Recipe missed the bar with this one. A miss; problematic under makeup
