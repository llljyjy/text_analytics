I love everything about this sunscreen! The brand Glow Recipe has easily become one of my favourites, and this sunscreen did not disappoint! I’ve seen a few reviews regarding the sunscreen pilling under makeup. I haven’t had that issue, however I use this sunscreen as a moisturizer as well as I find my skin doesn’t need the extra moisture doing the summer. nan
