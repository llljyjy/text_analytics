I am a skincare freak and this is now my staple moisturizer!!! My skin is very very sensitive, uneven and combination. I don’t usually have breakouts but if I get it rated look out! This is a wonderful moisturizer, it’s light, dewy and feels like silk! Worth every penny, I plan on trying to dew drops next Must have for sensitive, uneven and combo skin
