I am loving the aesthetic and vibe off this product. complimentary from Glow Recipe. Especially. the fact that it is pink! And the product feels so light weight and non-greasy. I was looking for a sunscreen, since summer and spring is rolling around. I am so excited to use this product! Love how pretty it looks!
