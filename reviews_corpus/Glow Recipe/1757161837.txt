Pros - The texture is nice, it goes on smooth, not too thick, and the smell is pleasant. Good ingredients.Cons- I found it a little too sticky and a with a slight white cast, and I tried 3 different foundations and it piled up for all three (even letting it dry for 10 min). For reference, I am pale with dry skin. Tip- Mixed it with a drop of the watermelon glow toner and it went on better. SuperGoop is still my regular but this one has fantastic ingredients and a nice watermelon smell(if you like that sort of thing). Nice SPF, could be better
