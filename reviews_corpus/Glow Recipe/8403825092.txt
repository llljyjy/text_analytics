I wanted to love this product SO bad but it just didn’t sit well with my oily skin. I started to look more greasy than glowy after being out for just a few hours, especially under makeup. It also didn’t mix very well with my other skin care products because it started to peel off my face when I would apply it - even after giving everything time to absorb into my skin.If you have oily skin but sunscreen is the only step in your morning skin care routine, I’d say go for it! I do like this if I just need a sunscreen for being outside in the sun all day (Like at the beach or something); this just wasn’t the best for my every-day use. I didn’t notice any white cast, it didn’t burn around my eyes, and it was moisturizing enough to skip my moisturizer in the morning. Not the Best for Oily Skin
