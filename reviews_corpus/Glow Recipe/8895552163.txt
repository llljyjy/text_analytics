I like the consistency of the sunscreen, I have combination/dry skin and it had a glowy finish. I liked the shine it left on my skin, but bare in mind, it does take a few mins to sink in. It leaves a slight white cast initially but it disappears after 15 mins. It does have that weird watermelon sunscreen smell but it wasn’t too overpowering imo and it does fade after a while. It doesn’t peel at all for me so yay! Lastly, this DOES NOT pass the eye sting test so beware of your eyes when applying. Overall, I think it’s a good sunscreen. It’s not exceptional, but it’s good enough for me to keep using it and finish it up. I guess I’m slightly disappointed because I was excited to try it and had high hopes, but it’s just okay. It’s good, not exceptional
