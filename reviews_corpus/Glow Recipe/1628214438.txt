This was my first time trying out this product by Glow Recipe and I am incredibly happy with the results. I did see a huge difference with my skin texture, as I suffer a lot from having huge pores. This moisturizer evened out my skin texture & gives me that extra glow!! Love to wear this under my “no makeup” makeup look, because it amplifies my natural glowing skin. I am usually sensitive to many skin care products, but this one was just fine!The best party is the packaging too as it brings a refillable jar pouch and it can be easily replaced for your next replenishment. Holy grail item!
