Got this as a sample. It was the best hydrating face cream for my skin that last all day. I used a after toner, serums, and sunscreen. I found that when applied before color correcting and base, my skin looked healthy and not cakey. My makeup doesn’t look as good as without this cream. I recommend for anyone 40+. It didn’t notice any tacky feeling. That could be because I apply my other skin products before this cream. I would rebuy. great for mature skin 40+
