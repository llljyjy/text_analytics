As someone with very dry skin in the winter and dry-combo in the summer this is THE BEST moisturizer. For some reason I tend to hate those moisturizers that feel like slippery or oily on the skin. This product is fenomenal not only it absorbs on your skin so fast, but it leaves it so hydrated and glowy. I usually use it before going to sleep and I wake up with a soft and glowy skin! What I love about it the most is that sometimes a pimple or two are coming out, I put this moisturizer on and next morning theyâ€™re gone!!! Anyways, really recommend this moisturizer for dry and sensitive skin! Dry skin Favorite
