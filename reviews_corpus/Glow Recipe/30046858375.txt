First of all , wow ! The smell of this sunscreen is so fresh - like watermelons, very Y2K and I love it . Itâ€™s so hard to find a good sunscreen for my brown skin that does not leave a white or greasy cast . This one is like magic , spf 50 and blends immediately. Great lightweight sunscreen for daily use Lovely lightweight sunscreen
