I initially resisted trying this product because of the higher price point. But, after many months of being intrigued by all the hype, I finally caved and bought it. I had been using The Ordinary’s niacinamide. I loved the formula and the results I got with it, but unfortunately the “pilling” was pretty bad. I have very oily skin, and this formula is a HARD PASS for me! It’s so sticky and tacky, and it never fully absorbs into my skin… even overnight. Also, I don’t see any dewiness at all… it just leaves my skin looking more oily than normal, no matter how much or little I use. I really wanted to love it, but it’s a big “no” for me! Very disappointed in a WAY OVERHYPED product! VERY DISAPPOINTED!
