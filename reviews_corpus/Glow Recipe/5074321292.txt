There is definitely a learning curve with this sunscreen because otherwise it WILL pill. I’ve learned that for me, I can only use toner, essence and maybe a very light serum before applying this sunscreen. I can’t use a moisturizer because I find that it always pills. Also, you have to work fast with this product! That is KEY. If you’re used to working in your sunscreen until the cast disappears, you CANNOT do that with this one. I try working it in evenly really quickly, when it’s still liquid on my face and then I stop. You will have a very light white cast, but just give it a few minutes and the sunscreen will set in. Now for formula, it’s definitely on the thicker side. I have oily to combo skin and I can say that I feel it being sticky and it gives me more of a dewier look that I would want. I’m currently using this only for my first application of the day and use another sunscreen to reapply throughout the day. If I reapply this  more than once, I look like a grease ball. I would not recommend this sunscreen for people with oily skin, there are definitely better options and some less expensive. I’m sorry Glow Recipe I love your products, but this one is just not for me!!! :( I wanted to like this, I really did…
