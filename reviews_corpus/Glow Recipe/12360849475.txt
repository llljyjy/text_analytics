Oh man, I never thought I would say this but: I’m a part of the Glow Recipe fam! If your like me, you’ve been reading reviews Forever contemplating should I buy this? After using this product for a couple days now I have to say: add it cart! I’m blessed with oily skin and I was skeptical on how long it would hold my oil production at bay, needless to say, it did a great job, probably one of the best I’ve tried thus far. If you have combo/oily skin, you owe it to yourself to try this. Is it worth the $$?? Yes it IS.
