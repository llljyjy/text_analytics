I received this product for free from Glow Recipe, and let me say this product came for me when I needed it! I have bad under-eye circles, and it’s been an insecurity of mine recently. I’ve used this product for about a week, and it’s greatly improved my dark circles. It’s smooth on the area around your eyes and feels extremely hydrating. Whenever I go to apply my makeup, especially my concealer, it no longer cracks or cakes. I’ll continue to use this product to see how much it improves my dark circles! nan
