I swear I cannot get enough of this brand! They have been in a roll with their recent releases and this product did not disappoint. The jar is beautiful, the scent is light and fresh and the product itself is so nice. Lightweight and not as thick as I was expecting. It feels so soft going on and rubs in nicely. It has an almost watery feel to it and leaves my skin feeling so soft and crisp. I feel like since using it my skin has had an overall better texture so Iâ€™m going to keep on using it! Another 5 Star Glow Product!
