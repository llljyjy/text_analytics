Iâ€™m still adjusting to using this am and pm. It comes in a bottle shaped like nail polish. But as someone else mentioned, it smells like cucumber and goes on like aloe. I would compare it to Clinique Moisture Surge but without the glow.  Again I need to give the product a few more days to see if I notice a change in skin. cute packaging
