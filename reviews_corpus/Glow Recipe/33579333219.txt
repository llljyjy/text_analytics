For the high price and high standard of the brand, this cleanser is really disappointing. It smells like an artificial shower gel, and stings like soap if it goes in your eyes. I got some in my mouth and the taste was literally soap. It was not drying and did take my makeup off, but something just feels off with how soapy it is, especially for a cleanser. I found this to be really enflaming to my rosacea and not at all on par with the rest of Glow Recipeâ€™s other amazing products. You can get way gentler cleansers for a lot cheaper than this. Soapy and disappointing
