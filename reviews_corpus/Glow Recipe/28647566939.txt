Was excited and wanted to love but…Day 1: followed directions and videos online from GR and used over skincare, letting each step set/dry. As I was applying the sunscreen, it was pilling immediately, everywhere. Day 2: followed directions but this time without daily skincare, again pilled everywhere. I did some troubleshooting on the pilling that GR posted, to apply more in those areas, this did not help, but just pilled more. So sad, love all of their products. I see what they did here with this product, they needed it in their range of products but this one just isn’t for me. I’m sure it will work for others, but if you’re struggling with pilling, you’re not alone with this one. Pilling Nightmare-BUMMER!
