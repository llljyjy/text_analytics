This is really really good. I just finished the bottle. I noticed my dark spots slightly lightened and it did seem to smooth my skin. Compared to Paula’s choice this is not as intense but more hydrating. It is more effective then glow recipes pineapple vitamin c and Sunday Riley’s vitamin c. I have dry skin and this was not drying at all. Paulas choice was effective but drying and irritated my skin. I use one pump in the morning and it has lasted me months. It does not pill. I am not repurchasing as I want to try new things, but I think I will come back to this. it works!
