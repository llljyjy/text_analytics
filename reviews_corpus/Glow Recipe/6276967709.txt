I used their previous watermelon overnight mask and loved it, so I was very eager to try this one. When I used it for the first time, it felt very hydrating and moisturizing. I woke up the next morning and my skin was very bright and glowing. Would recommend this to anyone interested Beautiful, glowing skin!
