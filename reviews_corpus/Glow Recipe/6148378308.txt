I love everything I’ve tried from glow recipe and I understand the hype. I got this because I have rosacea and it doesn’t get rid of it permanently but it does helps cooling off the redness on my skin. It doesn’t go away immediately but like in a hour  or next day, there is no redness on my cheeks. I have not tried any product that does this to my skin. Will definitely keep repurchasing! <3 have rosacea?
