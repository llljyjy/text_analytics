I went into using this serum with high hopes. Other reviews claim that the serum helps with pore size, dark spots, skin texture, and discoloration. Unfortunately, I did not see any difference in my skin! I just finished the bottle, but I won’t purchase it again. I’m disappointed because I’ve been on the hunt for BHA + AHA Salicylic products to help tackle my skin issues, but this one just didn’t do it for me. Oh well! Won't be purchasing again
