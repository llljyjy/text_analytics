I have used lots of acid treatments before, but this one has really helped my congested skin! Although my skin did purge with a few blemishes, my skin was super glowy afterwards! The texture is very nice -- not sticky or tacky at all! It also never dried my skin out, and kept it super hydrated while also really improving the texture of my skin! Would definitely recommend! nan
