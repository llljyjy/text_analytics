I love this balm. I have used many balm cleansers. Many are too oily and many are just cream made into a balm consistency. But I persisted in looking for that ideal consistency and results. Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet is it!! I am 70 and have taken excellent care of my skin, but aging is a continuous battle. Cleansing with this balm at night leaves my skin soft and refreshed with no residue but nicely hydrated. I highly recommend this Papaya Sorbet especially for mature skin but also for dry skin. I love it. Best Balm clenaser I have used!!
