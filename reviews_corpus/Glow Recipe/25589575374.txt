Obsessed with this product! My skin’s never looked so good after using products with acids until I tried this product. The texture is super light and didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy and the results were just outstanding. Skin looked a lot more hydrated, dry patches disappeared and blemishes started to fade after the third use. Highly recommend nan
