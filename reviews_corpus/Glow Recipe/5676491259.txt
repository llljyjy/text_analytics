I absolutely LOVED this serum! Not only did I love the overall cute packaging of a glass strawberry, but the scent and formula as well. I feel like my skin absorbed this really well and did not feel any irritation. What I liked the most about this was that it didn’t have any sticky residue whatsoever. The scent isn’t a weird sugary smell like most strawberry scented products out there.  This serum  really soothed and hydrated my skin pretty well! nan
