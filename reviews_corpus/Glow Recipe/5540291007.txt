I have sensitive skin, so finding a sunscreen that doesn’t break me out has been hard but I think I finally found it! It makes my skin super glowy and dewy, while protecting my skin throughout the day. I wear this whether I’m inside or outside (because UV rays can be everywhere at any time!) and no breakouts so far- thankfully! I totally recommend this for any of you who have sensitive skin and are looking for a great sunscreen! My new go to sunscreen!
