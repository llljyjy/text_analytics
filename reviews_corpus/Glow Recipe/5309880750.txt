The first few days I was using this, I though “holy cow this is unlike any eye cream I’ve used! I see the difference already!” After a week or two, it didn’t really do much anymore. It doesn’t disrupt my undereye makeup though! And as you put it on, it just glides on your skin. The tube is really annoying because it’s hard to get the product out and for $40…this is REALLY small. It’s Like All The Other Ones
