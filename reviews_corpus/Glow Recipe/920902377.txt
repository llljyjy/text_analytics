Great serum for the price. It gives you a burst of hydration without stickiness. I especially love the bottle and packaging. The bottle has a nice shape and weight  to it. It’s sturdy so it won’t knock over easily and the pump distributes the perfect amount. Definitely recommend. Hydrates with effective packaging
