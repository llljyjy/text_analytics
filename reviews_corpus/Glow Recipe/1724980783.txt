I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review.  This has officially become my new favorite moisturizer!! I own and love many of the products the Glow Recipe makes, so I’m not surprised that I ended up loving this, as well!  First off, the packaging is gorgeous and sustainable with a removable and replaceable pod that you can replace without having to buy an entire new pot! So clever!  The product itself is heavenly; the texture is bouncy and silky and my skin felt so refreshed and hydrated after using it everyday!  It has an interesting cooling effect that I really appreciated and also does well under makeup.  All in all, I’m a huge fan and will definitely be re-buying when the time comes! Highly recommend! My new favorite moisturizer!!
