The first thing that I noticed and loved about this product was the consistency the texture of it it was so light we I was confused at first but it’s just that good. The hydration is amazing it doesn’t feel sticky it does it feel like you put anything on your skin. In the morning a skin looks amazingly hydrated. I can’t wait to see how my skin looks in eight weeks especially the dark marks that I have currently I’m excited
