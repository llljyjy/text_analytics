Perfect for my combo skin! I use the watermelon toner before this and then the moisturizer and it sinks in so well, has helped with redness and hydrated my skin without looking one bit oily ! So glad I bought this ! If you have drier skin this can definitely be a serum but for my oily skin with dry areas it works so well for me! I do use a thicker cream at night but for day this is amazing nan
