I definitely woke up with smoother, softer and super hydrated skin. My face looked and felt fresh, brighter and supple. I love the bouncy gel formula that sinks in effortlessly. My skin drank up the mask, it absorbed really nicely and didn’t feel sticky or tacky. I didn’t get a chance to try the original but really enjoy this new and improved version, totally get the hype! It smells really nice, not too strong and the smell doesn’t linger. I’m planning on using it a couple times a week during my nighttime skincare routine. Glow Up!
