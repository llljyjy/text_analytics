This is an amazing product If you want fresh and glowing skin the next morning. love this mask firstly because of texture, it’s gel-like and extremely lightweight. It’s gentle, has never broken me out. I use it once a week as an overnight treatment and wash it off the next morning and my skin is soft and glowing. It smells amazing. I think it should have an applicator spoon or dropper or something to apply. nan
