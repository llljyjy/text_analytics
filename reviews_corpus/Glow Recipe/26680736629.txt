A Sephora worked recommended this for me when I grabbed the watermelon oil free moisturizer and said this one was even better, and recomended for all skin types. My skin is oily, (not too oily  though) and it never seemed to absorb into my skin, it sat on top of my face in a layer that I felt, and it was really uncomfortable/greasy. I wiped all my skincare off underneath and then reapplied and I got the same affect. I tried applying makeup and it all pilled, and in the places it didn’t pull my makeup slid off my face. Returned this as soon as I could. I really wanted to like this product especially because of the refillable pod option. But it just didn’t work for me. not for oily skin
