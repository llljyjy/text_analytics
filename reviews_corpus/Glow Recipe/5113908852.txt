I have major problems with big pores, and my skin is fairly oily. Also very sensitive. This product smells great, and has an interest, serum-like consistency. Doesn’t burn or irritate my skin at all. BUT I don’t really think it did anything. Nothing at all for my pores, didn’t improve my skin texture or hydration etc. Mostly just smells nice. Bought it as part of a set, probably won’t re-buy. Meh.
