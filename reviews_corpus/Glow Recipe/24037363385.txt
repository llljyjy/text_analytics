I’ve really been loving this new eye cream from Glow Recipe! It feels soft and hydrating on the skin and absorbs nicely without pilling or leaving a tacky feeling. The pump bottle allows me to dispense the perfect amount. This product has been improving the darkness and fine lines around my eyes so far, and most importantly it doesn’t irritate my eyes. I definitely recommend it! nan
