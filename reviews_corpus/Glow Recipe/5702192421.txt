First off, this product smells wonderful! Think watermelon jolly rancher, YUM! I was a bit worried about using this mask because the original one I tried pilled all over my face and pillowcase! Luckily, this one didnâ€™t do anything like that. It makes my skin supple and glowy the next day without any irritation. There is a slight tackiness right after applying this but it goes away within a few minutes. Glowy and Supple Skin!
