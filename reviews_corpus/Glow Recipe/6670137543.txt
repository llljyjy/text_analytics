I’ve been using this for 15 days, 3x a week. I don’t struggle with acne so that’s not why I got it.I got it to unclog my pore, exfoliate & help with my blackheads, I can definitely see that’s my pores don’t look as big/clogged as they use to & my blackheads have gone down a lot. I would definitely recommend if you have sensitive skin (or if you’re unsure of how resilient your skin is) using this x2 a week, only “issue“ I noticed is my first use my forehead got a lil red but that only lasted about 5-10 minutes. It spreads easily & for me, 2 pumps is enough for my face. I also really love the smell too! Loving it so far!
