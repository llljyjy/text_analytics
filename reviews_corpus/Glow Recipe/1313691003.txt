This is a must have staple for me now. I saw immediate, as in the first application and within minutes results of hydration and plumping of my facial skin and providing an immediate more youthful look.  I can have sensitive skin and have had no issues with this product.  I did not give the product 5 stars, despite such great results, for 3 reasons.  First, for a strictly hylaluronic acid serum the price is a bit high. Second, the bottle is a bit misleading because the product does not go all the way to the bottom of the container as you may think looking at the picture. Third, the pump can be finicky at times especially when you are lower on product.  I want to point out points of improvement, but seriously overall the product itself does not disappoint if you are looking to add more hydration to your face. Must Have, Immediate Results
