I’m in love with this entire product line. I started off using their Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Dew Drops, and I loved it so much that When I started having a breakout from my medicine being adjusted I went and bought their Glow Recipe Strawberry Smooth BHA + AHA Salicylic Acid Serum to help clear up my skin and I was using the both of those for a month and realized that I needed some help with my moisture barrier so I went and ordered this too! It works perfectly with my beauty routine. And since I have combination skin finding the right beauty routine has been tough but thankfully I found the glow recipes and they have been a big help with my daily skincare. ❤️don’t know how I lived without this before❤️
