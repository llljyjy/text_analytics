The texture of the aha night treatment is quite runny compared to the previous version of this sleeping mask. The finish right after application feels slightly wet. But surprisingly the product absorbs well and my skin has a matter finish without a greasy residue. I was impressed that my skin didnâ€™t feel tight or dry. The aha night treatment is also very gentle and great to start with if introducing active for the first time. Matter finish, no greasy residue
