I have dry skin and usually when I use sunscreen it tends to either be too oily and break me out or too dry and clings to certain dry patch areas even with moisturizer, but with this product it has worked great with my skin and I haven’t had any issues like that. I find this sunscreen is very light and doesn’t leave a white cast at all which is nice, and it definitely gives you an immediate glow. You don`t need to use a whole lot of this product so it last a long time. If you were wondering about the smell, it does still smell like regular sunscreen to me, but personally I don`t mind that.
