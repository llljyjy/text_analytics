I was skeptical about double cleansing with a cleansing balm as I used to use micellar water as my first cleanse when I was wearing makeup. However I started double cleansing with balms and I immediately noticed a reduction in congestion. I use this cleansing balm first, rubbing gently for about 60-80 seconds to (very) mildly exfoliate especially around the nose and T-zone area followed up by the YTTP Superfood cleanser or Inkey List Salicylic Acid cleanser. My skin is completely smooth and bump-free and I would largely contribute this to this cleansing balm! I used to only use the Farmacy one but I feel like the Glow Recipe one generally works better for facial massage and emulsion. Amazing product. Listen when they say to double cleanse!!
