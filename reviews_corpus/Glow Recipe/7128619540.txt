I guess this would be good if you have dry skin. I’m combo and this made me look so greasy. I like a glow but this was a bit much. I’ll stick w my Dr. Jart Every Sunday SPF 50+. ALSO, this left a very uncomfortable thick-like, grippy/sticky feeling to my face that didn’t diminish. This is supposed to be a lightweight cream.  I had to wash this off my hands due to the residue it left. It pilled like crazy too. You can’t mess w it once it’s blended in due to the pilling. It was fine w makeup over it but I got really greasy fast. I will be returning this and just sticking w what works for me and my skin. 1 star for price 1 for recyclable material. NOT FOR ME……
