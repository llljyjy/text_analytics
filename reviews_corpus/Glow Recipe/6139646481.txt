I have been using this a couple times under my makeup and i can tell a difference every single time I use it and when I donâ€™t! It keeps my under eyes very hydrated and keeps my concealer from creasing! Also I love the smell! 10/10 would definitely recommend to someone with dry under eyes or even to just to brighten the eyes up a bit more! New staple!
