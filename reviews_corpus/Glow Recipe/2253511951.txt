If you are looking for any type of serious hydration and moisture, skip this! I don’t think this is suitable for any skin type except the oiliest…even then, you could do better. There’s nothing special about this moisturizer whatsoever.It does not plump, it does not hydrate, my skin feels desert dry just minutes after application. Maybe if you have super oily skin?
