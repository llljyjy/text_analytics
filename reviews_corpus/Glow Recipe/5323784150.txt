I was looking for a product to help lighten a few dark spots I have, used this consistently for about a month, and I really didn’t see much results. It helped my overall complexion look healthy and a little more even, but didn’t help my dark spots at all. I’ll try and finish the bottle, but probably won’t repurchase it. its okay
