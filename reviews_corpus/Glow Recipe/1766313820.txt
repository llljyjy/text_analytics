I’ve only every written “glow“ing reviews for all of GR’s products, but not all products within a line will be perfect and this one falls short.  I received a sample of the new sunscreen for an incentivized review with much excitement, but only to find this product “pilled“ upon every application attempt.  I tried different skincare products, GR specific products, waiting for each layer to completely dry, and even on clean bare skin with no success.  I’ve been very puzzled by the conflicting reviews and wonder if there are issues between production batches.  I also noticed in video promotions and with other influencers’ videos, they do not spend much time rubbing in the product which makes me question effective application and true honest reviews (are people hiding the pilling issue?).  I also saw the GR video promotion of reapplying sunscreen by lighting tapping a beauty blender...this is concerning to see since this will add very little protection.  Even the regular promo videos use very little product.  This is misleading to consumers about proper sunscreen use and protection to prevent skin cancer....just overall disappointed.  I will continue to buy my favorite products (Blueberry cleanser, Papaya balm, Pink Juice and Plum moisturizer, mist, and toner) and try new ones in the future.  I’ve been a long time fan of the company back to the K-beauty curation days, but I feel like they are missing the mark big-time on this one.  I hope they can take this feedback and help improve their product and information around sunscreen application. Disappointed...
