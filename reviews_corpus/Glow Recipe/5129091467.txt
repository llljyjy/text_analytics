I was so excited with Glow Recipe made an SPF (finally!) and then read the reviews that other people were experiencing pilling and felt my heart sink. But, I still tried it and... no pilling! So it might be a case-by-case basis, and I got lucky. Who knows!Pros: smells delicious, very hydrating, helps with glow. Works as my final moisturizer *and* SPF - replaces Dew Drops, Pink Juice, and a sunscreen. Perfect for no-makeup days where I want to smear it on and go. I also like that I’ll be able to get every last drop out of the packaging.Cons: the price - you can get a good 50ml K-Beauty SPF for a lot less. I wish it was 2x this size, it won’t last as long as I’d like. Has a tiny bit of flashback, which isn’t a problem on my pale skin but definitely could be a dealbreaker for the melanin-blessed folks.I will probably alternate this with my more affordable K-Beauty SPF to make it last longer, using this for no-makeup days where I just want to *glow*!
