Okay, why does it have to smell so good!? That means nothing for performance, but I enjoy it :). It is lighter and thinner than a traditional eye cream so itâ€™s great for summer. It soaks in quickly and has a bit of almost shimmering brightness to blur dark circles.  Complimentary from Glow Recipe. thin, but mighty :)
