Gifted by glow recipe. Nice sunscreen. Very lightweight, has a watermelon fruity fragrance. Gives a glowy finish and absorbs well. However I have a oily skin and I feel like this didn’t sit well on my face. It made my face more oilier and didn’t work well with makeup either. I only recommend this sunscreen to dry or normal skin types. Good for dry & normal skin
