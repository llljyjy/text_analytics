I never got a chance to try the OG watermelon cream, but this one is pretty nice. This is a resurfacing treatment that contains 2.5% AHA complex (a blend of glycolic and lactic acid), hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, quinoa peptides, and watermelon enzymes. A little goes a long way and I use it in place of my moisturizer. I currently use vitamin C and tretinoin in my skincare routine, so I used it on a night where I didn’t use any actives. The next morning my skin felt pretty nice and moisturized. What impressed me the most was the lack of any peeling, dryness or redness that can occur when I use anything with glycolic acid in it. Super happy with this. I’ve only used it about 3 times and I always make sure it’s on a night with no other actives in my routine. I think this could work for sensitive skin types but make sure to patch test. Really loving this and might repurchase if I don’t have any future skin issues. Great resurfacing treatment
