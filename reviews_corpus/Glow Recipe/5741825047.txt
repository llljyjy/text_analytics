I’m a fan of Glow Recipe and was super excited to try this product. I use this mask every other day when I’m not using retinol. I use this at night as the last step of my pm routine and wake up to hydrated and brighter skin. After a few days of use i feel like some acne scars are fading.  I haven’t tried the previous version of this mask but I would recommend this one. New addition to my pm routine
