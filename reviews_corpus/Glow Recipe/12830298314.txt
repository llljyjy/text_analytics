I honestly have the hardest time finding a good sunscreen because I have oily skin and most make my skin feel greasy and leaves a white residue! Especially if I decided to put makeup on that day. THIS ONE DOES NOT!! It smells amazing, gives you a nice dewy glow, and does not make my face feel weighed down with oils. Once I pat it in and let it absorb the white cast goes away and I can start applying my makeup with no problem. A MUST HAVE!!!
