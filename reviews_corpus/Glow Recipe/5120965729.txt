This eye cream is a winner. It has a lightweight texture yet it is highly moisturizing. It does not pill on the skin so I can use concealer if I want to, so it does play well with make up.The bottle is absolutely charming that it comes in and itâ€™s a nice pump. My skin under my eyes feel very hydrated pumped up and refreshed nan
