I love this serum! It really is a powerhouse for my acne-prone/scarred face. I’ve almost used one entire bottle and I have noticed a subtle improvement in my skin’s texture. I prefer this over the popular niacinamide dew drops because it still creates a beautiful glow on my skin while treating it to some amazing ingredients. I also feel that it leaves my face less sticky. I definitely recommend! My only gripe would be that if I use two pumps per use and use twice per day, I feel like the bottle disappears way too quickly for $40. Beautiful Glow With Added Benefits
