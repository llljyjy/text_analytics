First two weeks I loved the way it felt on my skin . Application was not a lot- just enough to moisturize.Come to the third week I started noticing a few bumps on my face then it progressed to a small sting and leaving redness. I stopped using it and my skin felt dryer. I did keep in consideration that the temperature did change within the weeks I was using it , but it has left my skin with texture . Wouldnâ€™t recommend for cold weather . nan
