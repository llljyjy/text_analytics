am a skincare enthusiastâ€¦And let me tell you that glow recipe did it again. I love that this product is a 2.5 percent AHA. I think we are so accustomed to strong exfoliants. I experience no irritation. The product is so light weight and a small amount goes a long way. I woke up the next morning and not only was my skin hydrated but glowy as well. I love it. Love
