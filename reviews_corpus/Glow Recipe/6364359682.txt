I am a huge fan of Glow Recipe products so it was super excited to try this one. First, the smell is amazing. Not too overpowering or super sweet.  This is not sticky on the skin and sinks in quickly. I apply it in the am and makeup sits great on it  The packaging perfect, makes it easy to pump with one hand. Another favorite!
