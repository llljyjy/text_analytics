I have noticed for a while now that my face breaks out every time I fly somewhere . After trying this toner I noticed within days my face cleared out and it usually takes weeks for my sensitive skin. I love how hydrated and fresh my face feels after using it.  I’ve tried toners before that completely dried my face and was definitely not a fan of it. This watermelon glow smells soo good. I love the Glow Recipe products so much . I would recommend this toner to anyone who’s dealing with dry skin Amazing Toner
