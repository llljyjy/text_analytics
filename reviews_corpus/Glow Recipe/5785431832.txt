I love the way this sunscreen feels and it has such a beautiful glow but it pilled like CRAZY. I had so many pilling pieces on my skin, especially in the forehead and temple area. It was so unpleasant every time I touched my face to see and feel pilled skincare so I returned it. There are much better sunscreens on the market. pills like crazy
