TIP for application: I apply my toner to my face, let that dry, then I apply the sunscreen using the two finger method and finally I put my moisturizer and eye cream on. This avoids pilling! I really love this sunscreen, it truly makes me excited to put it on! I love niacinamide and I am so happy it is in this product. The texture is lovely and my face looks beautiful after applying it, no white cast whatsoever and it blends like a dream! I must admit, it does have a little bit of an oily residue afterwards, but it doesnâ€™t feel heavy or uncomfortable like other sunscreens. Beautiful sunscreen
