I have dry skin and after using Glow recipes Hyaluronic Cream it left my skin feeling refreshed, super hydrated and my skin had a hydrated glow look to it. My skin stayed hydrated throughout the day! It absorbs into the skin quickly. The cream feels like it melts into your skin. I definitely recommend to everyone! This is my favorite moisturizer to keep my skin hydrated and looking great! I love that itâ€™s refillable for less waste! Amazing moisturizer
