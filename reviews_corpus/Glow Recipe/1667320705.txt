What a treat for my skin!  I’ve loved the OG watermelon mask and was so sad to hear it was being discontinued. But, it’s back and better than ever. It still has the lovely jelly texture and refreshing fragrance. It feels amazing when I apply it to my skin at night. This is and always will be a staple in my routine! nan
