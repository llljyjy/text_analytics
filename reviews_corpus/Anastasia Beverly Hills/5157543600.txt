I have combo/oily skin. I added this to my regimen in the morning, before final moisturizer and makeup. And it has been amazing!!! It doesn’t break me out, or add to my oil. In fact it helps control my oil. Doesn’t take a lot to work. Also, I use it to help me do liner from eye shadow. I drop a little onto my makeup tray and dip my angled brush in it then the shadow. Got that from a beauty influencer, don’t remember who. best face oil
