I love a good acid toner and this one is gentle enough where my skin isn’t peeling or flaking and also feels nice and hydrated after. My skin’s texture has improved and breakouts aren’t as bad during that time of the month. Overall, my skin tone is more even and blemish free. However, a huge drawback is the menthol. It is so strong and harsh it burns my eyes and there is an initial discomfort while applying because it’s just that strong. I wish they would reformulate without the menthol. Would be 5 stars otherwise. Hope they reformulate without menthol
