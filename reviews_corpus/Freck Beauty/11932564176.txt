This is hands down my favorite moisturizer. I am on my 5th tube of it and it stays consistent. I have acne prone skin and can breakout super easily but never have broke out from this. It’s super thick without it being too oily as I have oily skin. It’s amazing for winter and summer weather! I highly recommend this product! Also - a little goes a long way! Holy grail moisturizer
