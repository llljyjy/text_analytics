All I can say about this stuff is….wow. I am SO amazed by how well this lactic acid toner worked for me. I’ve only used it twice and my face is SMOOTH. I struggle with acne and dark marks, and I woke up this morning so happy with the way my face glowed. If this stuff works as well it does I really want to try more of the Freck line! SO impressed. AMAZING TONER!!!
