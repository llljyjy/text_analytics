I was very excited to receive this toner because Iâ€™ve always been curious about freck. for starters, I was completely surprised at how gentle the toner was, considering that it has lactic acid in it. It is very lightweight (quite literally like water) and provides a beautiful glow. I love the way it made my skin feel and look after applying (glowy and refreshed). nan
