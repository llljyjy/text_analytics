This toner has its ups and downs and overall it is a good toner to gently exfoliate and balance the skin. Pros: has lactic acid to help reduce pigmentation and pores on skin. The glass bottle is heavy HEAVY and the luxurious glass makes it a perfect product for the shelf. The opening is just small enough to have product come out without spilling it everywhere! Freck describes this as water and it is exactly that! It absorbs right into the skin and dries down without drying the skin. Cons: WHEW the reviews do not lie this is a hard to open cap for this toner! It took me a while to open this container. This toner is exactly the same consistency as water BUT it has a tingly sensation when applied and at first it was a warning for me that this product was not for me but after a few more times using this product I enjoyed the tingling sensation it gave. Overall thoughts: this a toner that I will leave on my shelf and will continue to grab it when I need a gentle exfoliation from time to time. I did see results from the several times I used it. It is not a great WOW product and I think I will have to continue to use it to really have a concrete opinion on this toner. nan
