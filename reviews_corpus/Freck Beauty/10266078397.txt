This toner worked about the same for me as other toners do. For some reason that I’ve never been able to figure out, toners have a tendency to leave my skin feeling sticky/tacky afterwards, whether I moisturize or use other products after or not. I’ve been searching for one that doesn’t feel tacky afterwards for a while now, and bought this to see if it would work. I wish they offered a smaller sample size, because now it’s too late for me to return it (I wanted to test it for over a month to see if I would adapt. I didn’t.) Now I just have a ridiculous amount of toner left that I don’t really like, and probably won’t use, so it’s a waste of both product and money. If I had liked it, the size of the bottle would have been a great deal, because it’s very large.If you usually react well to toners, this will probably work for you. It just wasn’t right for me, and I’m still searching for something that is. Not for me
