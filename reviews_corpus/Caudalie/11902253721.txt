I am so surprised that this actually worked on my skin! I have very strange combination skin that goes through phases of being super oily and then super dry. This saved me during a particularly bad dry phase, but surprisingly still works when my skin is normal. My skin has even gotten less oily since Iâ€™ve started using this! nan
