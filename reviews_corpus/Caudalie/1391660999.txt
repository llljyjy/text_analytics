Love, love this product!! I’m not much of a heavy makeup wearer anymore. I’m only using a daily SPF AND tinted moisturizer and this elixir. It gives me such a nice glow that last me for the most part of my day. It’s not irritating and has a fresh like scent. I’m on my second bottle and will keep on repurchasing . Do you want to glow?
