I have been using this for a few weeks now and it has really hydrated my under eyes. It’s very light weight and applies evenly. A little goes a long way and the applicator is metal so it’s very cooling and perfect for depuffing the under eyes in morning. For the price point, I will say there are other options with the same outcome but if you’re willing to splurge this is a good product. There’s no scent and applies well under makeup without separating. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
