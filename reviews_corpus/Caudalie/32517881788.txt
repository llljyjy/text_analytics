I received this #freeproduct in exchange for my honest review from #tryitwithtopbox.This clay mask has a lovely lavender scent. This spreads very easily and is not as thick as some. This doesn’t dry out as quickly as some so you have plenty of time to distribute it. I like that it doesn’t make your skin feel drawn or tight while or after its dry. It washes off about like any clay mask so pay special attention to any larger pores as they’ll need more attention. I will say it left my skin feeling soft and moisturized after its removal. This definitely helped me with oil and deep pore cleansing. I am not a big fan of clay masks but this is definitely worth using as it does everything it says it will. I would recommend this whole heartedly to anyone. Leaves skin clean, soft and moisturized
