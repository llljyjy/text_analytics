Love this! I use it as a toner and during makeup application. It’s extremely moisturizing and allows my makeup to ‘melt’ into my skin, yet giving it a dewy and natural look. It really helps make my makeup look more skin like, and adds some boosted moisture which makes it look glassy. The mister is extremely fine, and distributes the product in a way that isn’t too overwhelming. I also find there to be no scent (I mean, there is only a couple ingredients so I didn’t expect there to be a scent anyways haha). The bottle and amount provided is extremely good for the price, as I find that most mists/toners have 3/4 or even half of the product that this one has, usually for an even bigger price. It’s extremely cost effective for what you get, and would definitely recommend it to people looking for hydrating sprays when doing their makeup, or toners/mists that add some moisture into their skin. Really hydrating!
