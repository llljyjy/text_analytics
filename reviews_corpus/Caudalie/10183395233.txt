I received this #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox. First off I love how the packaging is recyclable, more companies should do this. The serum itself is lightweight but hydrating. It doesn’t leave a sticky feeling and sinks into the skin immediately. A little goes a long way. Fragrance is light and doesn’t smell artificial. I’ve seen a slight difference in my fine lines. The only thing I can’t get around is the price. It’s not affordable for everyone. I’ve recommended to family and friends because it truly is a great product. Just not in my budget for skincare. Great Serum
