Bought this because it was the highest reviewed face mist. Saw it near the check out at my local Sephora and grabbed the 30ml THANKFULLY not the full bottle. Which $18 for a 30ml bottle was so expensive when it only lasted for a week and a half. It was a nice glow at first but then it would go away after an hour along with its hydration. I used it every time after my moisturizer and it would SMELL like old lady eucalyptus mint with a floral touch. Not a nice SCENT because it was very strong and you would get DIZZY after a few sprays, this is coming from someone who doesn’t mind fragrance at all in fact I love it but this was not nice to smell. Used whenever my skin felt dehydrated and it proved no long term hydration. Those with oily skin should probably find a different face mist because it’s kind of heavy feeling. Every time I would use this I’d get an itchy feeling of a break out on my face. Such a pretty bottle not sure about the formula though. the HONEST TRUTH
