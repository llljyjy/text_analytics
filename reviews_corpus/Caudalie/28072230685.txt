I received this awesome product to try out in exchange for my honest review from top box Circle. This is my second product from caudalie and wow it lives up to the premier Le Cru face serum that I received the last time! Totally wish I would have received them at the same time to use as a set. So the product itself is a pearl-like finish it is very absorbing and sinks into your under eye skin fairly quickly. I have been using it for around 3 weeks now and I have noticed my fine lines and the puffiness under my eye area have became less visible. I use it two times a day once in the morning before I apply my makeup and once at night. The only thing I do not really care for is the application tip it is made a little weird and doesnâ€™t quite make sense the product comes out backwards to where you have to squeeze so much out for it to reach the front side of the eye rolling cool that is attached to the tube so I do not use that I just squeeze a bit on my finger and apply. The Pearl like finished gives my under eyes this really nice brightening effect which I really enjoy. I cannot wait to continue using this product for two or three months and see the difference then. All in all this is a really great product Caudalie premier cru dark circle cream
