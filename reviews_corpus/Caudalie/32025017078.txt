I received this gift from #trywithTopBox as a #freeproduct in exchange for a review. Iâ€™ve been using this serum for about 3 weeks and overall I really do love this serum. It has left my skin looking  and feeling softer and more hydrated during the day. The scent is lightweight and nice. The texture of it is smooth and silky and absorbed well into my skin.
