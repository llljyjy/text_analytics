I got this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using the Resveratrol Lift Firming Cashmere Moisturizer along with the Resveratrol Serum for a few weeks now and I’m really impressed with the results. I use this serum and cream immediately after I receive it . I use it every day at night, and it makes my skin feeling soft and look radiant. The texture is good and the scent is very nice. I love the silky texture so much, the serum is more like lotion that can absorb quick, the cream is  light and hydrating enough. The Resveratrol Lift Firming Cashmere Moisturizer along with the Resveratrol Serum  don’t clog pores, and don’t irritate my skin. Suitable for my normal skin type. My skin feels so soft and looks healthier and firmer and I expect to see more results after weeks! Such a good product- would definitely recommend! nan
