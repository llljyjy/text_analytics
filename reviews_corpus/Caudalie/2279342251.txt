I’ve generally had good luck with most Caudalie products that I’ve tried and this, too, is one that I enjoy.  It has a light scent which isn’t overpowering and provides a nice amount of moisture/hydration without feeling heavy or greasy in any way.  I appreciate that it doesn’t feel sticky and I find that it absorbs readily, making it not only ideal for bedtime (because who wants to stick to their pillow?) but also plays nicely with my other skincare and makeup.  This claims to be an “anti-aging“ serum and while that’s a little difficult to prove, it DOES make my skin feel nice and hopefully the ingredients are providing cumulative benefits.  *This was provided as a #freeproduct compliments of #trywithtopbox nan
