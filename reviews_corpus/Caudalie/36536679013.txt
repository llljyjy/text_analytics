I received this product for free from Top Circle in turn for my honest opinion. I found the product clean smelling and smooth to put on. I appreciated that it didn’t make my face oily and I could use it morning and night. While it left my face smooth and hydrated I’m not sure if it helped with my lines or not. I will definitely keep trying it as I have no negative comments about it, although I wasn’t a huge fan of the smell. I used this product daily in the morning for about a week. #freeproduct #trytopcircle Great moisturizer
