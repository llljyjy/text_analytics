I received a wonderful #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and it over-exceeded my expectations!I have dark circles under my eyes for many years, especially after the disruptive sleep or a party. I tried quite a few primes, correcting eye creams, but so far the Premier Cru Dark Circle Correcting Eye Cream is the best.It reduces appearance of my dark circles and under eyes puffiness, hydrates and plumps the skin under my eyes.I usually apply it in the morning and it last for the whole day making my look fresh, healthy and illuminating.I like the light and powerful texture and very pleasant sophisticated fragrance.It makes me feel more confident to know it was made of natural-origin ingredients and cruelty-free - good for me and safe for the nature.I would recommend it for everyone who is looking for an effective and natural solution for your under eyes circles and puffiness. Works great!
