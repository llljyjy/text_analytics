I received this product as a sample in my Sephora box. I am using it as a daytime serum and so far I like the results. I use another serum by Peter Thomas Roth which is specifically for night time, and I needed to find a daytime serum. This may be it. I will keep you all posted as I plan to buy. Want to continue to use it. Well, I don’t know if there’s a lot beyond. Day time serum to the rescue
