I was really looking forward to trying this product as it’s a highly praised one, but unfortunately it wasn’t as I expected. The main issue is that I had some type of reaction to it after a few days, it caused the skin under and around my eye to get very dry and I noticed some small bumps as well. Besides the poor reaction my skin had to it, I wasn’t satisfied with the applicator either or how the product felt on my skin. It didn’t absorb really at all, it smeared and seemed to “lay“ on top of my skin and was kind of tacky.Ended up returning the item after a week, going back to using Kiehls Super Multi-Corrective Eye treatment. Disappointed
