Best cleanser I’ve ever used. I have oily, blackhead prone skin. I breakout much less and my oily skin is so much more manageable. I use this whole caudalie line. Toner, serum, and moisturizer I absolutely love it. It’s pricey, but worth it. And it’s clean! I do wish there was an SPF in the moisturizer though. Still need to find a good SPF for my oily skin. nan
