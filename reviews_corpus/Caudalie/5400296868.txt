I received this #freeproduct from CAUDALIE Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum from #trywithtopbox and I absolutely fell in love with this product! I’ve used it for almost 3 weeks now and I can see a slight difference, so I’m sure with continued use of this product the results will get better! I love how it’s gentle enough for sensitive skin and a little product goes a long way! The texture and feel of this product does wonders, it doesn’t have much of a smell to it and definitely has worked out with my dry skin! I’m so thankful that I was able to try this serum out bc now I have to get the eye cream and the moisturizer to go with it! Oh and the packaging is beautiful and it’s a pretty heavy bottle which is even more of a plus for me! Definitely worth trying out! It’s definitely more on the expensive side but it’s worth it! Not to mention it has some amazing ingredients as well! 0% Parabenes, phenoxyethanol, silicone, phthalates, etc! It’s also Vegan, has TET enzyme discovery, for a serum that helps skin look visibly younger! Amazing CAUDALIE Premier Cru Serum
