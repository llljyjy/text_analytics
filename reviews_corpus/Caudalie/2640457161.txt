I had gone for my very first facial back in June and the aesthetician used this on my face for redness that she had noticed.  You use it before applying moisturizer.  Currently I am using the Tatcha Water Cream.  A little does go a long way with both products, so even though it is pricey, I still have a little over half the Caudalie bottle left and I’m going on almost two months now.  I just ran out of the Tatcha so I’ll be picking that up soon.  I’ll admit I can skimp on my skin routine too either because I am too tired or just forget (I work from home so I don’t wear makeup as often as I used to) so that might also be why it lasted longer.  But again, you don’t have to use huge globs to get good coverage. Great for Redness Too!
