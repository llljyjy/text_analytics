This cream is a lovely, lightly scented and cooling cream that spreads very nicely without leaving a greasy residue. Unfortunately, it does leave quite a heavy layer on top of the skin even after it’s been fully worked in and has caused me quite a few breakouts over the past several weeks of use. Because of this, I don’t get much use out of it as a true face cream but instead use it on my neck, chest and décolletage when I get out of the shower. It seems to absorb much better and leaves me skin feeling nice as moisturized without leaving the same feeling it does on my face. I’d say that if you too are at an age where anti-aging products are in your repertoire but you still have to be careful not to cause breakouts, this might not be the face cream for you just yet.#freeproduct #trywithtopbox Not for those who still have acne concerns
