It’s been one week exactly and I already notice a difference.  I attached a photo with no make up and the same lighting. Top is before , bottomIs after one week of this product.  I haven’t experienced drying out.. but I do apply it at night , wait a few hours , then right before bed I add my regular moisturizer on top. (Fresh rose moisturizer) in the morning I apply, then supergoop spf after.  It’s worth the money. notice a difference after 7 days
