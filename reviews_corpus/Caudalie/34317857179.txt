Probably my most valued, effective skin care. Itâ€™s lightweight, thin, absorbs fast. Mostly it just works! After a few (2?) months of use, I was amazed by how it de-aged my face and chest. Kept using, and it erased sun damage, dark age spots, even a few dark scars. It is the one skin care item I will never give up.Yes, expensive, but you only need 2-3 drops so it is quite worth it! nan
