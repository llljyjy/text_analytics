Thank-you to Caudalie and TopBox for the #freeproduct (Premier Cru Dark Circle Correcting Eye Cream). I’ve been using it for a little over two weeks now and enjoy the light consistency. Not heavy or greasy at all. I’ve seen mild improvement in the discoloration around my eyes and minimal improvement in puffiness. The best part is the long-lasting hydration. It has definitely improved the appearance of the fine smile lines around my eyes, especially under the lower lash line. Works well under makeup, no pilling. I like this more than the Vichy gel moisturizer I’ve been using. Highly recommended if you have fine lines, tired-looking eyes, or dry skin and need a non-oily eye cream.#premiercru #trywithtopbox #topboxcircle #caudalieIG: @addisonsvox nan
