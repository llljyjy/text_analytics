I received Caudalíe Paris premier cru anti-aging serum. This serum has the cutest little bottle. It’s very sturdy and has a lovely pump. The pump does twist and it twists very easily to lock and unlock. This is a thicker cream like serum. It’s milky white in color. It moisturized my skin and left it very hydrated. I seen results within the first week. It lifted and made my skin glow. It smells amazing I believe the scent is rose. The scent does last all day. I do use this night and morning after my toner. I also use a light moisturizer after. My skin has never looked or felt so good. Defiantly recommend this is a great serum. Hydrated and glowing
