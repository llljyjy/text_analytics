I received this product #freeproduct in exchange for my honest review. I used this glycolic cream at night after the Vinoperfect serum. I love how the cream melts into my skin. There is no residue or greasy feeling. I did see a difference in the brightness of my skin but I can’t say my dark spots have lightened. I will continue to use this product till its gone because I do like how it feels and how it makes my skin glow. I don’t know if I would purchase this product. #trywithtopbox Nice night cream
