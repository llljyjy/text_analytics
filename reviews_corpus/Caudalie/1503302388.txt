I received this Eye Cream to try for free from #topbox.  It is a pretty good eye cream overall.  I didn’t see any huge difference in under eye circles or wrinkles though I do not have a lot of wrinkles yet.  I attempted using the tip to apply the product but I didn’t like it.  I almost found it better to use my finger to apply the product personally.  Another issue that I had with the packaging is that a little of the product always seems to squeeze out of the tube and dry out inside, I did not like that.  The product itself goes on well and absorbs it is more of a thick cream consistency and I prefer something a little more like a serum.  I also was not crazy about the mica in it to brighten under eyes.  I would prefer a product that does not have mica and just lightens and depuffs naturally vs a cover up.  #trywithtopbox #freeproduct It's a Good Eye Cream
