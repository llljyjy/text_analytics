My review is based on the sample I received with my purchase. It smells like an expired product, it’s that bad. I have combination to dry skin and it felt oily on my skin, not sure if it’s meant to feel like product sitting on the skin. I love their vinopure facewash with natural salicylic acid so I thought their moisturizer will be awesome but completely disappointed with the moisturizer. smells really bad!
