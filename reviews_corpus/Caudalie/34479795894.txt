I received this #freeproduct Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist from #trywithtopbox and I’ve been enjoying it.I love that this spray works as a fine mist which helps apply evenly while providing hydration and freshness.The scent is a strong menthol with lemongrass. It’s very spa-like in my experience, although I’m personally not a fan of menthol.Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist also helps with putting on makeup. I spray while applying foundation instead of spraying on the blender like what I used to do. And that saved some of my spray soaked into the blender yet still does the job, my foundation blends in so well! Could have been perfect
