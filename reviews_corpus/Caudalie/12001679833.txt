A friend of mine bought this mask and she gave me a little bit, as soon as we applied it and it dried we knew it was going to be good. After rising it I could notice my skin way better, of course my pores were still there but considerably minimized and my skin was so soft, I had to buy my own and now I use it once/twice a week and my skin feels incredible!
