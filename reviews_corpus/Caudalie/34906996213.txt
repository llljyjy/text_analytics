I received Caudalie Premier Cru Anti Aging Cream Moisturizer as a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, I use it at night time after my showers. I like to use it then because this product tends to be a bit thicker and on the oily side (considering it is a cream and does a good job at moisturizing). I am new to anti-aging products, I am in my 20’s, but I think it’s a good time to start, never too early. The cream is made with top ingredients and vegan, which I appreciate. Smells floral, I usually don’t like scented products but I do not mind this scent all that much. I promise you will notice more “bounce“ to your skin. I recommend trying it out. Leaves Skin Feeling Moisturized and Bouncey
