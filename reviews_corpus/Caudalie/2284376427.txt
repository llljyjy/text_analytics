The Caudalie premier Cru lotion was such an honor to be able to #FreeTest! Caudalie has been around for years, and they have an excellent reputation. So I was very excited. The packaging (jar, which IS refillable) is beautiful, very lavish. The light scent is heavenly, and the consistency of the cream is like silk. I put this in my routine, day and night and my skin just drank it up! Of course, there is no greasiness or residue, itâ€™s Caudalie! I read that it helps with 8 signs of aging. Awesome! This is a spectacular cream that I can heartily recommend to anyone who loves to take care of their skin. nan
