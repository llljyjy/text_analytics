I was excited to try this cream with the serum but wasn’t as happy as I expected. The cream goes on well and is in fact moisturizing, but it leaves my skin very shiny. The smell is subtle and enjoyable, but I dislike the shine that is left over. It looks like my skin is very oily or that the cream just doesn’t absorb well. I did give it a try for a few days but didn’t notice any results that outweighed the shine. I received this for free in exchange for review. #freeproduct Moisturizes, but shiny.
