First impression: I can’t talk longterm because I received the product today but I will talk about how it felt on the first try on. For reference, I have dry sensitive skin. This cream feels very lightweight amd gel like. It smells like th rest of the rpoducts from this line, grass-bamboo florally scent. It reminds me of the dior backstage smell. If you are sensitive to scents, this might me strong for you. It applies well and drys out quickly. I wouldn’t describe it as moisturizing but that’s because I have dry skin, I feel like this product would be perfect for someone with oily skin because it does not feel oily at all! That being said, I did notice as I am writing this review, that I am feeling a tingling sensation and my skin is becoming red where I applied it. It might be too strong for me. If you have normal, combo, ouly skin, with no sensitivity, then this product is for you. For normal, combo or oily skin. Not for dry skin.
