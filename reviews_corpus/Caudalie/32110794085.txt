I was thrilled to have been able to receive this #freeproduct from Caudalie and #trywithtopbox. It comes in a recyclable glass bottle, minus the pump. I really like that it is made of 98% of  natural origin ingredients.  I applied this serum after toner and before my day or night cream.  It absorbed into my skin immediately,  leaving my skin soft.  I do think it faded my age spot slightly as well.  The serum is white and has a faint rose scent.  After having tried this, I would like to try the moisture cream in this line. nan
