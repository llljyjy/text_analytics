At the good age of 47, I need all the help I can get for my tired eyes. Enter Claudalie Premier Cru eye cream. It has a creamy texture, and a little goes a long way. Melts like butter and smells great. After a few weeks, I am a able to tell a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and the dark circles lightened up some. However, the product tends to clump up in the applicator causing “lost product“. I plan on continuing the use of this eye cream as I need to turn back time on my eyes. I received this product #freeproduct and #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review. turn back time
