I received this product for free from TopBox in exchange for my honest review. First off, the packaging of this product is beautiful! I love the new bottle design. I used this product as a nice mid-day refresher and I was amazed at how well it worked. The spraying mechanism on the bottle is perfect and gives out a nice, light mist without showering you with any huge droplets. The product itself visibly tightened my pores and left my skin smoother and softer. The one downside to this product is that it is heavily scented. It has a very heavy herbal fragrance to it that might irritate the skin of someone with sensitive skin. If you are sensitive to fragrances, I highly recommend patch testing this before using it on a larger area. Other than the fragrance issue, I would definitely recommend this product.
