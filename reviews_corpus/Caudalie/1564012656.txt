I’ve been using this moisturizer for about 3 weeks now. This has been great at keeping my dry skin hydrated. It does have a thicker consistency and a little goes a long way. BUT I took off 2 stars because of the price and because I didn’t see any significant change in my skin. I’ll stick to my less expensive moisturizers. meh
