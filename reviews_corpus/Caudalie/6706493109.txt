I REALLY wanted to give this face mist 5 stars, it is literally everything I would want, need & look for in a face mist, it hydrated my face beautifully, gave my face this awesome dewy look, it was not oily nor tacky, it sprayed evenly and it was actually quite soothing, which is something I really appreciate in my face products, I suffer from Rosacea, so whenever I have flare ups, I look for products that soothe and calm my skin.However, the smell of this face must was sooo overwhelming, it was quite suffocating. First time I used it, I thought maybe I didn’t shake it well enough or perhaps I sprayed to close to my face. I really wanted to give this face mist a fair try & had I not seen & felt the benefits of this mist, I would have def not used it again, I have been using it for about 2 weeks now.The powerfulness of the scent is still quite overwhelming, if you’re ok with the scent, I hands down recommend.I really doubt I will be purchasing this mist in the future, unless the smell gets toned down a bit.
