Slightly gel like in consistence, but mostly has a watery feel. Smells AMAZING, very light rose scent. Takes a minute or two to soak in completely. Gives me a tingling/ever so slight burn feeling, which I like, you know itâ€™s working. Once fully absorbed there is no shine or tacky feel, just a softness. Smells so good!
