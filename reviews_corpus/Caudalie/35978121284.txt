I was very happy with this moisturizer. It has a light floral scent and is thick. When applying it absorbed nicely into the skin and left no greasy residue. I used this during my morning routine, once a day. I saw minor improvement in the tone, brightness, firmness and glow to my skin over the course of two weeks. I would buy this. I received this as a #freeproduct in exchange for an honest review from #trywithtopbox Amazing
