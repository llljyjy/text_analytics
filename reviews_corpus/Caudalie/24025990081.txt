I received Caudalie anti aging serum as a #Freeproduct from TopBox Circle in exchange for my honest review so here it is; to open up the eye serum all you got to do is pull it like a pen cap, nice and easy. It also is designed with a slant to it so that makes it super easy to apply to the eye area. Iâ€™ve been using this for a couple of days now and I am definitely loving the way it works. I would recommend this for yourself or as a nice gift, you can pick it up at your local Sephora store. Cadaulie eye serum
