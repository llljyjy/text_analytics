It’s a nice moisturizer for my super oily skin. I wouldn’t say my skin is now absolutely not shiny, no. But it still works better than any other one out there on the market. I don’t want to buy a different moisturizer cause worried if it doesn’t work. Better buy something that is already verified. It helps me to break out less. I used it together with other products of Vinopure line as a skincare baseline for about 6 months. What I don’t like about this product are the price and size. Who makes 40 ml moisturizers today? I ran out fast. Very sad...And yes, it layers very badly with sunscreens. I have to wait about 20 minutes when it absorbs so I can apply the sunscreen. My sunscreen is la Roche posay athelios Will by again
