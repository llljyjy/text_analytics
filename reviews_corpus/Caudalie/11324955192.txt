I love this cream! It has a nice, but not too strong floral scent. I used it every day for a few weeks and my skin felt very moisturized and felt great all day under my makeup. I also love that you can buy refills for the nice glass jar-makes me feel like Iâ€™m not wasting the nice jars. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Love It!
