I felt it work, saw immediate difference.  in my opinion I’m happy when a product isn’t masked with perfumes. that means to me, the “real“ stuff is in it and working. if I want parfum on my face I’ll spray it after words.  (makes no sense) I can deal with any smell for the better of my skin...(Well almost) and I must say there is no smell) people prior must be talking about nature. this product is great. I’m 49 just turned. redness some on cheeks, sensitive skin,  can’t handle fragrance and combination skin ,getting dry. amazing
