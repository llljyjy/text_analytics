I was so happy for the opportunity to try this new serum as a #freesample from #tryitwithtopbox, because this winter is brutal on my normally combination maturing skin. My face is extremely dry right now, and the serum sinks lightly and effortlessly into the skin. It has a light, pretty scent and and my face feels firmer after application. I canâ€™t wait to see better effects after prolonged use. Firmer, more moisturized winter skin.
