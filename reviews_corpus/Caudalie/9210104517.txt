I’m 42, and my skin is definitely starting to show age. I’ve tried a lot of serums, creams, and snake oils, because I’d really prefer to age gracefully. This Caudalíe serum is really different than anything I’ve tried before. It’s a very lightweight, lightly scented creamy serum, it absorbs so fast, does not sit on your skin at all! It was really easy to layer the rest of my products on top, there was no pilling, or sticky residue. I’ve been using it with my regular skincare regiment, morning and night, and after 3 days I could definitely see a bit of a difference, but after 3 weeks, there’s an amazing difference! The fine lines around my eyes are softened, and the dreaded lines between my eyebrows are less defined. I’ve never experienced these kinds of results with a topical product. I would say the serum is definitely worth the cost, and I will be repurchasing! I’ll also be looking into more of the #Caudalíe skin care line! Thanks #Topbox for this #FreeProduct ! One of the best things I’ve ever got to #TryItWithTopbox ! Real Results!
