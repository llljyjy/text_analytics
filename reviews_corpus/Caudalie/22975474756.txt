I’ve repurchased this product multiple times because I know it works for me as part of my double cleanse. However, I wouldn’t say it’s life changing- I’m sure there are cheaper products on the market that are just as effective. But I like it:) The one star removed is for price, but it’s not too bad compared to other caudalie products and lasts a while!I massage it into my skin, rinse, then follow up with a regular cleanser. I think of this product as more of a makeup/spf remover rather than a cleanser. I don’t wear heavy face makeup often but I do use a tinted sunscreen everyday. I also wear waterproof mascara most days and will say that this product won’t remove waterproof on its own- I usually add a few drops of micellar waterproof makeup remover in my hands as I’m using this one. It’s totally safe to massage into the eye area as you’re removing makeup! I prefer it over makeup-removing balms I have tried (drunk elephant, zero brand), but maybe it’s a texture thing. Less sticky feeling?As someone with oily, acne prone skin, non-sensitive skin, I can vouch that this product doesn’t break me out (when used as part of a double cleanse) ! I’d recommend trying it out for sure! Repurchased Multiple Times
