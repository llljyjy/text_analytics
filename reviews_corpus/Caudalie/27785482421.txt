I’m a big fan of Caudalie, as I know their skincare is vegan, clean and free from ingredients that are potentially harmful to our body and environment. Their container and packaging also focus on sustainable sourcing.I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox, I love the light lemongrass scent from the cream, the smell is divine and I feel very relaxed by massaging my face with it. It contains patented resveratrol, hyaluronic acids, shea better along with vegan collage. This cream aims to reduce fine lines and wrinkles on your face, I don’t see obvious results about these as I’m not at that age yet. But I have to say it is really good for softening the skin, filling the skin with a delightful glow, I feel my skin become brighter and smooth.I enjoy using this antioxidant firming cream, the quality is great compared to other moisturizers in the market. I will highly recommend it to my family and friends. Love this cashmere cream
