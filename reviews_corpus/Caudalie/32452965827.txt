! I have been using this now for several weeks and have been very impressed. I got this free from caudalie in exchange for a review and I have loved the benefits. The texture is creamy and hydrating but not too thick or greasy. The packaging is beautiful and it has a lovely scent that isnt too strong . I also love that this is clean and plant based! luxury in a bottle
