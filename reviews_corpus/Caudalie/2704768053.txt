Since I can remember, I have had terrible circles and puffiness around my eyes (I think wearing glasses and stress might be the cause). But, after almost a month of use, morning and night, I can see some remarkable improvement. The puffiness was much better, and the circles are starting to fade. My skin absorbs it so quickly, without sticky oily residue, so you can definitely use it under makeup. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox It actually works!
