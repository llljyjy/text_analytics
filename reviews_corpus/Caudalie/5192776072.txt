I enjoy double cleansing at night, after caudalie oil makeup remover I use this, the first time I used it i felt I was applying silk to my face, after my fifth day of microneedling which I was still sinsitive it cleanses very well and gentle, I removed it with my wet Halo pad. So satisfying. I applied Ren oil elixir, Tula eye balm. My skin is glowing. Worked for me! nan
