if you know me, you know this girl loves her glycolic acid, my skin just absolutely loves it. Iâ€™ve also been looking for a night cream and this product is a combination of the two. The Caudalie Vinoperfect Brightening Glycolic Acid is so silky and smooth, it feels so luxurious.  I also added a tan bit to my stomach to ease the itch from stretch marks and it was fabulous for not only hydrating my face (I looked so much better!) but softened the stretch marks and my itching was eased. 10/10 Holy grail
