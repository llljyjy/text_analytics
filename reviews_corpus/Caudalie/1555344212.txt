I had no idea how dry my forehead was until I tried this product. My forehead is glowing again! I have combination skin with discoloration issues. I used this moisturizer at night in combination with the caudalie serum to revitalize my skin. I am in love with the texture of the cream. It’s luxurious and feels comforting, if you are sensitive to smells this might not work for you. If you have a normal skin type with similar skin issues like mine and a touch of dehydrated skin, this is a game changer. I’m so glad I tested this #freeproduct I will definitely be stocking up for my night time skincare routine. I love waking up to soft hydrated plump skin! #trywithtopbox Plump and juicy skin!
