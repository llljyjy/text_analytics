I received this product free from TobBox Circle. This Beauty Elixir is the same formula with a new feminine packaging. It absorbs well and I’ve used as a toner and as setting spray, either way they’re both great. It definitely awakens senses, for me the scent was a little strong with the first spray but calmed down after a minute or so and now every time I use it it’s just so amazingly, refreshing. It has an even fine mist when sprayed, it has tightened my pores and gives my skin an instant long lasting hydration with a smooth dewy glowing complexion. Refreshed Hydrating Glow
