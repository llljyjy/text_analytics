I’ve been using this cleanser forever. I love the consistency. Despite being a foaming cleanser it doesn’t feel drying at all unlike most foaming cleansers.  It has a nice smell, not too fragrant. Leaves my skin super clean without drying it. That being said, I have been breaking out lately which is why I’m not giving it 5 stars. Maybe my skin needs a little break. Will update nan
