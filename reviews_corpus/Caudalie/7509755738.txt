I tried this moisturizer as part of a sample I received, then put it away to try the full size once my other moisturizer ran out. I knew I liked it when I tried the sample, but when I finally bought the full size, I created an account here JUST to review this product. Bottom line for me is that it doesn’t break me out. Period. I have sensitive, acne prone skin but I’m constantly worrying about aging / taking care of my skin in a way that I don’t have to consistently blast my skin with acne medication. I want that dewy skin like everyone else! But I legit did not think that was possible for me. I’m in my late twenties and have been trying new beauty products of all types and prices since high school. It’s taken me until THIS moisturizer to find something that doesn’t break my skin out. It’s balanced. It allows me to feel like I’m still taking care of my skin, still moisturizing while I don’t have to worry about blemishes. Idk it’s been a life saver for me!!! If you have overly sensitive skin I can’t recommend this enough! THE Best Moisturizer I’ve Ever Tried… Seriously
