I absolutely loved this eye cream!! It was a #freeproduct in exchange for my honest review. I used it in the morning and at night for several weeks, and I can tell a difference when I miss a day. My favorite part about it is the applicator. It feels cold and so good applying the cream. Plus you donâ€™t have to get it on your hands to apply it. It has a little bit of a tint to it, and it color corrected my dark circles nicely. It really hydrates the undereye and your skin feels soft after using it. LOOOOVE the applicator!!
