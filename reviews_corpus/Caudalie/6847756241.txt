I first tried this product around the peak of the pandemic due to the high alcohol content. The smell, while noticeable at first, it mellowa out and leaves a soft, refreshing scent. I wouldn’t say it’s the most beneficial spray on the market since it’s mostly water and alcohol; however, it does a great job at settling makeup that is too shiny, and again the scent is soothing. I find myself using the product even when I’m not wearing makeup. It’s definitely a treat myself kind of spray but worth it. treat yourself
