I got this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review. Overall, I thought this was a good product. I liked the application tube. It was hard to squeeze out initially, but it got easier with use. The texture is nice and thick. It felt moisturizing without feeling heavy. I think it smoothed out my eyes and reduced the puffiness. However, I didn’t notice much change in my crows feet or fine lines. On the box it says it can be used for lip wrinkled as well. I did not use it for this purpose so I cannot comment on it. I’m a fan
