I received these free products from Topbox in exchange for my honest review. The Caudalie Resveratrol- Lift Firming Cashmere Cream is very hydrating, and it also firms and smoothes my fine lines. I have been using it for about nine days, and I am very happy with the result. I use it every day at night, and it makes my skin feeling soft and look radiant. The texture is good, but not too heavy or greasy, and the scent is very nice. I feel like my face is silky soft after applying it. This cream improves my overall skin texture, and it makes my skin look healthy.   I also use it with the Caudalie Resveratrol- Lift Serum to promote the best result. The serum is very moisturising, and lightweight, and has a nice scent. I use it every day at night. The serum makes my skin feeling plump and glowing after each use, and it also makes my skin feeling soft and smooth.   When using the serum and the cream together at night, I feel like my skin becomes better each day, and they both work very well. They don’t clog pores, and don’t irritate my skin.   I like these vegan and clean beauty products. They both contain Resveratrol, which is good at firming skin and reducing wrinkles. They also contain Hyaluronic Acid, which is good at hydrating skin and making skin feel soft.   Suitable for my normal skin type. Good for both Summer and Winter time. Highly recommend. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Amazing Cashmere Moisturizer
