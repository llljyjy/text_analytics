I have very sensitive skin that reacts to several beauty products.  And since the pandemic, because of the use of the mask, my skin is irritated and acne-prone.  I bought this product from Caudalie and what a difference!  It is a very comfortable product for the skin that cleans deeply.  My pimples and redness have reduced tremendously since my use (2-3 times per week).  I am completely satisfied. Love it!
