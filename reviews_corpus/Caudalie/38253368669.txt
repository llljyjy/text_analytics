This Caudalie Instant detox mask works great. I like that it is face tightening and really cleanses pores. It is a peachy orange color and sits thin on the face. I leave it on for about 10 minutes and gently rinse it off. The caffeine and pink clay are a good combo in this mask. My skin looks and feels renewed and added clarity. In a way it helps me look more awake as well. I plan to continue using this mask. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Best product!!
