WOW! This eye cream is the best thing ever. It is so brightening and makes the delicate skin around my eyes so soft. It is such a buttery feel and an actual lightening if dark circles. It helps with puffiness when you wake up and gentle enough to apply to my upper lids. It says it can be used for the lips so I tried on my upper lip and I can see a difference in the fine lines dissipating and much more plumper. I swear by this eye cream and it comes in such a cute squeeze tube that has a rounded steel applicator to massage into your skin. I received this as a #freesample and Iâ€™m so glad I did because I love it. WOW!
