I received a trial size and I really liked it, so will buy the full size. It’s moisturizing enough that it’s a serum/moisturizer in one for me.  My skin looked brighter after using, I’ll try the full size to see how well it works on reducing some sun damage. It does have perfume in it, which sometimes irritates my skin, but the amount is minimal in this so it was fine. thumbs up
