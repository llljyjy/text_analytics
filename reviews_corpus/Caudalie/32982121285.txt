I just adore this cleanser. I bought it and used it almost everyday for about ten months, so it does last. And it takes my makeup off entirely, like seriously! I double cleanse and after I use this makeup remover there is literally no makeup left ever. In addition, itâ€™s very gentle on the eyes. I have issues with makeup removers stinging my eyes, but this one never does. Best Makeup Remover EVER!
