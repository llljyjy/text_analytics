After finding out Clinique tests on animals (!!), I had to find a replacement for Moisture Surge which had been my daily moisturizer for at least 5 years. I love Caudalie’s face wash and loved the Divine Oil when it was still available in Canada so I thought I’d give this a go. It glides on so smoothly, absorbs very nicely, and smells heavenly. I absolutely love it! My only real complaint is the fact that it’s only available in a 40 mL tube. nan
