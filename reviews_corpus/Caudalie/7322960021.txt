I received the Caudalie Premier Cru Anti-Anging Serum as a #freeproduct to sample. I have tried several Caudalie products before and tend to be very satisfied with how my skin reacts to them, this product is no different. I applied the serum morning and evening after washing my face, about 1 and a half pumps seemed to be the ideal amount for me. I like the texture of this serum and how it applies smoothly and dries quickly. In the morning when I wake up, I found my face felt extra soft and after using it for a couple weeks I believe my face appears more radiant and bright. All in all Iâ€™ve been happy with this product as a quick, easy and effective addition to my skin care routine. #trywithtopbox Another Great Serum by Caudalie
