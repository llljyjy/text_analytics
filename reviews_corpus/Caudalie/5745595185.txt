A sales associate recommended this moisturizer to me when i wanted to try something new. It’s not awful but it feels oily and my skin was still quite dry after much use. I thought it might take a bit to get used to and so I kept it and figure I would finish out the rest. After 8 months I saw zero improvement in my skin. It didn’t seem to make my dry skin any better and I got pimples more frequently than I had ever before.Takeaway: it’s not horrible but certainly not worth the money. I’ll stick to my usual moisturizer. Meh
