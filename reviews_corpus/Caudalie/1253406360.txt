I came here to write a rave review, but was shocked to learn this is a dark spot serum!? I was recommended this product by a sephora rep who also has bad dry skin like me. OMG it is SO GOOD! I have horrible dry skin, especially in the winter. This serum helped me FLAWLESSLY SURVIVE BOSTON WINTER this past year! I will say, I use several drops each use and therefore the bottle only lasts me about 1.5-2months, but personally, the money spent is worth it because I have never found a product that kept my skin so hydrated as this one. ...and I am still going to buy 2 more right now, even after learning its main focus isnt hydration!? Its taken me years to accomplish some form of survival with my dry skin on my face. Using oil based makeup remover plus a milky cleaner and then THIS serum, all at night, has been a life changer for me. I also really love The Ordinary Marine Hylaronics! I will also periodically pair with different face masks before bed, but more often than not a cheaper hydrating sheet mask from amazon suffices. Again, i use 2-4 drops of this on my face by pressing all over. I often do 1-2 more drops in the morning before makeup. Sale rep who initially introduced me to this said product should last 6 months-- that is nowhere the case for me, but the extra drops/running out before a 2 month mark, is my survival goal, so! (Also- a good primer, beauty blender and MACâ€™s water weight foundation also really help my dry skin during/after makeup application this past winter.) VERY Hydrating
