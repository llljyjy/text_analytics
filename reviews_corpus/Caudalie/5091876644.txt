I’ve used a lot of eye creams, and this one is truly impressive. First, I love that the squeeze tube applicator has a metal side to it. It feels so nice and cooling on the eyes, especially in the morning when your eyes are feeling puffy and tired. I’m usually very weary about trying new eye creams because the skin around my eyes is very sensitive and prone to drying out. This formula doesn’t irritate my eyes at all and in fact, soothes it. The cream is a nice silky texture that melts into the skin and doesn’t have a strong scent or leave a weird film. I do truly notice my under eyes are brighter when using this. Worth the price point. VERY nice
