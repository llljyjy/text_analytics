I gave this a 4 star because I haven’t used it for up to a week but I love love love the luxurious smell. Yes I did notice a glow from day 1 of use and I love how light weight it is on my skin. No noticeable breakout and I’ve used it day and night even though it says it’s a day cream. So far I am loving it and would be looking forward to it doing what it says it does.I’m also using the vinopure toner and serum and my pores have shrunk already. If this helps, I’m dark skinned with combination skin. Lightweight and Moisturizing with evident glow
