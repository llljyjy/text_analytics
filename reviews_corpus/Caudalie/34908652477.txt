It felt night and light enough, but I would only use this at night as I wear sun protection during that day and think that would be a bit too much product on my face.  I really appreciate the cruelty-free and vegan aspects of this product, as well as having recyclable packaging (though I think there is still room for improvement there).  Nice that there is an option for a refill at a slightly lower price.#freeproduct#trywithtopbox nan
