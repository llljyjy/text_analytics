I have used the product a few times now. I like how it wears . I have oily skin and it does help reduce the appearance of open pores. It did not irritate the skin. Just make sure you shake the bottle before using and close your eyes when your spray it on your face. I have worn it on bare skin as a toner and over the make up as setting spray. I like it both ways. Only downside for me is the fragrance. It is too strong for my liking. Overall a good product otherwise. Works for oily skin
