I received this #freeproduct from #trywithTopBox and Caudalie in exchange for my honest review. •Description•The Beauty Elixir is a Face Mist that functions as a toner, setting spray, and as a skin refresher. It is a 100% natural formula, and is vegan and cruelty free. The bottle is absolutely stunning and screams luxury, but the packaging is completely recyclable. The mist is housed in a frosted glass bottle. •Experience• After cleansing, I mist my face with the Beauty Elixir to allow it to tone my skin and tighten my pores. The fragrance is quite strong initially and I pick up lemon and rosemary, along with a bit of orange. It is refreshing and fast acting. The scent settles after a few minutes. After finishing the rest of my skincare routine and makeup application, I apply another light mist of the Elixir to set the face. •Verdict• I love this product. Although I do feel it is effective as a toner, I prefer to use it as a setting spray. The toners I have already lend themselves to more specific functions than I fee that the Elixir provides.The dewy glow provided by the Elixir is stunning and it really makes my makeup look better. I have dry skin and using this product as a setting spray has enabled me to use some of my more matte foundations with fuller coverage, without having dry makeup patches pop up on my skin two hours post application. Considering I have only been using the mist immediately after I finish my makeup and not throughout the day—I am impressed. I can see why this product is so popular with makeup artists. 4.5/5 ⭐️ Caudalie Beauty Elixir
