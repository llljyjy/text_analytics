Let me say you can tell that this is a high quality, luxury product. The container is so heavy, and feels like glass. The creme is smooth and thick, and incredibly nourishing, moisturizing and hydrating. It doesn’t leave your skin feeling oily or greasy. Just soft and smooth. It is rather expensive, but if the price point isn’t a issue for you then I would highly reccomend. A little product goes a long way, so this container will last you a long time. Also a big plus for me is the companies sustainability commitment. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Luxurious creme
