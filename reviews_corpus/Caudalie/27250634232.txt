This cream is amazing and very good for anti-aging, it also smells great when you open it and feels soft and light to the touch.Caudalie cream leaves your skin very soft, hydrated and shiny, personally I prefer to use it at night before going to sleep and after doing my facial routine and with very clean skin.Some of the benefits of this cream are that it reduces expression lines, delays skin aging, eliminates dark spots, and gives the skin volume and elasticity, among others. It is rechargeable.Ideal for all skin types that need to renew and hydrate the skin.I highly recommend it.#Freeproduct Awesome Cream!
