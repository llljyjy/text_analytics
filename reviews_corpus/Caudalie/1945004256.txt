I’m in my mid-30’s and became concerned with wrinkle prevention a few years ago. I have acne prone skin, and doused my face in all sorts of acids to treat the acne in my 20s, but forgot to hydrate properly. Dehydrated skin causes wrinkles, and when I began to wake up with faint hints of wrinkles from sleep I decided to switch to something brightening while simultaneously hydrating. Caudalie Vinoperfect night cream is perfect, as the glycolic gently resurfaces and brightens while delivering solid, but not greasy or heavy moisture. I’ve tried other night creams and they were just too heavy and broke me out. I’ve purchased this product several times and will continue to do so. When you find what works, why change it? Great night cream for mid 30's
