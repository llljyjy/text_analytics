The Caudalie Beauty Elixer is wonderful! I recieved this product for free for my honest review. It tightened my pores right up! It has a distinct scent, I can’t put my finger on what it is that stands out. Earthy I guess I’d call it. It tingles after I spray it on. Almost like menthol. But my skin feels great after it dries. It’s not greasy or sticky in any way. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox This is definitely a hit!
