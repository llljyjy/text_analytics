Wow is all I can say. I love this product. There’s no scent and all good ingredients. I love the metal applicator it seems to always stay cool for me so feels really nice around my eyes. Also use this around my lips where one tends to get those wrinkles. It does take a not to soak in but I actually like that Especially for around my eyes. I want them well moisturized. The only thing was with the cap at first had a hard time but you just pull it off. I’m used to always having to unscrew everything. Other than that I love it. Haven’t had any reactions to it no sensitivies which a lot of things with fragrance and other bad stuff too. This doesn’t at all so makes me so happy. #trywithtopbox#freeproduct Scent free
