In English it’s advertised as a “Cleansing Milk” but in French the name is “Démaquillant” (meaning makeup remover) which is what I read (I’m bilingual ). When using this, it completely fails at removing any eye or face makeup. I prefer using cleansers that also remove makeup, so I’d recommend the Tatcha Rice Wash for dry or normal skin or the Deep Cleanse for oilier skin instead Doesn’t Remove Makeup
