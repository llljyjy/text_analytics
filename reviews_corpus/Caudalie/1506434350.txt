This eye cream delivers. I was encouraged by the other 4 and 5 star reviews. Particularly because people said it helped with under eye circles which is not easy to improve. I’ve used it for 3 days and my very fine lines under my eyes are noticeably plumped. I have an infant who’s been sick a lot this winter so I’m up with him multiple times per night which means tired eyes and my dark circles get worse. I look much less fatigued in the eye area when I use this. Time will tell if it brightens dark circles for me as it did for others. The applicator is a plus but honestly the good stuff is what is inside that tube. For under $100 this is a luxury level cream that is worth the money. Also I have sensitive eyes and no issues like watering or milia so that makes me happy. Next level eye cream
