I love Caudalie so much. I want to try this product so I can save my face from this ridiculously cold winter. My entire face is chapped. I just love Caudalie and all their products. They’re pricey but totally worth it. If I had my way I’d choose this over food. But my other half doesn’t agree Caudalie is nirvana for the skin. nan
