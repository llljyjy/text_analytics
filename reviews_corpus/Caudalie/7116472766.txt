First off you can’t fully remove dark circles. It can be genetic. Fillers and sleep can help. BUT I got this as a sample. I put it on my lips and around my eyes. Omg I actually saw a difference. I never get mind blown from products the way I have with this impressive eye cream. When my sample is done this will be my go-to daytime eye cream while I’ll do a more jelly type eye cream for night like Dermalogica. ACTUALLY WORKED FOR ME
