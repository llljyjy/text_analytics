I usually love Caudalie products and use their masks, serums and a night cream in winter. But this is WAY TOO STRONG. It stings my eyes with a sharp scent of alcohol and whatever essential oils (assume lavender) they’re using to fragrance it. It dries my skin out, doesn’t seem to provide any kind of dewiness. Absolutely not a fan. YIKES
