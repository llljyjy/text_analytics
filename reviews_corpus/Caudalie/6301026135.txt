I’ve been using this for a little over a month and just started taking a look at my skin to see if I notice any differences since incorporating this product in my routine. I can say that some of the fine lines on my face look less noticeable. I think I realized this when I noticed my foundation not exacerbating the look of my smile lines. It’s a lightweight serum so for my dry skin it’s been working fine on warmer days, but when the temperature is below 40 I have to supplement this with additional hyaluronic acid so my skin doesn’t feel too tight or dry. I also like the scent. It’s light but fresh, and the serum itself is also lightweight. I use anywhere from 1-2 pumps depending on how I feel. Beautiful product, and I’m hoping with more use it’ll help my my skins moisture retention. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
