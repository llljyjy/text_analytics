This dark circle correcting eye cream had a rich creamy texture. One of my favorite features is that you can remove the metal tip for easy cleaning and it’s super easy to take off. No tugging or pulling sensation while using either. Plus, you can beat the fact that the all the packaging is recyclable. I have also noticed a true difference in my dark circles. They still aren’t perfect, but I have high hopes. I received this as a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox. Definitely worth buying
