This is hands down one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. The texture is so soft and neither too heavy or too light. I have combination skin and feels super dry on winter. I love using it at night in winter! It provides enough hydration and makes my skin feel super soft and smooth. I like to pair it with the premier cru eye cream. Plus it smells great! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox One of my fav!
