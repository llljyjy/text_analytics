Literally one of my favorite products. I buy like 3-4 of these every time I make a purchase! Can’t live without it! It’s perfect for my sensitive skin. I mainly use it after I shower. I also like to keep it in the fridge as it makes the experience even more amazing and refreshing. My skin is noticeably healthier looking. It’s also lovely to do it right before bed. ICONIC STUFF!!!!!
