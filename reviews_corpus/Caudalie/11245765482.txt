Every Caudalie product that I have tried has always worked very well for my skin and the new Premier Cru line is no exception! The Cream has a rich texture that spreads and absorbs well, leaving my skin well moisturized without being greasy. This facial cream has a light, pleasant scent and comes in refillable packaging. Since using this cream my skin is noticeably smoother with less fine lines and dark spots. I have combination, acne-prone skin and did not experience any issues with this cream clogging my pores or causing breakouts. Overall this is an amazing cream for those looking for a more even skintone and to fight the signs of aging.#freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
