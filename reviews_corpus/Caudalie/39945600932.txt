I received this product in the mail through topbox and I tried it day time before I apply my make up and I use it at night time also before I go to bed and it works amazing.  I am light completed and have two toddlers who don’t fully sleep 8 hours and I have a huge problem with dark circles that looks like I got into a fight all the time. Concealer and foundation don’t always cover it up or it will wear off in a couple of hours in the Texas heat and I would have to reapply through out the day.  Also being in my late thirties , I started noticing lines under both of my eyes. I would try different creams to try to minimize it and nothing was working. When applying the cream under my eyes I have noticed a huge change the first day. My dark circles are very little to see and the fine lines under my eyes disappear and make me look like I am in my 20s again. I watched reviews on YouTube on how to apply and what people thought of the product and hearing nothing but great results . I also saw one lady put the cream in the freezer for 5 minutes and used the metal part to smooth out the cream under your eyes and helps with puffiness and minimize dark circles. I like that there is no to little scent of the cream so with people who have sensitive skin like me there is no allergic reaction or irritation. The cream comes out thick and smooth when applying which is really good. Love this product and would recommend it. Free Product
