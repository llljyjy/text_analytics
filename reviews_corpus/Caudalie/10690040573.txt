First of all, how beautiful is this rich cream with the gorgeous purple glass packaging that can be refilled with the eco-friendly refill jar. I love using this luxurious cream as a night cream for my combination to dry skin. I apply the cream on my clean skin. It has such a beautiful rich and luxurious texture that goes on very smoothly and feels lightweight when applied to my skin. It does not leave my skin feeling greasy at all. It sinks right into my skin and makes my skin feel hydrated instantly. This cream is wonderful for my combination to dry skin. I wake up with velvety soft, smooth and hydrated skin. My skin feels supple, looks plump and has a nice healthy silky finish. It also calms my dry and irritated skin, especially now with the colder weather. I love how it smooths my fine lines and wrinkles. I highly recommend this beautiful cream, especially for aging skin! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Smooths and hydrates skin
