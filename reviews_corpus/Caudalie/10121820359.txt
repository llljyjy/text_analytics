I received #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox for my honest review. I used CaudalieVinoperfect Brightening Glycolic Night Cream has been around for about 2 weeks and has seen a noticeable change in my skin. My skin is more even, brighter and more radiant. In my nighttime skincare routine, I use Caudalie’s serumVinoperfect Radiance Dark Spot Serum first and then use Caudalie Vinoperfect Brightening Glycolic Night Cream moisturizer to lock in moisture. It doesn’t feel greasy and absorbs quickly into the skin. I have known Caudalie and trust its skin care products very much, so I was very pleased when I tried this product, and will buy again next time. I will recommend to my relatives and friends to buy and try. My new favorite moisturizer!
