I received this #freeproduct in exchange for my honest review. I use this serum in my morning skincare routine. It’s a vegan friendly, lightweight serum that has an earthy/natural scent that’s not too over powering. It dries very quickly and doesn’t pill up underneath makeup. I have combination skin that leans more dry in the winter months. After using this serum for a few weeks, I can say that my skin has been less dry and more moisturized. The packaging is also recyclable which is great. I have been enjoying this product and the only downside is the cost at $129 which seems a little outrageous to me personally.#trywithtopbox nan
