This stuff is pretty awesome. I have been using it about a week or two ish but I immediately noticed a difference after putting it on the first time. If I compare one side of my face (with cream) vs the other (without cream) , I can see the difference it makes as the side I’ve put the cream on already looks soo much better than the other one. I didn’t even think my skin looked bad beforehand, but it certainly shows a difference in things. Fine lines smooth out, dark circles not so dark, face all the way around just more vibrant looking. It feels great on my skin and while I prefer a different scent, it is still a pleasant smell. Reminds me of roses. I use this everyday at least a couple times a day and I highly recommend trying this product!#freeproduct#trywithtopbox Love
