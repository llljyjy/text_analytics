I’ve been using Resveratrol Lift Firming Cashmere Moisturizer for several weeks in the evening and loving the results!  I DO notice a tightening in areas and love how silky soft my skin feels. The texture is light, creamy and absorbs quickly! I’ve been using this cream after applying Caudalie Resveratrol Lift Instant Firming Serum.  My complexion looks healthy and bright! Healthy Glow!
