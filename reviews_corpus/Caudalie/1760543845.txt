This is my ride or die product. I love it. I bring a mini with me every time I travel. It keeps my face feeling refreshed even after hours of being on stuffy hot airplanes. I use this after washing my face, before applying any other product, and during the day to hydrate. Love the smell of rosemary, it’s not too overpowering. Unless they decide to reformulate, I will continue to buy this. I use it on all of my clients, and have never had any irritation or complaint. Helps my skin stay looking fresh and doesn’t irritate my acne prone skin. Ride or die face product
