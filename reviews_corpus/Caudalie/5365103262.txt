Becoming a big Caudalie fan after purchasing and quickly falling in love with the beauty elixir.  Have been using this HA on damp skin after cleansing and toning before I apply my Tretinoin. I was so pleasantly surprised to feel how soft and hydrated my skin felt the next morning from incorporating this!  I have very sensitive skin and this worked beautifully. I love the smell and packaging too with twist top and pretty pink glass, feels luxurious and like youâ€™re really pampering yourself. This will be in my nighttime routine for a very long time. nan
