I was able to try this product through topbox in exchange for my honest review. I started using morning and night and I was hoping to be in love with this product but it broke my skin out on my forehead. I was not using any other products and I do not know why this happened. Has a light scent which is okay, did not see any any change in my fine lines. This is a glorified moisturizer but did make my skin soft and supple. This did not work for me but so I can not recommend. I was able to try this product through topbox in exchange for my honest review.
