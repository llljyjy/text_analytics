After first try, I got these reaction itchiness and irritated but  it did go away after 10 minutes. So, I thought I would give another chance but unfortunately, same results. Sadly, I’ll be returning this. I’ve never had reaction like these in the past and I am the person who constantly change different products. But I am always consistent with vinoperfect line from caudalie. Been buying them more than 5x the serum and essence. That’s why I didn’t hesitate to buy this one despite the price. But not going to waste my money for something like this. I wish someone can tell me why this is happening. itchiness
