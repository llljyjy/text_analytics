I have used Caudalie products for years, and they are always excellent.  But Premier Cru is the most luxurious Caudalie cream I have tried to date.  It is rich, comforting, and decadent.   If all the popular Vinosource and Vinoperfect lines are too light and airy for you, then you might like the richness of Premier Cru.  I only use it at night, because I think it might be too much by day, since I have oily skin that is easily aggravated by wearing disposable masks.  But for a night/sleeping cream, it is ideal, because it plumps everything up so that you wake up looking less haggard!  Even my lips seem more plump.   Obviously, it is not a miracle worker.  You have to commit to moisturizing the heck out of yourself every single day if you want to maintain the illusion of no crow’s feet .  But it helps, and it is pleasant to use, which helps you stay consistent.  And that’s really the key to good skin----being consistent, no matter what you use.#freeproduct Luxurious and rich
