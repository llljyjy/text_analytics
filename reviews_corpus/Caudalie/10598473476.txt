I got this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and I’m very satisfied with it. After cleansing my skin, I started to apply the mask with a spatula and spread it on my face in really thin layer. Left it on about 15 minutes and when I started to feel that my skin is tight, I washed off with a warm water. That feeling what followed the removal, was unbelievable. Somehow my skin felt free! All that sebum and dirt coming out from the pores, just gave me that awesome weightless feeling. My skin was plump and pure. The pores shrink a little because I couldn’t see those big ones around my nose. I’m loving this mask and I will definitely repurchase it Great mask!
