I Love Caudalie, tried this moisturizer hoping it would brighten my skin. It did, a little bit, but I used it up too fast? Used only a pinky nail amount every night, it lasted only for about 3 months? (Normally I use moisturizer for at least 5 months) It may have been too pleasant that I used too much. Great cream, good result
