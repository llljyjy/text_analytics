As a professional makeup artist and skincare specialist, I am so happy that I had an opportunity to try this under eye cream. I was give. This eye cream complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion. I suffer from dark under eye circles and this under eye cream came to the rescue. The formula did a wonderful job at brightening my under eyes and calming down the color. The metal tip is so cooling which is also awesome especially when I get puffy eyes. The formula has also smoothed out fine lines and wrinkles so all in all it is a great under eye cream and I have seen results already. I would highly recommend this eye cream for not only my clients but friends as well! A life saver for my under eye dark circles!
