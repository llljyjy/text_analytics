I received this face mist as a #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox in exchange for a review.As other reviewers have noted, the scent is quite strong. I personally really like it, but it may not be for everyone. I does smell like you would expect from the highlighted ingredient list. The mint and rosemary stood out most to me, if that helps anyone thinking of buying this without the chance to smell it in person!I do have sensitive skin, and while the ingredients of this don’t irritate me personally, I recognized many of them from lists of common irritants or allergens. If you’re not sure whether you are sensitive to anything listed, I’d recommend getting the smaller size and doing a patch test. I suppose that’s the tradeoff with essential oils. They can have powerful beneficial effects, but they’re strong stuff that doesn’t agree with everyone.I found this especially refreshing to mist my face with several times a day during the even-drier-than-usual spell we’ve been having here in the desert. It seems to keep my makeup refreshed, and the scent is a nice pick-me-up. nan
