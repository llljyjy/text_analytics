I decided to try something new so bought this. I love the consistency and the smell and wanted this to be my new usual, but it was just too gentle for my skin and I just kept breaking out. Regardless, I would still recommend to anyone looking for a really gentle cleanser. Fantastic Product, Extremely Gentle
