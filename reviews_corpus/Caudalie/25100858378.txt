I love the pearlescent quality of the mask. It looks very cute going on. I love that it dries out the skin just the right amount and the skin doesnâ€™t feel stripped after the mask. As someone with oily acne prone skin, I want a mask to absorb the oil and sebum from my skin but not dry out my skin completely. This mask does just that! I was a little skeptical at first, as it felt pretty tight as it was drying but was super impressed after wiping it off. The skin was left supple and glowy yet felt a lot cleaner. I am in love with this mask for sure! Looks good; feels great!
