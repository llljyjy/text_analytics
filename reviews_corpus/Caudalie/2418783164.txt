I love the Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist. I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox but I usually buy this product on my own! After I cleanse and tone I like to use this product before sealing in moisture with a gel or cream. Although this is not the most hydrating mist, Iâ€™ve always liked the smoothing and toning effect it has on my skin. Not to mention, the bottle is aesthetically pleasing and looks great in a shelfie!
