I have always loved Caudalie products and I was so excited to try this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox.  The bottle is a great size and has a lot of product.  I have used the S.O.S. serum from this brand before and enjoyed it as a hydrating serum.  I live in a cold, dry place so I’m always trying hydrating serums.  I really love this.  It has a lovely, light scent.  This product aborbs into my skin quickly and really made it feel hydrated.  It’s not greasy or heavy, but my skin honestly felt better after just one use.  I’m looking forward to making this a regular in my skincare regime. nan
