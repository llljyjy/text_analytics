I have tested multiple brands of eye creams, and most resulted in subtle changes over a few weeks. I received this #freeproduct  #trywithtopbox around a month ago, and I have been using it twice daily, adding it to my beauty routine. The applicator is a metal ball almost, that acts like a face roller to depuff while you apply the beautiful cream itself. I knew this brand was good, but I never had the opportunity to try thry eye products; I have to say that the skin under my eyes is brighter and smoother, the fine lines are less evident, and puffiness is reduced.It makes the skin around my eyes plump so you canâ€™t see the dark circles I tend to get.
