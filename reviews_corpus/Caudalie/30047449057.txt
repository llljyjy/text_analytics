i got this product after seeing it on tiktok and decided to try it. this product has very little to no scent, and it gentle on the skin. when the mask drys, you can see the oil build up on the mask. it leaves me skin to feel smooth, tight, clean, but moisturized and not stripped to dryness. i am a person who has a lot of skin texture, and this mask definitely make my skin feel clean. amazing.
