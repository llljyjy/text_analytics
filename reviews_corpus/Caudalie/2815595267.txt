I genuinely donâ€™t understand the hype about this product. I purchased this and the smell was so overwhelming. I do not like fragrance in my face moisturizer. I had high expectations, especially after reading all the reviews. What a disappointment. The price point is outrageous. I went back to CeraVe for my facial moisturizer. nan
