I have been using it for a month now, luckily I got if from Caudalie for free to test, and this serum is just a delight! Both morning and evening, used right after ’Caudalie Instant Foaming Cleanser’, it’s the most easiest product you can use. It penetrates really well, no shine, perfect base if you use make-up during the day. Also appropriate for my age (45), to reduce age-marks, which is one of the main goal of this product. I highly recommend. Delightful
