I received this #freeproduct in exchange for my honest review.  This is the first time I’ve used Caudalie products, and I am so happy with the results.  I’ve been getting dark spots more on my face as I get older, and I hate them.  This has really made a difference in how noticeable they are.  My face also usually looks dull, and this makes it more bright and youthful looking.  I like the consistency of it, and it leaves my face feeling smooth and not oily.  It doesn’t have a strong smell which I really like.  I usually put it on at night, but I’ve used it during the day under makeup and it works well then too.  I’m super impressed, and will continue using this! Soaks in Quickly
