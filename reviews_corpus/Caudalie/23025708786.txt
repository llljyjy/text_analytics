#freeproduct from #topboxcircleI’ve used a few weeks now and I can’t say I notice a lot of difference. But that could be because some of my issue has been an issue for awhile now.  But I did like how it felt on my eye area. It was cool but also kept the area feeling hydrated. No smell which is good for me. No tacky feeling or residue left nehind. I don’t have much left but will use till it’s gone. All n all a great product when used consistently. nan
