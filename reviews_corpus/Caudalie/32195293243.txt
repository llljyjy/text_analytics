Bought this after seeing it in a vogue beauty secrets video. I love the light mist and cooling feeling but this buuuuurns. Maybe it’s just because my skin is dry but you can smell and feel the peppermint a little too much. Glad I bought the small size, don’t know why people rave about this product. Ouch..
