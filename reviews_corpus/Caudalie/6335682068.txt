I bought it at the drugstore but this really works!!! After only one day (used Am & Pm) I saw a change. I have pcos & i grow facial hair. I struggle with shaving pimples.. this  reduced my pimples & my dark sports where slightly lighter. After 4 days , I had like 3-4 pimples left and my dark spots have significantly lightened. It’s been more than a week now. My friend asked me if I started treating it cuz it was lighter. I use it on my neck & décolleté too , my skin is brighter and I starting to look more even So yesterday I decided to but the serum and moisturizer to use with it. My only concern is if it works that well & fast does it stop at some point when the skin gets used to it? nan
