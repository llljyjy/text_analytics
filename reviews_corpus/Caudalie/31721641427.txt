My skin is very sensitive and it’s so hard to keep it fresh and hydrated during a day because any product that I put on my skin causes a breakout. I tried this one just so it can moisturize my skin before I put my makeup on to prevent my foundation from looking cakey and OMG.... My skin is hydrated and soft, no breakouts so far, it makes my makeup look so natural and literally like it’s my own skin. I recommend this product to everyone who want to keep their skin hydrated and fresh. Highly recommend
