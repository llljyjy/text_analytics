I received this freeproduct with #trywithtopbox. I began using it before bed. I also started using it in the morning under my moisturizer each day. It was very pleasant to smell and did not seem strong or overwhelmingly scented. It went on smooth and formula was non thick or greasy. I liked it a lot and will continue to use it. The bottle is also pretty and looks classic. Free product
