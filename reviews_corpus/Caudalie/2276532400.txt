Absolutely YES. I’m extremely particular with my skin care, especially moisturizers. A Sephora employee recommended this to me and it’s the PERFECT day time lotion. Doesn’t pile in combo with my skin care and looks really good under make up. The smell is faint but nice. I will definitely continue to purchase! absolutely yes
