Returned this product. I was excited to try this most after reading reviews. It sounded lovely. When it arrived I tried it out and the smell reminded me of cat urine. I had to wash it off my face and return it. I’m so disappointed. I’m sure if you don’t find the smell offensive, it’s a great product. I ended up getting the grape water mist instead and LOVE the gentle spritz without the odour. Exchanged for Grape Water Spray
