received this product #FREE in return of my honest opinion.I have been using this product for about a week. It does soften the skin however I don’t notice any of my pores shrinking/disappearing. I use this product before my moisturizer as directed. You can use it as everyday skincare or for setting your makeup. I have not used it for setting makeup since my daily routine is mainly mascara and maybe a little bit of concealer. The smell is a little fruity but I mainly smell mint. Overall I think it’s a good product but need more time to see if there are more benefits. Smells minty
