Very basic serum. Caudalie Resveratrol Lift Instant Firming Serum did nothing to my skin.Pros - light, pleasant scent, no breakouts, very light and perfect for summer.Cons - I did not see any changes (used the whole bottle) and is pretty pricy for not seeing any difference.I might purchase it again just because I loved the scent and texture and was great for my sensitive skin. Good for sensitive skin
