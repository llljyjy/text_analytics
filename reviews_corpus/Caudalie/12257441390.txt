I received this Caudalie Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum compliments of Top Box Circle in exchange for my honest review.  I am 39 years old and started to noticed fine lines and wrinkles a couple of years ago.  Anti Aging products are a tough market as there are so many products out there with much of the same claims.  I have tried so many and most of them do not work.  I have been using this serum for a couple weeks now and there maybe a slight difference, however nothing extremely noticeable.  I am still on the fence about this one as maybe using long term will show more desired results.  This serum has a lotion scent to it. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox On The Fence
