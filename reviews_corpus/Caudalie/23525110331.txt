I received Caudalie Premier Cru Dark Circle Correcting Cream for free through Topbox Circle in exchange for my honest review.This vegan, fragrance free cream formula is intended to fight 8 signs of aging, dark circles, fine lines, and wrinkles, to name a few. It can be used around eyes and on the contour of your lips in AM, PM or both. It has a metal tip that can be used to massage the cream into these areas. It’s also removable for easy cleaning.This product delivers on it’s claims and then some. I have seen dramatic improvement in the smoothness, firmness, and brightness of my undereyes. My fine lines are less noticable and my undereyes have never looked brighter. The cream is rich but non-greasy. It’s absorbed into skin quickly and feels weightless.This product is worth every penny. I recommend checking it out for yourself - you won’t be disappointed!#freeproduct #trywithtopbox Amazing Results
