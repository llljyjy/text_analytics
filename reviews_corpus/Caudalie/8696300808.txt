I’ve tried many serums and I never end up liking them, the sticky sensation they leave on my face after I apply them drives me crazy. Now, Caudalie’s Premier Cru “The Serum“ has been a whole different experience, this serum is not sticky at all (it’s more gel-like) and my skin absorbs it quickly leaving a smooth finish. Been using it for about one month now (morning and night) I can tell that my fine lines are diminishing around my eyes, they seem less pronounced and smoother. I’m so happy with this serum, definitely recommend!! Absolutely LOVE this serum!!!
