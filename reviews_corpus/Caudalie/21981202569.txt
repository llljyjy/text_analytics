Every time I consider switching out this product, I chicken out at the last second and repurchase. It does have a smell, but I LOVE the smell - something about it makes me feel luxurious when smelling and applying it. It’s worked great for me, and I’ve been using this product consistently for about a year! Zero complaints! My Go-To!
