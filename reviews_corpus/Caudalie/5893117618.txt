I’ve been using the Vinopure cleanser for just over a week, and I am already noticing significant improvement in the condition and clarity of my skin. My skin is smoother, less red, and there are no more little white bumps, clogged pores, flakiness, etc. After a lot of research I figured out that coconut oil and coconut-based ingredients in my previous cleansers and moisturizers were congesting my pores and causing my skin to feel “rough“ with little white bumps covering my entire face. Coconut oil is highly comedogenic so I started looking for a completely non-comedogenic cleanser and this is it- my new HG! My Holy Grail cleanser for clearer skin!
