I absolutely love this mask! I only have to leave it on for about 5 minutes, and once I rinse it off, my pores are less visible and any blackheads are gone! I use this every few days, as I have very oily skin, and it keeps sebum from building up in my pores. I love that this doesnâ€™t make my face feel tight or dry afterwards like some clay masks. It simply leaves me with smooth, soft and clear skin! #freeproduct Awesome mask for cleaning out pores!!
