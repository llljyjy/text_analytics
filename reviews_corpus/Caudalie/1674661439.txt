I use this everyday, morning and night. Lost count of how many bottles iâ€™ve repurchased. This helps alot with preventing maskacne and calms my skin down when its irritated. My husband was sunburnt at one point and I used this on his irritated skin and it was also very soothing for him. Cant go without
