This product is fantastic on my skin. Leaves it refreshed and adds a lovely layer of nutrient to the skin. After spraying my face I apply hyaluronic acid serum to absorb on my skin. I then follow up with an antioxidant serum, vitamins c serum, and moisturizing spf. Itâ€™s a holy grail. It also looks beautiful when I add a bit of rms highlight to my skin. It works! It has tons of function. One of my favorite products.
