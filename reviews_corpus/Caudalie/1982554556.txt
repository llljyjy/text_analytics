I kind of kick myself every time I buy this spray.. it’s a bit of an expensive extravagance. But listen, it just smells so good, and the experience of taking 30 seconds out of my day when I’m hot and I’m tired and my skin is a bit dry to spray my face and neck is divine. It’s like I’m momentarily transported to a spa. And it definitely helps with dryness on planes or when I’m wearing a mask. A very, very nice indulgence
