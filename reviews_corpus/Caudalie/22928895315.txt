I received a complementary bottle of Caudalie Premier Cru Serum from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest opinion of this product. I used the serum in the morning before my makeup routine then again in the evening after washing the day away. I immediately noticed how quickly my skin soaked up the moisture without any type of residual film or shiny spots, its so lightweight & lightly scented I hardly knew it was there. After using religiously over 2 weeks I noticed my dark spots were not so dark, the lines/wrinkles around my eyes & mouth especially weren’t as prominent and definitely less noticeable. I’ve already told some of my close friends and family members to give it a try. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox #goodbye crowsfeet Definitely helps lessen signs of aging
