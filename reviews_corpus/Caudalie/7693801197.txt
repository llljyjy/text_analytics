So far I’ve noticed results with the claims but I don’t have many skin problems to start with other than dryness and wrinkles. This serum did address those problems pretty well. Wrinkles have been minimized and are not as noticeable. I have other serums I use with this that address dryness to I’m not sure if this alone is best for that. Overall better than I expected. better than expected
