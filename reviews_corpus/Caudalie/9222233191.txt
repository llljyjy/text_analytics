This is my favourite product to “take off the day” before I start my nighttime skin care routine. I wouldn’t recommend this as a sole cleanser to remove makeup (especially waterproof eye makeup). That said, it is useful when you need a quick refreshing clean up that leaves your skin hydrated and smooth. nan
