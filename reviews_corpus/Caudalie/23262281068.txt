I’ve enjoyed using this Caudalie correcting eye cream, but had hoped to notice more results. I do think it has reduced some of the darkness and puffiness under my eyes, but haven’t noticed improvement to any of the fine lines under my eyes. The cream is a nice consistency and applicator is a nice addition. I’m looking forward to continuing to use it! #freeproduct Dark circle reduction
