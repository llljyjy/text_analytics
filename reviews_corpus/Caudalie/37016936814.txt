I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and have been using for several weeks. I used this clay mask a few nights a week since having it. The mask works great. It is easy to apply and rinse off and gave amazing results. It really got rid of all the excess oil on my face. The scent was the only thing I didnâ€™t enjoy about this mask. The benefit of the oil removal is a fair payoff for the small amount of time I have to smell it. This mask is by far the most effective and easy to use clay mask I have ever tried. I will purchase again possibly in an alternate scent if offered because it was so great. nan
