I love this product! I’ve been used caudalie products before. Living in NYC winters are brutal on your skin, they make it really dry. I applied this products every night past two weeks. And I’m loving it so far. It really moisturizes my skin and makes it soft. I mostly apply it around my neck and face. It’s really rich and smells fine. I would definitely recommend it. #freeproduct#trywithtopbox Great product
