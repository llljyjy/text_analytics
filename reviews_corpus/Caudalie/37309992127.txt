I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review. This cream is so luxe! I apply it morning and night over the serum and over the past month, I have noticed my skin is more balanced. I have dry skin and I really have to work at keeping my skin properly hydrated day and night. The pleasant scent is light and dissipates quickly. For a cream, I find it on the lighter side. When it is fully absorbed, I find my skin has more of a dewy finish, which is very flattering. My skin feels soft and smooth. After over a month of use, I have noticed my skin is healthier overall and it is maintaining proper hydration throughout the day and night and some plumping in my forehead wrinkles. The retinol alternative used in this line, resveratrol, is gentle and non irritating on my face. I have highly satisfied with my results using this product. nan
