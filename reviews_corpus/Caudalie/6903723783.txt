This cleanser really dried my skin out! I had been using a different cleanser for a while and decided to try something new which is why I purchased this! Within a few days, my skin was so incredibly dry, itchy, flaky and sensitive. No amount of cream could help me! It took a couple weeks for my skin to recover after I stopped using it.I really liked the smell and texture of it though! I wish it worked better. My skin is combination! Very oily t-zone. Dried me out!
