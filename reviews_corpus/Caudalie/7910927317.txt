Seeing results after a couple of weeks. I started with the deluxe trial size just to see if I liked it, and I did so I got the full size. For reference, I have super oily and fair skin with post acne marks that stay for months afterwards. I like the way the serum feels on my face, it’s not too thick or oily for my skin. It’s not an overnight miracle but the marks are fading over a couple of weeks rather than taking months to fade so I’m happy with that. Effective
