Love the smell and texture of this product. I used points to get a small tester size. Unfortunately, it wasn’t much product, and I didn’t see much change during the time I used it. So, I loved it for what it was, but probably wouldn’t pay for a large bottle unless I was sure it actually works. Smells and feels good, not sure how effective
