I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox from my honest opinion.  I want to start by saying that I’ve never used a detox mask and so it’s been a good experience because it actually cleared up my pores not to mention the fact that it actually tightened them which is great for the application of anything related to makeup.  The scent is not overwhelming I think is refreshing and I love how cleansed my skin feels.  Thanks for introducing me to a great product!.  I would definitely recommend and is also going to become part of my routine. Absolutely amazing!
