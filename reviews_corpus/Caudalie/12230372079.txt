I really like this as a daily moisturizer! The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the scent is a little unique for a moisturizer... personally I think it smells like pot (nothing wrong with that, its just not exactly what I want to smell first thing in the morning) but I’d buy this product again anyway. Its not ultra hydrating but it does the job! Unique fragrance, but so calming
