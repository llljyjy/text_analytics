I received this serum via #tryitwithtopbox for my honest review. I’ve been using this #freeproduct for a few weeks to ascertain any anti-aging benefits. I typically love the scent of Caudalie products, and this serum is no different. I’m not totally clear if this fragrance is completely natural. The texture is lovely and absorbed into my skin pretty quickly, leaving it a little dewier. Those are the pros. I used it mainly at night and sometimes during the day as well. I haven’t really noticed diminishing of find lines, but then again that often takes even longer than a few weeks use, so I hope it will have more impact in coming weeks. nan
