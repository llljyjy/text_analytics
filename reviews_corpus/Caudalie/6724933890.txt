I love Caudalie and use a lot of their skin products. I bought this due to the hype on Tik-tok a few months ago and use this every second day. All the videos of “the dirt and oil being sucked out“ is not entirely true. Yes this tightens the skin as it drys but so do other masks. The mask separates over the pores and looks as if its drawing stuff out like oily and the sebaceous filaments that people mistake as blackheads but thats not true either. Once you wash it off the pores are still there and honestly I can’t tell a difference from the before though I do notice my face is less oily and makeup goes on smoother. My face also feels calmer and refreshed but I can buy other masks and they work the same. I’d say if you want to try it then go for it because its worth a try but I won’t be repurchasing unless gifted. Alright but I've used better
