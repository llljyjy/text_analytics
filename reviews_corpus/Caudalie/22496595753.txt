This is one brand that I straight splurge on & has its own dedicated shelf bc I’ve acquired such a collection (most are personally purchased & some…like this one, were provided via #trywithtopbox as a #freeproduct). Love the partnering Caudalíe does with Harvard & highly recommend looking into their TET8. ~ Love the inside print w/the Vineyards ~ Inner cardboard inside packaging that folds over & holds cream in place~ Deep jar at 1.6oz running about $120~ Screw off lid w/peel off safety seal~ Loooove the scent of this & most other products by the brand ~ Very smooth format that was much lighter than expected ~ Glides easily along w/absolutely no pull ~ Doesn’t require pressure to ensure full absorption ~ No irritation ~ Love the silky soft after-feel ~ Use in the evenings~ Shelf life at 6 months after opening Another great line by Caudalíe
