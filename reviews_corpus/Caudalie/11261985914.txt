my skin feels brand new. smells amazing, and does what it says. I use toner before using it and it helps remove dead skin. it does have volcanic beads so be careful around your eyes and rinse well, but i haven’t had an issue with that compared to other cleansers w/beads don’t forget to moisturize after :) LOVE
