I received this complimentary from #Topboxcircle for my honest review. I have been using this for a little over three weeks and I can honestly say that I see improvement in my skin. I had a full hysterectomy 9 years ago and am not on HRT therefore my body is not producing any collagen. My skin looks and feels firmer as well as my skin tone looking a lot healthier. Radiant! I love that the serum is 98% natural as well as being vegan. The texture is light and silky and absorbs beautifully. I use it morning and night. It layers great under primers and makeup. Price is steep but it IS worth it! nan
