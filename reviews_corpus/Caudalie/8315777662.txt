It hydrates my dry skin without over drying it. After spritzing this on my face I can feel it tighten a little. It gives a little tingle on face due to the mint but it’s all good after some minutes. It has a botanical scent not too overwhelming. Bottle is cute and it’s glass. When I apply it gives my skin a light natural glow. I have tried it also setting my makeup and it’s amazing. Highly recommended for dry skin. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox I love it
