I’ve repurchased this mask twice now and here’s why:1. It’s a step up clay mask from just a simple clay powder mixed with water.2. It’s not drying nor irritating 3. It’s perfect for getting rid of extra sebum on your skin plus will give you some exfoliation.I can justify the price for this product, the volume is good and will last you for quite a bit, it smells and feels great on the skin + it does it’s job. If used properly will help to maintain clear skin. Amazing clay mask
