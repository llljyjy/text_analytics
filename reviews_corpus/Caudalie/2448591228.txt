Because vinopure worked SO well, I bought the entire vino line (which did not work). To my surprise when it arrived the packaging changed. It looked smaller as well. Even more of a surprise is that it no longer worked the same way at all. I cannot stand when companies do this! It is way too common. You find something you love, and they just ruin it, but keep the price the same. Why did they change it?!
