I got this as a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox . So for my south Asian skin, it still didn’t give me the expected results. It is super hydrating. I have been using it along with the serum and rose toner too , which I bought from Caudalie. It’s been a month now.  I have some dark skin spots on my face, no much difference. Also I do get breakouts one after the other. Hoping for it to work before it gets over Not as expected
