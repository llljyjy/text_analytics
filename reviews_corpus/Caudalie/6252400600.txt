I just started using this eye cream and I really like the texture. It does brighten the eye and when I put on concealer it goes on smoothly. I only gave it 4 stars because I could care less about the metal applicator. Every time I use it I think the cost would be less if this was not part of the packaging. Nice eye cream, not loving applicator tip
