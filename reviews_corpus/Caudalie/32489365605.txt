I chose the mini of this as a freebie during my last Sephora purchase and OMG!! I loved the trial size so much that I went out and bought the full size! It leaves my skin feeling so nourished and hydrated (I have very oily skin and this did not leave me oily at all!) Compared to other serums that typically leave a sticky feeling this one really seeps into the skin leaving it feeling so soft. There is a slight smell to it so if you’re not a fan of fragrance in your skincare this might be a pass but make sure to try it regardless! A little goes a long way with this product it’s definitely worth it. Very hydrating! Not sticky at all!
