#FreeProductSo far I like the night cream. I use it only at night on top of the serum. I do feel that my skin tone is evening out and when I had a breakout while using it the breakout went away pretty fast. I will continue to use this product and let it work ita magic. It takes longer when you have deeper acne scars. I will admit sometimes my face feels over moisturized at night so using just this at night without the serum will be what I do from now on. nan
