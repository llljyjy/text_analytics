Excellent and Phenomenal cream. It is aptly named “The Cream.“ Caudalie has done it again.  Premier Cru cream is a great cream for women who are showing signs of aging. I noticed excellent changes in my skin texture after applying this only for 2 weeks. It plumps up the skin, brightens it, reduces early signs of aging, reduces the visibilty of age spots. The cream is light, non greasy and simply glides on my skin.  I take  small amount and apply it morning and evening. I love the light fragrance and the beautiful packaging.  It is a bit expensive but I believe the jar will last me for 2-3 months. Phenomenal Cream
