I received this Caudalie Premier Cru Anti-Aging serum for free from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review. While I have been using for several weeks, I can say I haven’t seen any dramatic changes in my skin, however I can attest that it definitely has some great benefits. It’s incredibly lightweight, has a subtle scent and feels silky smooth once applied to the skin. My skin seems to soak it up quite quickly and it does give my skin an almost instant plumping effect and has definitely helped give a more tighter, smooth appearance once I apply the rest of my skincare routine and follow with my primer and foundation. The packaging is luxe and gorgeous, I love the colors and how nice and heavy the bottle is. The pump dispenses almost the perfect amount of product for your face, however I’ve been known to use two pumps to apply to my neck and decollate as well. It feels amazing on the skin and does hydrate, though I do have to still apply my other moisturizer which is expected as this is serum and not designed to replace moisturizer in your routine. I like how much more balanced and smooth my skin has looked and felt since adding this serum. It works wonderfully as part of my skin prep routine prior to applying makeup and equally as nice in a night time routine as well. Silky Smooth Hydrating Serum
