This moisturizer has a light floral botanical scent. It’s lovely. Comes in a refillable glass jar which is great. The product itself is a medium-light cream, tiny bit goopy. It spreads easily and feels luxurious without being heavy. My skin felt good using this. Unfortunately I have combination skin and this is formulated for normal to dry, so my face does get oily over the day. Those with normal to dry skin may enjoy this. Overall my skin felt healthy using this, but as I don’t have any wrinkles aside from the typical neck lines, I can’t attest to the results of its wrinkle-smoothing claims. I would recommend others to try this only if pricing is not an issue. nan
