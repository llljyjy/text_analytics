I was lucky enough to get this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox as well as the serum to put to the test in exchange for my opinion. I’m totally head over heals now with the whole Glycolic line. I have a good bit of acne scars and skin discoloration. Dark spots and redness so ive long been on a search for something that actually works to help even out my skin tone. Using the night cream with the serum has worked wonders for my skin. The cream texture is thick and rich, so I was worried at first because it feels really heavy upon first applying, but it turns out the cream it’s not greasy at all and absorbs very fast. I apply it every night. After about 2 weeks my skin cleared out nicely. I’m very happy with these products and have already bought back ups! Love it!
