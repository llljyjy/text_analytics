It’s so hydrating and refreshing! I’ve repurchased this so many times (4+). I use it to freshen up mid day or in the morning before my toner. Toners, serums, and moisturizers absorb better on damp skin (esp. hyaluronic acid). So, I spray this and while it’s damp I apply the products. It gives me unbelievable glow. #skincarehack amazing!!
