Okay. My skin is very sensitive and I would say this product is good but not great for my skin. I like how my makeup looks I use it under or over my makeup. And I use it in the daytime to help with my “mascne” since it says it’s antibacterial. But I think it sometimes causing me some little bumps so I don’t think I would purchase again. okay
