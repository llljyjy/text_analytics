I’ve been using this since Sep 2020 every morning and night to wipe off my make up, old dead skin and extra oil on my face. Since I let my boyfriend use, he also liked it so much! The smell is nice and never bothers and it cleans up whatever you wipe it out. The only thing I consider is that I have to use cotton pads every single time which is not great for the environment and skin because is causes frictions. I have normal skin type but my bf, so we use organic cotton for sensitive skin. This moisturizes our skin right after I use and won’t cause under dry skin even you put makeup on top. Cleans Everything
