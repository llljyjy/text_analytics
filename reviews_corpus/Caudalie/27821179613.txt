Loving this product! I have tried LITERALLY every Vitamin C product available - whether it’s in a cream/liquid/serum or it’s mixed with other vitamins/on it’s own or 10% or 2% - I have never found a Vitamin C product that my skin tolerates. I have been left with burns or I have very bad, painful breakouts. I have been looking for an alternative serum and have absolutely settled on this one and have repurchased multiple times now. When I have breakouts, I tend to be left with dark marks on my face. I have noticed this product has absolutely improved these dark marks over time, and helps to give my skin a subtle, healthy glow every morning. I only wash my face with a face wash at night, and in the morning use only water to rinse my face. After rinsing with water I apply this product and wait 5-10 minutes before moving on to the next step in my routine. Consistency is key for this serum (like any product), and I have followed this routine daily for the last 8-9 months or so. I’ve never had a breakout from this product even with acne prone skin, and I’ve found it has helped improve my overall skin texture as well. I wear makeup daily and have never had any issues or pilling since adding this to my routine as it is a very light, almost milk texture that absorbs into the skin no problem. If you are someone who doesn’t tolerate Vitamin C and are looking for an alternative to help lighten dark spots, improve skin texture, and help keep your skin glowing and healthy, I would absolutely recommend this product!
