I have been on the hunt for an anti-aging hydrating eye cream and have tried so many. This one seemed promising with the high reviews but geez, it wasn’t great. I got pimples under my eyes (I RARELY break out let alone under my eyes?!). The cream was not even hydrating and sadly the metal applicator just smudged the cream around, so I instead had to use my clean fingers to help it absorb. Disappointed and I’ll have to return. Back to the hunt! Breakouts, dryness
