I’ve used several varietals of Caudalie serums for the last 13 years, and LOVED (loved) the previous Premier Cru formula, one of the few oil-free serums that don’t break me out. I wish Caudalie wouldn’t constantly reformulate/drop my holy grails but what can you do. I picked up a deluxe sample first to make sure the new formula works with my skin type - sensitive and breaks out with formulas that aren’t oil free or water based. I’m happy to say that even though this version contains sunflower seed oil, it hasn’t broken me out in the last 3 weeks of use, so I don’t have to kiss the Cru goodbye! Unlike the previous formula, I can still feel the serum on my skin in the morning after applying before bed, and can feel it when I wash my face which is a bit odd for serum. It’s not dry and slightly tacky like the previous formula. A little more skin softening than previous formula
