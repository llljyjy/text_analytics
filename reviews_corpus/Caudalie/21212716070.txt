I received this product free from TopBox Circle in exchange for my honest review. I am a huge fan of Caudalie and use their Premier Cru moisturizer so I was very excited to get to try this product. The Premier Cru Dark Circle Correcting Eye Cream is different than any other eye cream I’ve ever used. The applicator is metal and no matter the temperature it’s also cool when applying the eye cream. It instantly cools and de puffs my under eyes. The cream itself is extremely thick but blends and absorbs into the skin like an absolute dream. I’ve been using this product for over a month now and I’ve definitely noticed a positive change in my under eye skin. It’s less puffy, my dark circles aren’t as noticeable and my skin seems firmer, more hydrated. I can’t praise this product high enough. It deserves more than 5 stars. Best I've ever used!
