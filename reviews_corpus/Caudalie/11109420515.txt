#freeproduct #trywithtopbox First, the glass jar is very thick and nice. I love that the product itself can be purchased as a refill that can be inserted into the glass jar to save on packaging. As for the cream, it is very thick so only a little is needed. If you use too much then it doesnâ€™t absorb and can get clumpy on skin. I have dry skin so this has been working great for me. I am only using it on the most needed areas. If you find it is too thick for you then you can combine it with a serum to thin it out. The scent is a bit strong. There is no added fragrance so it is naturally that strong. thick, very little needed
