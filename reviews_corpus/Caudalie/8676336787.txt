I saw kept seeing this online, so I decided to do some research. People swear by it so I gave it a go. This is a bud pricey, but I’ve been using AM + PM for about a month now and my skin is much brighter and noticeably less blotchy. It did strip my summer tan (oh well) but I’m satisfied with the results and deem this product worth the price tag. I will try out another less expensive alternative after I finish this bottle. But really wouldn’t think twice about purchasing again! Love it!
