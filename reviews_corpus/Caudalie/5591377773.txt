I absolutely love everything about this serum. From gorgeous luxurious packaging to the beautiful light sweet scent that just brightens my day, to the gloriously hydrated, soft and smooth skin it leaves me with. It has very light consistency and my skin just drinks it up immediately on application with no residue left behind. Itâ€™s certainly suitable for any time of the year, but the lasting hydration it offers is especially perfect for the colder months. I am very much looking forward to seeing all the anti-aging results this serum can provide with the continued use. nan
