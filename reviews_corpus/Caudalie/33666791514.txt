I’ll begin by sharing that I’m a massive Caudalie fan! Many of the brand’s products are among my skincare staples. I tried this moisturizer on and off for a year, using as daytime under makeup. After giving it many second chances, I do not recommend. It does not layer well with other products (makes EVERYTHING pill if you layer serums, etc under moisturizer and SPF on top). Every jar I purchased was a different color and consistency so I never knew what I was going to get—which was another reason I kept trying it. It is a light texture but does not dry down and is greasy (not tacky/sticky, though). I did notice brighter and more even complexion, however. I will not be repurchasing simply as it doesn’t play nicely with my other products or oily skin. Good, not great
