I’ve been using this at night. It smells luxurious! The packing is so nice and solid and I appreciated that the cream was sealed up before use. The cream itself is very silky and melts effortlessly onto my skin. It doesn’t leave it feeling sticky, but rather hydrated. It makes my skin so soft! This is my honest review but I did receive this product for free. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Looks good, feels better
