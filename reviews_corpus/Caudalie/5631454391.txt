I’ve been using it for a week now, in the day time and at night and its so hydrating. The fine lines on my forehead due to dry skin are gone, although it could also be from skinceuticals vitamin C serum! The cream is a little thick so you just gotta work it into your skin, and it also didn’t flake for me like other people have said in reviews. Super Hydrating
