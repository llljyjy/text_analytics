I received this product for free from topbox in exchange for my honest opinion. I must say that I am extremely impressed by this product. There are so many eye creams on the market that claim to work and honestly this is the first one I have run across that has ever helped me at all. The packaging itself is absolutely gorgeous and it comes with a metal applicator at the end that can be removed for easy cleaning. The applicator is flat and is meant for soothing the eye area. The cooling effect from the applicator helped my eyes out tremendously and diminished most of the puffiness under my eyes. The cream smooths on really nicely and it absorbs into the skin quickly leaving your skin moisturized. It doesnâ€™t feel sticky or oily. This cream is also gentle on your skin as I did not experience any breakouts while using this product. Very Impressed
