This product has helped my skin so much! I was on accutane for 9 months and have been off of it for 1 1/2 years. I started to break out quite frequently at the year post accutane mark. I bought this off my doctors recommendation and itâ€™s been amazing! It keeps my skin mostly at bae and is gentle on my sensitive skin. A bottle lasts about 4 months of morning and night daily use. 10/10 recommend for a daily acne maintenance serum! Sensitive, post accutane acne saviour!
