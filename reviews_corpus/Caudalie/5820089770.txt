A little bit goes a long way with this cream(I mistakingly used what I thought was a normal amount the first application and it was way too much!) I use just couple of light finger swipes and its plenty for my face and neck. This cream is a bit heavier than I’m used to(I have combination skin) but it works well in these cold/dry winter months. I would probably opt for the regular cream during more humid/warm months. As with all Caudalie products the scent is quite pleasant. Overall it’s a great moisturizer but can’t say I notice any effects other than moisturized skin but perhaps after a few months time I will see more of a difference. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Great moisturizer
