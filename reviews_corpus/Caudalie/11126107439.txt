Just recently found this brand and I absolutely love it. This gel cleanser is awesome when you put it on your face and rub it in it turns to this milky cleanser. I love the smell. I use this product along with the toner, serum, and face mist they do wonders for my skin Iâ€™ve been using them all for about 4 months now and noticed such a difference with my acne gone and the excess oils in my face gone with this cleanser a little goes a long way. nan
