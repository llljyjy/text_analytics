This serum is honestly amazing. I have very light skin and it’s hard for any of my post acne spots to fade completely. Even after a zit is gone, I struggle with redness and PIH for months after. I’ve tried multiple vitamin C products and been left pretty underwhelmed after every one. However, after only about a month of use with this serum from Caudalie I’m starting to notice that my dark spots are fading and my skin is looking much, much more clear. I only use it once a day and opt to use a different serum at night and it’s still made a drastic change. This product is absolutely worth the hype! nan
