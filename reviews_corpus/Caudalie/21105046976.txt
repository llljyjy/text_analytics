It’s gentle enough to work for all skin types, but still powerful enough to provide real benefits. It can be used for so many different purposes, and the small spray bottle is perfect for taking on the go. Polyphenol-rich grape-seed extract is the star of the show. Polyphenols protect skin against the oxidation that we face daily from stress, pollution, our diets, and more. They also act as a natural plumping agent and quickly boost skin’s hydration. On top of that, the formula includes plenty of essential oils that bring a plethora of skin-soothing benefits and a botanical aroma. This spray is a pleasant, gentle pick-me-up for the face, especially midday. It also has the ability to refreshen up makeup. In addition to its moisturizing properties, when used as a primer, it provides a smooth surface for makeup to adhere to for a look that lasts all day. nan
