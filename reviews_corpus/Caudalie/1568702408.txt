I got diagnosed with perioral dermatitis this year  - which is a fancy term for an allergy-induced rash around the nose and mouth that makes the skin extremely red with tiny bumps - and couldn’t find anything my skin would tolerate.This is hydrating, soothing, gets rid of nearly all of the redness, and has an almost blurring effect from the matte finish. This, the grape water mist, and green clay/zinc mask have been literally life-changing. If you suffer from eczema, dermatitis or rosacea and don’t respond well to thick, white moisturizers - try this and the grape water. A holy grail for sensitive, oily prone skin
