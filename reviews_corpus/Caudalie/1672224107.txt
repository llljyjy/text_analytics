Caudalie Premier Cru. You can immediately tell from the beautiful and heavy packaging that this cream is luxurious. It’s very thick which is good for my dry skin. I love the scent of Caudalie products, including this one. The thing is my hubby doesn’t like most skincare scents so I would prefer it as fragrance free. I’ve been using it for over 3 weeks now and my skin is glowing! Good stuff. #freeproduct Luxurious Cream
