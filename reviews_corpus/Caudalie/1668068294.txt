I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox for my honest review. First let me say how luxurious this formula is. The cream has such a nice thick texture with a pleasantly light scent. I love that how light and hydrating it feels on my face. It goes on smoothly and soaks into my skin. I typically use this after applying the serum in the morning and evening as part of my skincare routine. After a few weeks of use I can see a difference in my skin texture. I also love that it can be used on my décolleté as I’m seeing early signs of aging from tanning in the past. So luxurious!
