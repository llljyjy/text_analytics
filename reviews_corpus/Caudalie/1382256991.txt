This cleanser is so gentle  that it doesn’t remove eye makeup very well. After cleansing,  I have to use an additional eye maker remover which was what I was trying to avoid. It’s good for when you you aren’t wearing makeup.  The scent and texture are nice and it doesn’t irritate eyes. Gentle cleanser
