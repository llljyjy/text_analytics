I really wanted to like it, because I’ve been looking for a rich moisturizer for winter and I use many other Caudalie products such as serums, eye contour creams, etc. But this one is just too greasy. It calms my dry skin when I’m applying it, but then it makes it look super oily, and on top of that it never absorbs. I can never wear make up over it because if I touch my skin, the product rolls off as if I just did a peeling... Super annoying. Greasy and doesn't absorb
