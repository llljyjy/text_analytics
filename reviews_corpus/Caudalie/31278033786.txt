I wanted to try this product since a long time and got a sample with one of my Sephora order... I always struggled finding the right serum for my skin and my concerns: I have a oily combination skin with some acne due to hormones). The texture is light, fresh and it doesnâ€™t stick, almost like a light cream. After a few weeks of use, I can see a net change and my dark spots on the t-zone are starting to go away. My skin texture is smoother and really improved. I use it on a clean face after passing an acne toner and before a moisturizing cream (gel).I loved it and ended up purchasing the 30mL - it is quite expensive so wanted to make sure it worked for me. Improves skin texture and dark spots
