I bought this on a whim hoping it might help calm down the recent redness I’ve been experiencing on my cheeks.  After reading through a bunch of the reviews, I wasn’t sure it would help, but figured it would at least make a nice refresh spray if it didn’t.  I’ve incorporated it into my pm skincare routine and use it randomly during the day if my skin feels parched.  I can really tell a difference with the redness after less than a month and the spray feels very refreshing when I need a cool down.  I’m definitely repurchasing as this is now a staple product for me. Skin calming!
