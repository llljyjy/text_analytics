I love the Caudelie Vinosource line, I’ve tried a couple items from vinopure that were pretty good gentle and effective products but this toner is probably the best toner I’ve used next to a k-beauty brand that I love--- that is a bit difficult to get ordered right now. It doesn’t irritate my skin and it’s pretty good at getting my pores really clean without drying my face out. It works like a lotion-toner. It’s really good at stopping the spread of blemishes. Awesome gentle toner
