I love this little spray. It’s perfect for rehydrating the skin before applying my moisturizer, or just refreshing your skin. I also think it’s a very fair price. I can’t say it does anything remarkable for the skin, but I just love a simple facial mist. This spray is also pretty good and is a relatively fine mist and is an aerosol bottle. nan
