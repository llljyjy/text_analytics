I wanted to love this, since I paid for it, but I’m afraid this is not the product for me. I didn’t enjoy the scent and the cream didn’t do anything for my skin. It sort of sat on top and never really soaked in. I used it with the Premier Cru serum and neither Wow’d me. Back to the drawing board. :-( Not for me.
