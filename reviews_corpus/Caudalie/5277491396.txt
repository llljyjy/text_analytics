I’m always afraid of new serums causing my eczema to flare and this has a slight fragrance, which made me worry more. It has actually been a wonderful serum for my skin! I have had zero flare ups since I started using it, it helps my moisturizer absorb better and has a really nice texture. Five stars all around! If you have sensitive skin, I’d recommend giving this an honest try. eczema safe
