#freeproducIncredible cream. Caudalie is a brand with very good quality products And I’m not referring to good quality results, I suppose you know that the results of what creams promise are very subjective and also depend a lot on each person...they are not magic potions . If you don’t start taking care of yourself from the age of 21/22, it’s all luck or genetics, of course taking care of yourself will help, it won’t hurt, although you won’t start on time.This cream is very unctuous, thick, I have combination skin, sometimes considered oily, and not a single pimple has come out since I’ve been using it (1/2 weeks) It moisturizes a lot, even with  combination or oily skin hydration is vital, it goes a long way... I use it twice a day, I don’t even spend the first amount of the bottle, as if it had just started, it hydrates great, and the smell is very pleasant. Also the touch that it leaves you after the application on the skin is soft and silky. Glycolic Night Cream
