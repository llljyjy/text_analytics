I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest opinion. I’ve been using the Caudalie Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum for a month in the mornings and sometimes at night. The serum is lightweight, litely scented, and applies smoothly. My skin feels so soft, smooth, and hydrated after using this. I haven’t noticed any changes in my fine lines or dark spots though. I hope this changes with continued use. This serum is pricey but I would recommend it if you’re able to splurge. Great serum!
