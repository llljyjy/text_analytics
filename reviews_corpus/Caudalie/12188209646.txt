this cleanser is insane! i tried it last night for the first time. now i will admit that my skin did feel a bit uncomfortable while using it but thatâ€™s because i was rough on my skin before using this cleanser.. after washing it off, my skin looked so clean and fresh and when i woke up the next day a couple of the small bumps on my forehead got smaller and my skin tone looked more even!! if you have extremely sensitive or super dry skin, i do not recommend. but if u have normal, combo, oily, or acne prone skin, you should definitely try this out! golden!
