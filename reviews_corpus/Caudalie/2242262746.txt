Initially i thought this was a hydrating mist. I got the mini at first i always put it under make up and mever really thought much of it, thinking that it would be perfect to refresh my face and hydrate.. once i was out i decided to repurchase it.. tried it again on bare skin thinking it would hydrateâ€¦ lol completely wrong. I should have read the description lol but all that being said Its VERY smoothing and tightens skin and luckily for my i have oily/combo skin so it works out for me. ALSO w that being said i probably wouldnt repurchase right away.If you get oily during the day this will definitely help control the oils on your face. If your are looking for something hydrating, this is not it. NOT HYDRATING. REPEAT NOT HYDRATING.
