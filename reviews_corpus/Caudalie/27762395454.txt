I had the lovely opportunity to try Caudalie Premier Cru “The Cream“ for my honest opinion.  It’s a great anti-aging moisterizer that worked great for my combo skin, fine lines and wrinkles.  I especially noticed a big difference in my forehead lines and frown lines...they diminished after a few minutes of applying The Cream, I was amazed, especially because I applied my make-up afterwards(letting the Cream absorb a few mins 1st) and normally and sadly my make-up settles into my fine lines/wrinkles...Well, that didn’t happen with each use of The Cream! Definitely will be purchasing in the very near future and have recommended to my Beauty gurus.  This product is vegan, clean beauty & the jar is refillable-all u do is pop out empty pod&put in new one-The packaging/Jar are recyclable. Also, alittle of this Cream goes A Long Way! Definitely use morning and night. #TryWithTopbox #FreeProduct Premier Cru The Cream
