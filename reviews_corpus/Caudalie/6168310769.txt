This has a beautiful texture. It’s creamy and velvety. I found this to be hydrating and nice on the skin especially layered with other actives. I deducted two stars because the scent is very strong to me and burned by eyes. Also, the ingredients aren’t that impressive for this product to be so expensive. For $70, almost all the highlight ingredients should be near the top of the ingredient list. Now this is my opinion and everyone should do what’s best for their skin but this just doesn’t cut the cake for me. Good but not great
