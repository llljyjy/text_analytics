I love the scent and the texture when applying however I haven’t seen any brightening in my skin after using this moisturizer for over a month. Other reviewers have said that it doesn’t go well with other products and I agree. Whenever I use this under my makeup, I have a difficult time applying my make up because it pills and turns flaky - especially on my eyebrows. I had to wash my eyebrow brush after because there were so many white flakes caked on it. Not a big deal but something to consider if you’re looking for a moisturizer to wear under makeup. Smells great. Flakes when applying under makeup
