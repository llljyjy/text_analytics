This is my 3rd time buying this face wash. I use it once in the morning then twice back to back at night. I have very sensitive acne-prone skin and this was a cleanser I could really on for taming and cleaning my breakouts. Along with the other prodcuts ive been using, this is seriously a staple. Third time and I will never complain
