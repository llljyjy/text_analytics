I have dry and sensitive skin. I have been using the Caudalie Premier Cru Skin Barrier Rich Moisturizer with Bio-Ceramides for over a week now. After shower and cleaning my face I would apply this cream for hydration. My experience is absolutely wonderful so far. I feel the result of perfect hydration and amazing softness. The application was very easy, super fast absorbable facial cream. I love the scent, not too strong, almost citrus.I like to use this cream after a day being outside in winter conditions. I highly recommend to try out this facial cream for sensitive skin! #freeproduct Perfect hydration in winter
