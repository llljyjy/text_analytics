I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox. I used this cream at night after applying serum. It didnâ€™t feel heavy, and my skin felt really soft right after application up until when I woke up the next morning. My skin is dehydrated/dry type that gets oily to overcompensate, and this cream definitely hydrated it well. I did not wake up oily. My pores seemed to get clogged less often too, which was a huge plus. Overall, I get super excited to be able to use this at night since my skin is doing so much better as a result! By far the best night cream for dehydrated skin
