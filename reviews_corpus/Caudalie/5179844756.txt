This is a great facial mist. I have used it after applying eye makeup and concealer to spots on my face and it leaves a nice, dewy glow. I have also used it after just moisturizer and it feels and smells nice. It has a faint grapefruit smell. Would reorder but I think this small size will last me a while since I alternate between this and my Mario badescu mist. great buy!
