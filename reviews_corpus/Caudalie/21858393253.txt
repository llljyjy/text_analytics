Very good and gentle make up remover. I usually use a two phase make up remover from Lancôme and Nars, and this was quite a bright surprise. Way much more gentle to my skin. There is no strong smells as well, which is a good bonus for me. I don’t like those sweet and super good smelling skincare products. So good! very gentle!
