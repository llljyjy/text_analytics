I received this #freeproduct from#trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest opinion. Caudalie Cru Dark circle correcting eye cream itâ€™s fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised when I started using it on my crows feet and dark circles. Within two days I noticed a difference, the lines were fading and my make up was much smoother in the creases. I love the applicator and a little goes a long way. I also suffer from dark circles and bags under my eyes and this instantly freshened up my eyes and made my make up look flawless. I highly recommend this product. No more raccoon eyes
