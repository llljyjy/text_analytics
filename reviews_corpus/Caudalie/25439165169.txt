I love this product. It feels very hydrating at the same time that is very lightweight, so it works great for day time. It did not affect the appearance of my pores so I strongly recommend for the oily skin friends out there. It is the best day moisturizer I have used that addresses firmness & elasticity - and even better, it’s also clean! I have tried many different others, and this offers the best combo of clean + lightweight + hydrating + lift. I’m 29, I have an oily skin that now requires care for fine lines and wrinkles, and I live in a dry area (which offsets some of the oily skin issues). Fantastic
