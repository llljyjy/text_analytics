I got this before the start of winter to prepare my skin to the cold. At first I enjoyed the velvet texture this gave my skin but my skin always looked refreshed and plump in the mornings which is a plus. This definitely is helping keep my skin hydrated and I donâ€™t know how any other night moisturizer can compare to this product now. nan
