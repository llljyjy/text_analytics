#topbox #caudalie #gifted #sponsored #freeproduct #trywithtopbox- I was gifted with Premier Cru The Rich Cream by Caudalie Paris and Topbox in exchange for my honest review. It came in well packed and sealed.It targets 8 signs of aging (Deep wrinkles, finelines, firmness, volume, elasticity, age spots, nutrition, and radiance) with the TET8 Technology. It has Bioceramides that helps with intense hydration. This product is also paraben-free, natural, vegan, and eco friendly.It is indeed a rich cream. It’s very hydrating. I like it as it doesn’t leave any white casts. It absorbs well on skin. It’s great for people with dry skin. No breakouts for me too and I’m using this morning and before bedtime . In more than 2weeks of using, I noticed how it hydrates the area with finelines, and I can tell it minimizes it. I’ll definitely continue using this since my skin loves it. My skin loves it
