So far I’ve really enjoyed this serum. It’s got a amazing smell to it which I absolutely loved. After using the serum my face felt smooth, soft, and refreshed. It absorbs nicely into the skin and doesn’t leave any sticky residue like some other brands do. I’d highly recommend this product to others. 5+ stars from me. #freeproduct #topboxcircle Loving it
