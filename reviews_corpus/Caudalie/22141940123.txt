This serum is pretty luxurious. My skin type is oily with large pores, I’m 34 years old. I use it at night after I wash my face and use a toner so I can benefit from its full effects. It has a really nice light scent that I can only describe as floral but it’s not over powering. It does soak into the skin fairly quickly and there’s no sticky residue. My hands do feel tacky after applying though so I wash them right after application. I have no complaints and I truly do feel I’ve noticed supply skin without all the extra oil production. I will say my T zone gets oily fast but I don’t notice it getting oily any faster. I really like this over all and it just feels luxurious so I recommend it. The bottle comes with a lot so for the time it will last you it is worth the price tag. #trywithtopbox Fresh & Light
