I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox for an honest review. I have been using the Caudalie pore minimizing instant detox mask for the past few weeks and noticed significant differences in my skin. I have been using it once a week and leave it on for 5-10 minutes. I have been really loving this detox mask as there is no fragrance. In addition, this mask unlike other masks that I have tried out in the past does not make my skin dry out after and leaves me glowing. My pores have become noticeably minimized. nan
