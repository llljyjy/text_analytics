I received this #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox and I love it. To start, blown away by the gorgeous product packaging. Itâ€™s a nice bottle with pump dispenser. The mist is nice and light and hydrating which really helps my dry skin during a cold Chicago winter. You can use it before makeup, or after for a dewy finish. Or just on a day off with no makeup to stay hydrated! Overall this will be joining my regular routine! fresh
