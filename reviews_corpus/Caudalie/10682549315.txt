I received this #freeproduct  @Caudalie Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum, from #tryitwithtopbox for an honest review. I used at mornings and nights after my toner on my face, neck and décolleté. I absolutely have this beautiful healthy glowing skin my poor dry mature skin was dryer than ever because of this cold weather. I like this texture it’s lightweight and glides on the skin very quick plus the pleasant smell it’s beautiful love this presentation and the color made me happy it’s awesome thanks to the excellent principles actives/ingredients that really works wrinkles, dryness, firming, glowing feeling younger again. Highly recommended it!!! BEST SERUM EVER!!!
