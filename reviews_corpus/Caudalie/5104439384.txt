I have to say I love the packaging of this premier line, so stunning and definitely feels expensive. In terms of the product itself, the serum felt lovely on the skin and it left my skin feeling hydrated. I cannot say I saw much improvement in the dark spots and hyperpigmentation on my face to justify the price tag. I think for a premier serum, I definitely expected to see a noticeable difference in my skin. This product was gifted for an honest review. nan
