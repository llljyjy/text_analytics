I used this for 2 nights straight and I’m already seeing a difference in my skin. I cleanse with Glossier milky jelly, use this serum, then Moisturize with an Elizabeth Arden moisturizer and my skin is INSANE right now. The sun spots and freckles are fading, the texture has improved (after 2 days?!) — I never write reviews but I had to review this to tell you: BUY IT + TRY IT. It’s worth the price for the results and the time it takes to see them! buy it + try it - 5 stars
