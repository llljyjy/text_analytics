Received this from #Topbox Circle as a product test. I know this is an expensive item and I expected much as such. The cream itself is lovely and the metalic applicator gives a nice, cooling feel when put on.  I used AM and PM.  My husband commented on the reduction of dark circles, a big win.  I did not notice any help with my eyebags which are large.  Would probably not purchase myself as I did not feel the cost justifies the results I obtained, but everyone is different. Luxury Eyecream
