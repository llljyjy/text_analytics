This is 100% a product that should only be used at night! One of the only intense moisturizers I’ve ever tried that provides serious hydration and will leave your skin feeling super soft for days. I have combo skin and honestly I don’t think this could work for anyone as a daytime moisturizer. Think of it as more like a nighttime mask and you will love it and see results. Also smells so refreshing. nighttime moisturizer for soft supple skin
