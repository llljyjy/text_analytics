Caudalie is one of my favorite brands, unfortunately this cream seems a bit thick or heavy for my skin. The scent gives me nostalgia of my grandmotherâ€™s creams, I think it smells like a mix of baby powder and roses. If your skin is on the more dry side and you like thicker creamy moisturizers, this may be right up your alley! -#freeproduct luxe but a bit heavy scented
