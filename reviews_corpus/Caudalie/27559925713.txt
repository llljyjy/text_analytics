i have been eyeing this since i started my job at a sephora in kohls.  i finally ran out of my cleansing balm and picked this up.  i am in love with this product!! it smells nice but not strong, all of my makeup comes right off with no struggle, even with waterproof mascara.  it can leave my eyes foggy but it is way less than other makeup removers i’ve used in the past and it doesn’t hurt my eyes.  i can’t recommend this product enough. best cleansing oil!!!
