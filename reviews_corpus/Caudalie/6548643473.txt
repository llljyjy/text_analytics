I am obsessed with Face Mists. I’m constantly trying new ones, but I always come back to this one (seriously I buy it in between trying every other face mists!) I’ve tried the Tatcha, Drunk Elephant, Laneige, and Mario Badescu, to name just a few, and this one is by far my favorite. It’s so light and fresh and cooling—plus it’s not sticky like so many others. It has a nice cooling mint kind of feel, which is just so lovely and refreshing when you need a pick me up. I’ll use it as a toner if I’m feeling lazy, I’ll use it as a setting spray just to feel that cooling mist, and I’ll use it midday just to feel refreshed. Seriously can’t recommend enough!
