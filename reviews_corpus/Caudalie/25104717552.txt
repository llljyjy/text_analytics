I got a free sample of this cleanser in a different order and decided to grab the full size. At first, I really liked it. It has a nice cooling feeling and makes your face feel fresh. I thought it was soothing my redness, but Iâ€™m not sure if I see much of an actual difference in my skin anymore. A little bit goes a long way and lathers nicely! Cool & Fresh.
