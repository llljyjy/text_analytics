Works well at taking off makeup at the end of the day when I’m too lazy to wash my face completely. It’s gentle and lightly fragrant which I love. The only thing is with the “pump” style bottle is it tends to disperse more product than I need, thus meaning I’m going through it quicker than I would the average micellar cleanser. Would be better if they had a different style that didn’t waste so much product. nan
