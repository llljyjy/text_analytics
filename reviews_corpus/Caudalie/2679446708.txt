I received the Caudalie Resveratrol Lift Firming Cashmere Moisturizer for free from topbox to try and give my honest opinion. I have to say that this is an amazing moisturizer. The scent alone is top-notch. Itâ€™s not heavy or greasy and leaves the skin feeling silky smooth. I have a lot of dry patches on my skin and this helped with those. I feel like this cream has made a huge difference in my skin. I also love that this is a vegan formula that contains shea butter, hyaluronic acids, and resveratrol. Great ingredients for firming and combating dryness! I would highly recommend this product. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Try it!
