I received this product for free from Topbox Circle and Caudalie in exchange for my honest review. This is my first time trying a Caudalie skincare product. I love the ingredients and this elegant bottle so much. I’ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I apply it twice a day right after my cleanser. I can say that this serum has left my skin feeling smooth and hasn’t caused any irritation or breakouts. It’s lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving any sticky feeling. It contains a fragrance that is 100% natural origin and it doesn’t bother me at all. However, I haven’t noticed much of a difference in my skin yet when it comes to anti-aging. I will continue to use this product and I hope to see better results.⁣⁣ #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Good Product
