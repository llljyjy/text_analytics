This is some miracle cream in a little jar. It’s quite thick but quickly absorbs into my skin, making my skin feeling plumped and moisturized. After just a couple use at night time, next morning when I wake up, my skin looks brightened and radiant. I use this after washing my face and applying the Vinoperfect radiance dark spot serum. I have sensitive skin but don’t have any reaction with this cream. Love it, and would recommend it to everyone! One of my favorite night creams
