I gave this serum a good while to do some magic. About 3 weeks. I used it in the morning & at night following cleansing. It does immediately make your skin feel tighter. I would say I could also notice a brighter complexion. You will absolutely have to follow up with a moisturizer after if you have any inkling of dry skin. It’s winter so my combo skin gets dry easily & I was lucky enough to receive the coordinating cream & used that to follow up with the serum. Once you add a moisturizer over top the dryness lifts away. The product does have a grape fragrance to it. Not a fake grape scent like pop but a natural grape scent (they do use grapes in the products) I’m not sure if I’ve noticed any difference in fine lines, although I do only have some lines around my eyes so that may be why.
