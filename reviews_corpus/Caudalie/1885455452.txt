I have dry mature, 42 year old, skin. I’m light skin toned with a little redness. I use snail mucin everynight, A313 every other night and this product on the other nights. My skin looks better than it ever has. On the nights I use thia my skin is less red. What i lobe is how hydrating it is though. It’s hard to find crrams this thick. It has never flaked on me. So thick and amazing
