This serum promises a deep hydration and firming of the skin. I found the texture very light. What is great is that it is very smooth and absorb into the skin quickly. Thereâ€™s no stickiness or greasiness afterwords. My combo skin tends to get very dry during winter so I felt I needed more hydration. It has a nice cooling/firming sensation when applying and I can tell this is a good anti-aging serum but not moisturizing enough. nan
