This serum is amazing! I am very impressed with how hydrating this serum is. Most serums says they are hydrating but they donâ€™t always provide enough moisture but this one definitely does. It has a wonderful scent and feels very silky and smooth. It really sinks into my skin and makes it so soft and smooth. It works well to fight signs of aging. It helps plump my skin, which smooths out my fine lines and tightens my skin.  I would definitely recommend! #freeproduct Works great!
