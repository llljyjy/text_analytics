I really love this cream. I have been using it in the day and at night. I love the texture of it. It feels soo luxurious. I really like how it feels on my skin. I have combination skin and it has been working nicely with my skin type. It has a perfect kind of finish on my skin, it gives it like a satiny finish. Very nicely hydrating and I love all the anti aging properties. The packaging is beautiful. Its a glass container that you can buy an insert for a refill. I love that its also environmentally conscious. Overall I am so grateful for the chance to try this product and will definitely purchase once I am done. This is a holy grail product for me. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Love this cream
