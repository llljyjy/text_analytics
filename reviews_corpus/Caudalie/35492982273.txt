I received this product for free from Topbox in exchange for my honest opinion.My first impression of the product was that the packaging was so cute! Honestly, it was a great decision for Caudalie to repackage this product. I was a little afraid that the face mist would have a strong scent, but I was wrong about that. I could smell it from the packaging but surprisingly the scent was very subtle after spraying and fades quickly. The dry down is non-sticky and the mint in the mist leaves my skin feeling very fresh. Bonus points for the very, very fine mist!#trywithtopbox #freeproduct Great refresher for any time of the day!
