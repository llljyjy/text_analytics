I have repurchased this product a few times. I love that the spray is light and refreshing. It doesn’t have a strong fragrance or odor. I would say that this is a luxury and not really a must have. I started using this because I wanted very lightweight, minimal moisture. My pores clog easily with cream moisturizers. This leaves your skin feeling clean, smooth and refreshed. It doesn’t do anything extraordinary, its just a time saving, relaxing way to moisturize your skin. A Little Luxury
