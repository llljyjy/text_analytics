I have been using this cream for about a week now, maybe more. It’s hydrating which is great for this time of the year however it causes me to breakout. I guess it’s too heavy. It seems light in the jar and in my fingers. I thought it was because I applied it directly to my skin so I tried rubbing between fingers and then topping on my skin and that helped some but my skin hasn’t cleared up. I noticed if I used it over serum or essence it’s not bad not good directly on my skin. My skin now looks bumping/rough. I look like I have a rash. I was looking forward to trying this cream to get the results it claimed and I will keep trying.#freeproduct #trywithtopbox Hydrating
