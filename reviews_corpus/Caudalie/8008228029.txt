I am a big believer in high-end skincare, and Premier Cru eye cream is definitely a new favorite. I use it in the morning and evening and I have gotten wonderful results in reduction of both puffiness and lines. I love the unique applicator! It feels cool on my skin and it is such a nice touch. It’s also less wasteful than using my fingers. I’ve also seen a reduction in the appearance of my smile lines and forehead lines, as well. There’s no scent to clash with my other products, and it’s soothing on the skin. #freeproduct nan
