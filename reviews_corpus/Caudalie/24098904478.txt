I have been enjoying this mist! I received this #freeproduct through #trywithTopBox in exchange for my honest review. On first impression, this mist and it’s bottle have a very luxe feeling and appearance. The bottle is almost a foggy thick glass look and feel. I love it.The mist sprayer is wonderful, it’s so fine and delivers just enough product with one spray. Now the formula is lovely. It has a rejuvenating feeling whe applied to the skin and leaves a cooling effect also. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is simply because of the scent of this product. The scent is a menthol, lemongrass type scent and is too much for the face. I would’ve marked this mist as perfect if it wasn’t for the scent. I love everything else about it, I just really do not care for the scent on my face. If the scent was lighter or no scent, this product would’ve been a 20/10 stars. I still recommend it though because the formula and component are amazing and there are people that  could love the scent. Near perfect mist
