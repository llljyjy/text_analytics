I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and have been using it day and night for 5 weeks.  This serum has a floral scent and a lightweight, milky consistency.  The packaging is sturdy and the pump can be twisted to the left to lock so that none of the product is accidentally spilled.  I use one pump on my face and one pump on my neck and chest.  The serum feels sticky on the face at first, but this residue dissipates after it fully soaks in.  Out of the eight signs of aging this serum claims to target, I find that itâ€™s most effective at elasticity, firmness, and fine lines.  After application, I immediately feel my face tightening.  This sensation is tingly, but not uncomfortable.  Over time, the fine lines around my mouth and eyes are more smoothed out and less deep.  I did not notice any difference in terms of dark spots and radiance.  I have dry skin, and I did not find that it provided substantial hydration.  I had to follow up with a heavy moisturizer for my skin to feel quenched. Great for firming skin and smoothing fine lines!
