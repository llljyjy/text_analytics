I tried to start incorporating double cleansing into my skincare routine and this destroyed my face. At first it left my skin feeling supple and hydrated but over the course of a week I began to break out heavily on my forehead (not an acne prone person). I guess my face just doesnâ€™t like oils. Micellar Water works way better as my step 1 to double cleansing. Sea of Pimples
