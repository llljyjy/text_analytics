The face mists I typically use in my routine basically replace my toner/essence, as a first step before my skincare after washing my face. I go for hydrating mists, with ingredients like ceramides, hyaluronic acid, etc. This mist-- is not a hydrating one. The packaging itself is gorgeous-- glass bottle, and the spray is luxurious-- delivers the most perfect fine mist. Upon application, you’ll notice the immediate smell of menthol, along with other essential oils, and feel a minty feeling on your skin (due to the peppermint). Honestly, I am weary of essential oils in skincare as it can be irritating, so I don’t quite like most of the ingredients in here. Anyways, in terms of effect on skin, I don’t see much, though I can see how this can be nice for someone who lives in a hot climate and wants some refreshing sprays once in a while. However, that is not my lifestyle and I don’t need “refreshing“ sprays, I need hydrating sprays with more skincare benefits, so overall these does not quite fit in my routine. Additionally, my skin can be a bit sensitive at times, so the menthol feels more like it can be irritating rather than helpful. Refreshing, but not so useful
