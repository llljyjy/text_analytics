I received this Vinoperfect Radiance Dark Spot Serum as a #freeproduct from #trywithtopboxIt helps with dark circles, dull skin and dryness. This product feels very smooth and non greasy when applied and is well absorbed by am.Since the pandemic Iâ€™ve been dealing with adult onset acne and maskne as well. The night routine from the collection cleared up my skin significantly after just a few nights. My skin is clearer and brighter only after a few weeks. My skin feels very soft and moisturized and as an added bonus I see fewer fine lines!! Absolutely love the light feel and I love that there is a light scent and its not too overpowering.I also used Caudalie Vinoperfect Serum as well. I felt my skin was brighter and was definitely smoother after just a couple days of using the two together. This really is an excellent and extremely effective skincare line A product that actually works!!
