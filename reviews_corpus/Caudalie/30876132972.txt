I received Caudalíe Resveratrol Lift Firming Cashmere Moisturizer as a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox, in exchange for my honest feedback.I absolutely love the thick consistency of this moisturizer. It is not sticky, but smooth and fast absorbing. My skin felt silky to the touch. The fragrance is light, but aromatic. Not only does it add in the lifting of the skin, but it added brightness to my complexion. Caudalíe has never disappointed, and it didn’t cut corners with this moisturizer either. Phenomenal Moisturizer with lifting results.
