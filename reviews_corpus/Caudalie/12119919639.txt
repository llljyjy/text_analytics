I’ve been using this morning and night after a serum, and I find it leaves my skin feeling very I refreshed and soft. It has a pleasant, but not overpowering smell and a little goes a long way, so I expect it to last a while. It’s got great, proven ingredients including resveratrol, hyaluronic acid (which I’ve used quite a bit before) and collagen. It’s easy to use and apply. No hesitations recommending this to others! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox pleasant smell, soft skin
