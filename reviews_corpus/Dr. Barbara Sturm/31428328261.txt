The face cream is really good and feels really gentle on the skin. It gives a smooth soft finish. It has a natural scent and not fragrantic which I love. The consistency is not heavy at all and a little goes a long way. The skin feels moisturizing and dredging after with a natural glow. I also use this cream as an under eye cream for my dark spots.
