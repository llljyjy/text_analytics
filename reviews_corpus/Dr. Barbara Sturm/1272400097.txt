I recently tried Dr. Barbara Sturm products for the first time, and have been very impressed. This moisturizer especially surprised me. It has a very light weight, smooth texture. I tend to have dry, sensitive skin, so I usually opt for thicker or heavier moisturizers. It is winter, and this moisturizer seems to be doing the trick just fine, Iâ€™m very impressed. Just like with the other products from this line, I find a little bit goes a long way. Awesome lightweight but powerful moisturizer
