I put this on as a night cream and like many other reviewers, I woke up with tiny white heads mainly on my forehead but a few random whiteheads all over my face but felt like the cream was really moisturizing. So a bit of a mixed bag here. Loved how my skin looked with the exception of the tiny white heads. Unfortunately, my skin is prone to this type of irritation (and sadly I can’t figure out what drives this), but most other products that have irritated my skin have done more damage - caused more white heads and a lot more redness. I won’t be able to see how this product works in the long term, so my only suggestion would be to try to get a sample of this before investing in it - it’s not cheap, so want to make sure it won’t irritate your skin. What's causing all these little white heads?
