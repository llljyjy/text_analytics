I bought a sample size of these drops in the rewards bazaar. I used it several days in a row on no make-up days. I took selfies of freshly cleansed skin, face with moisturizer only, and face with moisturizer combined with glow drops. Comparing moisturizer only to moisturizer with glow drops, there is no discernible difference. I judged it after 5 minutes to allow the product to dry first. These drops did nothing for my skin. Don't bother!
