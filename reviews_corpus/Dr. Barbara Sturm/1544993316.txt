I have been trying this face cream for over a month to fully experience if it is worth this high ticket price and it is. I need hydration during the winter when my face feels the driest. This Dr Strum face cream is soothing and hydrating applying from my face to neck daily. I see a dramatic difference how subtle and soft my face feels over thia month. If you have the funds to invest in great skin product. I highly recommend thisface moisturizer. I am huge fan. I would definitely buy this  again! A skin genie is a bottle
