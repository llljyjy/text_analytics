I wish I didn’t get the mini sizes for points because now I love a $400 hyaluronic acid serum. Luckily, I got 10 of the 3mL minis so I basically got a full-size worth just for points! I’ve tried all the hyaluronic acid serums out there from The Ordinary/Inkey List to Drunk Elephant to SkinCeuticals and everything in between, and none of them hold a light to this one. My skin looks SO GLOWY when I use it. The first day I used it I looked in the mirror a couple hours later and was like wow, my skin looks incredible and I’m glowing! I thought it was due to a face mask I used the night before but when I used the mask again I didn’t get that glow... Fast forward a week, I use this HA again and what do you know, the glow came back! In one sense, I’m so happy to have found a product that works so well, but of course my wallet is already crying haha! I’ll just make sure to buy it during the VIB sale. Skincare is so individual so it surely won’t work for everyone, but this is a really awesome product and beyond the glow, it’s incredibly cosmetically elegant and super hydrating. Definitely more effective than the really inexpensive HA serums but I wouldn’t say it’s more hydrating than HAs in the $75-125 range, BUT no other HA has made my skin glow like this one. Two teeny droplets on lightly damp skin is more than enough for my whole face so I can foresee even the full sized lasting long! Got the mini size for points, I wish I didn’t…
