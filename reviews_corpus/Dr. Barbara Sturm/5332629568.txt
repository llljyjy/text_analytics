I have been having dry skin recently as we are inching toward the winter season. I paired this face cream with the Dr. Barbara Sturm Hyaluronic Acid serum (underneath the cream). After using it for 2 weeks, I noticed that the redness in my skin had reduced, however, I didn’t see much improvement in my skins overall hydration (as my skin has been on the drier side recently). I would recommend this cream for someone who isn’t showing signs of dryness (I had some dry flakey spots). I like this product a lot as it’s light-weight and great for the daytime. I will definitely be trying the other Barbara Sturm “Rich” face cream for an added boost of hydration. Also, I want to point out that when I applied the Barbara Sturm Hyaluronic Acid under this face cream, it would pill/separate the face cream, making it clump. Not sure if I received an “off” batch. Overall, I love Dr. Barbara Sturms products. Can’t wait to try more of them! nan
