So I’m a review reader and for whatever reason the thimble of glow drops as a reward irrationally irritated me for what is the equivalent to $100 (lol) but regardless, our girl Dr Strum is never affordable for any reason *howevvvver* the tub of the reward sample size was surprisingly formidable, so I was feeling it. Ended up getting up a few of these and idk why people hate on this. It’s a fantastic lotion. Would I pay for the full size at that price point over like LaMer Concentrate, if I was gonna go full metal jacket on a moisturizer? omg of course not. but basically I guess my review is to vouch for the rewards sample as decidedly worth it, if that’s helpful to anyone out there lol. a hard yes - for the 100pts reward size only
