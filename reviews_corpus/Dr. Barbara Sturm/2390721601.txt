I never would have purchased this face cream due to the cost. I am so glad I was able to try this out in exchange for an honest review, because it is fantastic. It is lightweight, sinks into my skin beautifully, and hydrates without feeling greasy. I do think it has made my skin appear more hydrated as I use it more, and the smell reminds me of just clean, sterile, high quality product. Super pleased with this overall, even though I wish it was bigger for the price. LOVE
