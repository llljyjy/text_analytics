It smells pleasant and works very well under sunscreen in the morning. Does it hydrate? Absolutely! And soothes my irritated dry skin on the cheek immediately, but doesn’t clog pores on the T zone, so does not cause any breakout. But is hydration long-term? No! That’s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. During the day I can feel and see dryness on my cheeks. Maybe I should continue to use it for a long period to notice its anti-age effect. Would I purchase it? Yes! Why? Because I like the ingredients, I believe that long-term usage will help with the loss of firmness, and also I believe that in combination with other serums it even out my skin tone. Hydrates immediately, works well under suncreen.
