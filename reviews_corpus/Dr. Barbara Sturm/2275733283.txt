This skin cream feels like a spa treatment for the skin. Itâ€™s thick but lightweight at the same time, leaving the skin feeling very hydrated throughout the day. This is good as a base for my makeup in the morning and also layers well for my nighttime routine. Would recommend if you want to splurge on a moisturizer. nan
