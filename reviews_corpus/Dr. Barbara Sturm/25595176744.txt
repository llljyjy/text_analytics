A good moisturizer is essential for everyone’s skincare routine. After searching for what seems like an eternity, Dr. Barbara Sturm’s lightweight and hydrating face cream takes the cake as a staple for my skin regime. I use this in the morning and night after I’ve cleansed my skin with Dr. Sturm’s cleanser by applying it gently to my face, neck, and décolleté. It goes on smoothly and quickly absorbs into my skin making it feel softer and fresher after using it. It doesn’t leave the skin greasy or sticky, which works perfectly for any environment and weather you’re in. Its potent ingredients containing anti-aging powerhouses, Skullcap and Purslane protect the skin against environmental stressors throughout the day and calms it with their soothing qualities. This cream noticeably keeps my skin hydrated and firm while giving my complexion a radiant and healthy glow. This difference alone in my skin has kept me repurchasing the cream again and again and will continue to! No matter the skin type, age, gender, or concern, this face cream is the ideal moisturizer for everyone and deserves a spot in your skincare routine! Facing the facts with face cream
