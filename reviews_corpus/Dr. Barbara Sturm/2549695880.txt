I love this moisturizer! I only apply once a day and it keeps my face refreshed all day long, no dry patches. Itâ€™s lightweight and hydrating rather than greasy and I noticed my little breakouts I thought were hormone related were from the previous moisturizer I had been using. No issues with blemishes with this!! I received this product for free for testing purposes. Great Moisturizer
