Over the last few weeks I’ve really been trying to ignore the smell of this product as I do like that it firms the skin. The clinical smell that it gives off is a bit to strong and very hard to ignore.  The formulation is also a bit to runny and borderline a serum.  However with those negatives there are positives that in which being a great fast absorbing formulation and proven results in the skin’s texture and firmness. The wear although runny is best suited for PM. Good formula but clinical smell.
