I got a sample foil pack of this with an order and was amazed at the results after even that small amount. My husband, who never notices anything, even commented that my skin looked tight the next morning. I ordered the 10ml size from Dr Strum because I couldn’t do the full size splurge (THAT my husband would notice lol) but it’s worth it and a big plus is that I can use it while nursing! Worth the splurge
