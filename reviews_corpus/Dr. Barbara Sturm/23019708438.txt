Now I know this costs some major dough, but I do want to commend this product for feeling genuinely luxurious on my skin. First, I am thrilled that a luxury brand has opted out of including fragrance in their skincare. I liked this face cream a lot because it was surprisingly thin but felt as moisturizing as a very thick cream would. Iâ€™m going to continue to use this in my routine as long as it still makes my pores happy! nan
