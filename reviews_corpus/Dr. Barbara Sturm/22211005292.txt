I received this product from Influenster and have used these glow drops after the HA serum and it does provide a very moisturizing and natural dewy glow on the skin. It works well on my sensitive skin, but it is a pretty penny for a glow. Id say if you can afford it, itâ€™s worth it! If anything, the brands is phenomenal and it is okay to treat yourself once and a while! We are worth it to ourselves- I would recommend! Subtle Dewy Glow
