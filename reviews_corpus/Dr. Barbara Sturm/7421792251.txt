Bought this and the face cream last time and it broke me out so I just left the duo sitting on my table until I decided to try just the toner again. I realized the toner is actually amazing. It was the face cream that broke me out. I ended up finishing the bottle and just received my second one! Used it last night and woke up with smooth skin. It helps my acne go down and balance sebum and add moisture to my skincare. I use this before my serums. This brand is expensive/overpriced and this is probably the only product I like from this brand thatâ€™s worth the money. nan
