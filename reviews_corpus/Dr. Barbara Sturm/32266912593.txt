I think Sephora just doesn’t explain products well. The face cream is Dr.Sturm’s most basic product. It’s marketed as a simple face cream for all day hydration.  (( if u wanna want something to treat hyperpigmentation or oiliness she has the darker skin tones and brightening line that have more actives in it))This face cream is meant for people with sensitive or dry skin as a preventative measure and hydrator. It has Dr.Sturms purslane ferment which is they say helps strengthen and prevent telomeres from decaying, and has skullcap antioxidants, vitamins, and lipids to help the skin cell membranes.That being said, I do think it is wayyy to overpriced. The cream itself very well formulated. It has a light texture and sinks right in but seriously gives all day hydration.I normally put a little bit on and it keeps my face so soft throughout the day. It has seriously healed my dry patches and calmed down my redness significantly.  It’s hard to explain but it makes my skin look really “healthy” and hydrated.It smells like a doctors office (which I guess comes from the fact that they claim to only use clinical grade ingredients), but it isn’t strong and isn’t noticeable. The packaging is really nice though. It has a nice matte stone like texture and a glass rim, and comes with a metal spatula.I do think it has good long term benefits based on the science, but it is extremely basic. I prefer her darker skin tones line which has more actives and visible results, or her brightening line which got rid of spots I’ve had. I would really only recommend this cream if you get in a set and want to try out her products or if you are looking for a cream to help strengthen damaged skin and want to get a healthy glowy look, but it isn’t worth the splurge if you are dealing with spots or acne or oiliness. an incredible but basic moisturiser
