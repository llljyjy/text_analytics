What kind of magically stuff is in this?! the first night I used this, I only used 3 drops. I’m being real with you guys. I was trying to save as much product as possible (peep the price tag). the 3 drops covered my face sufficiently and I put some of Barbara’s moisturizer over it. I woke up. nothing spectacular. it looked okay. the next night, I decided to follow the directions and use a full pipette. I didn’t squeeze it all out into my hands like the directions state to because again, this girl is trying to save as much product as possible! lol. I put it in dots on the tip of my finger and spread it around my face. after it soaked into my skin, I put the moisturizer on my face and went to sleep. OMG!!! WHAT A DIFFERENCE! I woke up with dewy skin. My laugh lines weren’t as noticeable, and the pimple I had that was in the center of my forhead shrunk TREMENDOUSLY! I am shook!I usually use Barbara’s hyaluronic acid serum but this right here is a WINNER! Maybe because it has hyaluronic acid in addition with other hydrating ingredients as well. not sure. but I will definitely be replacing my old serum with this one from now on.This product is definetly worth the price! so if you are hesitating, treat yourself and buy this now. you and your skin deserve it :) believe the hype and BUY THIS NOW!
