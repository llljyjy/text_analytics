I really don’t think this is worth if for the price. I get better results with face creams 1/8 of the price! This was not my favorite face cream. It didn’t work well with my skin. I feel like it just sat on top of my skin. I didn’t see that much of a difference. I also tried to use it under makeup and it was super oily and spread my foundation. Not a hit for me
