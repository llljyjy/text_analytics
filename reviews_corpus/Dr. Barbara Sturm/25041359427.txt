After using this product for almost a month, I am very impressed with how it has moisturize my skin. The packaging is so pretty actually leave it out on my counter it smells exactly like Redken shades, EQ hair color, which I actually love the smell of so that is an added bonus. I would definitely buy this again. I love how it makes my skin feel and I felt fancy using it. nan
