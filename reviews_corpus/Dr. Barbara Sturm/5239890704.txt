I would give this 5 stars because it is such a great travel kit. However, I sadly have to return because the Hyaluronic Acid is not even half full. I have seen so many reviews of this happening to other people but I honestly thought I’d be fine. I’m very shocked. Obviously this is an ongoing problem with this product. Not sure why a skincare brand as prestigious and expensive as Dr. Barabara Sturm has not addressed and fixed this issue. nan
