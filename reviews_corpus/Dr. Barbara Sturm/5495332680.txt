I received this complementary from Influenster. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now. At first I was kinda confused as to how to use this product. I ended using it every morning before applying makeup or on non makeup days. I like that the consistency isn’t thick and doesn’t make my product pill. I feel like it gives a nice glow from within type of glow as if your face is nice healthy and radiant. I have enjoyed this product but aside from that haven’t noticed change in my skin gesture or discoloration. I have enjoyed it but I don’t think I would buy only cause I don’t know if steep price justifies it. Glow from within!
