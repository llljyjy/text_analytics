I hate how much this costs… because it is honestly magic. I am not a person who gets compliments on my skin, and I consistently have dry skin with uneven redness/texture. DAY ONE of wearing this, I got 2 compliments from strangers on my skin UNPROMPTED. A STRANGER said I had the “most beautiful natural glow they have ever seen”…. After using for 4 days, my sister who is a makeup artist, said, “what have you been doing? Your skin looks incredible!”.Unfortunately, these Glow Drops are now required in my life because it makes THAT MUCH of a difference. I say unfortunately because the price is so extreme, I received this as a gift but will now be purchasing it forever. I have to. Unfortunately this is perfection. Worth the price.
