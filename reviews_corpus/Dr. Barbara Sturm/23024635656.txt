This is an amazing face cream. The cream is not very heavy and in non-greasy texture. It sits in quite well and leaves my skin feeling soft. In particular, It does a great job for hydration which could last longer than normal face cream in the market and helps for even the skin tone too. Great for anti-ageing, even for sensitive skin. Perfect for winter! Perfect for winter!
