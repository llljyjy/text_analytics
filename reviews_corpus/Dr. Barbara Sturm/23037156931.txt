A must-have for winter months when my skin is dry & often “wind burned”. I used this after my weekly self-care skin session & my skin still felt so soft, hydrated, & supple the next morning. I’m usually a “baller on a budget”, but this is one of 2 or 3 skin care items that I will be saving up & splurging on. A new must have in my routine!
