This is phenomenal!! I received this to try in exchange for my honest review, and I was beyond excited! I’ve been wanting to try this line forever, but the cost of the products was too high. This face cream feels so light, but is incredibly moisturizing!! I used it after the Dr. Sturm hyaluronic acid and the combo of the two products have kept my skin so soft and moisturized! I live in MN and my skin gets really dry in the winter. The hydration lasts all day, and provides a great base for makeup. I will shed a tear or two once this runs out, as much as I am in love with this, I cannot afford the product line. For anyone that can, I highly recommend!! So this is how the other half does skincare…
