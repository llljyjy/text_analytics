This was a game changer for me. I started with La Mer’s eye creams and then moved on to Dr Sturm’s eye cream, but I still had a persistent single ridge under my eyes. Within a couple of days, I see that final ridge softening! It has also started to reduce that last bit of dark circle under the inner corner of my eye. I continue to use my Dr Dennis Gross retinol eye serum three times a week.The price is comparable to what I was paying, but the results are better for me, so I am thrilled. game changer
