Honestly I really like this product. Its packaging is sleek and minimalist, it has a hefty weight to it that gives it a luxe vibe. The moisturizer texture is more thin than I would normally gravitate to but it feels great on the skin. It hydrates me without feeling heavy. It definitely is more on the gentle side, not many active ingredients in it but I think it would be perfect for maintaing skin or for sensitive skin. The price is high but I do feel fancy when I use it and think the product is betrer than others on the market. If you can afford it go for it. So good!
