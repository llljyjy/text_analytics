The face cream is my favorite daytime moisturizer. It layers so nicely with my vitamin c serum and spf in the morning. I love the texture of this product and how light yet hydrating it feels on my skin. I live in Boston and the weather is getting colder, yet this face cream keeps my skin barrier intact. I would highly recommend anyone, no matter your skin type, to use this in their morning routine. I have combination skin, and my skin doesnâ€™t get overly oily or dry when I use this product which is great. It is the perfect gift during this holiday season for any of your loved ones no matter their age or skin type. Happy Holidays! Great daytime cream
