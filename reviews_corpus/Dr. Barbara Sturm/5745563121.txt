I initially received this as a sample and after one use (one drop on the face before bedtime), I saw my face glowing the next morning. My face was hydrated, smoother, and looking fresh. I was amazed and loved it.  I used the entire sample bottle, which lasted close to 30 days. However I looked at the price tag online and balked at $300. Heck no! I told my esthetician who agreed with me to start incorporating hyaluronic acid into my skin care regimen. So I used the Image line for the past 6 months (not sold at Sephora) courtesy of my esthetician, and the bottle comes out to $79, which is much more reasonable. I recently ran out so I decided to buy the Ordinary, which everyone is touting as just as good. I will tell you that it is inferior. Vastly inferior. My skin was still dullish, not looking fresh, and it didnâ€™t feel like the Barbara Stern or Image serums. I have not yet bought the $300 one, but if I had the money to spare, I would! Once you hit your 30s, good quality hyaluronic acid is a godsend. Expensive, but Amazing
