I got a sample of this from Sephora. I enjoyed the cleanser a lot. I have normal to dry skin and it works beautifully to remove any dry skin or patches from my face without causing my skin to dry out or get tight after cleansing. It’s a white powder that you can add as much or as little water as you’d like to to make it more or less exfoliating. It’s nice and exfoliating while still feeling creamy. HERE’S MY ISSUE…as soon as I used it the 1st time I thought “this reminds me exactly of a cleanser I already have!” I looked in my cabinet and pulled out my Babor Enzyme Cleanser. This has always been a favorite of mine and a staple in my skincare routine. I tested them back to back and they performed EXACTLY the same! Next I went online and looked up the ingredients because they seemed so incredibly similar. That’s when I found out they are literally THE SAME EXACT product! Babor is a German skincare company that’s been around since the 1950s. (Barbara Sturm is also German) Babor makes this exact product in the same exact size and sells it for $30-$35, depending on where you order from. Why would anyone pay $75 for the same thing??? Especially considering Babor is the orginal product??? Babor is not a Barbara Sturm “dupe,” it is the OG! SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS?!?
