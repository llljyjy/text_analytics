I have not great skin, dry and acne-prone, that I’ve had for 15 years. I’m also pretty unmotivated, so no 10 step routines yet for me. But I am willing to spend the money for quality products with clean ingredients. I use this cleanser about once a week. I wouldn’t call it a miracle product, but it makes my skin feel lovely, and I haven’t had any horrendous overabundance of whiteheads on my chin during my period since I started using it. I will more than likely be buying more when I run out. Costly but likeable enzyme cleanser
