The cream did not clog my pores, which is usually a problem with hydrating creams for me. Attached are the before and after pics. Super light texture, very subtle pleasant scent. Does not feel oily at all on my combination skin. Gets absorbed quickly. Not sticky, does not create a “mask on my face” feeling. Liked the ingredients very much.Love the glass jar. I received this product product from Influenster fro free for review purposes. Very pleasant to use
