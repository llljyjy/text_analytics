Donâ€™t believe the hype. Face Cream has a scent like Neutrogena face lotion. No glow, superficial moisture, had better perks with cheaper facial moisturizers. Not worth the money at all. I wish someone posted an honest review like mine before I bought this. I believed that since it was from Germany it was a quality cosmetic. Not true. Tilbury magic cream is 100% better Not impressed
