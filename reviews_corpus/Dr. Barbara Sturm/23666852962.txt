This face cream is like that movie everyone keeps raving about but you don’t really like. Like, is it really just mediocre and everyone else is caught up in the hype machine, or is there something wrong with you that it’s not a fav. This is a fine face cream. But….just fine. Not amazing. And the price tag doesn’t match the product. Didn’t break me out, but didn’t really moisturize my skin, either. I received this product to review, but allOpinions are my own. nan
