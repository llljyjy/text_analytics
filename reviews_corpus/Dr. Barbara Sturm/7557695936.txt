I genuinely wanted to like this product, implementing this as part of my skin care routine for a couple weeks I noticed how bad I was breaking out, which was very unfortunate as I really love this product. My skin felt hydrated silky, smooth. I really wish this would work for me. Unfortunately, it may not be for my skin type, but still think it is a great product for others. Maybe not me
