I used an entire jar of this over a 6 month period and was disappointed and I canâ€™t recommend it:Cons:- Does not actually treat or prevent dark circles. Instead the cream has a light reflecting quality that works as a very temporary improvement in dark circles (like as in slightly less dark for about 30 minutes).- No improvement in my 35 year old fine lines around the eye area.- Not moisturizing enough.- Product did not seem to last throughout the day.- Tended to clog the pores in the under eye area.- Price is too high for lack of performance.Pros:- Pretty container- Lasted 6 months- Did not sting my eyesInstead of buying this product again I have switched to using my retinal around the under eye and layering with Susanne Kaufmann eye cream (only $50). Just one month of this routine has improved the look of my eye area more than 6 months of this product. Not worth the hype
