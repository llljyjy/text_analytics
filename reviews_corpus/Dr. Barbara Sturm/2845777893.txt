I have mixed feeling with this product. First, it’s really expensive so I had some expectations. And I don’t understand how to use it. Under makeup? As a primer or after? Is it a moisturizer or a primer? I doesn’t do so much under makeup.Mixing with foundation? It doesn’t mix well.On top of makeup? Yes it looks dewy, but it’s not a highlighter (no pigment or glitter). And it can easily take off the makeup if you put it on top, so be careful! It can also looks shiny, so don’t put it all over your face. I don't understand this product
