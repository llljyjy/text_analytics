So I never liked any of Dr Sturms face creams before, they never were just right. I have dry sensitize red skin and I can’t use ANY “active” ingredients so I need to look for anti aging somewhere else. This cream is it! I use with the anti aging face serum and I am shocked-my face is less red and very hydrated and the cream skins in beautify and doesn’t feel heavy. (Was using la me but that is always the complaint). I also have noticed a slight improvement in some tiny lines. My skin is calm smooth and hydrated try it, I love this line! A real hydrating anti aging cream
