I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. When paired with the Dr. Barbara Sturm Hyaluronic Serum, this product improved the texture and appearance of my skin.

It is great if youâ€™re looking for a lightweight moisturizer to prep the skin for makeup or softening the skin without providing all-day hydration. As a licensed cosmetologist and cosmetic enthusiast, I would not recommend this for the winter season nor as part of a nighttime regimen any time of year for normal to dry skin. Pretty good
