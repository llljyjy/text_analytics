I received this face cream from Influenster and Dr. Barbara Sturm in exchange for my honest opinion. I have been using this cream every day for the last 2-3 weeks. This product is unscented, comes in a nice, high quality, convenient size container. The texture is very pleasant. It is not heavy, but not super light either. I have a combination dry/oily skin and plan to use it more in winter since it can be a bit too heavy for me in hot and humid weather. The cream is supposed to have anti-aging ingredients and give youthful glow. I have to use it a bit longer to comment on the anti-aging properties, but it is definitely very soothing and hydrating.I use this product on top of the Dr. Barbara Sturm Hyalauronic Serum for extra hydration. I do have a sensitive skin and so far I havenâ€™t noticed any adverse reaction to this cream, actually it is very calming when used after I remove my makeup. Overall, great quality for the price. i will definitely repurchase this product in the future. Light-weight, long-lasting moisturizer
