I wouldn’t call this life changing. I had my eye on this cream for what seems like forever and was very excited to give it a go. However, this didn’t live up to my expectations of what a $200+ moisturizer should be like. The consistency is thin, somewhat runny, and the scent (or lack of scent?) is strange. It does moisturize my face, but nowhere near as good as other products do. If you care about packaging, this is an instagram worthy type of products. The jar itself is very heavy and minimalistic. Overall, I suppose I expectedmore from it, but will use it until it runs out. It is a nice moisturizer, but just ok
