This is a nice simple face cream. Lightweight and works well for dry skin. Provides that hydration needed to last all day. I can’t say that it is worth the $225 price tag though. Definitely a luxe product with good ingredients but I’ve tried other moisturizers that provide this kind of moisture and similar effects. It’s definitely nice but would I repurchase for the price tag...probably not unless I can get it on sale. I don’t have many skin concerns or wrinkles so I can’t speak to the effects on that. But it could possibly do wonders for people with skin concerns. If you have pretty decent skin and are on the dryer side, it works good as a nice basic moisturizer. Good for dry skin
