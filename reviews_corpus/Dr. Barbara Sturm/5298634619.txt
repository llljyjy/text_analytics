I really really like this moisturizer! It’s rich and hydrating for dry skin and doesn’t leave a greasy finish. It immediately calmed my redness and rosacea. There’s no scent, making it ideal for sensitive skin types. It’s a splurge but a worthwhile one. I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion.
