I absolutely love this product! A lot of face moisturizers leave my skin feeling greasy after applying them. That was not an issue with this face cream! The product is light and creamy. It feels so nice as you apply it, and you instantly feel hydrated. Although it is pricey, a little bit goes a long way. This jar will last me quite a while. I also love the packaging! nan
