Amazing product but terrible price point. I got this as a sample and absolutely loved it. I saw a difference to my skin texture overnight after using it. However, I was shocked at the price point. Yes it’s amazing and it’s luxury skin care but I still think it’s just criminal to charge this price. Even after reviewing the ingredients list I still don’t see how $300 for 1 oz is justified. I loved this so much that I ended up buying the full size but it goes by SO fast. Really wish they would bring the price point down a bit to make this more attainable for most consumers. amazing but unaffordable
