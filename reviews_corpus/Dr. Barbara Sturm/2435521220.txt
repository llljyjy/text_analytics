I’ve enjoyed Tatcha and AMOREPACIFIC’s enzyme cleansers so I was happy to redeem Dr. Barbara Sturm’s deluxe sized from Sephora several months ago. I’ve finally tried it enough to say that it’s simply not worth the money. It is one of those cleansers that leaves your skin with that stripped down feel to the skin. It also doesn’t clean my make-up residue. I honestly don’t even want to finish the deluxe sample because I dislike this product so much. I recommend the Tatcha and AMOREPACIFIC ones over this one and they are around the same price-point but definitely works better. Not worth the money
