I used the entire container and am still not sure what this mask is supposed to do. I have sensitive, combination skin and am mostly concerned about mild signs of aging and this mask just did nothing for me whatsoever. I think it maybe reduced the appearance of my pores a tiny bit? I don’t find it hydrating at all and really couldn’t find any other positives other than that it didn’t break me out or irritate my skin. Not worth the money at all, unfortunately. The best thing about it is the little brush that comes with it! Not worth the money
