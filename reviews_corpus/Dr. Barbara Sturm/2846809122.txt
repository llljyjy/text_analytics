Well now I know why rich people have such great skin…. HOLY CANNOLI!!! This might be the BEST moisturizer I’ve ever used. It is so light but perfectly moisturized my combination skin. Along with the serum, it helped even my complexion, reduced the redness from my rosacea, and made me my feel incredible. I’ve been under massive stress over the last four months, yet my aunt keeps asking me why the black circles under my eyes haven’t been popping up, like our genetics likes to do. I can only think it is from using this moisturizer and the serum for the last month and a half. Even my stress pimples that like to show up on my forehead and jawline have stayed at bay. My skin feels great even though I’m an emotional wreak so that has to say something about the product 🤷🏻‍♀️. Best Moisturizer I’ve Come Across
