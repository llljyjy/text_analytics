I am 37 and have very dry and aging skin. A lot of skincare and make up products donâ€™t work for my face. I like the texture of this cream which is not to thin, however I wish it was thinker. I love how it feels on the skin: very light and absorbs quickly, but I felt like I needed to reapply again during the day. Thinking to try the Anti-Aging one and hoping that one will work even better for my skin Light moisturizer
