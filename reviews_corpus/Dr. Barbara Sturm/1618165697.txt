I am returning this kit.   Upon opening, I noticed the Hyaluronic serum is only half full or maybe slightly less than half.  I was also having an issue with the dropper.  When I tried to open it,  only the plastic (cap piece) would come off, the dropper (rubber piece) was stuck to the glass bottle.  I tried several times but no luck.  I ended up having my bf looked at it because he works for a skincare company and familiar with packaging.  He had to slowly peel off the dropper and thereâ€™s still a tiny little rubber piece glued to the glass bottle right now. Half full bottle of Serum
