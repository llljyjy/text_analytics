this is my moisturizing gel. This is as heavy as I can go and I am fine with that.  For those who are saying this is just aloe you have NO clue about skincare. This is Aloe loaded with antioxidants and soothing/hydrating ingredients and Zero comodegenic ingredients so common in conventional products. I have searched for yrs for something this good for my oily skin. Look at how short the list is, everything in such high concentrations.  CANNOT do without this Finally a hydrator without breakout bombs
