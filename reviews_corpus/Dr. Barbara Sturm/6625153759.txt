This is my go to moisturizer now. I used to use Estee Lauder day wear matte, but I just wasn’t getting enough hydration from it. This hydrates my skin without being greasy or leaving me looking oily. Super easy on your skin too I don’t get congested pores or any irritation. The Sturm line in general has been fantastic and I’ve slowly transitioned to the complete routine. It’s an investment but if you can afford it every 3 months or so I highly suggest trying out her products! perfect for combo skin!
