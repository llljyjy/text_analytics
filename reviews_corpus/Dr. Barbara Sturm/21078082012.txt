I really didn’t dislike the face cream but I didn’t see any spectacular results. For the price of this cream you should have buttery smooth skin. It has a very watery like consistency and just doesn’t feel very moisturizing. I didn’t notice a fragrance at all which I do love for my skincare. The packaging is also on point with the very heavy and luxurious jar. Overall though I just don’t see the benefits that equal the price point on this cream even though I love other Sturm products...this is not it for me. Not for me
