I really like this moisturizer. It didn’t irritate my eczema skin and kept my skin hydrated. I use this with the hyaluronic serum underneath and it really helped with my dry skin especially now that it’s colder out. I can see why this product costs so much but truthfully, there are a lot of products out there that are great for anti aging and hydration and half the price, so I won’t be purchasing this based on price. But if you’ve got the money to splurge, please check it out! Great moisturizer
