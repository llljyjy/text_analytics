I received a sample of this product and was using it at bedtime with a barrier cream on my face. The combo was great so I decided to purchase the full size and started using it in the morning as well. I have dry skin, and I really like this- I think the heavier face cream would be too much!I also like this product because it does not have any scent. It almost smells clinical, which I prefer.The cream isnâ€™t overly thick so I almost wish it was in a tube rather than a glass jar. I just worry about dipping into glass jars and bacteria, plus the jar is heavy so I feel like I need to be extra careful not to drop it and break it. Great even for dry skin types
