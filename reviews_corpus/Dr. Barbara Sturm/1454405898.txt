I got this serum as a free mini-sample. I’m using it on days that my skin has been irritatedovertreated. That happend, for instance, when I recently used the Dr Dennis Gross Firm & Brighten serum, that I got as a sample. I’m using this until the irritation moderates.That way, I’ll be using some vitamin C. I normally use a 10% ascorbic acid (no derivatives) serum, and my skin tolerates that well. The Dr Dennis Gros serum I used has 15% vitamin C and also lactic acid. I might be able to work up to regular use of that but for right now, I’m sticking with the Sturm vitamin C until I get back to baseline. . Nice for when you need a Vitamin C Serum Lite
