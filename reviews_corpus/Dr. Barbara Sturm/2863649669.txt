I received a full sized Dr. Barbara Sturm Face Cream for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This cream claims to protect the skin against premature antiaging using an antiaging powerhouse: Purslane, which is apparently rich in antioxidants. This cream also has vegetable lipids to defend the skin’s moisture reservoirs. It also has a thing called skullcap extract which serves as an additional antioxidant. I’m not too familiar with these ingredients but I can say that my skin felt really good using this cream, it’s really rich and really hydrating. Feels great!
