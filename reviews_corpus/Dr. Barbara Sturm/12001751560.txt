I love this face cream! Itâ€™s super thick and creamy and feels amazing on the skin. I have been using it as a night cream. I have oily skin and can see this being too heavy for daytime use, but has been great for dry winter nights. I would highly recommend this to anyone, especially those who need some extra moisture. A luxury cream for thirsty skin
