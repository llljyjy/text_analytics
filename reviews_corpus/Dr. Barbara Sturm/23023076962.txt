I’ve got a sample of this cleanser with my recent sephora order and let me say I’m disappointed. This is pretty basic product for the price. It makes my skin clean but doesn’t provide that marvelous exfoliating effect (and baby soft skin) I expect from the enzyme powder. Btw Babor works much better and is half the price of this one. Not as good as my previous enzyme powder
