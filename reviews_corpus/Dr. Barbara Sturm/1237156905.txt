Received this free to review from influster and I do find it thick and rich, it’s not what I would expect from a cream at the price point.  It did okay but my face still felt dry towards the end of the day.  It doesn’t have a scent which was nice.  The packing is heavy which seems kinda unnecessary.  I haven’t seen any massive improvement but my skin isn’t really bad and I was using a nice brand before. It's okay but not worth the money
