This is a really nice face cream. I love the texture but I’m not sure that it provides enough moisture in the colder months. This would perhaps be better in the summer months. I have been mixing a bit of face oil with it for Pat week. So far, I haven’t broken out so it seems to be ok for sensitive skin. Not sure I would repurchase at that price though. nan
