You can tell this was made by an esthetician,  because putting this cream on your face is an EXPERIENCE. It glides easily all over your face and neck and leaves behind moisture without too much grease. This face cream is still just a tad but too light for me in winter because I use Retin A, but it’s perfect for summer for me.   The cost is pretty steep for a face cream, since there are quite a few good creams available for a fraction of the price. If it’s in your budget and want to feel like you are being pampered every time you do your routine, then it might be worth it to you. Elegant moisturizer
