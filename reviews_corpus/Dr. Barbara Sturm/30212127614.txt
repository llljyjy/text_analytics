When I decided to start being a grown up about my skin and figured I should take care of it properly, I began my hunt for the best face cream. I have tried quite a few and this one has been my absolute favorite. I love how soft and non-greasy my face feels and how the moisture lasts through the night. At first my skin broke out just a little on my chin, but after a week of using it, I didnâ€™t have any more problems. nan
