I received this product for review. This is a milky-serum texture and comes with a dropper applicator in a glass jar. I find the product to be a bit messy as the jar opening is a little larger for the dropper and there is no stopper. This is a very gentle chemical exfoliant and I have experienced no irritation, even if using two nights in a row. I use this at night after an essence and before my moisturizer. I felt this left my skin pleasantly smooth the following day, with no tightness. I am giving it four stars because of the mess and because it is quite expensive. A gentle exfoliator
