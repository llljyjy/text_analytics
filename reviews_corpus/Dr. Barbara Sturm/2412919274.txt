I love the ingredients in this so much so that I use this as a serum,toner & moisturizer. This has been perfect for using tretinoin. I used to use the Korean fermented products and then a serum then tret or differin and moisturizer to top it off. Now I wash my face and apply this onto wet skin and let it dry down for about 15 min then apply tretinoin. If I need more moisture I put more of this on and/or cerave. It has really streamlined my skincare routine and ended up making my routine cheaper. I also use this as after sun gel and to help heal rashes. more than just Aloe
