Wow! I received this this product as a free sample and I am very impressed! The Peace Out Instant Pore perfector has made its way into my permanent makeup routine, thanks to all the skin benefitting ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid and Mushroom extract. I was a bit skeptical at first as pore primers have the tendency to pill on my dry skin, but all I had to do is really warm up the product on my fingertip before applying and it works soo well! I used my hands for application and much rather prefer that than a beauty blender to have total product control. You gotta try it! Dry/ Dehydrated Skin, this oneâ€™s for you!
