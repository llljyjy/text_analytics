The first box did what I hoped, blemishes were smaller or sometimes healed by the time I took off the dot (btw ouch). I’m about halfway through my second box but it’s been a dud - nothing is smaller, nothing is healing. When I remove the dot the only thing it does is rip off the top and give me an open spot that scabs. Maybe I got a bad batch, but at this price I’m hesitant to try again. Mixed results, inconsistent product manufacturing?
