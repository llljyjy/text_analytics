This product was gifted by Peace Out Skincare. I really enjoy this serum! I love the Dark Spot patches so I was so excited for this. It does smell a little strong, but I’ve been seeing great results after using for 2 weeks so it’s worth it to me. Feels great after applying, I could see this working for all skin types! nan
