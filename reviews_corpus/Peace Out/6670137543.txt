I absolutely love these. They always help dwindle any big surprises I have. For the best results apply them to clean skin after cleansing and wear overnight. You should be apply a new patch after every time you wash your face until the pimple is fully drained (ie you put a patch on and 6+ hours later the patch is still empty) Love them!
