I had pretty good results with these, I tend to get hormonal acne, and they can be quite cystic and painful. I use these patches overnight for the big unsightly ones  and they do a pretty good job at helping with the redness and actually calming the inflamed area before the pimples completely form. These are also a great way to hide pimples, theyâ€™re very thin and blend into the skin nicely with good adhesive, I put makeup over it and I could barely even see it, will definitely keep these on hand !! nan
