I am loving this so far! Let me start by saying I already enjoy several products from this brand, so when I saw this dark spot serum I knew I had to have it. The tranexamic acid in this works well for my skin to reduce leftover darkness from old acne spots. I love the niacinimide and aha blend too-it just really makes my skin look brighter. I will say though, this has a little bit of a smell… I say smell because It’s not a fragrance, but it definitely has an interesting odor that is slightly off-putting.  It isn’t enough to deter me from using it, though.  And, it has a large percent of acids so if your skin is particularly sensitive I would just be careful and introduce it slowly into your skincare routine. I didn’t notice any sensitivity myself.  *gifted by peace out skincare Brighter skin, but kind of smells
