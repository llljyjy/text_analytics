I had a very stubborn acne for so long probably months, and it was getting dark. The day I received it I cleaned my face and couldn’t wait to try it out. I placed it on that acne and left it for couple of hours, it instantly worked in hours. While I was working and  got done with work I peaked and it amazed me! Imagine, putting it over night. It will work wonders. I know the price is sightly high but it’s worth it girls. Better buy something better than wasting money on product that barely work. Love to peace out. Work best but pricy for 12 dots.
