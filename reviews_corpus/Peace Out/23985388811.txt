I couldn’t have received this retinol face stick at a better time, my acne was acting up and this stick really calmed it down. It’s definitely for all skin types.  I have very sensitive skin and this stick did not irritate my skin even with me building up use to three times a week. I love how easy it is to apply and that it can be applied before serums and face creams. This product for having retinol in it did not dry out my face if anything it left my face looking so supple and hydrated. I’ve been using it for a week now and my skin has really improve drastically my acne has been greatly diminish I look forward to buying more products from this company in the future. This face stick is amazing a must have!
