I tried this, not really expecting much, and I’m pleasantly surprised! I have very sensitive, reactive skin, but this is not irritating at all. I’ve been able to use it every night. My under eye skin was dry and I have tiny bumps (milia); the Retinol Eye Stick smoothes and moisturizes, really reducing the dryness and the appearance of the bumps. I love it! Noticeably Smooth!
