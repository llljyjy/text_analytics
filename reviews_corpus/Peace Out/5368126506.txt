After using this serum for a week, I’ve seen my main “problem“ dark spot (caused by sun damage) fade significantly. It’s also been helping with redness around my nose & mouth, as well as making my skin feel smoother. Love that this can help with skin texture in addition to dark spots. Overall, I’m looking forward to keeping it in my skincare routine & using every few days. Product was provided complimentary from Peace Out Skincare but all opinions are my own. Worth trying
