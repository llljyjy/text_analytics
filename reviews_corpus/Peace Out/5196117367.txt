Seriously, this is a fantastic product for those of us who struggle with adult acne and hormonal breakouts. I had the mini version of this and brought it along with me on a trip. Didn’t expect much but I was having a bad breakout, and using this for two nights and my acne had considerably improved. Even my significant other was impressed and is now hooked on using this as his primary cleanser! If they made a JUMBO size of this I’d be all over it. Plus, you only need a very small amount. I have used it both on dry and wet skin. It spreads a lot easier on wet skin, otherwise, you need to be gentle using it on dry skin. This is my staple cleanser now! Amazing product
