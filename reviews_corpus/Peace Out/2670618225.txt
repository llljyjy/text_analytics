I have tried this new Instant Pore Perfector from Peace Out and fell in love with it right away. It looks like a brown paste, glides on smoothly and leaves a fairly matt finish. I have combination skin type with oily T-zone. My T-zone is a trouble area so my pores at those areas are larger. It helps to blur my pores and reduce shine in oily areas. I tried it with and without makeup for my T-zone so far and both works great for me. I also love the ingredients Hyaluronic Acid and Niacinamide in it which can keep skin hydrated without being dried. This is something I would definitely repurchase again. nan
