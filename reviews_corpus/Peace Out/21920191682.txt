I love these! My breakouts are sort of scattered all around my forehead and cheeks so i cut the strips to the right size. It usually lasts longer since it only comes with four packs. I find these work better when pimples or acne are closer to popping or already popped. Its able to absorb oil and bacteria faster. You will not find the results you want on newer breakouts. worth it!
