These Peace Out Acne Dots actually work. I suffer from hormonal acne. I was in the middle of a flair-up with a few types of pimples on my face and shoulders. Some were small and I had one huge pimple that was under the skin and red. It didn’t have a head or anything on it. I cleaned my skin, toned it, then applied the dots to my pimples. When I got up the next morning, I noticed a big difference in my pimples. The patches had “gunk” on them and many of the pimples were either completely gone or almost. The pimple that was under my skin had raised, but hadn’t popped. I put 2 patches on the next night. When I woke up the next day, those patches had gunk on them. The pimple had popped and was so much less painful. I applied another patch to area again because it was still pretty red. The next morning it was completely gone. I am really impressed with these and will continue to use these when new acne erupts. I was gifted by Peace Out in exchange for my honest review. These work!
