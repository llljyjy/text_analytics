I love this brand for its acne patches so I was so excited to learn that I can use their magic touch in my makeup game. I love the texture of this primer and how it works with my liquid foundations to make my pores look smooth. I’ve used a lot of the popular primers but they don’t always work with the formula of my foundations since I like to switch up seasonally. So far this has worked with all the foundations and concealers I’ve put over it. It helps me achieve that FaceApp matted smooth look I love IRL. A++ Game changer
