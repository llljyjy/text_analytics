These are great for travel. I like to keep my packing light when I go out of town and these are great for travel.  Great for reversing the effects of jet lag or if I need to attend an event the next day and want to look refreshed because where these really shine is in the short term usage. I use a strip on my forehead and the next AM it looks smoother and gives that “well rested” look. I do wish there were a few more strips in a package because it’s easy to go through them quickly. Great addition to a travel routine
