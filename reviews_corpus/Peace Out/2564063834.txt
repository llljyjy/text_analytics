Say peace out to to your acne. This is the only acne on-the-spot patch that works on my skin. Every time that I have an annoying big red irritation creeping up to the surface of my skin, I stick a healing dot on the area and it will do it’s magic. The dot calms the redness and irritation away. It’s like the healing dots help the skin find it’s inner peace. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to try a new acne treatment. It's magic!
