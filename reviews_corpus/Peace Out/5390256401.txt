I have been curious about retinol for a while because I have concerns with old acne scars. This product is great because I always heard that retinol can be harsh on your skin but this formula did not irritate my skin at all. It goes on like a balm and it is not sticky or greasy. It goes on easy so you don’t need to apply pressure. I wash it off when I do my morning skincare routine. It is easy to take during travels because of the packaging and the fact that it is not liquid. I do see a slight difference since I’ve been using it but I need to use it longer I think. Goes on like a lip balm but for your face
