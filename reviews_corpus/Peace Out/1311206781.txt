I have no idea how this has such wonderful reviews.  I have been a user of retinol for many many years.  My skin does not react to it any longer because of the many years of use.  Having said that, I decided to switch things up and try this based on reviews on many different platforms.  After two weeks of use what I found was it was a little irritating and at almost 53 years, the fine lines that my previous routine was obviously keeping at bay came out while using this inferior product.  Probably great for a younger age but women in their 40’s and 50’s, I don’t think this is a good product at all.  I went back to my Peter Thomas Roth retinol along with my biossance and within a few days my skin was back where it was before using this. Confused about the positive reviews
