So far, I’ve noticed a difference! I have a nasty habit of popping pimples (trust me, I’m working on stopping it) and get blemishes during the heal-over phase. I applied one to the blemish on my chin overnight (about 12 hours, tapping the dot with my finger every 2 hours or so -omitting when I was asleep of course-) and I feel it helps greatly in lightening it after just one day! The pictures I’m posting are after just one day, and my blemish is far more lighter! DAY 1: AMAZING (WILL UPDATE AS I GO)
