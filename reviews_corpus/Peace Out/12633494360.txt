I read a few reviews that complained about difficult application and that it doesn’t work. It totally works BUT on FINE lines not embedded wrinkles. Application is as easy as putting on chapstick and I’ve been using it for less than a week and notice an improvement in the fine lines around my eyes. The crosshatching is disappearing and though the bigger wrinkles still appear, they’re smoother. Recommend!!! Recommend for fine lines
