I was really excited about this, because it’s still summer and I want to keep my tan up. I haven’t really worn a lot of face makeup because it looks weird with my tan even if I get darker products. This I can put on and it minimizes my pores but doesn’t leave any sort of color on my skin! Really happy with this. Complimentary from Peace Out Skincare. nan
