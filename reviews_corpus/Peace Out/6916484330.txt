Whenever I see the white tip I apply the dot overnight and it is so satisfying seeing it come out. It even helps with small whiteheads around breakout. Sometimes if a breakout is too deep it wonâ€™t pull it out. My skin has been pretty stubborn lately because of the constant mask wearing, not allowing my skin to breathe. They really work!
