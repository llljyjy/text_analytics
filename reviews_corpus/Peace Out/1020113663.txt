this is an awesome product. I have been using it for about a year now, I’m on my 2nd stick. you need to be consistent with the product, and I saw results after about 5 months. some of the previous reviewers gave poor results after using overnight, one week, and one month later.  skincare results take time to work. my skin issues didn’t happen overnight, and skin care results don’t happen overnight either. I’m 62, and people don’t believe my age, they think I’m in my 40s.  use great skin care, stay out of the sun (#1 skin ager), and use sunscreen!  your face will thank you! awesome little tube!
