I bought this on a whim after seeing an ad on Instagram. I’m happy that I went for it! I’ve been using it every night since the day I received it. Over. Month now. The stick design is really easy to use. I glide it over my problem areas and lightly smooth it out with my fingers. It has a feel much like a lip balm. It’s a bit greasy at first but overnight sinks into the skin nicely. I’m 62 and have very thin sensitive skin so avoid harsh retinol products. I have had no negative issues with this so far. The positives are hydrating moist skin with some noticeable fine line improvement. I bought 2 more for when this runs out., Peace Out for Peace On your skin!
