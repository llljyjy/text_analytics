I was gifted the Peace out Dark spot serum in exchange for my honest review, I used a few pumps of my clean face the serum is smoot has a yellowish tone to it. It goes on smoothly and is fast absorbing and it leaves my skin feeling nice and soft. I followed with my moisturizer and just added this serum to my nighttime routine. The serum doesn’t smell  bad but definitely has a medium clean medicinal scent to it once I applied my moisturizer the smell wasn’t as noticeable. I have been using it for about a week and a half i have tons of freckles and haven’t seen much of a difference yet but my skin is glowy and feels good. Okay serum
