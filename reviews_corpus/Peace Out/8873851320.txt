Easy to use product and for me it stayed on all night. I donâ€™t think that the quantity of patches are enough to make it worth the price. I feel like I would have to use these for a long time to see a big difference but that would mean buying multiple packs of these to treat areas of my face regularly, which the price makes me reconsider. I wore these a couple nights in a row and did not see a drastic difference, but I wish there were more patches in each box to actually give it a fair shot. nan
