I really do not understand the hype on this  product and the reviews. It tugs the skin and the waxy consistency interacts with other layers.  My eyes looked and felt dryers, in fact, they looked more wrinkled. This is way overpriced plus it contains micro-plastics which cause huge environmental and health concerns. Cons weight heavily. Returning product if I can this week. Disappointed Overhype
