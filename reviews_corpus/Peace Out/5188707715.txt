At first I didn’t like this stick but it has really grown on me. It is a little bit too hard but I found it actually got softer the more I used it, maybe just the top layer is a bit more solid. The results though have been amazing. I’ve seen improvement in fine lines around my eyes and in the darkness under my eyes after using it for about 2 months. Considering this product is significantly cheaper than most under eye cream, it’s definitely a good value. Great value
