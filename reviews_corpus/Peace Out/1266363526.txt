They are alright but not worth the price for the amount you get in the box. Would I buy again - sure for say an event. Since the results are very temporary. Not a long term, if used constantly type product. But would I go out of my way, to repurchase - no! They work but nothing exciting. You get the same results from old fashioned “Frownies” that you can still find in some drugstores for a less money with more in the package. Nothing to write home about
