I tested the Retinol Face Stick, gifted by Peace Out, and think it’s a really cool product. It’s vegan, gluten-free, cruelty free and clean. The retinol softens the look of fine lines and wrinkles.   I think with consistent use that you’d definitely see results. I don’t love the application process. It’s easy to use but I don’t think it’s particularly clean to keep wiping the same product over your face every night. It’s a really cool, interesting product though. Cool product
