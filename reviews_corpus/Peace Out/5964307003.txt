Peace Outâ€™s Acne Day & Night Duo set has worked wonders! I received the patches just as a monster zit was starting to emerge - I applied the night patch to my pimple after cleansing my face before bed. By morning the pain and swelling had gone down significantly. I followed up with one of the day dots, which blended in really well with my skin. It looked great and adhered nicely on bare skin as well as with makeup applied overtop. I will repurchase these effective dots as I work my way through this box. nan
