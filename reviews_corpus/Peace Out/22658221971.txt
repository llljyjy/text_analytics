I was sent this complimentary from Peace Out Skincare. I had super high hopes for this but I couldn’t get past the smell. It smelled like melting plastic and it was just so strong. I put it on my face and the scent lingered for hours and hours to the point where I wanted to wash my face and restart my whole routine. I’m going to pass on this one unfortunately Smells SO Awful!
