I’m a big fan! This is an excellent dark spot serum. There’s no Ascorbic acid in this but it has a bunch of hyperpigmentation powerhouses in that do the best job. It never pills or irritates my skin.  I use it after toning and before moisturizing. It has a creamy texture and feels moisturizing which is nice. It has helped to lighten some post inflammatory hyperpigmentation from old acne. It’s also not too bad price wise compared to other brightening products from Sephora. I think a lot of people will like it this product. pretty dang good!
