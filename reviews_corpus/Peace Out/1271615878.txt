My skin tone is uneven, I have dark spots as a result of sun damage, some redness and pores around my nose and on my chin.  I have tried multiple face primers and I was beginning to think they served no purpose and were just a gimmick. Peace Out has changed my mind.  It evens out my skin tone and my foundation looks flawless. Finally, a primer that does something.
