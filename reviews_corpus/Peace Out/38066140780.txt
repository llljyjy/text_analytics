I don’t wear makeup, but I do wear a tinted mineral sunscreen daily that has a texture similar to a foundation. I use this pore perfector under my tinted sunscreen and it really does smooth down my skin and allow the sunscreen to apply more evenly and smoothly. The result is a softer, smoother look on skin. Also helps with any redness on your face. I have mild rosacea and it helped calm down the look of redness in my cheeks. I was kind of blown away at the difference it made, actually. It’s a thicker texture, so definitely use a moisturizer before applying it and it will glide right on. It layers very well with all my other skincare, no pilling, does not feel heavy on your skin, lasts well through the day. Soft & smooth look!
