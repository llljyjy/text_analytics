Peace Out has truly perfected stick formats for skincare.  The retinol face stick is the perfect complement to the retinol eye stick for smoother, clearer, and more even toned skin all around the entire face.  With the retinol face stick, I am able to impact a larger surface area and see results even more quickly.  I was initially concerned that a stick may pull or tug on my skin, but these exceeded my expectations with how smoothly they glide.  If the stick ever starts to become stiff or difficult to maneuver, a trick to get it to move more easily again is to run it along the back of your hand for a few seconds to warm it up first.  Even when used nightly, this does not irritate my sensitive, dry skin or cause flaking and peeling like other retinols have for me in the past.  Since the retinol face stick is applied as a last step after moisturizer, it can take a while to absorb and may leave a temporary oily shine depending on the thickness of the moisturizer.  However, I have never experienced any pilling with my other skincare products and by morning there is no residual greasiness. Iâ€™ll be sticking to this retinol from now on!
