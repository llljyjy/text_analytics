This is such a handy beauty product in the way that it is packaged for you to use as a consumer. The component makes this so practical in my every day skin care routine. This product smoothly glides across my skin and doesn’t leave any annoying residue behind. Once I smooth this across my skin with the stick, I then blend it in with my hands. I think this is just such a great way to apply a product like this I’m very happy with that. I’ve only been using it for about two weeks and I’ve noticed a minor skin improvement. When I wake up in the morning my skin is glowing here and clearer than it has been in a while. I don’t feel like this is stripping my skin of any moisture which is really great for a retinol product. I really enjoy using this product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for right now. Great Component for Easy Application
