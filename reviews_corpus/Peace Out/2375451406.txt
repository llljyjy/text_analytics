First of all, they really put care into their packaging. It came in the cutest box and they made sure to pack it so that the contents wouldn’t be deformed from mail. I was surprised by the color and texture of the pore perfector. It’s in a dark brown shade and I worried it wouldn’t match my skin tone. It actually blended quite well and gave a no foundation foundation look. If you’ve used the primer from tatcha, I actually prefer this one over that one because of the price, and better coverage. I do have to use sunscreen with it, so i wish it included spf. Overall impressed! Impressed and also good price!!
