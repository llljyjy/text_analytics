I’ve been using this for a bit and so far, I enjoy using it as the weather turns drier and colder. I really like using this around my eye areas as a final step in my routine at night. Because it’s pretty cold now, the stick takes a couple swipes to warm up. The finish it leaves on my skin is reminiscent of Vaseline/ Aquaphor. This doesn’t tug on my skin at all, but that could be because I already have my skincare on so it’s not gliding on a dry surface. There’s also no scent to this, which is a plus especially since this is for the eye area. I will say the squalane in this helps reduce the dryness and flakiness i experience around that area, but I don’t think I’ve seen the retinol in this do much yet. nan
