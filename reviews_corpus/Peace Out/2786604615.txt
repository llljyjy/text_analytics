I’ve never used pore strips before . It says Apply a nose strip or pore strip, tacky-side down, on clean, dry skin. After four to six hours, gently remove the strips. I wear them overnight and wake up with very clean feeling skin! Not sure about big changes as I don’t really have any major skin concerns. nan
