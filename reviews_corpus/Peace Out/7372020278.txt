I need to start by saying this is my ride or die moisturizer! It’s incredible! Goes on smooth, nice consistency and feels refreshing on the skin. It also feels great under make up and very hydrating to wear to bed. I removed one star just because I’m not a fan of the pump bottle design for this product (I often have to take the lid off when it’s nearing empty to get the last of it out). I’d prefer if it could come in a tub with a lid/scoop or something. But alas! Even if Peace Out never sees this minor critique of the bottle, it’s a great skincare product!!
