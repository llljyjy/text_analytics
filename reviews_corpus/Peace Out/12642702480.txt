This product works well right away and doesn’t leave any scarring. I usually use tea tree oil for pimples I see but it takes a long time for the tea tree oil to fully get rid of the spot. These work right away because of silicic acid. It’s very easy to apply the product. Put one on at night and in the morning the acne mark is gone! Great
