This product is amazing.  My trouble area is on my chin. Especially since wearing masks. I used tweezers to apply the patch, seemed a lot easier and to avoid touching my face too much.  I also tried them on an ingrown hair and it worked like a charm.  I highly recommend these because it helps prevent the pinching and squeezing. Beauty cabinet staple
