Is there anything more satisfying than not picking at your skin but still getting all the gunk out? These patches help me not pick at my face. This might be TMI but when a zit is really “ready” I normally go into the pore lightly and gently with a disinfected needle and then once whatever comes out is done, I cover the pore/zit with a sticker. These are 10x better than the over the counter pharmacy brand. Helpful tip: wearing this on a zit during a workout does MAGIC! It really helps release and pull out any oil. Satisfying
