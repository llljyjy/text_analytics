The Peace Out Dark Spots Serum has a super lightweight and gentle, gel formula. It feels fresh on the skin and absorbs instantly. It layers well with other products without any pilling. I think it has a robust formulation that really helps to target discoloration for a brighter and more even toned complexion. There is a distinct scent to the product, but it doesnâ€™t linger or bother me. nan
