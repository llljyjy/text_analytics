Unfortunately this stick format doesn’t work for me, the product is too stiff and hard and it drags on the delicate under eye area. I tried applying a small amount to my finger to Pat it on gently but the product doesnt melt or soften enough to feel like it’s going to do anything on the skin. I was really disappointed, I actually threw it out. nan
