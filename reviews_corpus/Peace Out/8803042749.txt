I quite like this stick, mostly because of the ease of use. Although the ingredients are excellent, l am gonna be honest I don’t know if it’s working at all. I don’t have wrinkles but do have dark circles and spots. It has done absolutely nothing for discolouration, but I keep using it in hopes of protecting myself from future wrinkles. Keep in mind, the stick doesn’t glide easily under the eyes, I sometimes need a silky serum underneath this to apply without tugging the delicate under eye skin. Easy to use
