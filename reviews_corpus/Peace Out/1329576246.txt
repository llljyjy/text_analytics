I really enjoy this retinol stick. I got it in the combo with the patches. I was a little afraid to try it too close to my eyes so I worked up to it..I see a reduction in the fine lines for sure. The dark circles come and go for me so thatâ€™s hard to judge. But I use this along with the whole face stock a few times a week after my nightly skincare ritual and my skin is looking fantastic Definitely worth using
