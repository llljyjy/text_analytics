I love this primer base I put a little bit on before my foundation and it’s so smooth and blurs out blemishes and redness before I even apply my foundation. My foundation goes on super smooth after using this as well and it’s a perfect base. I love the ingredients and I have very dry acne prone skin and have had no breakouts or irritation. This is a wonderful primer and it’s one I feel comfortable using since the ingredients are so clean and non irritating. nan
