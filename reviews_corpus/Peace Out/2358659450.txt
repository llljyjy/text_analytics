These just didnâ€™t work for my skin (oily/combination with hormonal acne). I placed them on my acne overnight, and when I took them off in the morning they did nothing--the acne looked the same. They worked once on one pimple to reduce the whitehead, but then the whitehead came back later that day. Maybe my acne is just too powerful! :P Didn't work for me.
