I received this product complimentary from Peace Out Skincare to try out and review - I’ve never really used primers before, so I don’t have much to compare it to. But i really like this product! It’s very blurring! It definitely evens out and smooths out the appearance of pores on my nose and cheeks. It’s also surprisingly hydrating! I woukd have expected it to maybe be a little drying,but it actually felt hydrating on my skin. I think this is great under makeup but also just on its own over moisturizer/spf! Very blurring!
