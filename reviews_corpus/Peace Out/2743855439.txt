This primer has a mousse consistency and spreads easily over the skin. I felt like I see the effect of smoother and primed skin after around 50 to 60 Sec. I am not a huge fan of the scent of the primer. This primer helps in application of the foundation easy and makes the skin look very polished! With the added benifits of skincare this primer is a good option for troubled skin. The packaging is simple and functional. nan
