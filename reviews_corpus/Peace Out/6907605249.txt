I actually did like these. They have micro needles and the patches stick on pretty well. I wouldnâ€™t buy these hoping to get rid of or treat acne overnight though, obviously. These are good for those occasional pimples with heads just to pull some gunk out. Rating 4/5 because I feel they are overpriced for the amount you get. Great little patches!
