As expected these work great! I typically use the original Peace Out Acne dots and these work just as well except since they have the salicylic acid and retinol infused in them they feel like they’re treating and drying out the pimple simultaneously. They’re definitely thinner than your regular pimple patch, though not completely undetectable (you still do see them on your skin). Regardless they’re great for the daytime, got the job done and flattened my pimple. Works great
