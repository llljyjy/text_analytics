I really like the application of this product and it’s super easy to put on before bed.  If you feel it’s tugging on your skin, try to warm it up a bit first so it’s a little softer.  I will say that you definitely need to moisturize if you use this though.  before I realized that, the skin around my eyes didn’t look dry when it was bare, but once I put concealer on, you could definitely see it flaking a bit. nan
