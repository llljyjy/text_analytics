I’m a big fan. I’m 37, and have some fine lines in my forehead, and this is my first go with retinol. It’s easy to apply because it’s in stick form, and hasn’t cause me any issues with flaking skin or breakouts. It took a few weeks to notice the difference but I’m really glad I stuck it out. I typically use it every other day when I remember but I noticed a huge difference today, after forgetting it for almost a week. I’m definitely going to try the eye version as well. I’m a fan!
