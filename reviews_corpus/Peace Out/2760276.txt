thought I would try these so I got them yesterday, wore them on the 11 lines and lower face area and after the 6 hours, removed them. Lines were softened however when  I woke up this AM, all lines were back to the way they were before. People experiencing great results must be in their 20’s or 30’s. . The patch on my 11 lines caused my eyes to itch and get puffy which I don’t understand because I have used tons of eye creams with retinol in them. I don’t get the high ratings. The results are very, very temporary. Over hyped and overpriced. Very disappointing and won’t be wasting my money again. Staying with my liquid retinol and my retin A cream Overhyped and a big fail
