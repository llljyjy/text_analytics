I’ve always loved retinol products for the eye area. This one is not irritating to my undereye area at all (although my skin is pretty used to retinols). The stick packaging is interesting, however if you have any toner or serum on before applying this one, it doesn’t go on to layer well. Another thing is if you don’t warm it up before applying the stick can feel pretty solid and hard to apply. It will take long-term consistent use for the anti-wrinkle effects to show, and I’ve only used it for a few days. (Gifted by Peace Out Skincare for my honest reviews). great but needs to be warmed up before use
