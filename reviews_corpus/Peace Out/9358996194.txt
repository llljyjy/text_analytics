Another product that over-promised and under-delivered. I used all of these on the same dark spot. All 12 and nothing changed. Maybe the spot was too old or too dark, I don’t know. Just disappointing. Also, I don’t understand why people are giving this product three or four stars but saying it didn’t work in their reviews. I should have read them more clearly and not just looked at the overall star count before purchasing… that’s on me. Don’t Waste Your Money
