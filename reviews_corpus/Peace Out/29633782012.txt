The Retinol Eye Stick by Peace Out is excellent for those of us with fine lines, dark circles, or uneven skin texture in the under eye area. Formulated with fabulous ingredients, but mild enough to use on the sensitive skin around the eyes, it has encapsulated retinol (of course), peptides, and an antioxidant called Astaxanthin that studies have found is 6000x STRONGER than Vitamin C (yes, you read that right!) to finally help give you a more bright, firm, and even looking eye area. Also fragrance-free, cruelty-free, and vegan, I love how convenient the packaging is; a simple, colorful, and easy to use eye stick that looks just like a lip balm. Can be used as little as once a week for those with more sensitive skin. I could already see a slight difference in the skin around my eyes in just a few days. I am 35 so the skin around my eyes has begun to develop that crepe-like texture we all do our best to avoid, and I could see improvement in that as well as seeing it was more hydrated. This is such a great product! Definitely will be purchasing this again when I run out! Super convenient & easy to use!
