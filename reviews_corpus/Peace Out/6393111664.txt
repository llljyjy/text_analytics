I love the retinol face stick. This balm really hydrates my skin. I feel like the formula is mild because retinol usually gives me red blotches but it hasn’t. Since it’s greasy I prefer to use it at night so my skin can soak it all up while I rest. My skin definitely looks smoother in the morning and feels hydrated throughout the day. I received this product complimentary from Peace Out Skincare. Smooth hydrated skin
