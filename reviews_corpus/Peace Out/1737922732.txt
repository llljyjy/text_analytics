love this product. it does what it says IF you have white heads, don’t bother trying this on a black head or zit that hasn’t surfaced yet. that isn’t the purpose of this product. that being said, i put this on all day (thank you WFH) and i notice an immediate reduction in the size of my zit. after another day or 2, depending on how big the initial pimple was, it’s practically gone. i also put this on after a zit has popped and it helps to passively extract whatever gunk was still left. i took off a star because this is expensive but i will begrudgingly keep purchasing because it works and i haven’t found anything else, though i feel it should be more affordable it works///depending on the type of acne
