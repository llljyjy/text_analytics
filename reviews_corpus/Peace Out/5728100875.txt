This product is horrible I don’t know why such a product is on the market this patch literally doesn’t come off your skin easily when you try to remove it. It peels off the top layer of your pimple which rips of that protected skin layer which exposes the pimple it self which can result in inflammation and scars in the long run. I’m returning this, this will cause scars because it literally rips off the pimple. Not good. HORRIBLE
