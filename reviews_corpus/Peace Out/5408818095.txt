Okay, I was skeptical that this would improve my skin since I was just putting makeup on top of it but I was pleasantly surprised that it actually did. I don’t get terrible breakouts often but I always have a few blemishes that pop up regularly. After using this I noticed that my skin was staying clear and the dry skin around my nose and chin were all but gone. Makeup can be a huge culprit in skin woes, so having a primer like this that protects your skin, and makes your foundation look flawless? I couldn’t ask for more! Highly recommended! This is a must!
