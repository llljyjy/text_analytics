I loved using these stickers. They don’t have an odor, they’re easy to use. When they’re on your face you can barely tell!! I accidentally walked around running errands for an entire day with multiple on my face lol. They truly did minimize swelling/redness and kept me from habitually picking and making a small pimple WAY worse. nan
