I adore these pimple/acne patches!! I have used them on my face, shoulders, and back with no residue left behind and no irritation! They are easy to apply and do not peel off after a few minutes of wear. I usually pop one on before I left for work and will take it off before bed to apply the nighttime dot! I have found that it reduces the puss, redness, and pain from my spots! A must have pimple patch!
