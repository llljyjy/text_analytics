I’ve been using this Blemish Balm consistently for a week now, and I’m seeing very stark positive results to my skin. My pores that used to be noticeable, are completely unnoticeable now, and my rough scarred and darkened skin patches are lighter and smoother. I’m not fully sure how this magic is happening, but I’m definitely going to keep using it, because I’m looking great and feeling more confident than ever before.  I received this complimentary from Peace Out Skincare in exchange for my honest opinion. My skin is looking great! Thank you!!
