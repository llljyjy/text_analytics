I don’t know how they do it but it works and it works so fast that it always amazes me. I started wearing the acne day dots with make up, and at first I was a bit skeptical but if you follow the steps that they provide it looks so amazing and seamless that people usually don’t notice and I feel like my skin is well protected and healing. The night dots are just pure magic, I swear that my pimples are incredibly reduced and sometimes gone the next morning after I applied it. A must have!
