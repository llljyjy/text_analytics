Always love buying this product especially in cases of emergency or when I have the kind of white-head pimple that hurts by even the slightest touch. I leave these on for at least 3 - 4 hours or better still overnight, and it sucks the white head out of my pimples and reduces the size of the pimple/red spot of my acne. Lifesaver! Highly recommend and will definitely repurchase for its fast action and results! Really works and works every time!
