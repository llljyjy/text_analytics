The Peace Out Acne Dots contain salicylic acid to help fight acne while also covering up your acne. While it didn’t work overnight, I saw significant improvement in the size of my pimple the next day. I wouldn’t recommend using them around your hairline. They are very adhesive and will rip out your hair. Gifted by Peace Out. nan
