I didn’t have high expectations because finding a good primer for larger pores can be hard but I was pleasantly surprised! This does a great job at smoothing out the face for makeup application and I would also agree that it gives you better skin over time. I’m not a every day makeup wearer but I’ve still seen in a difference in the time I’ve worn it.Definitely worth the price point! my makeup bag was recently stolen on a trip and this was one of my first repurchased items!! A must for larger pores!
