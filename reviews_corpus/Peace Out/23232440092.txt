I received this complimentary from Peace Out Skincare in exchange for my review. I have heard so many good things about this brand so I’m glad I finally got the chance to try a product out. I want to start off by saying that the smell this has is very I pleasant, smells a lot like chemicals. Other than that this product works wonderfully. I started all over the face but then decided to just use it as a spot treatment and I’ve noticed a difference on my old hormonal acne scars. Love!!
