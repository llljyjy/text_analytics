No, really. This primer rules. Used alone, it blurs imperfections and pores and gives a beautiful natural finish (perfect for working from home!) Used under makeup, it creates the perfect canvas for foundation and other products. It has a gorgeous feel - velvety, yet light - and doesn’t pill like some primers can. It improved the wearing power of my makeup and helped me not get oily. I’m obsessed! UBBBBSESSED
