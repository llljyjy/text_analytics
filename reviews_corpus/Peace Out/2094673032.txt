I purchased this directly from Peace Out and left a review on their website that wasn’t posted.  It seems they are only showing the glowing recommendations for this product, which makes me mistrust the many stellar reviews. While I haven’t used this long enough to know if it will work, I do know that it stinks.  I don’t know if I got a  bad batch or if this is usual, but it reminds me of wet laundry that’s been left too long in the washer or sweaty socks.  If it does end up working, I’ll power through it but will only wear it at night. Product May Work but the Smell Doesn't
