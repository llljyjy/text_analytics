My first impression is that this lightweight, gel textured serum is comprised of the latest discoloration-targeting ingredients. It has 2.5% Tranexamic Acid, 10% AHA blend ,0.5% Kojic Acid & 2.5% Alpha-Arbutin. Professional dermatologists warn that these acids don’t smell good. The Peace Out Dark Spot Serum does not contain added fragrance. The natural scent of this formula is, well, different. I combat it by applying my favorite scented moisturizer 30 minutes after applying the Peace Out Dark Spot serum.I’ve been applying it for six weeks straight on a few post-acne dark marks and melasma. It usually takes at least six weeks of consistent use to see the full results. I use it once each night as a spot treatment. The first week, I experienced some mild peeling. The peel stopped after the ninth day. This serum hasn’t done much for the melasma yet. The post-acne marks are just beginning to lighten. At the sixth week mark, the areas I treated are smoother. I will continue to use the serum for the next month when I expect to run out. I am going to purchase it since the formula is the gold-standard and is well priced for what it contains. Powerful formulation requires time and patience
