To start, I have gone through a tube myself and did purchase a tube for my little sister for Christmas. That being said, I have used this product long enough to have a solid opinion on it. I really do enjoy this product. It is great for being a Mom and not always having the time or motivation to do a full skin care routine some days. It does hydrate and the under eye skin looks firmer and brighter. My only gripe if that it is balmy. I was not able to use everyday twice a day without getting a couple under eye bumps. I reduced to once daily or once every other day use and found better results that way for myself. I really love Peace Out as a brand and they have some fantastic products that are reasonably priced. I would repurchase and recommend, especially if you have not so reactive skin. Of course there is tugging with stick products, but this is easy to warm up and lasts quite awhile too! Easy, effective product.
