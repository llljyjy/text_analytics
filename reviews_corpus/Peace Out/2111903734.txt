I have combination skin that is generally clear and blemish-free, however I used to suffer from acne in my mid-20s (which required accutane treatment that thankfully helped), and today, at 40, I still get the occasional nasty hormonal cystic pimple. You know the ones - red, inflamed, painful, massive, and stick around for weeks. I bought these acne dots on a whim and having tried everything under the sun, had low expectations. But these are seriously magic. I have never seen anything like it. They bring out everything in just a few hours and even those nasty cysts disappear a loooot faster - not in a day, but less than a week (when usually for me, they take 2-3 weeks to disappear and even then only with aggressive BPO treatment, leaving red marks for months). Small pimples disappeared within a few hours. Basically whatever nasty gunk there is is somehow pulled from your skin in a few hours and, bonus, they indeed to not leave a mark or dry out your skin. I am absolutely, thoroughly impressed and would highly recommend these to anyone Magic
