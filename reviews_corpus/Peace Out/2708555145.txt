I use this brand’s pimple patches so I wanted to try the dark spot serum because the ingredient list has several ingredients that worked for me in the past. I think it’s pretty effective at fading post-acne marks as long as you start using the serum right after the inflammation/puffiness goes away. My marks definitely fade faster with this one vs not using anything. nan
