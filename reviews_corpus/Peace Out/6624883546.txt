How nasty is all of your skin that this does anything??? I take it off after 6+ hours and there’s nothing on it.  It leaves a sticky residue and mark on my skin (bandage shaped) for hours.  I like their small pore dots but these are a total no from me. Also I think the pore dots work so well because of the SA.  These don’t have SA. Also you can buy regular bandaid brand of these for like $5.  Just look for hydrocolloid bandages. Definitely not worth it
