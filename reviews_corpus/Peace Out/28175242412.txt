I am 37 years old and have cystic acne with mid-cycle hormonal flares, so I approached this product with realistic expectations. I don’t think it is designed for cystic acne, but I decided to try it anyhow because I tried rather expensive patches designed specifically for cystic acne that did not work. I have used three dots each on two different cystic acne lesions at two different stages. When I used dots in the earliest apparent stage, I noticed the lesion did not swell to the point I expected it to though the duration of it was unchanged. When I used dots on a later stage (like when you could be tempted to try to express some pus out but you know better because it’s a cystic lesion), the dot performed like I expect it would on regular acne that forms a head (i.e. it “pulls“ the pus out and leaves the lesion much flatter and less angry). So far I would say this product is worth using. It is not a miracle, but it doesn’t hurt, and may help more than the usual benzoyl peroxide and hydrocortisone cream combination I apply. Plus, I don’t run the risk of bleached spots on towels, pillow cases, etc. like I do with benzoyl peroxide. No harm, probably helpful
