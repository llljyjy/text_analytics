I have been wanting to try this product fit a while. Like with any Retinol, results do take time. I am however pleased with improvements so far. I use this product at night. When I wake up daily, the eye area is definitely smoother and there is no dryness. It actually makes applying concealer a breeze. It seems to give a temporary effect of brightness u dee the eye as well. I will continue to use nightly and look forward to seeing more results. Nice results!
