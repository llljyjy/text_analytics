I received this serum for free from Peace Out in exchange for my honest review.  This is the Dark Spots Serum which is a brightening solution for dark spots and uneven skin tone.  The serum is packed with powerful ingredients like tranexamic acid, kojic acid, AHA’s and alpha-arbutin.  I have some sun spots that I was trying to minimize with this product.  Unfortunately for me the scent is way too off-putting.  I tried the serum once but couldn’t continue due to the strong odor.  Fortunately, my daughter was able to use this serum with great results.  She has some acne scarring and the serum has really helped her skin tone to become more even.  She reported that her skin felt glowing and soft after use, and she didn’t have a problem with the scent at all!  She told me she loves the serum and will continue to use it. Works great, some might not like scent
