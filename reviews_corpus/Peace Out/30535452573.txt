I received this product complimentary From Peace Out Skincare. I love the idea of this retinol stick. It’s easy to use and has a   Gentle formula, although it isn’t gentle when i apply to my undereye, I have only been using it for a couple of weeks, but I haven’t noticed anything that will make me continue to use it, I am not WOWED or even impressed. This is a pass for me pass
