I’m always looking for a primer that’s hydrating for my dry skin and this definitely worked. The primer has hyaluronic acid which is an ingredient key I look for with dry skin, especially with the colder month’s coming. The packaging itself is really cute and easy to just put in your bag and travel with. Upon putting the primer, I’m used to more wet and tacky primers, and this was not what I’m used to and I wish it felt more hydrating when priming the face. It definitely does blur pores and reduce redness. On full days when I’m out, I notice that it does do a good job at blurring and smoothing out the skin for a perfect base with or without makeup. I also like how it’s a makeup product with long term skincare ingredients! nan
