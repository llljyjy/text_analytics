I received this product as a complimentary gift from @butterly for my honest review. The Dark Spots Serum is my first Peace Out skincare product, and I was so excited to receive it in the mail. Made with 10% AHA blend, 2.5% Tranexamic Acid, 0.5% Kojic Acid, 2.5% Alpha Arbutin, and a concoction of other ingredients that are great for treating uneven skin tone, dark spots, and texture. Another plus about this serum is that it is also fragrance-free perfect for those who are sensitive to scents. I have been using this product for over two weeks now, and I love the results. This serum is affordable, very light and gentle to the skin. It targeted the discoloured areas of my face from acne scars. I found that those targeted areas look brighter, and the appearance of my acne scars is much more faded than before using this product. Highly recommended.  #DarkSpotsAreDonzo #SuperchargedSolution #gotitfree The Best Concoction For Dark Spots
