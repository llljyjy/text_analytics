I love that this set comes with patches for both daytime and nighttime use.  The daytime ones are thin and sheer enough so I can apply my foundation overtop. I often have a cluster of pimples on my forehead and chin and love that this product is mess free. The Salicylic acid helps get my pimples under control quickly. The aloe vera is soothing so there is no redness after use. The patches are easy so remove. The box contains a good number of patches and the box can be recycled after it is empty. I also appreciate that the patches are great to keep in my purse or bring with me while traveling. nan
