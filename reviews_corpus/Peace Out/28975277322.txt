I was given the Peace Out Retinol Eye Stick complimentary to try out. Firstly, I like that this is vegan and cruelty-free and geared for all types of skin. This does not have a scent from what I can tell. When you look at the stick, it looks hard. I gently stretched out my skin slightly then applied the balm. The balm glided on smoothly. I use this on the sides of my eyes for the fine lines and around the sides of my lips. It is too soon to tell if I am seeing results. I do like the ingredients and hopefully in a couple of weeks will see great results. Retinol Eye Stick
