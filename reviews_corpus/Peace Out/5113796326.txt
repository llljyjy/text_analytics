I love this formula - it’s great for my combination skin that swings from super oily to red and irritated.  It’s a really lovely, thick formula that absorbs quickly and pairs really well with my tretinoin to minimize irritation.  My only complaint about this product is the packaging - I feel I lose so much product that is nearly impossible to get out towards the end.  It would be much better if it came in a tube instead! Formula rules, packaging doesn't!
