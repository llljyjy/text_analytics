I tend to break out during that time of the month and this serum really helps with that. I started using it during nighttime (personally my face is on the drier side during fall season, so 2 times a day is a little too drying for my face) and after 3 nights, I can see my acne is completely dried out and the healing process begins. I canâ€™t wait to use it in the summer months when my skin will become oilier. So far I like it a lot! Great product for acne
