This retinol stick is very smooth and easy to apply.  I do prefer a stick form to liquid or creams particularly for the under eye area and this fits the bill. Also you don’t have to wash your hands after an application. I thinks it’s very affordable and a little goes a long way. My under eyes don’t look puffy or dark and I love the results. Highly recommended. Magical stick!
