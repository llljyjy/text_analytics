These acne dots are amazing! I wish these were around when I was a teenager. I use them for the occasional hormonal acne and they work great. It’s satisfying seeing the patch absorb the contents of a pimple. When I use these my pimples deflate and heal quickly. The addition of salicylic acid, retinol and aloe vera make the patches work better than the competitors who don’t feature said ingredients. I will continue using these forever and will recommend to all my friends. nan
