I struggle with very small fine lines on my forehead that become more apparent when I apply makeup. My foundation settles into these fine lines and causes them to look more noticeable. I wanted to give these patches a try because I love the acne patches that Peace Out makes. I followed the instructions and applied the patches to cleansed and dried skin. The next morning, my fine forehead lines were noticeably smoother. Iâ€™m not sure how this product would work on deeper wrinkles, but for my fine lines it seemed to do the trick!
