I love the Instant Pore Perfector I received it complimentary from Peace Out Skincare. To me it’s more skincare than a makeup primer because of it’s long term benefits.It has my two favorite ingredients in it Niacinamide, Malic Acid, and their own special blend of Hyaluronic Acid. What i personally experienced is my pores looked small, my skin was more hydrated, and I notice that my skin just looked better. The product has unbelievable slip that makes it just glide over my skin. I love the soft and silky texture.I love using it right before a zoom meeting with no makeup on because it gives me such a polished look on camera without wearing makeup for coverage. When I use with with makeup it simply enhances my look and makes my pore look so much small in person and on film.I need a jumbo size of this! Poof pores be gone!
