I was lucky that Peace Out sent me the Instant Pore Perfector to try early. It’s lightweight,  much lighter than other pore products I’ve used, and a little goes a long way. I tested it with and without makeup. Without makeup it worked beautifully, my pores were minimized, my skin looked healthy and I noticed that it almost looked blurred,  like if I’d used powder. The hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, mushroom extract and malic acid worked worked well together to plump and hydrate my skin and soften my fine lines. The results lasted for hours, even after being out in the heat. I also used it as a primer under my makeup, I do recommend a light hand with it, you really do not need much, I used a light to medium coverage foundation and there was no balling or pilling, my foundation settled beautifully, I didn’t use powder to set it, but I honestly didn’t need it. My skin looked flawless, it looked like I had airbrushed my pores. It actually worked better under my makeup than powder does on top. Again, the effects lasted for hours, it didn’t break up or separate my foundation or other products. This will definitely be something I use again and again,  with or without makeup. A must try!
