My first impression of this serum was positive, as I have other Peace Out products I really love, and the packaging was really cute. The serum itself is very lightweight and blended into my skin so easily. I was not a fan of the smell and not sure how to describe it but itâ€™s very potent. I anticipate great results over time! Gifted by Peace Out Skincare but all opinions are my own. nan
