I used to use this product religiously-it cleared up my acne completely and I would always recommend it to everyone I knew. It was a lifesaver. Unfortunately, the formula has changed recently and it has an awful mildew smell. The consistency is completely different, it is almost grainy. It does not go on smoothly anymore. I thought if I could just get over the new terrible smell, I could still use the product. But I’ve noticed that my skin has broken out even more because of it. I’m so sad that my favorite skincare product is gone… I hope the old formula is brought back Used to be my favorite but new formula is AWFUL
