I like retinol eye products so I was excited to try this. I’m not sure the stick version works for me. The product is rather firm and takes some effort to apply. I“m not sure how I would soften it. So the fine lines around my eyes don’t really need the additional pulling and tugging of trying to apply this. I haven’t really noticed a positive difference after using this for over a week. Not something I would get again. Received a free sample from Peace Out for my review. Not for me
