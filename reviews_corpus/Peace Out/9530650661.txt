I received Peace Out Dark Spots Serum complimentary from Peace Out Skincare in exchange for my honest review. I think this is a pretty good product. Iâ€™ve been noticing some dark spots on my forehead for about a year now and I think they may be age spots. After using this a few times they appear to be lighter. I like that the serum feels light when applying. I absolutely do not like the scent. I will definitely purchase. Good product
