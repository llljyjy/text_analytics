I received this retinol face stick complimentary from Peace Out. As with any retinol product, I started off using this once a week to see how my skin reacts, and my skin didnâ€™t show any negative reaction. I love the fact that this is easy to dab on instead of being in a cream formula. Hoping to move on to two days a week to see how it goes! nan
