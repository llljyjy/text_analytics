I’m obsessed with these. I’ve tried several other brands, but none have pulled as much gunk out of my skin. I have had the experience several times of slapping one of these things onto a sizable pimple before going to sleep, and then waking up in the morning to a full healing dot (sorry so gross) and a totally flat, healed patch of skin. Sometimes it takes a couple of days. I wish I had had these when I was a teenager. These are saving my skin
