I’m usually skeptical about products that make these types of claims but these acne dots??? Insane. Especially when paired with their acne serum & worn for 6+ hours (put them on before bed; I leave them on throughout the day if I’m gonna be home/out wearing a mask). I’ve had pimples that were half the size in one day & completely gone in 2. They’re most effective on pimples that have already come to a head, but I’ve noticed they’ll sometimes either calm ones that haven’t come to a head yet or speed up the process. As long as they sell these I’ll keep buying. Amazing product
