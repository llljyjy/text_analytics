Incredibly “meh” for me. I’ve been using this around my eye area at night for a few months. I haven’t noticed any change (positive or negative) that could be contributed to this product.I definitely fell for the packaging, I love the idea of an eye treatment that can be applied like a lip balm. But the formula has a hard wax consistency that does not glide smoothly. It snags on my thinner eye skin (ok, bags) even if I try to warm it up first.I have oily skin that is prone to dehydration, but it’s not particularly sensitive. I have the hints of fine lines developing around my eyes, but my main concerns are puffiness and eye bags. I think I may have simply chosen the wrong product for my skin type and concerns because I am incredibly underwhelmed.I’ve started applying this to other parts of my face just to use it up. I do not plan to repurchase. not impressed
