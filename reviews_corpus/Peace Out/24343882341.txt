I was gifted by peaceoutskincare. I love how this primer instantly works at covering up any redness and pores. It has a thicker tinted consistency and is very gentle on sensitive skin with the hero ingredients and being cruelty free makes it even better. I would repurchase because it keeps my skin looking mattified and smooth even without makeup on and takes away the oily shine and dry patches I always have from combination skin Mattifier
