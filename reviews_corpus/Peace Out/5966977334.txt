I received this product complimentary of Peace Out Skincare. This primer comes out in a greenish brown color. It helped even my tone since I have a lot of redness. The consistency is thick but doesnâ€™t feel heavy on my skin. It also helps control my shininess. I love that it blurs my pores without clogging it. Hyaluronic acid and Niacinamide are great ingredients that help my skin overtime as well! nan
