Had very low expectations on these but to my surprise they actually work! They are super satisfying when pulling them off plus the pimple heals much faster. I do find that they work better on white heads and when you leave them on for around 8 hours! My only complaint is that it does create redness after however my skin is super sensitive. Will definitely repurchase. A must have!
