This was my first experience with a Peace Out Skincare product, and I’ve enjoyed it. The Peace Out Retinol Eye Stick is so convenient and easy to use. It’s as simple as applying chapstick, only I use it around my eyes, between my eyebrows, and around the mouth. I know it’s only meant for eyes, but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to use it where other fine lines may show. It goes nicely under moisturizer, too. Such an easy addition to my skincare routine! Super easy addition to my skincare routine!
