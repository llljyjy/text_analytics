like the title says -- this is the only acne sticker that’s EVER worked for me and i wholeheartedly stand by it. i get breakouts once a month around my period and this stops my pimples from becoming a problem (now it’s just a slight inconvenience) . i’ve also used this on ingrown hairs to some success-- not always perfect but definitely has made them better ! only thing i trust for my zits
