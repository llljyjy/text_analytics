These acne patches are my holy grail! I have purchased the original ones multiple times and I love how they have salicylic acid and retinol to help heal my breakouts faster.  This day and night duo is great because it comes with some sheer dots that are perfect for wearing during the daytime under makeup.  I prefer wearing an acne patch on my acne instead of trying to cover it up with makeup and the sheer dots help heal my pimple faster while kind of covering it up as well.  Iâ€™ve tried a ton of acne patches and these by far and my favorite. My favorite acne patches
