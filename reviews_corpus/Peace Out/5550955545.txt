So I’ve use the patch about four times and what I’ve noticed since using it is that if you don’t open the bump like pop it or try to squeeze something out of it the patch doesn’t work that effectively but when I did try to squeeze or pick at the bump a little bit and then apply the patch it reduced it completely got all the icky stuff out Love this it’s a must have!!!!!
