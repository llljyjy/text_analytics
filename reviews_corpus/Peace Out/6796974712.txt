I will start by saying these wont bring your pimple from 100 to 0, nothing will. BUT these WILL reduce the size and severity of all types of pimples and can be a major godsend at times. These are probably the most expensive patches on the market but also work the best-they have salacylic acid at 0.5% unlike most that have no active medical ingredients so instead of just draining they will help to clear and kill the bacteria in your pimple as well, also they stick really well compared to most other patches so for guys (or girls) with a beard, this will be a must. I have get a reoccuring pimple every few months in the same area that stays painfully under the skin and I found that at first sight of its return, if I put these on at night for about 3 nights in a row, i can stop it from forming all together and beat it before it becomes a problem so itâ€™s also a tool in prevention instead of just maitanence. Wish these were half the price to be honest but for the confidence of clear skin these bring, they currently are still worth it to me-but lets see what infaltion does... Expensive but lifesavers
