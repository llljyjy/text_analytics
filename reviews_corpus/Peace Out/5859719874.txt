I received this product free from the brand. When I saw this product for the first time it really intrigued me. I never really heard about retinol in a solid form, I felt like that concentrated amount would be perfect for my under eye and areas with discoloration. I have been using it for only a week but so far it is good, I really like the solid retinol idea and my skin feels smoother already. Like it so far
