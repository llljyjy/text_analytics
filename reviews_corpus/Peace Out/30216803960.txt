This is a great brightening serum. The INCI is bomb and it feels great on the skin. This was gifted by Peace Out Skincare and didn’t know what was in it until I received it. I was bummed out when I saw propanediol on the label because I hate how it feels on my skin. Fortunately, this serum doesn’t have that usual greasy propanediol feel and it’s a great serum!
