Decided to give these a try after falling in love with their acne patches. They work and feel good, but I probably won’t repurchase for two reasons: 1) the package is such a waste (cardboard box + plastic slip for each pair). 2) The price per pair is also pretty high ($5.5) compared to Peter Thomas Roth’s cucumber eye patches ($2.27). Good, not great.
