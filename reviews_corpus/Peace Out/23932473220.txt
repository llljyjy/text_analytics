I’ve recently been using Peace Out Dark Spot Serum and already see an improvement in my complexion. The serum goes on lightweight and quickly absorbs into my skin, not leaving it sticky. My skin tends to be dry and dull, in addition to having some sun spots. After using this serum consistently, my face looks overall clearer and brighter without any irritation. Additionally, the spots are less noticeable and I can’t wait to see the results in the upcoming weeks! I love that this product contains clean ingredients as well. nan
