This item was gifted by Peace out skincare.  I was super excited to try out this dark spot serum to see if helped me out with fading some older stubborn spots. I’ve been taking it really slow with this serum because the ingredients are a mixture that can be really potent and potentially “purge“ or break me out. I have sensitive skin btw so I usually have to do this. So far I haven’t seen too much of  a fading effect on my spots but I have started to see improvements in the texture of my skin. The scent is a bit unpleasant but nothing I can’t bare. I look forward to the future results. A slow start but has potential.
