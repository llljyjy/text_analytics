I received this complimentary from Peace Out for my review. These patches were a little difficult for me to remove with out touching the micro needling part. Once I got them applied to my face at first it did catch me off guard with a prickly sensation but then after my other uses I got used to it. They do stay on your face well. I slept in mine and had no problems. I have not seen a difference yet after 2 weeks so I will continue to use and provide an update after using for 6 weeks. No difference yetâ€¦
