I received complimentary from PEACE OUT! This is a fragrance-and Silicone-free daily, lightweight acne serum that contains highly potent 2% salicylic acid to visibly target and treat breakouts. Its lightweight, soothing formula contains niacinamide and vitamin C to reduce the look of post-breakout discoloration and zinc, which helps minimize excess oil. This serum is for acne-prone skin! It can be used as a serum for the whole face or as an acne spot treatment! I use it as an acne spots treatment! My skin has a bit of acne and marks. I look forward to using it to reduce more of my acne and marks! I will continue to use it and look forward to a better result. nan
