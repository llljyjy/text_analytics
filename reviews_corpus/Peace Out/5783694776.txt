This is a great companion product to their acne spots/patches. The salad til does a great job exfoliating without drying out my skin. I also like the fact that if I ever run the risk of applying too much product, I know itâ€™s not going to do too much damage. Packaging is great. The little pump is easy to use. Overall as an acne prone person this is great. Gifted by practice out skincare nan
