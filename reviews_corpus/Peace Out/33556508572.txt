I received this from Peace Out in exchange for my honest review. I am new to retinol and have used serums but never a stick so I was excited. It says it’s for the face but I did t enjoy it for the face. I felt like it wasn’t as easy to apply over my other skincare and I felt like I may have used too much. I did however try it on my hands and neck and loved it for my body. This is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars but other than thatit was great. nan
