I canâ€™t remember if I wrote a review already but this is a 6 month check in. I LOVE THIS STUFF IT HURTS! I am on my second stick and my eyes have never looked better. I am 25 and no true wrinkles like my mother (sorry mom) but it has plumped, filled in the fine lines and made my eyes look younger, even my co-workers noticed a difference. One thing I would change is the packaging as there is soooo much more product in the tube thats just stuck inside. I did get it out by using my cosmetic tweezer which got me another significant amount so maybe fix this issue? Just a thought. Otherwise its amazing. 3 month check in; ITS AMAZING
