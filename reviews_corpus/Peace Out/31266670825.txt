Never tried a stick eye cream before, it is so interesting to try. This eye cream is easy to apply  and the skin under my eye looks  brighter and softer after using this eye cream stick for about one week. Tough it is a retinol eye cream, it keeps my eye area skin very moisture and  I did not experience any irritation.  Really enjoy it and recommend. Love it
