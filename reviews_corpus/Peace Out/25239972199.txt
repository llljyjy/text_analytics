Peace out skincare gifted me this product in exchange for my honest review. The green tone of this product is great at neutralizing redness. I have noticed that my skin appears even when using this, though I do not observe complete erasure of pores. I think this is almost better than some of the more effective pore erasing products that I have tried, because the product does not create a “thick makeup“ appearance or pill when products are applied over top of it. I did observe some acne while testing this product, but it was mostly on my chin and not on my nose and forehead where I usually see product reactions. I have been under a lot of stress in grad school lately, so the acne could possibly be hormonal and not product-related! nan
