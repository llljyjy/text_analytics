I was gifted the Peace Out Day & Night Duo in exchange for my honest opinion. A little backstory, for the past several years I’ve been struggling with hormonal acne and has had a hard time when it comes to not picking. I’ve tried hydrocolloid patches in the past but I felt like they didn’t really do much. The patch itself would appear dirty but it wouldn’t pull everything out so I would constantly have to use patches everyday. When I tried the Peace Out Day Acne patches I was obsessed. They have salicylic acid so they were able to pull all the gunk out and help heal my skin. These patches are great to heal your skin and put a stop to your picking. Now, with the day and night duo, whenever I have a breakout I can put on a patch in the night to pull all the gunk out and then in the morning put on another to stop my picking and heal my breakout. I don’t have to use nearly as many either because they work so fast. Definitely my new go to product to avoid and heal breakouts! Great to avoid and heal breakouts!
