I love how velvety the formula is for this primer, it instantly melts into the skin. The green tint is perfect to cover any redness and instantly fills in large pores. I was honestly blown away by how well it fills in pores. I did a thin layer of tinted moisturizer over this, no concealer and the results are amazing! So good at smoothing out pores!
