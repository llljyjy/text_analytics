I’ve bought it twice and the second time was because all of the amazing reviews and thought I would give wit a try again. I had a white head- put on the patch wore it for 8 hours overnight. Nothing. Put  another patch on wore it all day- still had the white head. Wore a third patch over night again- I finally popped it with an extractor tool the next morning. I don’t think there is enough salicylic acid in the patches. not worth it
