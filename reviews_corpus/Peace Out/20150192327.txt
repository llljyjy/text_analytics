It really works! I am in my 40’s, olive skintone and it helps brighten the under eye dark circles that I get sometimes. I don’t use it everyday, maybe every other day, when I see I need it. I also put it on eyelids and it’s not irritating at all. Helps lift the eyelid a bit too. I like how it rolls on. It can be a tiny bit greasy since it is a balm so be careful about makeup. BUY THE STICK
