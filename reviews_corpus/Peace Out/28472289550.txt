Gifted by Peace Out Skincare. I haven’t had 2 weeks to test this out. So far so good though! This is meant to be used as the very last step in your routine, after moisturizer. This seems like a gentle retinol, so I’m using this about 3-4 times a week, & PLENTY of SPF the next day. My skin has been dewy & soft + my breakouts are less intense! So far, so great!
