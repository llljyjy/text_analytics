I got the cleanser in a set, not the full size and I’m glad I didn’t pay full price because this is the weirdest cleansing balm I’ve ever tried. It doesn’t say anywhere that it has a physical exfoliator or any gritty particles but it does. Imagine having tons of makeup and feeling texture as you rub it off. Also, I don’t want my acne medication to mix around with makeup or any other layers of product, it’s just an odd concept lol. I will say it removes makeup and sunscreen very well with no film or anything else left behind. However, everything else is unpleasant and cannot recommend. No thanks
