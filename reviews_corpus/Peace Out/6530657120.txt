These are by far the BEST acne patches on the market. Not once has it disappointed me when I put one on. It’s the most satisfying thing ever seeing it the next day - I do leave mine overnight as I find it works much better for me that way. ALSO, I’ve also found that I have to wait for the acne to be on top of the skin as suppose to deep into the skin. But anyways, if I could rate this 100 stars I would. These are my go to and ride or die!!! BEST ACNE PATCHES EVER!
