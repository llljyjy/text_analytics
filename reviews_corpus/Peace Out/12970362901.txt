I would give infinite number of stars to this product. Pimples that are still under the skin, but you feel them go away in one night after applying this pimple patch. For my hormonal, big red/whitehead pimples, these patches work for sure but the pimples donâ€™t go away in a night. All in all, a very good and an effective product. Pimples under the skin go away in a night!
