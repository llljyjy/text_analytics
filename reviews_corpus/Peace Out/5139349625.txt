I love this product so much. I bought this because I’ve started using RX tretinoin and I wanted something special for my eyes and WOW, I am so glad I did. It’s amazing. My dark circles look so much better and the fine lines under my eyes are disappearing. Also, if I layer this right, then my eyes are so, so hydrated thanks to the peptides and whatever else I’ve layered on that night. The price is very nice too and a little bit goes a long way. So easy to use, just be sure to warm the stick up a little first on the outside of your eye before swiping it under your eye to avoid any tugging. Amazing retinol for undereyes.
