I wanted this 3 pack of peace out products to work, I have tried soooo many other Acne items, I was at the point of “please, let this be the one!“ It is not, these dots, waste of time. The bottle, Peace Out Acne serum, No. However, I still use & like the Peace Out Blemish Balm for the sole reason that it’s an exfoliation for my still blemished skin...that product is a semi-effective cleanser. What has finally worked for me? Follow me over to any Ordinary page.... Peace Out of my pocket...not my Face
