I can’t remember how I looked before it, but I think it works incredibly well… Even if it has a placebo effect I am buying it again. I tried it on my laugh lines and it did make a difference there, but there were two problems. 1. I think it works while it’s on, but maybe not long term (will have to buy a second time to be sure)2. It makes me break out when I use it on my smile lines, but I will test and make sure that is not my normal acne I don’t know for sure if it works, but I LOVE IT!
