I am a sucker for cute packaging and this product immediately caught my eye! The formulation of the product felt great when I was applying it to my skin. I hate when products leave a greasy or sticky feeling after applying and this product did not leave me feeling like that at all! Start off using a small amount before increasing the usage to make sure there is no sensitivity. Although, itâ€™s too soon to tell if it has made much of a difference to my fine lines and wrinkles, it did leave my skin looking brighter after a couple of uses. I look forward to seeing the results of using this product! Lovely Product!
