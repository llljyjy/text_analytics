Love it! Itâ€™s skincare and s primer in one. Wear it everyday with under foundation and it gives me a a smooth finish. Pores are blurred out and love how it cancels out my redness. To top it off it has Niacinamide one of my favorite ingredients in skincare help control my oiliness. Definitely seen my pores shrinking after 3 week of using it. Smooth blur finish
