I don’t feel like I noticed any significant improvement in a blemish when I used this. However, it is difficult to tell because I can’t use one then go back in time and not use it to see if it actually made a difference. It seems when I get a blemish it just runs through the full cycle of coming to a head or just stays red and painful for a week. not sure it helped
