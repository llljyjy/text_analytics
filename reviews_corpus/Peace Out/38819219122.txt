I have several areas of hyperpigmentation from age spots to sun spots on my face.  I have always been bad about following through with using brightening creams and serums.  The Peace Out Dissolving Microneedle Dots treatment is a lot easier.  I have noticed quite a bit  of brightening and lightening of the areas.  I do think it takes time and patience, but this is my favorite treatment I have used. nan
