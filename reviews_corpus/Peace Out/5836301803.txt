Gifted by Peace Out Skincare. Too soon to tell results wise but this is a great option for a starter retinol product that is gentle enough for sensitive skin. I’ve been using it as directed, last step in my routine on top of moisturizer, and I’ve really enjoyed it so far. It goes on very smoothly, it is easy to apply and does a great job at sealing in hydration. Great starter retinol
