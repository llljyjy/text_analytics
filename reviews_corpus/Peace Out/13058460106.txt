I tried using this product for ~2weeks on ONE specific spot. I wanted to test its impact on one acne scar before committing to putting the dots all over my face. There was barely any change. I recommend trying another brightening product if that’s what you’re looking for, but this wasn’t a very good deal in my opinion. nowhere near worth it
