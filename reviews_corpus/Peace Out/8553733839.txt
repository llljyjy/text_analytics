So I see in the reviews that a lot of people say it doesn’t work , and that it didn’t pull any gunk out of their pores and when I first used it , it did the same thing. But then one day I was doing pore extractions and atm I have lots of tiny bumps all over my forehead , and the pores on my nose always get clogged with sebum plugs and they look huge, I have those little bumps on my chin as well. When I do pore extractions I use an ultrasonic skin scrubber. One day I decided to put one strip on my forehead , nose and chin after my extractions and then i finally saw it start to work. I could see it pulling the gunk out of my nose, forehead and chin. So my recommendation is to only use these if you have whiteheads or put it on pores you have just cleaned out. It helps heal my acne so fast. So I wouldn’t use these on my face unless I had a bunch of pimples I just squeezed , or after squeezing pores (NOT recommended) , or after doing pore extractions. Hope this helped someone ! Oh and it also makes mypores look SO TINY!!!! Thought they did nothing…until..
