Another slam dunk for Peace Out Skincare! I love this brand! They did not disappoint with this new pore perfector. Not only does it feel good when you apply it, it rubs in easily and does not sit on top of the skin like some others that I have tried. It definitely can be used with or without makeup, especially because it has a skin tone tint to it! I like this product alot and will continue to use it! Great product by a great brand
