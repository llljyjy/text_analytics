I love how easy to use these patches are. I do wish you got more in the pack but you do get six patches. I have a laugh line that I’m hoping these can help with. After using, I didn’t notice a HUGE difference or improvement but I’d imagine you have to continue using a while longer before noticing. They’re convenient and easy to use, however, maybe not be the easiest thing to sleep with. I’ve used smaller pimple patches before so these are definitely larger than those but still doable! Worth Trying! Easy and Simple
