These patches contain niacinamide, tranexamic acid and ferulic acid to help lighten dark spots. Each patch contains 430 microneedling dots to help with product absorption. I love the idea of these patches but after a few days, I havenâ€™t noticed much improvement. The skin brightening ingredients are great but I think several boxes of these patches will be required for a significant change. nan
