I was gifted the Peace Out Acne Serum- Acne clarifying treatment serum in exchange for my honest opinion. After using the serum twice a day for just 2 days I started to notice a significant improvement in my skin. After a week any blemishes I had were cleared up. It is fragrance free and was gentle on my skin and did not dry it out at all.  It contains awesome super effective and awesome ingredients like salicylic acid, Niacinamide + vitamin c, zinc, triluronic acid, & centella asiatica extract. My complexion is more even and really looks great. I get mild acne at least 2 or 3 times a month and this serum is perfect for clearing it up quickly and keeping it from getting out of control. nan
