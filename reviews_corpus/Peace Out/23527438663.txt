These spot dots have been pretty great so far. First off, they are a pretty large size so they may be a bit big for those tiny pimples but it can actually cover larger ones well. The adhesive is great and I had no issues with lifting off at night or during the day. They worked pretty well for my acne and I love that you can really see them work. They arenâ€™t quite what I need for some of my breakouts but others, even more stubborn ones beneath the surface I have had success with. nan
