Peace out acne dots were gifted to me. These dots are the only thing that keep me from picking at my face! They actually heal my spots, they bring the redness and inflammation way down. These are super sticky dots but that means they aren’t going anywhere at night. My only con is I wish more came on a sleeve! Don’t pick your face!
