This is a great primer for water-based skin tints and for achieving a dewy base. Please remember this primer is silicone-free, so you shouldn’t pair a silicone based foundation or concealer with it! If you do, it’ll go on patchy and emphasis texture. I use this primer for when I wear my Glossier skin tint and the Glossier stretch concealer. It’s very blurring, minimizes pores, and is incredibly hydrating. My only issue is how small of an amount you get for the price. $28 for 0.8 oz/.34 ml of product is pretty steep considering most primers give you 1 fl oz/30 ml for the same price point. Blurring & Dewy! But Slightly Overpriced
