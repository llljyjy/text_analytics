I love how this is not the kind of retinol I need to pump and apply carefully to my face. I apply this evenly once around the eyes. Doesnâ€™t leave skin extra dry like other retinols in fact it leaves a slight greasy feel which I really like. Also love that I can carry it in a small bag if traveling or a short night out with friends! Must have!
