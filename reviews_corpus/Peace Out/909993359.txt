Iâ€™ve been using this serum for a few weeks now to try and lighten facial spots from acne and from sun exposure. I can already see fading of those areas, and surprisingly have gotten compliments on the brightness of my skin. I apply the serum and let it completely dry before applying the rest of my skincare items. I use this and the Peace Out Dark Spot Dots and Retinol Stick nightly, and have been very happy with the improvement in my complexion. This really works!
