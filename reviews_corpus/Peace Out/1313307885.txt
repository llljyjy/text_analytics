What I love about this product is that I feel like it is basically 2 serums in one. I’ve been looking for a dark spots serum for a bit now, I get a couple sun spot patches during summer, and have some slight discoloration on my cheeks. Plus, it’s almost guaranteed that after a zit, there will be some sort of scar (surface level or deeper). However, I already use a Vit C serum and an AHA serum, and I feel like there are just stubborn spots that aren’t going away. When looking at the ingredients here, I love that it is tranexamic but also blends in a high level of AHA’s. Most, I feel, are Tranexamic OR AHA’s and I was definitely interested in the combo of both. I’ve been easing it to it by using ever other night, and so far I can definitely see an improvement in my skin’s brightness/radiance and overall texture/tone. I have a couple dots that I am “monitoring“ as the true test, but so far, I like this. Love the Actives Combo!
