I have heard so many great things about the various Peace Out Skincare acne dots and finally gave them a try! It is crazy how quickly they aid in the disappearance of pimples and they help a ton with not giving into the urge of popping the pimple! Iâ€™ve used non-medicated ones in the last, but definitely think the added salicylic acid in these ones helps greatly! I love this pack in particular, as it contains patches for both day and night! The only thing I wish is that there was various sizes of the dots rather than all being the same! nan
