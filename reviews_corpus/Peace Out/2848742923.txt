Out of all the acne healing stickers I have tried, this is by far the best one and honestly worth the price. Unlike other brands, these stickers don’t irritate the skin or pull off any skin in the process. I have incredibly sensitive skin, and these stickers didn’t leave a mark when taking them off. By the second sticker, my acne spot is barely there. And I can wear these throughout the day! nan
