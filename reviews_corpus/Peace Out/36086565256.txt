I was lucky enough to recieve the Peace Out Instant Pore Protector as a free sample, and I am amazed at how well this product was able to succesfully minimize my pores. I have always struggled with enlarged pores and skin redness, and this product is my alternative to a concealer or primer. I used this product on my t zone, and it comes out as a creamy consistency, and is so smooth on my skin. This product truly works miracles! TRULY ASTONISHED!
