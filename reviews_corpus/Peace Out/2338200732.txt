I am literally OBSESSED with this product - I have oily, very acne-prone skin and this is heavenly. I have tried every dang primer under the sun and most work for a bit but tend to make me look like an oil slab throughout the day or feel ineffective after a few uses. I have been using this with the Rare Beauty pore diffusing primer and it is MAGICAL. You don’t need a ton, just a little and pat vs rub as the last thing you do before putting foundation. It’s a little pricey but lasts a long time. I. AM. SO. HAPPY. OBSESSED
