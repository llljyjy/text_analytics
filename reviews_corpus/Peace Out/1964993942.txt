I received this complimentary from Peace Out Skincare. The first thing I need to mention is the scent, it’s almost as if you spilled a perfume over wet laundry that’s been sitting. Pretty gross. That said, it does fade for me after 5ish min. I really enjoy the gel texture. It sinks into skin easily. My skin is looking bright when I use this one. It hasn’t faded any super stubborn dark spots but it is helping with ones that are less pronounced. Pretty good, not great
