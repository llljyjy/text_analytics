This stick is very convenient to use. I used the retinol product for eye care the first time. Donâ€™t have any irritation. Started with 2 days per week, now using every other day. I have very small, barely seen wrinkles, so I am not sure, how this stick reflects on them, but the bags and uneven tone became less visible for sure. Need time to see the difference
