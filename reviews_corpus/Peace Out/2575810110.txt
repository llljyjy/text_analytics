I like the idea of retinol in a stick form, however for me this was just a failure. I don’t know if I received a bad batch, but my product is a dark orange-rust color. It didn’t seem to be sinking into my bare skin when applied. I went to itch my face a couple of hours after application and my hand came back covered with a icky brown oil slick. I used a tissue to try and blot off most of the product and gave up and rewashed my face. I tried again last night with less product and   the same type of thing happened. I don’t want to get the greasy mess on my pillow case or in my hair. I’m really confused because I’ve used the Peace Out eye stick without issue. Spoiled product?
