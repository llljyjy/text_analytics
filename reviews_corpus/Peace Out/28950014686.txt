I received this Retinol Face Stick from complimentary from Peace Out Skincare in exchange for my honest opinion. This Retinol  Face Stick so far is very nice to use. I like that this treatment balm is cruelty-free and vegan, and the application method seems very cool to me! It’s too soon to tell for results though, but I’m excited to see the results of using this long-term! nan
