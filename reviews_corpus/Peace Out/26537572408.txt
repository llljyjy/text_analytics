I don’t have a huge wrinkle issue on my face but i do have a pesky one on my forehead. I was hesitant at the sticking power of these but to my surprise it stayed right in place overnight. once you stick it where you want and gently press over the patch you do feel little prices like you’re rolling a dermaroller over your face but it isn’t painful by any means. as far as the effective I can’t speak thoroughly on that as of yet but I will say I noticed a softness to the wrinkles appearance. and I will say be sure you don’t have to immediately leave your house after removing the patch because it did leave a mark on my skin for a little while. this was gifted by Peace Out Skincare. nan
