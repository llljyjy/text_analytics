Don’t let the color of this product fool you - it’s such a great formulation! I’ve been wearing this on my “no makeup days” primarily on my cheeks and forehead as that’s where I see the most texture from pores. Having oily skin I’ve tried sooo many products that claim to blur pores but I’m often let down. I was pleasantly surprised with this and love applying it after my spf. It smooths out the skin and is super soft. I’ll have to wait to see any long term results but the immediate is def worth the price tag! Smooooth
