These are pretty nice in my opinion but I didn’t try them on a really old discoloration spot. I tried them on a spot that I recently over picked at. I didn’t see immediate vanishing results but I can definitely tell that it was lighter the next day. I do feel like the discoloration is lighter in the morning but more obvious in the evening. I appreciate the fact that it is a targeted treatment rather than a whole face product. I also feel like the micro needles do a great job delivering the product deeper into the skin. I don’t know what kind of results you get using these on an older discolored spot. I like the micro-needling aspect.
