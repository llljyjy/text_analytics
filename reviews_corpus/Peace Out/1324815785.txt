I have been using Peace Out’s Retinol Eye Stick for over a year. Before I purchased it I was looking for a retinol product specially formulated for my eye area. The applicator mimics a lipstick container and lipstick which makes the serum balm very easy to apply. I start below my inner eye and swipe the balm across my skin to the outer portion of my eye. I also apply the balm across my eyelids and to the area where “crow’s feet” occur. I even apply it around my nasolabial fold. Now they make a retinol face stick to address that area. The serum balm absorbs quickly and does not interfere with the absorption of my eye cream. One eye stick will last me at least six months! The serum balm has eliminated dark bags and any fine lines I had. A little product goes a long way. I did receive a Retinol Eye Stick from Peace Out in exchange for my honest review. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. I strongly believe in preventive skin care and this Retinol Eye Stick is perfect! I love everything about this product!
