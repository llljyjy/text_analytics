I was excited to try this, because this skincare brand as always been great to me, but Unfortunately this time, it didn’t work out for me. I tested it out on a dark spot and it hasn’t faded— mind you I used it daily for a couple weeks. Normally within that time frame I see results, but not with this.  I wasn’t fond of how it felt on my skin either because it felt tacky and didn’t dry down well on my skin. Eh wish it was better
