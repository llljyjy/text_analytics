Really disappointed in this. I would contact customer service if I could find an email. I went to open the box and couldn’t find any instructions. Turns out they print the instructions on the inside of the box so you have to open the entire thing in order to read the instructions. Then I noticed a lot number on the end of the box followed by a date. The date is 12/2022. I think to myself, this can’t be a manufacture date because it’s August 2022. This must be an expiration date but it is not labeled as such. This is made in Korea. I am pretty disappointed in Sephora. bought in August- expires in December:(
