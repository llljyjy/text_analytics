I am so impressed by these! They work best on scars that are less than a few weeks old. I have been using these for two weeks on three spots. 1 of which is completely gone and the others have almost faded away. They are honestly worth the price point especially if used correctly. I have been needing these as I tend to pick at my face. nan
