Got it to my husband. He has oily skin and his nose is very oily. So I let him try it. It does absorb the oil and dirt from the nose, but he was a little uncomfortable and uncomfortable when it was on for so long. It is estimated that it will not be used for a long time, but it is OK to use it occasionally. nan
