This serum is really easy to use and lightweight on the skin. It absorbs well and does not feel tacky on the skin. It has a pretty potent ingredient list so I have been starting off slow. My biggest complaint is its smell as it smells a bit sour which Iâ€™m not a fan of. Otherwise, a pleasant experience so far! nan
