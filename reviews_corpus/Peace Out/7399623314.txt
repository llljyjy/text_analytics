I received this complimentary from Peace Out Skincare and tried this one a smallish pimple I had on my face and wore it to bed, woke up and it was completely flat and smooth. I’m impressed, I’m lucky I don’t have any other active pimples at the moment so im excited to use on future pimples. I did notice some dryness post removing the patch but I know BHA is supposed to dry out the pimple. nan
