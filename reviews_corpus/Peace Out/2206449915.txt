I received this in exchange for a review; these are my honest opinions.PROS:- super thin & comfortable with a satin/matte finish, which blends in surprisingly well- I like that these have an added touch of salicylic acid to help calm breakoutsCONS:- I find the packaging a bit wasteful- these are not truly invisible, which doesn’t really surprise or disappoint me, as they are still a sticker on the skin (but they are much more subtle than other patches I’ve tried!) great thin patches!
