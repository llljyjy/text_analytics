These are amazing. I usually put them on whiteheads active blemishes before I go to bed and they soak up all that gunk and make the spot look almost completely gone by the morning! They also don’t irritate the surrounding skin like other acne dots I’ve used. I’ve bought at least two boxes and another for my teenage brother, and I’m sure I’ll buy many more in the future. Lifesavers!
