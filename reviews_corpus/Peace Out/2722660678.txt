Peace Out Retinol Eye stick is such a unique concept. I like that I can just use the stick instead of applying products on hand. It applies fairly easy on your under dyes and have had no issues with it. I havenâ€™t seen anything significant so will continue to use and hope for the best for my fine lines. nan
