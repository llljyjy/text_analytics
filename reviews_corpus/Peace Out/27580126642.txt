Peace out Skincare gifted me their Dark Spot Serum. This serum is very lightweight and easy to spread across the face.I think the packaging is super cute.The serum is nice but the scent is a off putting to me.Luckily it dissipates rather quickly. I notice some if my dark spots were slightly lighter after 1 and a half weeks of continuous use. nan
