I received the Peace Out Acne Dots gifted by Peace Out in exchange for my honest review. These are thicker patches that should be used overnight. Though they are thicker and more noticeable, they stick on well and aren’t in any danger of falling off. I like how these patches have acne-fighting ingredients. They do a good job at healing pimples but if you’re using them on whiteheads with the hope that when you take off the patch, it’ll also suck out the gunk, you’ll be disappointed. Regardless, I do really like the patches though they are pricey. nan
