I’ve heard of Peace Out’s Acne Dots before but never tried it his brand until now. I’m so glad they came out with a serum so I don’t have to individually treat each blemish. This was a great find and I’m glad my first experience with this brand was positive. I use it every other day with retinol. Apparently I’m not supposed to use them together so I don’t don’t.
