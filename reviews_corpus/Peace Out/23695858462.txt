I have been using this serum in my morning and night time skin routine. I follow it up with a moisturizer. I feel like the texture of my skin has improved, much softer. My redness has gone down. I will continue using to see if it helps my dark spots. I received this product complimentary from Peace Out Skincare. Good!
