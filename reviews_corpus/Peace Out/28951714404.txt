So far so good. I am enjoying the peace out retinol stick. It has a nice texture and goes on pretty smoothly and it doesn’t irritate my skin. I haven’t seen much result but I think it will it just needs more time! I definitely will continue using and can’t wait to try more products from peace out. So far so good
