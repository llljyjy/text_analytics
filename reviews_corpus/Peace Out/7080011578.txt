Since discovering retinol I’ve been really pleased with the effects of it on my face, so I was glad to test this one out. It applies super easily and doesn’t feel heavy or thick once on. It’s really convenient since it’s in a tube & you don’t have to scoop anything out. Overall I’m pretty satisfied with this product! nan
