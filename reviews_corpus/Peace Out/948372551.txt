This stick is the easiest way of applying retinol I’ve ever used.  Directions say to apply over all other skincare.  I wasn’t sure how that was going to work but it just glided over everything and sunk in.  I use this three times a week and my skin, especially the cheek area, has been smoother and my makeup applies better.  Gifted by Peace Out Skincare. So easy to use!
