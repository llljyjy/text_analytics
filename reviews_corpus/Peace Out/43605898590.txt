This product truly works far better than what competitors offer! I switched to another well-known brand of comparable, less expensive acne healing dots for a period of around 6 months, then switched back to Peace Out. After just a couple of uses, I quickly realized that just 1 Peace Out dot does the job (and BETTER) of at least 2-3 rounds of using the competitorsâ€™ acne dots. These dots do a far more complete job of drawing out impurities in less time, even for my stubborn and painful hormonal acne. Absolutely worth the price for how effective these are. Highly recommend! Works way better than other brands!
