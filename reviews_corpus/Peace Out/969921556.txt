I received this primer in exchange for my review. I am 44 with normal-combo skin, some visible pores and texture. This primer is really impressive! I generally do not like so-called “pore-filling” primers because they’re usually silicone based, so I was happy to see that this is a silicone free formula. I like that it’s both a skincare and a makeup product, and I think it actually does a really nice job of smoothing out my skin and leaving a nice canvas for makeup application. I really like how my makeup looks on top of this and I have no issues with layering products. It has a bit of a funky smell at first (maybe the mushroom?) but I prefer that over added synthetic fragrance. I really like this and I think it’s going to be a go-to! So good!
