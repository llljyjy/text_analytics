I struggle with hyperpigmentation and hormonal acne so I’m super excited to finally test out this serum. I have to agree with the previous reviews on the odor. It isn’t pleasant and smells musty. Personally, I’m willing to overlook the odor for the skincare benefits. Some chemicals just don’t smell good but are great for your skin. If the odor is too strong for you, I recommend applying a thick moisturizer or occlusive to lock in the smell. Aside from that, I’m obsessed with this serum. You only need a small pump to apply a thin layer over your face. It’s also full of amazing ingredients! I’ve compared the ingredients with other similar serums and am very pleased to see it is formulated with higher amounts of reactives. Because of that, I’d say to not overuse this serum. Once or twice a week should be enough to not irritate your face and still see some great results. nan
