Kindly gifted by Peace Out Skincare. This is the first time i’m using from this brand and I’m so excited. First impression of the product is packaging is cute and has nice texute but smells weird. I’ve some hyperpigmentation and tranexamic acid and alpha arbutins are my favorite ingredients. I have to see some time to see real results, so hoping it would be my favorite product. Liked it!
