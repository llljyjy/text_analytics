This was my first time trying out the Peace Out Skincare brand and I am honestly very impressed. This primer is very moisturizing and definitely did help me reduce my redness and pore visibility. It was easy to blend and I applied it before makeup with ease. There was no patchiness or dryness which I love. I definitely recommend it! nan
