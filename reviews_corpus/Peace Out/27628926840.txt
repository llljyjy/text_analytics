Doesn’t pill under makeup and didn’t break me out, but that’s about all this moisturizer has going for it. Didn’t find it particularly moisturizing, smell was funky, and packaging makes it impossible to access the full amount of product. Love Peace Out’s other products but this moisturizer just ain’t it. nan
