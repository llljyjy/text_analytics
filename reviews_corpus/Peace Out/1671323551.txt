I absolutely LOVE this product. I love everything about it.  I have maybe 20 different kinds of face cream in my bathroom but only one stick and it turns out this has now become my fav way to apply face cream! I truly wish more products did it this way - it’s easy and kinda fun to put on and it doesn’t get all over my fingers, no excess to wipe off or deal with so I also don’t waste any, I get to use as much as I want with no mess. And then the retinol itself is darker in color than other brands so I was a tad curious if it was effective but turns out it works great!! I noticed my skin peeling ever so slightly in areas after a few days use, those layers of dead skin cells are definitely coming off and much smoother skin is in my face after about a few weeks!! 100% would recommend, looking forward to checking out other products in their line, this one is a permanent addition. Get it, you won’t regret it
