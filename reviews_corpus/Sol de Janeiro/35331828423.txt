This lip balm smells soooo yummy, is to die for :) like a nice mixture of warm cozy vanilla and peanuts. The texture is light and rich, not sticky at all. I always keep this in my bag when I’m on the go, and is also perfect to use at night :) Definetely to flaunt it all around, like they say in the brand’s slogan :) Flaunt this all around :)
