This product smells great! But as someone who has chronically dry lips (thanks to taking Accutane 15 years ago—my lips never recovered), this is hydrating but not hydrating for very long. For something that costs so much, I would expect it to be more hydrating. It would probably work well for someone who doesn’t have as dry lips as mine. I prefer Jack Black, which also has spf in it, for anyone with similar issues as me. nan
