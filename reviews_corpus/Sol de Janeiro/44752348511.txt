I was influenced to buy this lip butter by a femaleTikToker from Utah who loves this product.Not sure why, this product is just ok. Nothing special. Ibought 2 so I could really give this item achance and used them back-to-back. Thisitem was $18 USD plus shipping. Not worth it.Expensive for what it is. The design of the tube is meant to trick customers into thinking we are getting a lot of product inside the “jumbo“ tube. Be Aware this is not the case!Pros: The size is helpful because it sticksout so I never lost this lip balm. I do like thesmell (tropical/ sweet)Cons: This lip balm product is notmoisturizing. The balm just sits on your lips.I found myself reapplying often and my lipswould get dry whenever I was not using this. Iam not allergic to any of the ingredients.I WILL NOT be repurchasing. Save your money, trust me. This productreminds me of the lip smackers, baby lips, orthe candy flavored lip balms moms wouldbuy as stocking stuffers for their pre - teen or teenage daughters for Christmas.  The packaging is cute, and the smell is good but this lip butter does not help your lips in any way. The design of the tube is very wasteful. I can not recommend this lip butter to anyone.  Sorry Brooke Milne but this lip butter is not amazing and definitely not a holy grail or must have item. Fun scent, but more of a gag / novelty gift
