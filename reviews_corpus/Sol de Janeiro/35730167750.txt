I was bummed when I smelled it. It’s not at all what I was hoping for. It has a very nutty, almost musty, smell to it. Hoooowever… nothing has ever worked on my lips. Ever. THIS smoothed my dry lips in a matter of hours. I’m not sure if I’d buy it again simply because I really dislike the smell, but for function.. it definitely gets a ‘wow’ from me. nan
