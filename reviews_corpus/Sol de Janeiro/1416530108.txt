I’m using it as as moisturizer instead. As a lip balm it is not at all sticky, the smell is amazing, but odd for a lip balm when you are used to the smell as a lotion.  There’s no taste to it.  Wears off very quickly.  The stick is oddly wide, giving me another reason to prefer using it as a moisturizer instead of lip balm.  It absorbs well and the scent lasts. nan
