I go crazy for the scent! Love it love it love it. I do find that my lips are very smooth and more plump looking after use but for a short period of time. (15-45 minutes).I wouldn’t recommend this for those looking for a lip butter with longer lasting deep moisturizing effects.I find too that the application is larger than my lips so it was a bit awkward at first to apply. At the end of the day it’s a nice lip butter that doesn’t do too much. Definitely over priced. I do love it though and will choose it over other lip butters and regular chapstick from a Walmart. nan
