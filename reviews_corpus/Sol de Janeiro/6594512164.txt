This is hands down the best lip balm I’ve ever used for my dry lips - outperforms the Summer Fridays butter balm, Laneige lip mask, and every drugstore lip balm I’ve ever tried. It stays on through eating and drinking. If I put it on before bed I wake up with the most hydrated lips. My only gripe about this product is the packaging/amount of product you get. When you get to the end of the stick there is still a lot of product left that you’ll need to use your fingers to get out which is a little annoying. Regardless I still think it’s well worth the money and will keep repurchasing. Bonus it smells AMAZING but has no taste which is a plus!! A must-try if you have dry lips
