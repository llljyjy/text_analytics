The only good things are the smell and texture.  This lip balm actually DRIED out my lips more!  I keep reapplying, but my lips are still chapped; it’s just an endless cycle of useless reapplication.  The tube is humongous so it’s very awkward when applying, unless you have Kardashian lips.  I tried to like this but everytime I apply, my lips are more chapped.  $18 down the drain.  Save your money and use vaseline lip therapy, it’s cheaper and actually works! Overpriced!
