I like the product I personally think it does a great job moisturizing my lips. I usually apply it before bed and my lips are soft in the morning. But the packaging while cute… sucks.  I feel like not only is too wide but there is SO MUCH wasted product if you throw it out once you hit the plastic stopper thing. I bought this In January and just by using my nail and scrapping it out of the white plastic thing that moves up and down I was able to make it last so much longer. For the price and the hassle of scrapping out the product i don’t know if I would buy this again. save your money
