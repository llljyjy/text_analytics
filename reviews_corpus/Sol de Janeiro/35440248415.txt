The Product is great the lip balm itself is very hydrating and healing. it leaves my lips moisturized throughout the day with me needing to reapply only once. With that said,I finished it in about 2 weeks. For the pice point, I feel like there should be a lot more product then Iâ€™d be putting this in my cart regularly. The Product is Great
