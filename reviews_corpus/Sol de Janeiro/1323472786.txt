ABSOLUTELY DELIVERED AND THE BEST LIP BALM EVER. Doesn’t matter what other negative reviews say this is the real deal. Yes it is expensive but what do you expect? This feels like butter and I was tempted to eat it. I love the entire line and I am a regular for the other products and this item is a MUST HAVE. I tried in store and bought 2 on the spot. It’s also a great gift. This winter has made my lips chapped and gross but thanks to this product, I am enjoying my beauty regime and I am a super super diva. BEST LIP TREATMENT EVER
