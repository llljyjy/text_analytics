This product is super drying. The moisture did not last for more than 1 minute. This lip balm smells like almonds and buttery popcorn, not my favorite. I ended up returning it. I recommend sticking to a more reliable lip balm brand like EOS. This is not worth it for the price you are paying for it. Honest review
