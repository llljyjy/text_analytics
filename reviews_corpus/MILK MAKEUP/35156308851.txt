I was pleasantly surprised with this cleansing balm! It is very soft to scoop up. It feels very creamy and rubs in easily without feeling thick nor waxy. When it emulsifies, itâ€™s super soft and hydrating leaving no residue. My skin feels hydrated and not tight or dry. It does have a very, very, very light fresh fragrance. It also does not burn my eyes and took off my makeup, especially eye makeup very well. Definitely a new favorite cleansing balm! New Fave Cleansing Balm
