I love this cleanser. Milk is hit or miss but this delivers. I actually found it at TJ Max and tried it for more than half the price. It’s gentle and moisturizing and feels luxurious. Gets makeup off if you’re being lazy and only do one step. But the price. Can’t justify $30 for face cleanser. But if you are on the fence about trying it and have $30 to spend go for it you will not regret it! nan
