I liked this makeup remover a lot. This is the 2nd cleansing balm I’ve tried, and it melted a bit better than my Clinique cleansing balm. It had a faint scent that might bother some, but since I didn’t keep it on my face for too long I didn’t mind it. It removed my makeup well, but I always go in with micellar water and a gentle cleanser after. My skin didn’t feel dry after use and wasn’t irritated. Great product!
