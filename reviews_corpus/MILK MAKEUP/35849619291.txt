The Hydro Ungrip Makeup Remover + Cleansing Water fully removed my makeup with a few cotton pads! My skin felt so hydrated and not irritated at all, which can be rare with makeup removers being applied with cotton pads. The formula is so gentle on the skin and left my skin glowing! My Favorite Hydrating Makeup Remover!
