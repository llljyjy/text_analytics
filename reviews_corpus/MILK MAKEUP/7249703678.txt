This is the first milk makeup skincare product that I have tried and I can say I’m pretty impressed, it’s a great option for a cleansing balm! When I say it removes everything,  it removes everythingggg! I did not get your typical raccoon eyes that cleansing balms sometimes leave, where mascara stays on your under eye lashes. Overall, I recommend this cleansing balm! nan
