While this does eventually clean your face, it is so greasy! It smells and feels exactly like rubbing Crisco on your face. Even leaves my face feeling kinda greasy.  Above and beyond that it stings my eyes a little bit. I can’t even imagine someone using this with more sensitive eyes than mine! I love cleaning at night with a balm cleanser but this one will not make the list! I’ve tried about 5 different ones and still none compare to Glow Recipe’s papaya cleanser. I hate to waste the money I spent on this so I can’t wait to finish this and move on to something better! greasy!
