I think the oil itself is fine and I like that it’s in a stick form. But the smell is terrible. I can’t use it because of the scent. It doesn’t have a fake, perfumed smell; it’s more a heavily processed, almost plastic-like one. This is the first product from Milk that I don’t like and may just throw out. nan
