I love the packaging on this, it’s so cute and the prettiest color, plus the pump is very convenient and the cap on the pump keeps it sanitary and clean - well thought out! The formula was gentle on eye makeup and didn’t irritate my sometimes-sensitive oily to combination skin. It removed face makeup and eyeshadow well, but I had to use multiple swipes to get off my mascara even though it was washable and usually pretty easy to remove. I think I’ll use this mainly for face makeup or to refresh skin, but enjoy it overall, just wish it had a little more removal power for mascara. nan
