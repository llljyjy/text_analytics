I was gifted this product by Milk Makeup in exchange for my honest review. I thought it did a nice job breaking down sunscreen and makeup as a first cleanse step. Fragranced products are not my preference but I honestly donâ€™t notice any smell on this one despite having fragrance in the ingredients. Pretty good as a first cleanse!
