I absolutely loved this cleanser. I typically double cleanse, and this has taken the spot for the first cleanse. It easily removed my makeup without any harsh smells or feeling. I didn’t feel like I needed to tug or push hard into the skin. It even left my skin feeling hydrated and soft afterwards. On days I’m doing light weight makeup I don’t think I’d need to double cleanse. Absolutely love the packaging, the pump is nice for getting the right amount of product. The color of the bottle is so cute and I feel fine leaving it on my counter.  Love! Will repurchase and recommend! Clean and hydrated
