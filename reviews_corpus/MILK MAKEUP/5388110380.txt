A huge fan of milk so I was really happy to see they came out with a cleansing balm because I double cleanse every single night whether I wear makeup or not. This melts like a dream and effectively takes off the grime, makeup and spf I have on for the day. One my my fav cleansing balms. The only thing is their price point is high compared to other balms on the market. nan
