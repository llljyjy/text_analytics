My holy grail cleanser for dry skin. It’s not going to remove all your makeup as your first cleanser (especially mascara) so don’t expect this to do what a cleansing balm or oil will do. However, it will in fact remove minimal makeup so sometimes I can get away with just using this. It has an amazing creamy texture, I don’t notice a fragrance (maybe slight) and most important of all for me is that it doesn’t strip my skin as do other cleansers. Very underrated. I will continue purchasing this as I like it better than other high end cleansers for dry skin. Holy grail for dry skin
