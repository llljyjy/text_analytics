Overall, I think this is a good cleansing water but I wouldn’t say there’s anything particularly phenomenal about the formula. It does a good job of getting things removed, but waterproof makeup take a little extra elbow grease. I really love the packaging/dispensing mechanism though. Packaging is the highlight
