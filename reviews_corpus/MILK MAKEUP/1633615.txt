As another reviewer mentioned, there is a major design flaw with this packaging. I have had 2 so far (bought one, it broke, Sephora sent me a replacement, second one just broke) break on me. When I twist the bottom to move the product up, the plastic cracks off making it impossible to twist. So the product is stuck in the tube. I like the product a lot, but the packaging needs to be fixed!! Poor design - great product
