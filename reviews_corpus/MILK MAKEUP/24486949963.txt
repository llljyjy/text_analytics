First of all, this actually removed ALL of my makeup without having to scrub too hard or use a ton of product or wash my face with a second cleanser. That’s the first time I’ve ever felt like my skin is actually clean after removing makeup with a micellar water. And my skin didn’t feel dried out which is usually a problem for me with micellar waters, but this one isn’t drying at all, I felt more moisturized after using it! It feels nice and gentle and I have sensitive skin and my face never got red or irritated! Also, the packaging makes this so easy to use. I love the way the product is dispensed! So useful! Cleansing & Hydrating!!
