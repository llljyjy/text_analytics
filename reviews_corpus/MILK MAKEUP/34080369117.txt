Cute container, moisturizer has nice consistency that is not too runny not too thick. Didn’t notice any fragrance. I think this may be making me break out a bit as I’m not really using other products. So I’ve just been applying very small amounts in areas prone to dryness and then dabbing out from there. It’s great that this is a mini size for someone who wants to try it out before investing in a larger container. nan
