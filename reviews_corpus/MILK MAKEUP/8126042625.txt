Recently I’ve become a huge fan of cleansing balms after discovering that makeup remover wipes aren’t actually too good for your skin. I received this cleansing balm complimentary of Milk Makeup and I must say I am in love. It does a really good job of removing my makeup after a night out (even waterproof mascara) I also love how hydrated and soft my skin feels after using it. Definitely a product I’d repurchase. Not my favorite
