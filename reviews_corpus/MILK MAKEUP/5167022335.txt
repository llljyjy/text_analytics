This did a really good job removing makeup, including eye makeup and mascara. I used two soaked cotton pads (one for each half of my face) to remove eyeshadow, mascara, and tinted sunscreen, and then I followed up with a cotton pad soaked in a separate micellar water to test how well this performed. It really had removed all but traces of everything I was wearing, which is awesome for a waterless cleanser.  I also just really like the milky green pump top packaging, too. Effective makeup remover
