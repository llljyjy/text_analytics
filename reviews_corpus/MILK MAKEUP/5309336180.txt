This was my first time ever trying a cleansing balm. I thought it was hyped up like “well my face cleanser removes makeup too, whats the big deal“ but nah! This was really good at removing my eye makeup and skin makeup, above what my face wash does! Even the face washes that are like “removes makeup“, now I see how a balm does a better job. This was a sample so I’m not sure if that is why maybe mine didn’t come with instructions, but it would have been nice to have instructions for first time users. for example, did you know that you apply this to dry skin with no water? This did leave my skin feeling hydrated and I appreciated that it was unscented :) I would actually repurchase this. actually works
