Received this as a sample in a previous order and I found it to be useless. Maybe it’s due to the way they packaged it, but it was incredibly awkward to get enough product onto my under eye area without scraping some out then rubbing it on to my skin. It might be better to apply in its full size applicator. Regardless, I didn’t notice any change or improvement with the puffiness or fine lines around my eyes. Not worth the money to try its full size version. Didn’t help at all
