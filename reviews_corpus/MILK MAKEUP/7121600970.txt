I like this makeup remover, especially the pump top. The bottle is larger than I expected so I expect this to last me a while. It’s super easy to pump the product right into a cotton pad so you don’t waste anything. And a little goes a long way- more than one pump will be too much liquid and can get into and irritate your eyes! nan
