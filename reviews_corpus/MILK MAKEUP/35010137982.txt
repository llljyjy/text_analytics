It doesn’t do it for me. If you’re going to use the directed amount, then you’d have no slip and be dragging your skin while applying. It has no scent, which is nice, but considering that you need a considerable amount of product for some slip and it doesn’t really leave me feeling moisturized, I’d have to say that I wouldn’t buy this again. It’s not for me and that’s ok.
