Product gifted for free by Milk Makeup. This is a solid balm cleanse. Great as a first cleanse that removes makeup. Wish it didn’t have added fragrance, but it’s low on the ingredient list. Turns into a milky lather and rinses off, leaving only a very slight residue (typical in my experience for cleansing balms). It this was less than $30 and didn’t have fragrance, I would love it, but I think you could get something more affordable that’s fragrance-free. Great! Could have been even better tho!
