As a cleansing balm connoisseur (kidding...kind of), I was quite excited to try this new release.Cleansing balms generally seem to fall into one of two texture categories: you have the thicker, almost vaseline type and the goopy, melty type. Milk’s is more in the former category, but make it slightly more milky. This is my preferred texture for travel purposes as the melty kind can get very messy!The smell is...surprising. I read the ingredients and knew to expect fragrance, but if i didn’t read through that - i would think this is a fragrance free cleansing balm. It doesn’t have a pleasant smell to my nose, but it’s not pungent either. I have a sneaking suspicion this will be a product some people misidentify as fragrance-free, so be aware it is not. I’ll quickly mention fragrance allergy is real, but a bit overstated, so this is a heads up for those who do have allergies!Now as for the most important part - yes it removes makeup effectively. It spreads nicely onto skin, emulsifies well, and rinses fairly clean - although I will say this is a product you MUST use with a second cleanser if you don’t want to feel a residue left behind. There are some cleansing balms that leave an intense film behind regardless, and I am happy to report this does not.Ultimately, I am pleased with it. I wish Milk had done just a LITTLE more with the packaging/presentation - maybe some kind of a refillable system? Maybe a scoop in the lid? But the product inside is solid (hey that has a dual meaning with cleansing balms! I’ll see myself out...) nan
