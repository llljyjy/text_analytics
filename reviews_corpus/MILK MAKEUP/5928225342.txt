THIS MOISTURIZER IS IT FOR DRY SKIN. Trust me, I’ve tried them all! It’s fragrance free and performs, which is definitely hard to find. I recommend putting it on at night before bed, as its a thick and rich cream. You will wake up with velvety smooth and plump skin! If you have dry skin like me, you can also use this moisturizer in the morning. It goes great under makeup. I wish more brands would DITCH the fragrance, it’s so unnecessary and it’s terrible for us!****The complaints you will see in the reviews are mostly about the amount of product given for the price, to which I agree: give us more! Also there seems to have been a production problem at some point and some people recieved defective products. Your moisturizer should be thick, super white, and creamy. If there is any transparency to your moisturizer or it feels like a cleansing balm, you recieved defective product.**** DRY SKIN MUST HAVE!
