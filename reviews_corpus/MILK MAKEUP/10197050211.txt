I love this cleanser! My skin (dry and sensitive) feels so fresh and hydrated after using it. I often feel that my skin dries out with many cleansers (especially in winter) but this Milk cleanser works so well for my skin type. I use it twice a day (morning/night) and itâ€™s gentle and moisturizing. I highly recommend this product! Great for dry skin!
