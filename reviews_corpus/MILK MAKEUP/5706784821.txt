I purchased the kit with the small cleanser, kush lip balm, bandeau and a small moisturizer. Sadly, it looks like there is a major issue with the small moisturizer, because I too got a dollop amount of face cream, balmy feeling (not creamy at all). It’s super hard to pick up and spread. I’d say if you want to try, get the bigger size. Packaging issue on the small format?
