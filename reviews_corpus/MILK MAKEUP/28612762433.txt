I use this product in the morning before applying eye cream as the caffeine helps reduce puffiness. It has a slight cooling feel. It’s also lasted me a long time. Even though it’s a nice product and one that I use daily, it’s not a wow-product. If this wasn’t in my routine anymore I wouldn’t necessarily miss it. Nice to use but not needed
