I love the concept of a makeup remover balm. It literally melts my makeup away when I combine it with warm water. It also has eliminated single use towelettes from daily routine so thatâ€™s a big plus! It smells fresh and has a lot of product that will last me a large amount of time. :) Melts Away Everything
