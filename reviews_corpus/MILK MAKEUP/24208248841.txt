I have mature, sensitive dry skin and this left a tight dry feeling. I stopped using it as my daily cleanser after a few days and tried the Skinfix barrier+ foaming oil hydrating cleanser which I much prefer. I have also tried the Biossance oil cleanser which I somewhat liked but It used to make my eyes sting and didn’t remove much makeup. Both the Milk cleanser and the Skinfix don’t make my eyes sting. I may use the Milk cleanser to remove makeup which I wear occasionally. It has an unusual smell which I didn’t mind. I would say it smells like rancid coconut oil. Did not work for me.
