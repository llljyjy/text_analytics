Iâ€™m a huge fan of the hydro grip primer, so I was super excited to try this one! It worked well! It took off all traces of my primer, makeup, and skincare. The cleansing water made my skin feel soft without feeling stripped and it worked well on my sensitive skin! I would recommend this to anyone! Great Cleansing Water!
