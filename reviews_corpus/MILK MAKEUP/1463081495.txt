I have been using this as my makeup remover for a week now and I have enjoyed it. It truly does remove even the most stubborn makeup. I am so ied to double cleansing that I still wash my face after, but in itâ€™s own I do feel like my face gets cleansed very well. I do feel a slight dryness, but my skin is very dry anyway. I like this product and would continue to buy it. However I do feel like there is a slight alcohol scent. Not sure why since its clean ingredients. Great at removing even stubborn makeup
