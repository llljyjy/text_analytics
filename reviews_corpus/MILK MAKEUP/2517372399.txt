Iâ€™ve really been looking for a different brand of miceller water to remove my make up, and I love this product! I use it alone, or with the MILK cleansing balm. I really noticed a full removal of make up, and it also left my skin feeling really hydrated. My skin usually feels dry when using a make up removing product, but this one was really good and hydrating! nan
