Not to be dramatic but this is soooo good!! I didn’t expect this at all, but I love trying new cleansing balms so I had to have it. There’s no added dyes or fragrance and it removes all makeup easily without leaving a residue. That’s probably the most important part for me. I hate having to work hard to remove the cleansing balm that is supposed to remove my makeup. This is so so good with a thin melty formula. I think the packaging is cute, but on the cheaper side and I wish it came with a spatula, but I have others I can use so it’s not a huge deal. Overall this is a winner and now im intrigued to see if milk will release more skincare! Works so good!
