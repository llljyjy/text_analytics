This Micellar water removes makeup beautifully, itâ€™s a great addition to my first cleanse cleansers. I used this while on vacation and I used a full face of makeup. A couple of swipes and everything is wiped off. The scent is a bit weird initially but goes away right away. Overall recommend this for dry sensitive skin types like mine. Removes makeup! Great first cleanse!
