I bought this product a few months ago, and I saw a significant change after just a few uses. My skin is super sensitive and this did not irritate me at all. I originally saw it on TikTok but I didnâ€™t really know what it was for. It is for depuffing and cooling. I use it mostly under my eyes and on irritated areas for it to kinda chill out. Works every time. I love it so much. Absolutely a slay. Love it!
