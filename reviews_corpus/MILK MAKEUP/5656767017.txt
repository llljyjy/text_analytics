A new love in my nighttime cleansing routine! This is a hydrating cleansing water that’s perfect for removing makeup. I mostly use this for my eye makeup before removing the rest of my Badr makeup with a cleansing balm. I love how this product dispenses! This takes off eyeshadow and waterproof mascara with ease. I’m not crazy about the smell, but the performance is totally worth the repurchase. Cleansing and Refreshing!
