So… I’ve tried A LOT of different self tanners. High end, drug store, in between. You name it I’ve tried it. This is by far my absolute favorite. My reasons are quite simple. I have WHITE sheets, I applied this on after my shower, let myself dry up for about an hour and then went straight into bed. I woke up the next morning and not ONE little bit of transfer anywhere which was very impressive. I also hate self tanning smells and although this does have a slight smell to it, it’s not as strong and gross as all other products I’ve used. I deff recommend using a kabuki brush when applying this to your hands, feet/ankles, and face because it is clear so you don’t really know just how “even” it’s spreading. However, what I like to do is if I use 2 pumps on my entire lower leg, I will use the exact amount on the other so it distributes evenly. It gave me a really nice tan, wasn’t orange at all and it didn’t leave me streaky whatsoever. I do also recommend applying with either a mit, or powder-free latex gloves (blues ones from CVS work great) just make sure to exfoliate and shave prior to application for best results!! Best of luck :) one of THE best
