I bought this granular self-tanning moisturizer because my skin is very dry, but I love using tanning drops. I have not noticed a difference in color, and my skin has not felt any more moisturized than before. As with all self-tanning products, you do get the smell, but I didnâ€™t see any payout in color. Stick with tanning drops
