Absolutely amazing product. Again as with any self tanner, wash your hands or anywhere it “spilled” after use. If you receive a sample of a tanning product assume that it will stain if you keep adding more, just wait the designated time and you will change colour (maybe look up sephora instructions online if you are not sure), and exfoliate before or the colour won’t look good. As long as you are hydrated and either use aha/bha exfoliants once to a few times a week, it will go on smoothly. If you have uneven texture due to built up dead skin cells nothing will look as smooth as after you gently wipe with exfoliant. Also, the type or product you mix it with is important, i use with a creamy moisturizer (biossence) and it looks natural and fabulous. Beautiful
