My absolute favorite self-tanner! Only knocking off one star because of the psychotic price point. I’ve tried quite a few self-tans (Loving Tan, Bali Body, Bondi Sands) and this is the only one I have repurchased. It has no annoying scent that lasts for days, doesn’t transfer, and has the best longevity out of every brand I have tried (has lasted through me shaving my legs in the shower twice). It just develops into such a beautiful and natural shade! When I tell my friends my tan is fake, they never have any idea. It does seem to patch up a bit as it fades, but nothing too bad. I love it! :-) Best self-tanner I've ever tried!
