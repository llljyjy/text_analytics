i was very hesitant to purchase this as i have acne-prone and sensitive skin, and i tried the isle of paradise drops in the past and broke out. PROS: AMAZING glowy bronze! it’s super easy to apply and has never been streaky or patchy on me. i apply it at night mixed in with my moisturizer (even just 1 drop works for me, sometimes i do 2 or 3) and then make sure i wash my hands right after. it looks great in the morning. i have not broke out using this product! PLUS it’s non-comedogenic which is the #1 thing i look for in a product nowadaysCONS: price obviously, but i will be repurchasing when i run out for sure. my second con is that it does dry me out slightly. i have dry skin already so it was kind of expected but it’s worth it in my opinion, and the drying is not that bad. just go heavy on the moisturizer if you have drier skin.this is my new go-to face self tanner. im obsessed and so grateful that this product works for me! no breakouts + beautiful bronze
