So this is coming from someone who has never used self tans before, but I found this very easy to use! I used it a few days in a row and the color developed nicely, did not show up orange on me (I’m pretty fair skinned). It has a sort of fruity/citrus scent when you apply it, I did notice a weird smell later on, several hours after applying, but it’s not necessarily off putting. Kind of smells like tortilla chips? Not perfect (got darker in some area like elbows, under the boob area) but overall its pretty nice, will definitely be great to use in non summer months to get a little glow which is all I was looking for!
