See photos: not wearing any sort of tanner or makeup on my face, so you can see the difference between my face and chest/armsPleasantly surprised! I just about gave up on tanning products altogether (I’ve tried them all—mousses, graduals, you name it)I’d highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to simply build natural looking color. I don’t have a deep bronze color whatsoever, but I’m much more confident in my skin now that I’m not pasty white.Pros:Dries quicklyCan apply with handsThere’s a slight self-tanner smell at first, but it’s gone after a few hours. Never experienced that with a tanning product before! No need to shower it off. Results are noticeable after 5+ hours (I put it on at night before bed)Doesn’t stain my clothes or sheetsCons:Can be a little bit streaky if you’re not being thorough, but that’s the case with any tanning product, so take your time applying it!Color really collected on my knees, so use a moisturizer on your knees beforehand and use the lotion sparingly around that areaNo deep bronze color, just natural looking light-medium tanOverall, this is the best tanning product I’ve used. Give it a try! As a self-tan connoisseur, this is my new favorite
