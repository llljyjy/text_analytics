10/10 self tanner! I’ve never used self tanner before because I didn’t want to look orange or miss spots and it be blotchy but this was so easy to apply and it looks natural. It’s so easy to use and you can maintain a nice color by using it a few times a week. If I can apply this without blotches, anyone can. Also want to add that people comment about a bad smell but I don’t notice any particular smell. As long as you mix it in a good, non-scented lotion, you should be good! nan
