WASH YOUR HANDS! I love this product and it made my face look naturally tanned. I always use SPF on my face, so it’s forever lighter than the rest of my body. During the winter months, it becomes very obvious! I mixed 5 or so drops of this with my moisturizer and it went on beautifully and evenly. The key is to read the instructions!! Wash your hands well with soap and water after applying. There is a slight smell that’s typical of self tanners, but it wasn’t overwhelming. I also think that will vary based on what you mix it with! Purchasing another bottle when I run out. perfect! read the instructions though
