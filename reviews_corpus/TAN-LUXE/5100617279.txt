I was really looking forward to trying this after seeing so many good reviews. Sadly, this is getting returned. Pros- Dries fairly quickly after application - Has a very mild scent. Not exactly a fake tanner scent, but maybe a perfume-y scent. - I personally like that it’s clear and does not hair a color guard. It was slightly nerve wracking at first when putting it on but I’m here for no transfer to clothes/sheets/etc. - Nice light consistency Cons- Slight sticky feeling after it “dries”. Not super annoying to me but reminds me that I have self-tanner on so not fun. - Dried my skin out SO MUCH. No matter how much lotion I put on, I couldn’t fix this issue. - My biggest con… faded very patchy. There’s definitely things I like about this tanner, but for the cost I just can’t overlook the patchy fading and very drying to skin. return
