I had to cancel my spray tan for my wedding but still wanted to attempt to self tan. I didnâ€™t trust myself with a foam or more structured tanning solution. This lotion was perfect! No streaks and left my skin glowing and tan. Used it 3 days in a row to create the color I wanted (in addition to the tanning face drops) and then used every other day, alternating with a regular body lotion. Just remember to wash your hands!
