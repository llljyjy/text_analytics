Honestly really love this stuff. I’m not an experienced self tanner aka I haven’t used mouse products before Bc they just intimidate me and I want something that’s easy to use and looks natural. I used the isle of paradise drops and those were good but I went through an entire bottle of that so quickly. This lasts much longer. I’m fairly pale but can get a nice tan in the summer if I tired. I use 5 drops of this all over and it just makes me feel better. Its soooo natural most people probably wouldn’t be able to tell I even have anything on which is fine with me. It just makes me feel a little more glowy. If you want something that will make you super bronze though this might not be the product for you. Overall super easy to use. Doesn’t have a terrible smell and I can put it on and go about my day. Highly recommend! nan
