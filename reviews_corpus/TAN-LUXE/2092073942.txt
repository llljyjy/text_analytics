I bought this to make the color of my face match my body since I use sunscreen daily. I applied at nightly and it worked okay for a while, and then I started getting really bad, deep acne on my face and neck. Not like a few pimples here and there, I’m talking really deep, persistent acne that ruined my skin. The product works, but the tan I got was so minimal it wouldn’t be worth it even if I didn’t totally break out. Maybe the med/dark color would have been better? For such an expensive product I would have expected more. Definitely returning. Acne, overpriced, minimal tan
