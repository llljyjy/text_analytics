This is the first time I have written a review on Sephora for a product, but I had to come here to rave about this Tan-Luxe self tanner. I am a pale girl with Irish skin who has been searching for years for a way to get a safe tan. I tried Mystic Tan back in the day, plenty of different self tanning creams and, most recently, airbrush spray tans. I got tired of going on a vacation with a fresh spray tan, only to find it fading as soon as I got a massage or put any sort of oil-based product on my body. Sunscreen lotion pools, seawater, and various body lotions and creams did the same thing. I always come home with LESS color than I had when I left for the trip. I was so sick of wasting money on spray tans that faded almost immediately, so I decided to try some new self tanners. I was drawn to this one because it sounded like it was actually moisturizing, which I also need badly as I’m very dry. I have been thrilled with this product and will never go back to spray tanning, since I can achieve the same color with this lotion and not require an additional moisturizer on top of it. After most showers, I squeeze some of this on a tanning mitt (also critical, I’ve learned) and rub it quickly over my legs, arms, shoulders, and neck. I believe it actually has some oil in it(?) so it is a bit drippy but it also feels hydrating. It dries fast, I throw clothes on and am on my way. No big prep time or dry time required. The color is great. And I can then reapply whenever I want to boost it or just maintain. There smell is no different from other lotions as it develops, but I don’t mind it at all. It’s not super fruity or flowery to cover up the tanner smell. If you don’t have time to mess around with tanning prep and spray tan annoyances, this is the lotion for you. I’m so glad I finally found it after all this time! Amazing stuff!
