I normally read negative reviews before purchasing products - SO glad I didn’t with this one! Easy to apply, more color than Jergens but not full blown “self tanner“ color either, so allows for a little flexibility in skin prep. The only con is the smell - it definitely has that classic developing self-tanner stink. Quick, easy, orange-free color! Love!
