I read so many rave reviews for this product so as a super fair-skinned gal, I had to give it a try. The ONLY thing I liked about this product was the application - it was not sticky and it *seemed* to apply well (easily) and I liked that I could go about my day right after applying it (unlike some tanners where you feel sticky and gross for hours after until you wash it off). Everything else about this product is awful - I look incredibly ridiculous right now... this is my second time using it & both times it looked SO streaky (understatement) and super orange on me (keep in mind I am v fair skinned). It also smells gross. Iâ€™ll stick with my Tanologist mousse or Jergins lotion. Absolutely Not
