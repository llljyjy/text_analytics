… It’s more like a beautiful skincare serum, packed with multi beneficial ingredients to help even out your skin tone - overtime. With hydrating properties that will help to leave your skin even, toned and plump with an extremely natural looking lit from within glow. If you want an actual face self tanner- this same product line has one. I think it would also be good for your skin, but they are indeed two different products. I would recommend reading the list and details about both of them, and hopefully this will help you with making your decision. Also, to the mention of the product getting into your hair line and eyebrows- turning them orange. It is recommended to avoid these aforementioned places while/ when during your use of this product. And always remember to wash your hands right after. Again, hope this helps ! :) It isn’t exactly the same as a self tanner
