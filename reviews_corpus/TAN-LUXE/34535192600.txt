I used this and I sprayed a lot on my skin in the day and saw no difference . So I applied a second layer and then finally saw color . But it didn’t apply evenly . It was so patchy . And it was so hard to get it off ! My skin was patchy for two weeks ! I scrubbed really hard and the dark orangey patches wouldn’t come off . And it’s overpriced . There are better self tanners that cost much less money . A patchy mess
