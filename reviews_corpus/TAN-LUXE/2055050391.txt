As a girl who needs to be about 3 shades darker than my natural skin tone at all times to be happy but also a huge stickler about sun filters and avoiding damage, I have spent my way through a small arsenal of UV-less tanning products (in addition to regular spray tans 2x per month).  Here’s my take:Pros:  odor isn’t amazing, but better than most and it fades quickly.  I’m pretty sensitive to smells can’t sleep in strongly scented products and I can apply this pretty close to bed time and not have a problem.  It blends well and is very easy to apply, in part because it’s super fluid (viscosity more like a serum than a lotion).  It’s definitely a gradual but shows up.  I keep a nice even 3 shades deeper using every other day.  In arm and leg baring season I usually keep a spray tan, one about every 10-12 days.  This is the PERFECT compliment for that because it doesn’t affect the existing tan and it provides a nice base before you get sprayed and helps them last longer and the fading process between visits much more even and so much less noticeable and without any areas of stark contrast.  Cons:  flip side of the very fluid texture, it can be a little tough to control and messy.  I usually have a few stray drops on the floor to clean up after an application.  The biggest downer, and what loses a star for me is it is ironically, very drying and provides no benefit as a moisturizer.  It’s difficult to avoid some drying from DHA but my legs get downright ashy (the tan making the dry skin a little more obvious) if I don’t alternate a “real” moisturizer in some days.  On the whole though, probably the best gradual tan/spray tan maintenance product I’ve found and if then could work in some emollient to help the drying it would be pretty close to perfect. Great for gradual/tan maintenance, not moisture
