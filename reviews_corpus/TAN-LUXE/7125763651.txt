Night and day difference in my skin. I’ve struggled to find something close to a Josie maran product that was discontinued a few years ago. This fits the bill. No streaking, no orange - started small and spaced out. I wash my hands immediately after. I mix with my night cream. I do regularly exfoliate which likely helps. Overall I’m thrilled with the results and have returned to using a tinted moisturizer vs a foundation! Whoot! nan
