I’ve only used this twice so far and am loving it! The colour takes a bit longer to develop than the Isle of Paradise drops, but it looks a lot more natural in my opinion. I’ve also found that it is much easier to control how dark the colour ends up being by the amount of drops you use. So far so good! nan
