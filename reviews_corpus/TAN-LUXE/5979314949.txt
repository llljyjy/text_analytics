Very easy to apply, not streaky at all if applied correctly in circular motion (some of these reviews make me think people didn’t do that) and could easily see tan within hours. Now this is a SUBTLE tan it’s not gonna make you dark really fast or immediately. It gives a nice sun kissed and glow effect. Had to knock off one star though bc of the smell. It’s not awful but pretty unpleasant where it did make me want to take it off at times. Nice & Subtle Tan
