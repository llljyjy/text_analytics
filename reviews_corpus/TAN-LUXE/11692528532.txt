Honestly not sure what all the bad reviews are about. I almost never use self tanner but bought this on a recommendation from a friend. I think it looks great! I have very fair skin and after one use I feel like I have a minimally noticeable glow. I thought it was easy to apply and if I had been a little more careful it wouldn’t be noticed around the wrists and ankles. I also don’t smell it at all. I thought the product smelled good going on and now ~15 hours later I still don’t smell any fake tan scent. I’ll definitely keep using. love it
