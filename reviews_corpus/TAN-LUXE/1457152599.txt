First, I am VERY sensitive to fragrance. Some of these tanners trigger migraines. This one does not! The smell is delightful. I believe I can smell the raspberry. The performance is wonderful. Iâ€™ve converted from St Tropez mousse and thought that would be my ride or die.I use The Water, followed by this product to extend the life and it lasts longer than tropez without the sticky feel. I also use the Face lotion on the tube and am happy with the subtle glow. Highly recommend this product and the Tan Luxe line!! my new favorite brand!!
