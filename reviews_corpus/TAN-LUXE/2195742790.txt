I loved the face version of this so decided to try the body.  I love that I can mix it with my own body lotion and it dries a bit faster then foams but that’s where the pros end.  I’ve tried it 3 times now, each time applied more thoroughly then the last but always turns out blotchy.  The tan colour itself is not natural looking, definitely has orange tones.  This self tanner is not forgiving, you have be extremely careful and diligent and even then blotches are still a possibility.  The tan takes a few hours to develop too so you can’t see if you’ve missed any spots until it’s too late.  It last’s 2 days for me, I make sure to prep my skin before hand with a good exfoliator and moisturize every day.  As for the smell, it has a nice scent going on but as it dries it smells like every single self tanner I’ve ever tried, there’s no escaping that lingering fake tan smell, it’s one of the ingredients.  All self tanners try to mask it with their own formulated scent but as it dries you will notice that classic fake tan smell.   Would also like to note that I am very fair skinned and didn’t find the medium/dark tan too be too much.  I was a bit concerned it wouldn’t look right on me.   I think I’ll be sticking to foam tans. Orange and blotchy.
