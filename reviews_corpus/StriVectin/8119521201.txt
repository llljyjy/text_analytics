I’ve tried a lot of anti aging creams, this cream, when used consistently, delivers results. I do all of my nighttime skin care in bed as I watch tv before going to bed layer products allowing them to soak in. I apply this buttery rich neck cream in an upwards motion towards my jaw. In 6-8 weeks, my lines are diminishing, my skin is tighter, I’m seeing results. On days that I’m home I use it during the day too or if my skin is feeling dry. It should not be yellow or greasy or pill upon application, you may have an expired product if that’s the case. I order directly from Strivectin site, as they usually have 25-30% off sales, and gifts w/purchase. My 30 year old neck is BACK!
