I was skeptical about this product since it’s on the pricey side but honestly I love it and am totally convinced. I’m 30 and have had fluctuations in my weight over the past 5 years that have left me with some saggy skin under my chin. I tried this product to help fight gravity and it has exceeded my expectations. It’s definitely something you have to use over a period of a month or so at least to see the effects of but it definitely works, you just have to trust in the product and keep up with it.
