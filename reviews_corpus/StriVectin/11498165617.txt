With not vitamin A (Retinol), moisturizer, and SPF, this product is a fantastic all in one product. Perfect for those days (or weeks) when we don’t have the energy to go through our entire skincare routine. Also a great entry product for those stepping their toes into skincare! Definitely a great product, I didn’t have any white cast, although my skin is pretty pale. All in One!
