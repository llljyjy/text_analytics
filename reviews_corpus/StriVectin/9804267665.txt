I’ve never tried neck tightening cream before, but this peptide cream is super hydrating and smooth. Love the stainless steel roll on it. I put it in fridge and use it morning and night time, it’s super calming and refreshing. It’s easy to apply and it’s not thick. After few days of using this constantly i recognized few changes such as tighter skin and smoother neck bands. Super excited for this. Works perfectly
