This is a great predecessor to your eye cream as its a lightweight serum. I typically apply it after cleansing, allow it to set, then follow with a hydrating cream. While the results aren’t astronomical, I do think it’s helping. My orbital area feels hydrated and smoother. The size is also great for travel. Perfect Predecessor
