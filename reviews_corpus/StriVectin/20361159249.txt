I’m 39 and started to notice that my neck skin need extra care. I used face cream for neck before and stone roller, but glad to find the product that combines cream and roller and made specially for neck area. It’s Easy to apply, roller feels pretty cold (good for the skin), nice scent. Too early to talk about visible results, but skin definitely feels better and more moisturized. *This product was gifted in exchange of honest review. Pleasant to apply.
