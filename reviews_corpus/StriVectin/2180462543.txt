First time trying this brands products. The cream has very nice light texture and it absorbs very well into skin. It almost has dewy and glowy finish which I like. However the spf was irritating my eyes so I stopped using. ( I’m used to gentler spf ) but if you use regular spf products I’m sure it won’t be a problem for you. Lightweight and glowy finish
