StriVectin sent me a complimentary Contour Restore Tightening & Sculpting Face Cream in exchange for my honest feedback. Being in my 40’s and living in a dry, arid climate has definitely increased the signs of aging and I love that this cream helps to tighten and sculpt my face and neck area. I had a reaction the one time I’ve gotten injectables so I’ve been looking for products that can help get similar results and this one is by far one if the best I’ve tried so far. This is also the first StriVectin product I’ve tried and it does not disappoint. The texture is luxe and creamy and leaves my skin feeling well hydrated and truly restores youthful radiance. Highly recommended for mature/maturing skin concerns! nan
