I love how innovative this packaging is. It’s like a roller and you’re painting the product on your neck! I’ve been using this for over a week and I have deep tech lines on my neck. I love the cooling sensation that it offers my neck as I apply the product. After a week, I will say that my neck feels softer and smoother. Lines are still there, but I didnt expect them to be gone so quickly. I also wished to see some difference in firmness, but havent yet! Excited to continue to use this though! Nice Neck Product!!
