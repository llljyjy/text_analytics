I have always prioritized SPF in my daytime moisturizers. I was extremely happy that this one had retinal, which is not something I have seen or used in other products before. The consistency is medium thick, itâ€™s not greasy but it does give the skin a nice natural sheen and moisture! I feel protected in the daytime sun even with this under my make up!! Great for daytime!
