This is my first time using a Strivectin product. I love the bright packaging! My first impression upon opening the component is that the texture looks amazing! A thicker cream, which is great for my dry skin. My goal was to focus on my neck with this, and I was really pleased with the results. It’s very hydrating, and I noticed some lines (those pesky tech lines) plumping up. My skin definitely feels more hydrated. I’m excited to see the results after a longer period of use. I’ll for sure be checking out more of this brand’s product line! New Brand added to my arsenal
