I’ve been using this for a week and a half so far, morning and night, and have already started to notice a bit of a difference. My neck looks and feels slightly smoother, and the thinner line on my neck is a bit less visible. I love the roller tip, it feels cooling and doesn’t tug on the skin. The serum feels hydrating, absorbs nicely without any stickiness, and doesn’t irritate my skin at all. I’m pretty impressed so far and excited to continue using it! nan
