I am a retinol lover like any other woman next to me, but we all suffer from the same thing of extreme dryness, peeling and sensitized skin using harsh retinols, with this product it didn’t seem to be the case. It was gentle enough for provide the anti-aging effects while not over stimulating my skin. So far I’m loving the results and will continue to use. Sun protection and anti-aging for the win
