I’ve been using the Power Starters Tightening Trio for about 3 to 4 weeks, and I am very pleased with two of the products.  Using the Tighten & Lift serum is great. At first I thought this package was a waste of money and one day I looked in the mirror and my face was brighter and then I realized that it was also tighter, so I was thrilled.  I also noticed that my 64 y.o. neck was tighter, looks great, and my jaw line seems more defined.  I am only giving 4 stars because I don’t see where the eye serum has done much for my eyes.  My eyes do feel more moisturized, but it hasn’t done anything for my fine lines or crows feet.  Sorry I didn’t take before/after pics.  Maybe next time. I would purchase again.
