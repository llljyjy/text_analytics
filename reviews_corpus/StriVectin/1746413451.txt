Just like how we use sunscreen as preventative skincare, I like the idea of using skincare on our necks and hands to prevent signs of aging. I love the product comes with a roller to help massage in the serum. It is also cooling which is pretty perfect now that the weather is heating up. Besides using this on my neck, I also use this on the back of my hands. It is too soon to see results on my tech neck but I do see that my hands look smoother compared to when I just use regular hand cream. I will be continuing to use this product and Iâ€™m excited to see how it will help improve the appearance of my neck. nan
