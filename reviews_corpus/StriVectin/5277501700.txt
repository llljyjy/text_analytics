I’ve been using StriVectin peptight neck cream for about two weeks now. I honestly did not think it was making a difference. I’m glad I took before & after pics that show I was wrong. It has definitely helped with the appearance of lines on my neck & my skin does feel more taut. I will say I started having some red spots on the last day when I took the after picture. I’m unsure if it was from the cream or not, but thought I would mention since they are visible in the picture.  I do feel like the cream is priced a little high. Love the roller though. I did see results
