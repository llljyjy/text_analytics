I’m typically hesitant when skin products make claims about tightening your skin and noticeable improvements in lines, but I have to say I’m pleasantly surprised. I’ve been using the pep tight neck serum for about 10 days and see a noticeable improvement in the horizontal lines on my neck from looking down at my phone. I used it in the morning and night as directed, and it definitely works! nan
