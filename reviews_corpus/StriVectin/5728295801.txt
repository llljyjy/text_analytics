I’ve never tried anything from StriVectin before, but my mom has and has recommended the brand. My skin is super pale and I’m approaching 30, so I’ve been starting to incorporate ’anti aging’ skincare into my routine. One thing I’ve noticed is that my neck has thick lines (most likely from ’tech neck’ and it’s something I’ve been insecure about and it’s super noticeable since I’m so pale. This product is super easy to use, especially with the roller component. The product feels comfortable and not sticky like some other neck creams I’ve tried. So far, I’ve noticed a tightening effect and plan to keep on using this! nan
