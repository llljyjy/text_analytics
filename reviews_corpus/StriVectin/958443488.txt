I feel I havenâ€™t used this long enough to notice tightening but I do like how it feels when I apply it. The roller is calming and cool, after rubbing it in with the roller I do notice some type of warming sensation - maybe due to blood flow moving to the area. Will continue to use morning and night to help avoid neck aging! :) nan
