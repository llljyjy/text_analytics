This was sent complimentary. Unfortunately my mail carrier didn’t deliver it in time for me to test it for 2 full weeks, so this is just my honest first impressions. It’s a lightweight moisturizer with little to no noticeable scent. It’s almost kind of runny, like an SPF essence, which I love. It’s a very nice texture. I’m used to using a high percentage of retinol, so so-far this is very gentle! I love that is has added SPF as well. Excited to see full results! Gentle and great texture!
