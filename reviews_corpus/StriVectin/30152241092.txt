I love how this product has a roller built-in. Makes it super convenient and easy to apply the moisturizer - which I also love. It’s very lightweight and goes on super smoothly. Overall I like the way the product feels and soaks into my skin, but I haven’t seen a noticeable difference in the past 2 week. I will continue to use it to see! nan
