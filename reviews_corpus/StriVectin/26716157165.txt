I’m assuming using this long term will show the results hopefully. I’ve only been using it a week. I love the texture and how moisturized my skin feels later. It’s good especially during winter. I like the scent but I’ve yet to see a marked difference in sculpting. Don’t expect immediate results and /or lines softening. Im happy because I love a good moisturizer that has mote advantages than just moisturizing. Great texture and love as a moisturizer.
