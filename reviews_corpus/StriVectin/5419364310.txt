I have been looking for a product to use daily that has all of the skincare in one, so I love that this has moisturizer plus retinol plus spf. A little goes a long way! I have dry very sensitive skin and this does start to feel a little greasy after application. I also learned the hard way that if I apply it in the morning then do a workout or go outside and sweat it gets into my eyes and stings like heck! Spf plus retinol!
