I’ve been using this serum in the AM for a couple of months now, and my husband has been complimenting how great my skin looks…and this man never usually notices ANYTHING. It feels a little sticky at first, but then absorbs quickly. Non-offensive smell. Plan on the-purchasing whenever I run out..I still have at least half a bottle with almost daily use. nan
