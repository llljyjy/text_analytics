My skin around jawline is not as tight as before. So, I was excited to try this face cream. I use it twice a day, applying in upward motions. I already started noticing that skin is little firmer and more plump. I like how in the mornings my faceline is more defined and uplifted. It also helps with my fine lines, it makes them less visible. Love it!
