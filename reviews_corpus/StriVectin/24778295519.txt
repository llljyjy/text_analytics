I have been using StriVectin cream for just over a year. I bought it to address wrinkles and crepiness on my neck. I had tried other neck firming/tightening/lifting creams with no success. After about a month of using the cream morning and night, I thought I saw improvement. After a second month, I definitely saw improvement. My neck continued to improve steadily until about the sixth month mark. Thereafter, there was no further improvement, but the gains made remained. I would say my neck is 70% better than it was. In addition, a small dark spot that had started to develop on my neck has completely faded away. I am now applying the cream to two other dark spots on my décolleté and they are already starting to fade after about four months of use. The cream itself is fairly thick, a little goes a long way. A 1.7 oz tub lasts me about three months. There is a very light scent if you stick your nose into the tub as soon as you open it. But the scent dissipates quickly and I cannot smell anything after applying the cream to my neck. This cream is pretty pricey but worth it in my opinion. I can see myself using it for the rest of my life or until I am so covered in wrinkles that I just don’t care any more. (LOL) One year review: WORKS FOR ME
