This StriVectin is a Super-C Dark Circle Brightening Eye Serum has a wonderful texture. It brightens my dark circles. It’s a lightweight gel serum. It has helped with my dull skin and my uneven skin tone too. It’s good for Normal, Dry, Combination, and Oily. I have dry skin and this eye serum helps with hydration too. I found it is great for my puffy eyes and firmness. It’s a potent serum with vitamin C in it. I love all Strivectin products and for years they have been my favorite brand. My favorite eye serum
