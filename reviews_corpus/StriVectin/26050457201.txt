I cannot be without this face cream. It’s hydrating (but not greasy), lightweight and absorbs quickly. Works perfectly and without incidence under makeup. It’s lightly fragranced which doesn’t bother me but is worth noting if you’re sensitive to fragrance. It absolutely lives up to it’s promise to tighten sculpt your skin. Before starting this cream my skin felt so soft loose. I think it was noticeably saggy. I’ve been using this consistently twice a day began to see improvement in as little as a week. Now it’s been about two months of regular use and today I realized what a dramatic difference it’s made in my skin nan
