It refreshes my eye area and keeps it moisturized. The skin around my eyes feels hydrated/more firm and I like the way my makeup goes on over it and stays smooth throughout the day. I’m not sure I can see a huge difference in my skins appearance. So I’m excited to see the long term difference it makes. nan
