I’ve never tried retinol cream that had an SPF and was surprised it’s a possibility to use it during the day - I love the idea, it’s brilliant and I really like this moisturizer, it is very nourishing and doesn’t leave any white cast, only smooth and moisturized skin. I’m using it before my make up and I like the fact that I don’t need any additional SPF before my make up. I’d definitely recommend it to everyone who wants to try retinol products that protect the skin from damaging sunlight without having any irritation. Brilliant
