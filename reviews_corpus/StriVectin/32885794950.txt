I’ve loved this eyecream so much! I usually have deep dark undereye circles, and when I read what this eye cream offers I thought it would be thick & heavy but to my surprise…it’s super lightweight, yet so effective. It’s not only brightening but it also gives you this look of being awake and alive, while still natural. It’s got benefits that I love like vitamin c which is great for your skin and can help with that undereye hyperpigmentation. Don’t just take my word for it, try it for yourself I’m sure you won’t regret it. This is my face early this morning before even doing my whole skincare routine, my dark circles are almost nonexistent Best eyecream for dark circles! Must Have!
