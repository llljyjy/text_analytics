I have tried so many eye creams, and now I have found the one! I already tried Strivectin’s Anti-Wrinkle and the Peptide Serum. I have nothing bad to say about either one, but this cream is perfect. I have sensitive skin and I get dried out areas easily. No issues here! It absorbs quickly and I feel like my eyes are soft and moisturized all day. I have all the signs of aging - under eye bags, wrinkles, and upper eyelid drooping. Everything seems smoother and softer since using this cream. I have used it for three weeks, and can’t wait to see what happens as time goes on! nan
