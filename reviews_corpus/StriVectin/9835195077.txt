I love a good anti aging moisturizer and i love retinol, and so when i got to try the new Advanced Daily Repair Retinol Moisturizer Broad Spectrum spf 30 i was thrilled! This feels so good on the skin, absorbs beautifully and ive already noticed a difference in texture and my fine lines softening up.  I love that this has spf as well, great all in one game changer! New skincare staple!
