I am obsessed with this stuff, I use it morning and night, I especially love doing the 10 minute moisture-boosting face mask twice a week. I know itâ€™s not technically used for a leave-on moisturizer BUT, I often put it under/around my eyes over night for extra moisture, my wrinkles are loving this stuff. IT LEAVES MY SKIN SO SOFT!!
