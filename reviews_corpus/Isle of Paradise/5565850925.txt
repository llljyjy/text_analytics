I love this so much. The fact that it’s a lotion AND tanner? Amazing. It’s so easy to apply, and it saves so much time because I don’t have to wash it off. The self tanner is gradual and doesn’t get too crazy dark, but rather it gives me a nice even bronzed look. I have light Asian skin, and it really makes me look sunkissed without it being too orange or drastic. Hello bronzed skin!!
