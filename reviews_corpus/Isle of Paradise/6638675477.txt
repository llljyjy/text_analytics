This made me look so tan it was insane! I mixed mine with a little bit of my hyaluronic acid moisturizer and it was perfect!! After about 8 hours I took a make up pad and just wiped off the residual on my face! I like diluting it a little more with some lotion for my neck so it blends a lot better!
