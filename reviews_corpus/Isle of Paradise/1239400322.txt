I’m very fair and this is one of the most foolproof self-tanning products that I’ve ever used. I love the fragrance, granted, the DHA smell still emerges after a few hours, and this does take several hours to fully develop. I mix about half a dropper with one pump of my favorite lotion and work one body part at a time. It’s buildable, and the first time I applied it I barely noticed a difference, but mixing it with the Isle of Paradise Serum over top was a dream. Love it. Would never put it on my face or my chest because it’s mostly coconut oil and I have sensitive acne-prone skin. Still trying to find a good self-tanner for my face that doesn’t have added fragrance, essential oils, alcohol, coconut oil, etc. Would love some recommendations! Easy to use!
