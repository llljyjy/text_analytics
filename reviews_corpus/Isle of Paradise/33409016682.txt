So ready for summer and was excited to try this product. I personally prefer to have glowing skin but not to dark .  Very easy to apply, has oily texture and it makes it easy and even spread the product. Gentle scent and not greasy. Color looks nice and exactly how it described. Skin feels hydrated. Very natural look. Would buy darker color for summer . nan
