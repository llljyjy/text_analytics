I love how hydrating this product is: with hyaluronic acid, glycerin, squalane, sea kelp base, argan oil, grape seed oil, and avocado oil. The ingredients list is amazing, cruelty-free, vegan, and kind to your skin! The packaging is so cute, and I love how easy it is to shake and spray on!  Best of all, the scent of this product is so pleasant. Itâ€™s not like other self tanners with that ghastly smell! Super easy, hydrating self tanner!
