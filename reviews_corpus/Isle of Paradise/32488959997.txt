I really do like this self tanner I left in on for 6 hours before rinsing it off and it gave me such a beautiful natural looking glow and it’s the perfect tone I would want. The only thing I don’t like about this is that it’s clear so it’s he’s to tell if you have missed any spots or not. Besides that I highly recommend this product. Love it!!
