After several months, I have to say this is a product I like a lot. My skin would be considered light, but I tan a little orange. So this is great on my skin. After reading reviews, I went for the darkest shade. It works well! Every other day for a little warm up. Itâ€™s honestly like a little extra skin camouflage for me. nan
