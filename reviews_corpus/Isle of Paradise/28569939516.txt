So I hadn’t used a self-tanner in over a decade (because of how streaky I found them to be) but this one is delightful! Only a little bit of streaking near my toes (and it’s not even that bad). I like that you mix it in with a moisturizer you already have and love (I used Kiel’s) and about 6 drops at first for each legs application. It was too subtle so the next day I did about 10 drops in each leg and I liked that coloring better. Very easy to use and I just went about my day after application. You can see I only did my lower leg for skirts/dresses so you can see my natural color and then Below where my finger is is the tanning color. pretty even tan
