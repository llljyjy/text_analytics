This product gave me a nice natural glow. It was slightly patchy in areas. I liked the concept of the squeezy tube component but it ended up giving me less control over the product because it would squirt too much or messily into my hands. I like that this product is vegan and cruelty-free and overall enjoyed using it. It's okay
