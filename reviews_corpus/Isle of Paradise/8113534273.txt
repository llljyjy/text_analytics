This is a great self tanner! I’m very fair, and the color is light but noticeable after one application. The smell is very light (probably the weakest scent out of any tanner I’ve tried), and it’s not greasy. It dries quickly and I don’t feel like it transfers onto clothes or sheets like others do right after application. The color is natural even on really fair skin, and it applies evenly and not streaky even when you’re in a rush. nan
