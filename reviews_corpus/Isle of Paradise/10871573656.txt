Great when used as it describes! Mix drops into moisturizer. I do 4 drops and find that’s perfect (see photo for difference) I put on about 1 hour before bed and slept — woke up with no marks on my pillow and visibly tanner skin. A good glow without it being obviously fake tanner. Will continue buying! Works on the body the same. A little difficult on foot/around ankles and must wash hands after application! First time tanner? Buy this! 10/10
