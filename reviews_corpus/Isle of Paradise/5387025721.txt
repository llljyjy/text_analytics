I like it and will be using it for the tanning benefits. I love the colour and the fact that you can sleep after putting it on. I’m fairly new to self-tanning so this was a good first experience. However, a couple things I didn’t like: it did feel a bit sticky before bed and i didn’t love the feeling. Not horrible enough to deter me but in case somebody hates that feeling. The colour is beautiful in the morning, but I definitely have some patches and missed some spots so hard to know where you’re putting it. I have to be more aware of blending it in. It is an oil, so I had to give my floor a wipe down after as my bathroom was super oily. I read some people did it outside which isn’t a horrible idea. Finally, the packaging design is horrible. I have no idea why they chose to make the top of it round. When it’s open you can’t put it back down nicely.Overall, I’ll keep using it - but I might want to try the water mist next time. Colour is nice, texture is not great, and packaging design is horrible. Good, but needs some improvements.
