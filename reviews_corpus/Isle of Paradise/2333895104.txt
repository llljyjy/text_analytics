I almost didn’t buy this product because of the negative reviews and pictures with streaks. I’ve used this a few times now and honestly it’s great! I think the folks who failed with the product weren’t sufficiently thorough in their application. Here are some best practices: use only a few drops each time and build over time, make sure you really blend the drops into your moisturizer before applying, rub your moisturizer into your skin longer than you normal would for an even application. For me, I used two-ish drops per area of my body (leg, arms, bum, chest, etc). I love that this product is Clean as well! Applied correctly it's a great product!!
