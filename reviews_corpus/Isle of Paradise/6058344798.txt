I’ve been staying away from self tanning products primarily because of their weird chemical smell and how difficult they are to apply and spread evenly. This thing is like magic, though. It smells so nice and it makes my skin both look and feel hydrated! It’s super lightweight and doesn’t feel sticky at all. The bottle is super cute, too. nan
