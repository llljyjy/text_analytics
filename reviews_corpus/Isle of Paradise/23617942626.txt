Love this stuff! Seriously, I really recommend this product. If you apply it with caution and spend a little bit of extra time (15 more seconds) to ensure you thoroughly spread out the product over your desired area, you will have amazing results! I tan well in the summer so I decided to get the medium colour. You can build up the colour of your tan depending on how many drops you use. Be sure to wash your hands well after using.
