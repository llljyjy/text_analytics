The best thing about this is how easy and convenient it is. The lotion is nice and I experienced no transfer throughout the day as it set. I was confused on whether I was supposed to wash off the color guard the first time, and I find that if you do it’s best (after about 4-6 hrs). The worst part is it’s slightly patchy. So I will continue using this when I’m in a pinch. It wears off easily. Easy if you’re in a pinch
