Ok, this is actually works, idk the science behind it but the skin does look tan after just 1 application, and doesn’t stain clothes or transfer anywhere. Just beware if you have hyperpigmentation on your face, it will make it more evident right away! took me couple weeks to ’wash’ it away Works but makes hyperpigmentation is more visible
