I love the color this tanning product produced! It worked perfect with my golden/ neutral undertones and was not at all orange. It was super easy to apply as well. I love that you can just out it on like regular lotion and not have to rinse it off later. It does start to rub off and get patchy after a few days if you donâ€™t keep up with application. Perfect golden color
