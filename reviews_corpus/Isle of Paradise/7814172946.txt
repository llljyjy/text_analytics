I have pretty pale skin in general, but especially in the winters. I’ve been using 2 drops of this with moisturizer every day and I get compliments on my glow all the time. I have severely dry skin and while this doesn’t irritate it, it occasionally clings to dry patches and makes them a bit darker. Nothing substantial, but something I notice occasionally. Overall, I’m a big fan and it works well with my skintone. nan
