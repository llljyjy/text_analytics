I put a LOT of sunscreen to protect my skin of sun damage (and also I have rosaceai), so my summer tan is always not so tan. So I mixed this with a light moisturizer for my body and with an hydrating serum for my face and it really worked well. I am pale and I was afraid it would be too dark, so I used less product than what they recommend.P.S. don’t mix it with a thick cream, it doesn’t work well.Also, the EWG Skin Deep score is not perfect (5), mostly because of colorants, so I think they could remove this frome their ingredients, it’s not useful. Saved my summer tan!
