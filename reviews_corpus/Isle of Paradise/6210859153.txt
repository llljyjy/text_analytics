Holy grail for self Tanner!!! I don’t understand the negative reviews. I think streaking would be a result of not blending well enough or the serum/moisturizer you mixed it with. I’ve never had an issue with it and have been using this for years! It does have a slight fake tan smell to it but it has never bothered me and I am very sensitive to smell. definitely recommend! nan
