I think this product just doesn’t work on very fair skin… I am very fair and don’t tan at all during summer time so I am very experienced with self tanners but I wanted a “quick” option and this one was cheaper so I tried it… left absolutely no colour on my skin EXCEPT for the dry patches (knees, elbows and ankles). It is not as easy to blend in as other brands and it fades terribly… extremely patchy. Doesn’t look natural at all… Not for fair skin and certainly NOT ultra dark
