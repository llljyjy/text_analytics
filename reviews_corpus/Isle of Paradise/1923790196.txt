If you want to be tan you will be tan because this spray does work! Applied easily just make sure you rub it in evenly. I used a makeup brush to get all the hard to reach spots. This was a medium tan. You can see the difference on my hands! It even smells great and not like other not so great smelling tanning products. My skin feels very hydrated and the spray does not leave my skin sticky. It actually absorbs quickly. I love that itâ€™s vegan and cruelty free as well! Good
