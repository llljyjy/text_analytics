The first thing I noticed about this tanner was the smell. It doesn’t smell like other self-tanning products. It smells like aloevera, which is quite nice. It seems like it has really nice moisturizing properties on top of the tanning components. I used a mit to rub it in rather than my hand. I’m curious to see if the mit picked up a lot of the product or if it helped distribute the product evenly. Another cool thing was the way the dispenser dispenses the lotion out of the bottle. It’s upside down, so that’s amazing of course, but when you open it it’s not like a flip top. It almost lifts open. Overall seems very nice. I’ll have to see what my leg looks like in 4-6 hours! Seems good!
