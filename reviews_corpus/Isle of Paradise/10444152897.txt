I have never used South Tennessee for so I was a little nervous. But this worked wonders for my medium tone skin. It goes on very evenly and I like that it is clear and color and usually doesnâ€™t say anything but I still wear something dark just in case. I hate turning in the sun due to UV lights so this will be perfect for early spring and summer. I have autumn sensitive skin but I have had no issues. Perfect for Asian medium tone skin
