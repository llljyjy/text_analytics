First thing I noticed about this tanning butter is the refreshing scent.  It reminded me of freshly picked cucumbers and not at all like the heavy chemical smells of most self tanners I’ve used in the past. This is super easy to apply with the consistency of a body butter and doesn’t leave streaks. It gives the skin a nice healthy glow.  I would imagine with frequent use you can really build up a nice tan.  I like to use it just to maintain a subtle glow. Pretty healthy glow
