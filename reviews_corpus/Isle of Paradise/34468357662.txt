I purchased the dark drops and I really don’t like them. I might even use the word “hate”. I mixed a few drops with my face moisturizer and it was SO orange. The smell is honestly the worst part, it’s like a sickly sweet smell that doesn’t go away. Another issue that I had was that no matter how well I mixed the drops with my moisturizer, it always distributed unevenly and looked CRAZY. It wears off extremely unevenly as well, like part of my forehead stayed tan for days while the rest faded away. Maybe I should have tried the medium or light drops, but I disliked this product so much that I won’t repurchase in a different shade. The one star is for the nice packaging, and for the fact that this continued to develop throughout the day- I think that’s a nice touch (even though it ended up developing into a disgusting orange color lol!) Orange!
