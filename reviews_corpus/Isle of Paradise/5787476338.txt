These are THE BEST tanning drops for your face! Not so much the body…I tried that and it was super streaky. However, not streaky at all for the face, neck, decollate area! It is sooo freaking good!!! For the facial areas it is fool proof! I mix in 2-3 drops in my moisturizer about every other night and WOW. The drastic difference this makes for a mom that doesn’t want to cake on makeup everyday is INCREDIBLE! Just makes it so my skin isn’t dull & I don’t look dead lol! Literally all I do most days is a little under-eye corrector, mascara, and brows! Saves me so much time while still making me feel like I’m presentable! I won’t be without these ever again! Will never be without this!
