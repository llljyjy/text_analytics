I’ve always been a tanning bed girl (GASP!) who would try the latest and greatest self tanner(s) every year and be disappointed and go right back to my tanning bed for color.  Then, I received a sample of Isle of Paradise…GAMECHANGER!  It’s so easy to use, I get even coverage and a lovely glow.  While a scent does ultimately develop, I find that it comes about once the product has done its work and I’m ready to rinse/shower anyway.  I think I like this so much because it fits squarely into my routine: I moisturize my body after every shower.  Adding a few drops to my lotion is an easy, simple process that doesn’t feel like an added step to my routine.  For an extra boost of color, I immediately rub a few extra drops into my freshly moisturized skin that has the glow drops boosted lotion on already.  My friends ask: you have a fantastic tan!  And they wonder where I “laid out”.  Not orange or streaky and I have a lovely tan for a week or until I apply again.  The only downer is it doesn’t work well for my face since I exfoliate with AHA toner and I use Retinol every other night.  If I want a glow on my face for a special occasion I can use my drops knowing it will fade after I use my skincare and/or I just use my bronzer to achieve a glowing, sun kissed face.
