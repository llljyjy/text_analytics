After hearing about these drops everywhere, I had to see what the hype was about. I totally get. These five off such a beautiful natural looking tan. I really like how you can customize how deep you want your tan based on the amount of drops you choose to use. I’m fair skinned so I do about 5 drops on each leg, about 4 on each arm, 2 on my face and 4-5 on my mid section at night after a good exfoliation in the shower and i wake up looking like I’ve spent a day in the sun. I do recommend using a tanning mitt. The first few times I didn’t, and I would wash my hands afterwards and I would try to be careful but no matter what the next morning about 2 inches up my wrist were paler than my body. Also a mitt just Distributes the product more evenly. A little tip, you sparingly around your elbows and knees and ankles. These areas WILL be darker I would repurchase
