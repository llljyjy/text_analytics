I really wanted to love the product, and most of me does (hence the 3/5 stars).  It gives a nice glow, which is why I purchased the product.  However, 3-4 days later I ALWAYS have a breakout!  I can pretty much put anything on my skin.  I can slob on oil and not have a breakout.  I’ve used other self tanners and have not had this experience at all.  Right now I’m nursing a huge pimple recovering above my lip which has been the worst I’ve had using this product to date & it’s going on the 4th day with this huge pimple.  I’ve used this product at least 10x now and each time, like clockwork, I have a breakout.  I have skin on the drier side & like I said, I haven’t met a brand of makeup or skincare (trust me, I’ve tried most of them too) that makes me break out.  I can also use all types of acid peals, serums, retinols etc never get breakouts, so I’m at a loss which ingredient does this to me but it’s definitely something in this I guess OR maybe this clogs the skin unlike any other tanning product I’ve ever used.  Just very crazy to me because I can sludge my face after skincare and even that doesn’t make me breakout.  I’ve even used body tan lotions on my face with no issues.  I do like what the product does, but I don’t like having to deal with the pimples I get afterwards.  I’m not even someone who ever struggled with acne in my life so I guess this product just isn’t for me, sadly.  I still recommend the product, just not for me. nan
