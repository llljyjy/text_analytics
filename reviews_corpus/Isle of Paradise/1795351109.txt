I was gifted this product from the brand in exchange for my honest review. I’ll preface this by saying I am new to fake tanning, but I really did enjoy this product. It definitely is a gradual self-tanning lotion. Being new to all this, that was perfect for me. It didn’t turn out orange. It just gave me a light, subtle tan. I also really enjoyed the smell of this product. It’s not too overpowering either. I like how it has avocado and coconut oil, which both help to prevent dry skin. You get a decent amount of product in each bottle. I would definitely buy this again. Good for beginners
