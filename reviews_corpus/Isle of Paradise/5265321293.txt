Isle of Paradise is my go to tanning brand! I am not a professional when it comes to applying sunless tanner and when I do it’s always a splotchy mess. But not with Isle of Paradise. I love that this tan spray oil is so easy to use and so easy to blend since it’s an oil. It’s not sticky and it doesn’t have a gnarly smell. I smell like vacation. I love that after applying it, my skin feels so hydrated. I love how fast it develops as well. I start seeing instant results in just 4 hours! I’m super happy that it is also a vegan formula and cruelty free! I highly recommend! Vacation Glow in a Bottle!
