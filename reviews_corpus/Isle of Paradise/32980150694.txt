Smells lovely. That’s about all I can say for this product. It has a bit of a sticky/oily feeling, and I can’t quite figure out how to layer it with my other products. I have a light olive skin tone (read: I look yellow when I’m not tan), and I didn’t see much tanning with regular use either. So, I just occasionally spritz it on when I want to smell nice and have a little pick me up. Smells good, but not much more.
