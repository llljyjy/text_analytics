I use this self tan for my face. I mix it with my moisturizer and it’s easy to apply; just make sure to blend it into your hairline, down your neck, and around your lips. Make sure to wash your hands afterward too. My only complaint is that the undertone is pretty orange, so make sure you don’t use too much. Works Well
