I love how easy this is to apply. You can technically spray it right on without having to use your hands, which is a huge plus, since before with the self tanner drops I would usually end up with very tan palms. Seems like very even coverage as well. The only downside is the residue from the spray ends up on the floor, making it very slippery. nan
