I will say there is a learning curve to applying these and figuring out exactly how many drops are best for you and how much lotion to use but once you figure it out you will never tan any other way.it is so fast and easy. Such a time saver compared to the mousse option I used in the past. I’m fair to light skin tone and this medium shade is perfect. I can’t speak to how it does on the face, I only use it on my body. I’ve tanned my whole body at least 10 times now and still have 2/3 of the bottle left. easiest way to tan!
