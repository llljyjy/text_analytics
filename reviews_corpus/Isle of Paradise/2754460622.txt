I was really pleasantly surprised by this tanner! It was really easy to apply...just like lotion, and I didn’t find it left any streaks after it developed. It did take 2-3 days to become the color I wanted, but once it did, I loved it! It fades evenly too, which is a huge plus for me as other tanners can be patchy when they start to disappear. It does have a warmer tone to it once it develops. I didn’t notice a scent at all, at least not an unpleasant one. My only complaint about this is the size. I can see myself going through it in less than a month. If it were bigger for the same price, this would be my new favorite tanner. As it is, I love it and will enjoy using it for a super easy, realistic tan look. Pleasantly Surprised!
