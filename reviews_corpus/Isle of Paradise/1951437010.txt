This is the best smelling self tanner I have ever used! It smells really lovely while you spray it and keeps that scent while it tans. It doesn’t turn into a yucky self tanning scent later and I love that! It’s also the most moisturizing self tanner I’ve used. My skin feels sooo silky and healthy when I use this! The tan is not fake looking at all, but it’s more like a natural glow. I like that I can reapply and build on the initial tan. The only thing I don’t like is that it’s hard to spray on your legs because it doesn’t spray well upside down. Other than that, I’m very happy with the results and will continue to use it! Smells really good and keeps skin hydrated!
