This tanner is next level y’all I promise you please try this out. It literally has the best smell which I was so shocked by because all my other self tanners are super gross smelling but this smells like cucumbers it’s so fresh and not sticky at all! I love how glowy it leaves my skin and I love that the tan isn’t orange at ALL! In LOVE
