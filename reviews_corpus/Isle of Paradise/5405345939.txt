I wanted to like this product but it is probably one of the worst self tanners I have used. As a self tanning pro (I have used almost every brand and have never had any issues like this) Instructions tell you to fully saturate your skin but since it is a water it runs horribly. I fully misted my entire body however the backs of my legs, under my arms, and back ended up being white! My feet look like a circus freak even though I applied thick lotion and on my feet and used a mitt to apply, they look like an oompa loompa with a skin condition. I had to wash my hands after applying and all of the tanner washed off where water touched it. Very, very sticky formula. Takes an eternity to dry. My son sat next to me on the couch two hours after I applied and ended up with tanner developing on his arm. Stick to the foam formulas with a green hue. This one develops into an orange color and looks fake. Misting water formula is not the way to go.
