Hello.  I liked the body butter.  It has a very pleasant texture, and the product also moisturizes the skin well.  My skin on the body is very dry, I was afraid that this product would dry the skin, but it is not.  Also, my skin is very pale, I don’t tan in the sun, I always use self-tanners.  I like that this product gives a slight tan to the skin.  I use a mitt to apply it. It’s ok
