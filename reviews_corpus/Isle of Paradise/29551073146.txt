So I mixed ONE drop in my moisturizer and then fell asleep… my skin is VERY pale as I haven’t been tanning so i didn’t think this would turn out okay in any way but don’t fall asleep with it on (first pic). After makeup remover, a shower, and makeup (second) it did look better and this product definitely works! Snow white to Orange
