I’m a pretty pale person and I use sunscreen on my face daily, so my face often ends up a few shades lighter than the rest of my body. The ‘light’ shade of this is great for me, because it totally corrects that difference after just a couple days of use! I use 3-4 drops with moisturizer morning and evening, and my face now has a really natural looking glow. It doesn’t stain, and the ingredients contain quite a few beneficial oils that also help moisturize my face without making it oily. Love this stuff, can tell it will last me a long time, and am tempted to buy the medium shade to use on my body. Great for even, subtle glow
