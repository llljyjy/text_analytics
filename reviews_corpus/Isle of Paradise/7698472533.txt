I have relatively pale skin with red undertones so I’ve worn foundation daily for almost 15 years. I wouldn’t feel comfortable or confident leaving the house without painting my face first. I’ve been mixing this in with my moisturizer for two month now and I love it!! I mix one pump of my moisturizer with a full dropper of the Dark tanner, and apply to my face, neck, and chest. It gives a natural glow, I have even started to appreciate my rosy cheeks. I love how this looks and I love being able to skip on the daily foundation. I use it every day or every other day. I am less than half way through, and I purchased it 2.5 months ago. It doesn’t smell like typical tanner, and it doesn’t cause acne. Exfoliating is critical though! I was experiencing patchiness on my neck at first. Nothing that won’t come off with a washcloth. Isle of paradise is my new skin staple! Replaced my foundation! Love the natural glow
