Initially as I was getting into my self tanning journey I thought, why would I ever need a buffing brush? Until I saw this one and the reviews. OMG does it deliver! It’s so soft and dense, I wish it was a makeup brush. Gone are the days of getting orange, caked on hand creases! I used this to swirl and buff out my face and body with the tanning drops or tanning water. Works like a dream. Applicator is great ad grippy. I wash with lukewarm water and a super gentle face wash (I use tatcha rice cleanser) and leave out to dry with a fan on it as I do with my makeup brushes. Doesn’t matte or feel chalked full of gunk after but if I’m putting it on my face, I’ll wash it after each use. Love this thing!! It’s made tanning super easy an definitely streak free. Huge fan. WOW! If you self tan, you need this in your life!
