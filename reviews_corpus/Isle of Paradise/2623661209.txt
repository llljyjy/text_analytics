Very easy to spray, convenient application. However, since it goes on clear you canâ€™t see where you sprayed. The first time using it I had stripes all down my lets. Also, I sprayed it on about 3 hours before I went to sleep, I was sweating while I slept and that made it even more streaky. Terrible experience. I have stripes on my legs
