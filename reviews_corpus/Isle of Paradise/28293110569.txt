i have naturally very pale skin, with cool undertones. i have used the tanning water before, in the shade medium. i found it was easy to accidentally look a little bit orange, but i liked the product. after seeing a video of the creator explaining that the dark shade is purple to counteract orange-tones, i decided to try out the dark mousse after my medium water ran out.and the results are in: the mousse has a MUCH easier application process than the water, and the colour is much more suited to my skin tone! i only had to use a tiny bit, so i know the bottle will last me a long time, which is a bonus. I look more bronze than orange, which was the goal. i highly recommend this product over the water (which i previously rated 3 stars).if youâ€™re pale with cool undertones, try using a tiny bit of dark instead of the medium. much more natural shade! dark shade on pale skin & better than the water!
