I have been using this once a week for almost a year. Iâ€™m about to buy my 4th bottle. I use light and my skin is normally a fair neutral- 1-2 steps darker than the lightest. It  looks natural and fades evenly. Just be sure to exfoliate before like all self tanners. I use the st tropes mitt and it works great together on my skin type. It takes about 6 hours to develop evens out my skin tone. every week staple product
