I really wanted to like this product, I use the drops for my face which are great. I find this very difficult to apply,  after spraying on, you still need to work at smoothing it evenly onto your skin and because it’s clear it’s hard to tell where it’s been applied to. Also the tan color was a bit orangey. will not purchase again. Difficult to apply evenly
