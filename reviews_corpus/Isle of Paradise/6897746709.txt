Ok isle of paradise had been ON it recently. I loved the lotion and this oil looked really nice so I was super excited to try this. It’s very easy to blend and left me super hydrated. I love that it doesn’t have a self tanner smell! I don’t feel like I have to shower to wash off the scent. I also don’t have any reside left over with this! If you’re worried about self tanner picking up your dry patches then I’d definitely try this! The best for dry patches
