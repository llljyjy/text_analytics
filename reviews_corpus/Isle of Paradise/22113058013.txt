I got the medium drops, I have light skin with peachy undertones and these drops worked wonders. I used around 8 drops per body part (leg, arms, torso, and back) with 4 pumps of Glow recipe moisturizer. It looks very natural and “sunkissed“ skin. If you a want a deeper finish I’d probably go with the dark shade. Very natural!
