This product does give a dark tan and the application is easy. I have dry, combination, skin and it did cling to any texture I had on my face (not super surprising). The very unfortunate part about this is that it caused breakouts. Not even just on my face when I used it, but I had little bumps all over my chest after using it on my neck/décolleté - and I never, ever, have body acne or anything of the sort! It looked almost like a heat rash (and it’s not summer over here). I won’t ever use it on my face again because of that fact. Super unfortunate because it does give a great colour overall (and doesn’t transfer)! Wish it was better!!
