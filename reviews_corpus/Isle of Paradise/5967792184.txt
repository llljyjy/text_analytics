I was super nervous about using a tanner with no guide, but it was surprisingly easy to apply. I loved the oil based formula, and how it didn’t transfer to my white towels or white sheets. It does have the self tanner smell as it develops, but not overwhelmingly strong. My only complaint is that it isn’t very dark. It is very natural looking, however, the “dark” is what I would expect for a Light or medium shade. I think this would be a perfect tanner to compliment a base tan in the summer. I will be keeping it, but I won’t be using it again until I am already tan this summer and want just a little extra color. super natural, super hydrating, not very dark.
