This is a GAMECHANGER!!!! I love the St. Tropez mousse and the Tanologist mousse - this brush spreads both of these like butter! It’s amazing.  I also have a tanologist spray I like, tried using with this brush and didn’t work as well - it just absorbed the product.  And definitely wouldn’t try a lotion with this - it would be a cakey mess.  It’s a very dense brush.  Easy to clean with the mouses though! LOVE IT. Great with tanning mousses, not sprays or lotions
