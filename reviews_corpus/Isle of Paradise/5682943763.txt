I’m obsessed with this product!! I have always been skeptical of self tanners especially because I didn’t want it to look obvious and fake but this one is so natural (I do 2 drops in my moisturizer) and it gradually fades over a few days so it’s super natural and it doesn’t have a strong smell! I would recommend starting with 2-3 drops and then going from there if you want darker (I have a medium white skin tone that’s fair in the winter). It keeps me glowy in the winter! nan
