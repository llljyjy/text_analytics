I’m going to be very detailed because I wish someone was for me. I did the trial and error so you don’t have to!I have fair skin and used the medium drops.Exfoliate well prior to self tanning. Once you’re out of the shower and towel dried moisturize areas that you don’t want to absorb too much color. (Face, hands, wrists, elbows, under arms, knees, ankles and feet)I use the drops with Cerave Daily Moisturizing lotion.For a deepish tan I use:3-5 drops for face/neck 1/2 pump lotion 10 drops per leg 2 pumps lotion 8 drops per arm 1 pump lotion 10 drops for back 2 pumps lotion 10 drops for chest/stomach 2 pumps lotion I use a tanning mitt as well as a back applicator set I got off Amazon. Specifically a back applicator that’s a band style with a handle on each end.The key to an even streak free application is to blend, blend and blend some more. Seriously, blend more than you think. Blend until all the lotion has fully absorbed.Don’t be heavy handed on your hands and feet you’ll end up looking crazy. I use whatever is leftover on the mitt after I’ve blended most off. Once you’re done wash your palms thoroughly and don’t forget between your fingers. If you forget between your fingers the tan develops really dark there and it will look straight up orange.I normally do this in the evening so I just hangout in a robe before going to bed.To extend the life of your tan don’t overly scrub in the shower and pat yourself dry. If your rub yourself with a towel some of the tan will come off and end up looking patchy. You can also add a coupon drops to help maintain your tan.I hope this helps someone. Have fun you tan goddesses! Overly detailed how to guide
