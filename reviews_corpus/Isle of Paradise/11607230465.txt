Im so in love with this tanning oil mist from Isle Of Paradise. It’s super easy to apply all over my body, just spray and rub in with my tanning mitt. I was so relieved that it didn’t make my skin feel sticky or super oily. Instead it was so hydrating and left my skin feeling silly smooth. The glow this tanning mist gives me is absolutely gorgeous and gives that natural sun kissed look. It definitely makes me feel much more confident and beautiful being in my skin, especially when I hit the beach or pool. I was impressed at how long the tan actually lasts on my body too. And it smells amazing , none of that gross tanner scent that I’m use to with other products. I will definitely be continuing to purchase for the Spring and Summer months ahead. My new favorite self tanner. My new favorite self tanner!!!
