These drops work, but you have to be strategic when using them. I have fair to medium skin but I bought the dark because when I use a self tanner, I want to look noticeably tanner. My thought process was also that with darker drops I could use less product to see a difference. I don’t think I would’ve seen any difference in my skin tone if I purchased the medium drops and I wouldn’t consider the light drops at all. I would say my skin looked tanner after 3 nights of using this product in a row. After that, you should be careful to really blend out your moisturizer because I did see some patches around my wrists/hands and the drier skin on my elbows went dark orange. I like the idea of not having to use a mousse or more involved product but I did see a lot of reviews saying these drops are great because they don’t have the fake tanner smell. That was not true at all for me. In the bottle, they have a light citrus plant-like scent. But once I mixed the drops into lotion and applied it on my skin it turned to that awful fake tanner smell. I can’t put my finger on it but to me it smells like burnt caramel mixed with cooked pasta before you add sauce (yes, I know that’s really weird). I used many different scented and unscented lotions and the overpowering chemical smell was always there. I would only recommend using this at night when you are planning to rinse it off the next morning because the smell hangs all day and is very noticeable and unpleasant. If you can deal with the smell and are looking for a quick and easy way to look a few shades darker, I would recommend these. Go for the darkest shade & beware of smell
