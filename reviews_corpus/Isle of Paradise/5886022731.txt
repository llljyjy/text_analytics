I donâ€™t tan all the time because I find the process really time consuming. I loved this product because it was super easy to apply! My skin felt hydrated and I felt like this dried down really quickly. I used a mitt with this and my only tip would be to make sure you really rub it in, I did get a few patchy/missed spots but overall it looked really natural and beachy in the morning! I will continue to reach for this. nan
