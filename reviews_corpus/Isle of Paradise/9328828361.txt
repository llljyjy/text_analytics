I received a sample in a kit. It does work. I have a lovely glow. I don’t like it though because I have to mix it in a moisturizer which is just messy. If you don’t mix well enough you will not get an even tan. It is sort of buildable. I tried to do 6 drops instead of the normal 4 for my legs but that caused the dreaded orange hue to show up.   I’m going back to my normal lotion that I don’t have to mix. Love the concept and it can work well if you have a particular lotion you always want to use and you have great mixing skills. Works but messy
