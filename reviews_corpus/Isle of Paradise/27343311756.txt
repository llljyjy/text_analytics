I wanted to love this, I love a noticeable tan and have light olive skin, and thought this would be way easier than using mousse and a mitt so I added it to my moisturizer and added a generous helping of drops (probably more than 12) I haven’t noticed a difference at all the next day except for between my fingers that I clearly didn’t wash off properly... disappointing as it was pricey and just once use is about 1/8 of the product. Disappointing!
