i like it but wouldn’t buy again. i’ve used it a handful of times and every time it dries a bit patchy on the face. i think it tends to stick to dry skin patches, so i exfoliated and washed my face to see if i noticed a more even colour and i don’t really. it does have a nice noticeable tan, but if you have dry skin/patches then just be aware of that. good, but not great
