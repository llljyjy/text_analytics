Tried first as a sample then bought full. Works well with no streaking imparts a healthy buildable glow. No patchiness. Can apply w hands as long as wash them well after. Works well with all different brands of moisturizer and serums. It is cheaper and better than tan luxe. I will ask if I can return my mini tan luxe as I received an mini luxe for holiday and it works nowhere as well As this one. I also struggle with combo skin acne if I donâ€™t stay on top of my skincare or intro new product I expect some reaction. No breakout with this product and did have one w tan luxe. better than tan luxe, great quality, mixes well
