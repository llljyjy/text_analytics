I like the color it gives, very natural and truly deep. Also it works fast, I can see my skin darker in just an hour. It’s super easy to use, I mix it with my moisturizer. Doesn’t feel tacky, absorbs well and quickly. I am not a fan of the scent that I can’t put my finger on, I’d say it smells almost nutty, better than a typical sunscreen’s scent. Overall, I think this product is decent, above average. Gifted by Isle of Paradise Looks natural
