. The tan goes on completely clear and develops to about one or two shades deeper than your skin tone. You can continue to layer it to achieve and deeper and very natural-looking tan.It instantly melts into the skin upon contact and it feels cool and refreshing, like water. It’s truly a unique formula and application experience. It feels instantly hydrating on the skin and, while wet-feeling, it absorbs quite quickly. It feels just slightly sticky as it is drying but as soon as it completely dries, it doesn’t feel like you applied anything on your skin at all! The formula always look flawless and develops the most natural looking tan! You don’t have to worry about streaks or patchiness because it just goes on so smooth and evenly! I’m very impressed with this formula and I highly recommend it! Effortless and Hydrating Bronze Glow
