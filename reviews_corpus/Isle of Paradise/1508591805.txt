I’m highly impressed with  this its my first tanning product I’ve ever used and it’s so effortless and stress free to apply you just mix it with lotion and  place section by section to distribute  i Did end up docking one star because I found with my very fair skin that I am whipping through the product really fast even for my  fair skin tone at first  using solidly for first few days in a row With just 2-4 drops after that I evened it out by moving to two to three days per week with 4-6 drops I plan to repurchase product in the future but I  will be switching to the medium shade in order to use less drops and make the product last longer. All in all four stars nan
