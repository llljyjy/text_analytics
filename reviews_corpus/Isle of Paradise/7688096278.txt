I’m a BIG fan of everything by Isle of Paradise and their new Oil Mist doesn’t disappoint. Goes on effortlessly and leaves me feeling hydrated and glowing. I have worked with their drops, which I love for my face, their Body Butter which is my go to for my body glow, especially my legs and their Mouse, another hit. Like all the others, this oil will not leave you sticky and isn’t transferable. You can get dressed within minutes. I love that Isles is not only cruelty free but also vegan free and working hard to eliminate waste with innovative new rectangle packaging. My go to tanning brand!
