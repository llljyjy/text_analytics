This brand really does work. I received a very generous points bonus sample of the lotion. I wanted to try it because someone said it didn’t smell like tanning lotion. UMMM, YES it does. But it really works.  I like the drops better just because I can mix it with my own slighted scented lotion.  The first day I used this lotion I got great results.  The next couple of times, I tried mixing scented lotion in, it didn’t seem to do much. But overall, especially if you can stand the strong tanning smell, it really works for pail people.  The medium is the one I use. Just watch those toes, ankles, knees, and elbows! nan
