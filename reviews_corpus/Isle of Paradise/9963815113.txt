I usually use the tanning drops but I decided to give this a try. It definitely got me tanner than I was before, but with no guard color it made to difficult to figure out where I had already sprayed. Some parts of me are extremely tan while others are white. Obviously some of that is user error but I feel like it couldâ€™ve been avoided if the oil was tinted. The color of the tan is nice though, not overly orange. Good, not great
