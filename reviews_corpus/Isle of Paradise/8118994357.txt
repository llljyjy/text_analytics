Finally a tanning product that keeps my skin hydrated! I’ve tried every tanning product on the market and this one by far keeps my skin the silkiest which is key for a long lasting tan. Upon application it’s super luxurious and glides easily so you’re able to get to even the smallest and hardest spots. I love that it doesn’t smell like the traditional self tanners do! It’s vegan and cruelty free so that’s a bonus. I recommend you to get this if you regularly self tan and want a tan that gives you a beautiful glow and is long lasting. nan
