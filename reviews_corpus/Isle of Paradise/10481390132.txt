i love how you can use this on face and body. definitely noticed a difference when i got up in the morning, however it got very patchy and doesn’t last that long. i found that if i don’t apply everyday then the tan only last like 2 days max for me. It also makes my hands ORANGE lol so make sure your washing your hands frequently after use. beautiful bronze glow
