The best face tanner out there! I like the end color result from this - it is warm and bright. I do find the tan only lasts maybe 2 days on me - but I do clean my face a lot and do apply products such as retinols/AHAs/BHAs, which contributes to the overall skin turnover time. This was gifted to me by Isle of Paradise. nan
