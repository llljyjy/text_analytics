First time trying Isle of Paradise self tanner and I’m so impressed. This oil mist is so easy to use and delivers a beautiful tan color. I’m pretty pale and I usually have issues with self tanners turning orange but this one is perfect. Excited to keep using it. Tan lasts about a week and the color develops in about 10-12 hrs. nan
