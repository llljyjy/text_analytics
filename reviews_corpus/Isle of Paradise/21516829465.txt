Gifted by Isle of paradiseBy far the best self tanner on the market. I put this in with my lotion once a week. It dries so quickly because it’s in your lotion which is such a great concept, so it doesn’t leave a greasy sticky residue. The tan fades evenly and not streaky at all. Has a pleasant OK smell. Last for about a week. And doesn’t stain sheets or clothing. 10 out of 10 Absorbs quick
