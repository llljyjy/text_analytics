I got a sample bottle with my points. This stuff works so well. Didn’t make me break out and made me look tanned. The only complaint I have it the smell and texture. It’s a bit sticky feeling and smells like a tanning product. But worth it. The tan luxe smells better for sure but I haven’t tested that one long enough . great results not so great smell and texture
