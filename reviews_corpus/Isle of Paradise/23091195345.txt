I’m giving this 2 stars only because it’s the first tanning water I’ve ever tried and I love the innovation. Sunless tanners have come such a long way! It also doesn’t smell bad, I actually didn’t notice a smell at all. However, those are the only 2 things I liked. It’s super streaky and patchy and when it wears off, you skin is left looking like shedding lizard skin, literally. Terrible orange color, but I will say that it lasts a lot longer than I expected. Not Good
