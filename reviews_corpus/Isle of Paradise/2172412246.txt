This is my absolute favorite self tanner company.  I love how they have so many different formulas like gels, musts, etc. this is my favorite because itâ€™s a lot easier to apply than some of the others out there. I would recommend you do it in the shower though, because if it gets on the floor it will make your feet brown! nan
