I just bought these and there are white specs floating all in the tanning water. The box was sealed and the girl confirmed the product had just come in that day. Another associate confirmed the white specs mean the product is expired…so they’re putting “brand new” expired products out on the shelf sealed so you can’t tell until you open it purchased “brand new” full of mold
