I am very pale and refused to subject my skin to sunlight to tan. I only like to use self tanning products. I’ve tried many other ones that were very difficult to apply and left streaks. This one is very easy to apply, and creates a gradual natural looking low. Overall I love this product and I’m so happy to have tried it Great
