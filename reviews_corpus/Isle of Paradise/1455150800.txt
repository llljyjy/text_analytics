Typically I don’t like self tanners because I have olive skin and they tend to give me an orange hue but I decided to try this one and I was really happy with it. It gave me a really nice natural sun kissed  glow I use this one only on my face no streaks or blotches it blends really well with your regular day cream which is nice cause I can mix it in with my morning routine or nighttime. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I’m not keen on the smell at first it smells nice when you put it on but after it dries I felt like it left behind a wet dog or towel smell but it does fade the next day. good stuff
