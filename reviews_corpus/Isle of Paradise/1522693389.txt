I have used their drops in the past for my face so I was really excited to try the body butter. It did not disappoint! I love that it gives such a natural tan without streaking and as long as I wash my hands right after my hands don’t turn orange! It’s really moisturizing and leaves my skin looking summer ready! Love it!
