I have really been a big fan of Isle of Paradise for the last few years. I am constantly looking for an easy self tanner to use that gives me a nice glow, but nothing that is super obvious and orange. I was previously using Jergens and I loved it, but I felt like it wasn’t giving me “the look” that I wanted color wise. I have been using this for the past couple weeks and have noticed an instant difference in my tan. The application is super easy and it I love the smell. This is definitely my new go-to gradual self-tanner. Easy Application
