I have no idea why this product has any bad reviews! It’s easy to use, smells fine, and applies flawlessly with zero patchiness or streaks, no orange, no colour transfer. You can get dressed straight afterwards and within 4 hours colour starts to develop, being darkest about 8 hours later. It’s unreal, seriously. The name is misleading and kept me from trying it for a long time. It is not a “water“, but more of a body oil. It is very hydrating and can be used in place of my moisturizer on days where I use it. My skin feels so soft and it does not break me out to use directly on my face. Colour fades over the next week very naturally. Any leftover colour can be scrubbed off in the shower in time to prep for another application. A must have. Holy Grail Tan
