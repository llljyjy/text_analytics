Why is no one talking about how BAD this smells?! It’s like very early 90’s, OG, sunless tanning smell. It’s very greasy, too. I do like using it on my hands & feet between spray tans as they tend to fade/get patchy the fastest. It is a very subtle color, though, so between that and the smell it gets two stars. nan
