I was gifted this product by Isle of Paradise in exchange for my honest review. I really love Isle of Paradise products and this one is no different! I use the medium formula for the winter and just started using the dark formula for the summer and I just love it! I’m Italian so I already have an olive undertone to my skin and it doesn’t take much for me to tan so this looks super natural on me. I love to mix it in with my moisturizer for a gradual glow. If I need some color quickly, applying it directly to the skin works beautifully too! No stinky smell and the color develops within just a few hours. I’ve never had any streaks or weird color blotches using this and it always looks great! Big fan of this brand Blown Away!
