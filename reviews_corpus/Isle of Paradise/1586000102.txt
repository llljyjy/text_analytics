The color came out subtle and nice. I would not try this product again as it made my legs super hot. Not sure what was about its ingredients but something mightâ€™ve clogged my pores. I hard a hard time sleeping at night (I applied it 3-4 hours before bed) because the areas that I applied the product to got super heated. Overheat side effect
