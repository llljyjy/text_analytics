I decided to try this product after having disastrously orange results with self tanner lotions and products, and not wanting to use tanning beds.I really like the colour I had when using this product! I started with only a couple drops into my facial moisturizer and really didn’t have to increase beyond 3 drops total. The colour lasted a few days, but I also exfoliated prior to applying. Considering how little I have to use at a time, the price is very good for the bottle (if you like a darker look, you’d probably use it up more quickly than me)The only con to this product is that I find it causes me to break out. Great colour, causes breakouts
