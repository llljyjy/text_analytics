I love how I can adjust the darkness of my tan by using more or less drops, depending on what look I’m going for. I will say it was definitely a learning process in terms of how many drops I needed to achieve a perfect tan but it was easy to use and blends nicely into my face. It gives a really naturally looking tan which is perfect since I’m trying not to tan outside anymore. It also did NOT break me out, which was my greatest fear using it. Gifted by Isle of Paradise nan
