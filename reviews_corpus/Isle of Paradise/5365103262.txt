On my second bottle of this and loving it!  I’ve never had such a low maintenance, natural looking tan. I’m pretty fair so often products like this just look fake and strange when I put them on but not this one, a nice healthy glow and can turn the dial up or down depending on the season with how many drops used. Not streaky at all and none of that dreaded transfer to clothes and sheets. 10/10! nan
