Great self-tanner lotion!! First of all, I LOVE the smell of this product! It is very light and clean smelling unlike other tanning lotions. I noticed immediately how easy it was to apply and how hydrated my skin felt. The color comes in very naturally and gradually, which is great for my pale complexion. Great!
