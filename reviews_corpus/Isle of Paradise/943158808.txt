I’m not great with self-tanning products as I usually rush and make them streaky & uneven. I have super dry skin and wanted to try this bc it’s a butter. I’m pretty fair and find it to be a really natural colour on me, and also pretty foolproof. I also love that it’s not sticky & doesn’t stay wet for long. It dries quickly and I don’t have to stress about smudging it. Smell is fairly strong & self-tanner-y… but I find the awesome results to be totally worth it! nan
