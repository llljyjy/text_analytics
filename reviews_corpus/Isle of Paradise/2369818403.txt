This is the second Isle of Paradise product I’ve used, the first being the tanning drops. The bottle is big, which is nice, especially if you’re using on your entire body. It doesn’t have a bad smell either. I left it on for about 8 hours and honestly didn’t notice a huge difference. It definitely is gradual. If you are wanting a quick tan with only one application, this isn’t the product for you. I personally prefer the drops, as they work faster and produce a darker looking tan. nan
