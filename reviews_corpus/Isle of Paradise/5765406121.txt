I have been a big fan of Isle Of Paradise for years, and I was so looking forward to this launch! The tanning drops are usually my go-to for a tan without being sticky, so I’m really excited that they finally made an oil version so I don’t have to guess about mixing dropss into moisturizer and all being the same shade. It’s moisturizing, tone looks natural, and it wears off evenly. Awesome every day tanner! (Complimentary) Finally! A non sticky self tanner!
