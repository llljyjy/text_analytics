I’m a fan of the Isle of Paradise tanning products, but this oil mist is by far my favorite. The formula is lightweight and easy to apply, it isn’t sticky and goes on the skin evenly. It also doesn’t leave streaks or unpleasant fake tan fragrance. It has a very pleasant scent. This self tanner is formulated using great ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and squalane, and A vitamin-rich sea kelp. To reach the desired medium tan, I applied this tanning elixir twice in a week. I did it before bed after showering, shaving and exfoliating my skin. I also love that this tanning mist is free from harsh chemicals and has environment friendly packaging. Natural tan
