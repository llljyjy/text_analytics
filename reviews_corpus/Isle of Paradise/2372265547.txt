I’m a fan of other Isle of Paradise products so I was excited to try their latest creation. I like the idea that this could be so convenient, just as easy as applying your moisturizer out of the shower. The website and other reviews don’t mention this transferring or needing dry time, but I waited a while before dressing just in case and applied with gloves so I didn’t stain my hands (I feel like some product sunk into the gloves which made this not very spreadable, but I think it’s also just a thick product). This smells like their other products if you are familiar - kind of like a self tanner, but somehow a little better. The packaging is very cute and I love that this is cruelty free. The scent was a little strong for me and I feel like I used a lot of product on just my legs alone, and didn’t apply a thick layer. There was some tackiness and it took a while for this to dry down which I didn’t love. In the summer I like a lighter weight lotion, so I wish this were more like a lotion than a thicker body butter. Cool idea and gives a subtle glow, easy to use. I’ll give it a few more shots. This product was gifted in exchange for my honest review. nan
