I am very disappointed with this product! It caused my face to break out which I have overall pretty clear skin. I always used tanologist tanning drops but switched to this. Wish I didn’t waste my money it made me look orange, won’t come off at all, and latches onto specific parts and is very blotchy. It is just not good. These photos were taken less than 24 hours after putting it on. Do not recommend! nan
