For a quick and easy tan, this works really well. I used this on my legs and did one application at night, and felt like my legs looked plenty tan the next day! I didn’t have any streaks at all only slight buildup of color at the ankles in spots where I could’ve applied better. It was moisturizing and didn’t smell at all.  I do think the color is slightly more warm than I’d like but it’s a very passable tan. Not bad!
