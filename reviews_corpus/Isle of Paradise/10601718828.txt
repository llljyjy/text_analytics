I used this religiously when I had it! It’s been a while since I got some, but here’s my take from when I was consistent: I got this at the same time I got a fresh tub of Rodan+Fields Active Hydration body moisturizer. For about 2 weeks, I was just adding 3-5 drops to my daily post-shower lotion. I loved it, so I ended up just dumping the whole bottle in the tub and used it every time I got out of the shower until I ran out of moisturizer. It was such a great system; didn’t add extra time onto my routine bc I would be putting on lotion no matter what, no extra steps required. The color was beautiful, all I had to do was be sure my lotion was distributed evenly. I had a few mishaps around/between the fingers and on elbows, knees, & ankles but I figured it out quickly. I just *gently* scrubbed my nails when I *gently* washed my hands afterwards every time and never had staining serious enough to bother me. I don’t like to use it on my face bc it turns my pores & blemishes brown/orange, so I opt for St. Tropez Face Tanning Water/Mist (whatever it’s called) just bc it goes on as a mist and is not a serum. But for my body??? THIS IS THE ONE! I won’t use anything else. I’ve tried SO many, with mitts and without. Nothing tops this, and the fact that it goes in my lotion is what takes the cake for me. Just follow the directions to add it to your lotion and you won’t have any problems! (P.S.: if you try to put the drops on by themself, you will look like a piece of cheese pizza. Save yourself the humiliation & follow the directions!) MIX IT WITH LOTION
