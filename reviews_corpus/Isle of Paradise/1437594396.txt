Does not go on evenly. I have been using tanning foams for a long time, but since this item had good reviews, and it was also moisturizing, I figured Iâ€™d give it a try. Colour is a bit orange-y and it gathers in certain places and does not give a smooth tanned look. Tried it on my legs. Not impressed. Am returning it. nan
