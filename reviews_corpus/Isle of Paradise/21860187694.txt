A lot of the reviews were incentivized so it was difficult to find any cons to this product so I bought it myself to test it out. 3/5, it still ends up being sticky with that fake tan smell. While being a clear product means my white bed sheets won’t get stained it also means there was no guide color. First time applying and my hands and palms turned so orange (even after making sure to wash off product from my palms.) Bottle doesn’t have a flat surface bottom unless you put the cap back on so between sprays you can’t really set it down without laying the whole bottle down on it’s side which is a little annoying. Also when spraying, the product goes everywhere BUT where it was intended to go. Applied in my bathroom and so much got on my floor that the bottoms of my feet were also tanned the next day. nan
