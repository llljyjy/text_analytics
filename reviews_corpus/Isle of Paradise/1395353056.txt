If you’re trying to decide on the tanning water or this kit, get this kit! The sprayer makes all the difference! It is so much better than the pump bottle. The refills are only $24 too so that’s a perk. I love this self tanner! I’ve been self tanning for over twenty years and this is the best one I’ve ever used. Self tanning takes practice but once you get the trick to it, you’ve got it. The trick to this product is to be sure you’ve sprayed enough on each area before blending with the mitt. You need the mitt!! And always, go light over ankles, feet, wrists, hands. A little lotion before and after (gently) really helps those areas to look even and not harsh and fake. The hands and feet are always big self tan giveaways. This stuff is a little pricey and doesn’t go very far if you’re using it to tan your entire body. So I use my less expensive tanner like Jergens on places that mostly stay covered and I use this on my face, chest and arms. It lasts and once it’s ready to come off, it comes off fairly easy compared to other self tanning products I’ve used. I am very fair and go with the medium glow. It gives a golden and sun kissed looking tan. The only thing that would make this product better for me is if they increased the amount in the package because it’s a little pricey for the amount you get. But it’s Summer and a tan always makes me feel better so I say splurge and try this stuff! You deserve it! :) Hello Summer glow!
