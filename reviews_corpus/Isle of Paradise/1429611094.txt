Love this stuff! I use 2 drops with each leg, one for face, and two for both arms.  Blend well!! Have never had streaking or the orange look.  Start SMALL if youâ€™re fair skinned and rub lotion in very well.  You def get the self tanner smell, I usually apply at night before bed and shower first thing in the morning. Natural looking!
