I have been using self tanner for years but decided to try this to use just on my face. My face was straight up orange when I woke up and I only used 1-2 drops mixed with moisturizer! I’m not even that pale and rarely pull orange from self-tanner. It also travelled down my neck while I slept so it’s all patchy and gross looking. Such a waste of money! ORANGE!!
