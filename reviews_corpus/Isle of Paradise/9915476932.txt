24 hour prep time was a drag. Still tacky at 30 minutes. 4-6 hours of avoiding water (bathroom visit = white hands), and not breaking a sweat (big ask in summer) all feels a bit like hard work. Colour is good, but big, obvious white patches where water splashed at #2 hour mark. White towels also a mistake. Not great.
