I love this product! I live in Florida and want my legs to look tanned. I had tried a drug store product, but my skin had a strange texture with it. After I order Isle of Paradise I wondered if I made a mistake regarding the depth of color - but the light is perfect, I can add to it, it lasts several days, itâ€™s easy to apply and my legs have a perfect tint. Love It
