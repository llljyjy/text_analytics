I bought both the medium and light shades. The light shade I used on my face and the medium I used on my legs. I would say overall I really like the product, especially on my face. It applies evenly every time and looks beautiful. The problem for me is my legs, I cannot seem to keep this from being streaky on my shins no matter what I do. I have switched lotion consistencies and that has helped somewhat (I have super dry skin and was using a super rich lotion to try to combat the crazy itch that tanning products create on my lower legs). But even when using a lighter lotion, if I put this on and went to sleep, I feel like the tan got shifted around on my legs from rubbing against sheets/my other leg. God forbid you put on pants and cross your legs etc. so while I would say it’s been very good on my face/upper body (and it doesn’t make me break out!) it has been tricky for the lower legs/feet. Great in some respects, not so great in others
