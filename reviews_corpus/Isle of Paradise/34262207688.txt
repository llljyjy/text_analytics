this is my first time using a self tanner for my body so safe to say I’m not very experienced I did head to toe and it was awesome it was not blotchy!! I just rubbed it in my body with some body lotion the only thing I would recommend is really not going hard on your feet because I  had orange feet because I put way too much . perfect for beginners doesn’t really have a smell, will leave you looking tan!! I’m pretty sure all the bad reviews are from people who didn’t know how to use the product or just didn’t rub it  into their skin because I did not look blotchy at all Perfect for first time users
