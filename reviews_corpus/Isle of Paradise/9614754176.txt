This self tanner is a winner! The product makes my skin feel smooth and hydrates. It leaves my skin looking naturally tan and glowy. Itâ€™s super quick and easy to apply, and not sticky. I love that this product goes on clear, as it helps with transferring to clothes/sheets. It actually smells great, unlike other self tanners that can have that self tanner smell to them. I love how the brand is cruelty free and vegan, as this is super important to me! This self tanner wins!
