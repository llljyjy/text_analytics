I love both the drops and the water, although I do lean more to the drops since it’s so easy to apply.It does leave your skin slightly oily, but the subtle tan is worth it.However, if you put too many drops, you do look quite orange. There’s a fine line between the perfect dose and the orange look.The water for me is ok. It makes me quite orange, so I have to apply the day before I want to be tanned. That way it fades out in the day to the perfect color for me.I do think it is worth it if you want a daily subtle tan, mostly for the winter months. Great self tanner
