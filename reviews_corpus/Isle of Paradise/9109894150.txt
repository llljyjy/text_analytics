Complimentary from Isle of Paradise. I have fair skin with yellow undertones. This product did develop a tan on me, but it was a subtle one. I have been using 3 drops of the product in my night routine, where I will mix it with my moisturizer. The tan usually lasts about a couple of days before my skin is back to its usual tone. Always wash your hands after applying it, else itâ€™ll leave orangey streaks on your hands. nan
