I like it. It went streaky on hands and lower legs and feet but that’s pretty average. Smell at first is so good, then goes to a burnt sugar smell once the chemical reaction takes place. But no where near as strong as other ones I’ve tried. Worth the price! Did come a little orange, but mostly olive toned which is pretty. Enhanced my skin on face, looks like I’m wearing good makeup. Before and after are the photos Worth your money- looks like I went to Hawaii
