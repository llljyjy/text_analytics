Its a lightweight oil, subtle yet nicely scented. It delivers a light, natural self tan.  Love the Golden tan that I experienced. I was nervous in applying it the first time given the dark shade I received, but it worked out beautifully! My observations:  1. The oily-water formula doesn’t spray evenly. 2. One must shake the bottle often when applying. 3. It requires more than just spraying it on…e.g. one needs to spread it into your skin to get an even coverage. 4. Requires time to dry off (I waited over 30 min and it wasn’t completely dry). 5 requires gloves or you’ll ended up with orange hands like me, even tho I applied Vaseline before, the product did “tan” my hands. Overall, a good self tanning solutions. Beautiful soft golden tan!!!!
