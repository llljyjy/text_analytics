Overall, I really like this self-tanner due to the fact that it is very moisturizing (my skin is super dry).  However, it is VERY sticky and doesnâ€™t seem to really dry.  I put it on at night and wake up feeling as sticky as when I applied it.  Packaging could be better since the top part of the bottle is round. Good product but sticky!
