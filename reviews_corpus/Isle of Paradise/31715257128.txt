It’s gifted by Isle of Paradise. It will give you a natural and healthy tan. Really can’t say I smell any of those good ingredients.  It’s really easy to use, it smells great, is fantastic. A very peppermint smell . Color is great as well, dark and cancels out redness in my skin. I didn’t care for it on my face because it made it blotchy. One to two drops each night in my moisturiser match’s my tan perfectly. Smells good
