I received the self tanning drops gifted by Isle of Paradise. This is seriously the only self-tanner I trust on my face at the moment. It gives the best, most natural looking glow AND it’s like permanent makeup. I am very pale and fair skinned so this stuff makes me look a little healthier haha. Honestly if I was stranded on a deserted island, I wouldn’t be able to live without these drops!!! A perfect tan for your face!
