i really did wanna like these drops since i saw so many great reviews & i was super excited to try them. idk if its cause i’m naturally VERY pale as but unfortunately they did not work for me at all. before applying i exfoliated every INCH of my body to make sure i didn’t have any dry patches, i mixed the drops well with my moisturizer, & i made sure it was applied consistently & i made absolute sure i didn’t miss a single spot. for the first day maybe, i had a nice, golden glow. by the second day it was already fading, patchy, & inconsistent. the patchiness is especially bad on my neck, stomach, & under the boobs. now i’m left looking like a giraffe, desperately trying to get it off. inconsistent & patchy mess
