This tanner is awesome! Like many, mine came cloudy and I was a little concerned so I reached out to the actual company and the rep let me know that: “As our products are totally transparent there’s a chance that when stored in warm or changing temperatures, or exposed to direct light, strands of the ingredients may begin to reform. In this case, it’s possible that this was caused by how the product was stored or transported before you bought it. Please be assured that this is no cause for concern and the water is still 100% efficient and safe to use. The only impact to the formulation is purely on a visual level.“ IT IS SAFE, NO NEED TO RETURN THE PRODUCT. IT IS NOT MOLDY, OR EXPIRED. I used it and it was totally fine, the color was amazing and it lasted so long! Way easier than any mouse I have used and way less messy. PSA: The Cloudy Liquid is NOT Moldy or Expired!!!
