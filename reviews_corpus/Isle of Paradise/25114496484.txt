This product is super hydrating, so buyer beware if you have oily skin! I have dry to normal skin, so this is the perfect addition to my nighttime routine. My skin is also very fair, so I notice a difference in the morning after using it. I love that I get a nice, very light tan by the morning. Not orange at all. I have to use more than 2 sprays though (instructions states 2-3 sprays, but I do about 4 to notice a nice glowing colour by the morning). I love the smell too, it doesn’t smell like self tanner at all. It is super hydrating though, and I broke out just a little tiny bit on my forehead the first time I used it. So now I just don’t apply as much face cream after washing my face, because the spray will add the extra hydration. And after doing that, my skin stopped breaking out! I have officially added this product to my daily nighttime routine and couldn’t be happier. Nice glow… and super hydrating
