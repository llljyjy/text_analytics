Love this product!! I’m a fan of self tanning creams and mousses, never tried an oil mist but was highly intrigued after reading the description and reviews. Purchased the Dark shade since I’m naturally a med/tan color and need a product that makes my skin tone more golden, deep, and rIch. This delivers! Color takes a while to develop, although once it does it continues to deepen and lasts a good while, many days, even after showering. The oil mist applies evenly and easily with a tanning mitt. I misted on my skin in the shower after fully drying off, to avoid product getting all over my bathroom. Definitely recommend washing hands and palms very well to avoid dark palms. Other than that this is a winner! No streaks or orange patchy spots… just even and beautiful tan. This is one of my new faves and my go to tanning product. Golden Tan - Easy to Apply
