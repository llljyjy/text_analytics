I’m not a big self tanner but this definitely does the job! I used the tanning drops before and so I like the idea that this has the spray top because I felt like it applied nicer. I chose to moisturize while I was putting on the Tanner but I felt like it just sunk into my skin and I think that actually helps it apply more evenly. I wanted a light tan and I think this does the job without being too obvious, you can definitely build more on but if you’re just doing a once over of your body it works. I definitely have a little “tan line” from where I left my bracelet on and you can see the difference in the tan. I had a few streaks but only minor overall I say this works well Works nicely
