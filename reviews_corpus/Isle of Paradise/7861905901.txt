Color / stains , love the color . But unfortunately maybe I’m just not fully aware of self tanners but the first day there’s no odor but after tht there’s always a self tanner smell and slight stains on my bed sheet thank fully they fully came out but still rubbed off on my bed ://// color lingers/ rubbing off :/
