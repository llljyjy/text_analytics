This product met expectations. I’m asian and typically easily tan in the sun, but it’s nice to have this to even out those parts of the body that get less exposure (ahem, torso + upper legs). It smells quite nice and feels moisturizing. The tan is gradual, but make sure you’re pretty even with the application or it may leave streaks. Not orange-y at all, just a nice deep glow that looks like it’s within! Works on asian skin
