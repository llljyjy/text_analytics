This tanning lotion smelled very nice and made my skin feel moisturized. I know many people love when tanning products don’t have guard colors but as a tanning novice I think I need one. I made some areas streaky and orange (ankles).  I think this was more of a me issue and less of a product issue. The product dries down really quickly and didn’t feel sticky which was nice. Overall it’s probably a fine product for more experienced users. Best for more experienced users
