Was a little nervous to try this since there is no color guide and it’s an entirely clear formula, but I am obsessed! As long as you pay attention to where you are putting the product, it turns out looking natural and glowy and I didn’t have any streakiness. Also love that is doesn’t get on your sheets or clothes!! Has a fresh smell that isn’t super pungent, and doesn’t really have that “fake tan” after scent (not entirely odorless, though). Will be repurchasing this for sure. Glowy, natural color — and no streaks!
