The best gradual self tanner I have used in a while. I have used Isle Of Paradise tanning drops before but never their self tanning lotion. Big fan, you do need to make sure to rub the product into all the corners to avoid splotching or uneven product. But that goes for any self tanner. I use this daily to achieve a nice tan throughout the week. Great for fair skin and an easy glow
