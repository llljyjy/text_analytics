This self-tanning butter is truly divine. I have the Isle of Paradise drops and this product works so well to maintain my tan throughout the week in combination with using the drops each week. The smell is absolutely lovely and is the best smelling tanning product Iâ€™ve ever used. The lotion itself is super moisturizing while giving you that gorgeous glow. Totally recommend! Smells amazing and great glow!
