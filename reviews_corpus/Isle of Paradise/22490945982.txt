As one other review mentioned, it’s hard to avoid getting this all over your floor, which in turn stains the bottom of your feet. Though it takes quite a while to develop, the color looked great on day one. I wanted to see if it was buildable so I followed up with a second round the next day. This time applying in my shower to avoid getting my wood floors all slippery. The second time left my skin super dry and bordering on orange in some areas. My face faded much faster than the rest of my body. The tan was even and not streaky. A great value - I have the smaller size from the value pack and with two applications I haven’t even used 1/4 of the bottle.This product is okay. I didn’t have any issues with the smell. Overall I just prefer the drops because they are more moisturizing and buildable and I can use my own preferred moisturizer. Works, but prefer the drops
