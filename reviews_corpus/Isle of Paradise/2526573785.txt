I am a pale lady trying to change my ways without getting skin cancer/wrinkles. I have seen this product floating around the internet and finally decided to give it a try. I was a little worried that I would go from ghost to pumpkin overnight. Let me just say, I am amazed. I chose the Medium drops. I did a little research beforehand and ended up using 1 drop on my face, 2 on my upper body, and 3 on my legs. I shaved before and made sure to exfoliate well in the shower. It didn’t smell like much when I first put it on, but that famous self tanner smell did develop as time went by. I woke up the next morning and was astounded. No pumpkin in sight, just a beautiful, natural glow. I took a shower to get rid of the self tanner smell and was good to go! I will say I had minimal streaking by my wrists, but I think that was user error. Everywhere else is blended in nicely and looks very natural. Pretty solid for a newbie! I told all my friends about it and now I’m telling you! Converted Skeptic
