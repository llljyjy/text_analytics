Gifted by Isle of Paradise. I just love how innovative, clean, effective this brand is. I picked the light version as I’m pretty pale and mixed with my moisturizer, it gave my skin tone sun kissed tone, as I just came back from vacation. It didn’t cause any irritations and lasted for a few days, which I’m surprised, but can’t complain as I look better with it. Overall, it can be a life saving beauty product, especially in the summer, no need to put heavy make up, just a few drops of this tan and all imperfections are pretty much hidden. Much needed
