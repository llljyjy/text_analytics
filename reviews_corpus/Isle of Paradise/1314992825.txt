I was so excited to try the new Isle of Paradise Self Tanning Oil Mist in Dark! I was not disappointed and it’s so good and hydrating as well my skin felt so soft and hydrated for few days. This tanner lasts up to 7 days so that’s a weeks worth of a tan! How amazing is that! It is formulated with color correcting technology to even out your skin tone which made my skin look even better! It’s so easy to apply too, taking around 2 minutes to mist my body then just blend in and it isn’t sticky or anything it is very smooth and easy to blend during and after application. I love this product! The tan it gives you is so natural, beautiful and glowing! I look like I just got back from a weeks long vacation from the beach! It also has none of that tradition self tanner smell either so you don’t have to worry about that. Lastly I love that Isle of Paradise is a vegan and cruelty free brand so I feel good about using their products! I highly recommend and if you want a quick and easy just got back from the beach tan reach for this tanner!! I just got back from the beach tanner
