This tanning lotion will not stick to my skin. It leaves my legs very streaky and patchy. I tried it twice after I exfoliated and it would not absorb into my skin and when it did it was pretty orange and uneven. Would not recommend. Iâ€™ve used the St. Tropez foam tanners and they do a much better job of giving you an even natural looking tan. nan
