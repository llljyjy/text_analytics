I love how they arevegan/cruelty-free! After applying, my skin feels so hydrated!  I have medium color tanning oil and I am obsessed! It makes me feel like a whole new person after application. I am glowing and I feel like I’m truly shining without stickiness. It is so easy to apply! Be sure to exfoliate and moisturize dry areas before application. I shake it well and spray the mist until your skin is totally saturated. Be sure to do your hands and feet last, so you’re able to blend with your hand and immediately wash your hands after. The scent is not strong like some other self tanners I have used. I genuinely recommend this if you are looking for a glowing tan! Perfect glow!
