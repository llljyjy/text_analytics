Absolutely horrid. This is the worst self-tanner I’ve ever used. First, the bottle broke before I was even halfway done which resulted in the tanner being all over my bathroom and hands trying to get it out of the bottle which now that I’m looking at the reviews that seems to be a common problem. Second, the color is orange. Like, really orange. The product formula is also clear, which I won’t throw shade for because I get the point but just beware that it’s hard to know where you’ve put it which leaves streaks. Let me just say, I’ve used drug store self-tanners that have trumped this one. The fact that this is at Sephora for $32 is craziness. Horrid
