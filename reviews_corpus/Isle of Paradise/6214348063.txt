I bought this in hopes of evening out my tan lines from swimming but it made me look orange (I think because of my undertones and the fact that I already have a solid tan). I had to scrub my face to get the color off because it was so patchy and weird looking even though I followed the directions. 3 stars because I’m sure it would maybe look nicer on a different shade of person, and it didn’t smell strong which was nice. nan
