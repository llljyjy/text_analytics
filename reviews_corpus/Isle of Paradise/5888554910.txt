I purchased this product and it worked great so I repurchased. The second bottle I received stopped working properly after about half the use. At that point, I was past the return window so I decided to repurchase and try it again. The third bottle worked well at first, and then I didnâ€™t use it for a few weeks. I went to use it again and got halfway through my application and it stopped working. I have engagement photos to take tomorrow and half a tan. Pretty bummed out about this product because the tan itself is beautiful but the pump design is faulty. I attempted other pumps from similar products and had the same issue. Pump Stops Working
