I’ll give the product 2 stars simply because it does give a small glow, but nothing special compared to many other product of better quality and that smell better.I can’t stand the odor, it smells like....“ Old coffee you dropped on your car seat and didn’t completely clean kind of sour“ odor! I thought maybe I had an expired product, but no, it’s just what it’s smell like. And none of my creams could cover that smell up.If you can tolerate the smell and rather use drops to mix with your face cream for a small glow, go for it. But if you’re looking for a nice selling product that will give you that sun-tanned look, I’d pass on this one! Works ok but smells like old sour coffee!
