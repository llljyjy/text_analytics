This is my third product from Isle of Paradise. I have loved every product of theirs that I have tried! What I love about this  Self-Tanning Oil Mist is that the color lasts up to 3 days! The medium shade blends well with my skin tone, and the avocado oil leaves my skin feeling so soft! Love that the color lasts 3 days!
