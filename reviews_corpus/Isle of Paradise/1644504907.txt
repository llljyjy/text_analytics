Beautiful results (USE A TANNING MITT!!)! You don’t need much, maybe a few sprays per leg etc and thoroughly blend in with a tanning mitt (theirs is ok, st tropez makes a good mitt too). Colour lasts quite some time and I didn’t have any streaking, maybe just a bit of build up on my dry ankles (hint, moisturize before applying…). The smell as it develops is quite intense, wear long pants to bed (after letting your tan dry) to help minimize the odour transfer to your bedding. Shower the next morning to help the scent, but you will have that fake tan smell linger on you for a good day or so unfortunately. I would still recommend this as the results are quite nice. nan
