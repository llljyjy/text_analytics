I liked this a lot! I’ve tried a lot of tanners and really hate how they make my skin feel overnight. This one was much more palatable and didn’t leave me so sticky once it dried down. The color is natural and it lasted on my skin well with daily moisturizing (that’s key lol). Probably more suitable for experienced tanners because you do have to shake the bottle a lot to keep the oils evenly dispersed in the bottle. It’s easy to see where your skin looks shiny and that’s where the product is, but otherwise it can be tricky! I recommend. My skin looks great!! Good for experienced tanners
