Beautiful color and it does self adjust. It’s really the nicest color I’ve ever gotten from self tan I think (I used dark and i have light skin). But it’s hard to put on. It’s oily so it leaves oil spray everywhere even when you’re very careful with it. The bottle design is cool but it’s actually really stupid because you have to put it down on its side since there’s no flat bottom and then it rolls off the table which is just dumb. I have to go outside to use it. It does make your feet really dark and splotchy so don’t even spray them just use what’s on the mitt at the end to put it on your feet. Make sure to moisturize them. I did notice they usually get really orange even when I barely put any on, but it’s self adjusts so the first day you can’t really see what’s happening because it’s clear. The second day you have a nice tan but your feet are really orange. The third day in onward it’s a really nice town. If you have an event or something, have the event beyond day three. I prefer tinted self tanners but this one is nice because it doesn’t dry your skin out like all the other ones do so I’m torn. Nice product, wish it was less messy, wish the design of the bottle is better, and wish it was tinted. Really really nice color with cons
