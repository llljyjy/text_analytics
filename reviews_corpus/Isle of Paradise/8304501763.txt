Super easy to use, I’m a pale white girl so I only use like 2-3 drops in my moisturizer and I find it gives me a nice glow without looking orange. I use it before bed and don’t see any transferring either. It does have a fake tan smell after awhile tho so if you have to wear a mask just be ready to smell it for the whole day. I believe it’s buildable as well, just add more drops, but defs start lighter than you think just in case! super easy to use!
