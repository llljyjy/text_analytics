This is perfect for a light tan for fair skin (the pink “light” bottle). I add a few drops to my cerave moisturizer for my legs. You can build color by doing this daily or adding more drops for a darker result. If I need an instant tan add a little of your favorite liquid bronzer to the mix. I love that you can customize it to fit your needs.  Most self tanners are too dark for my fair skin. This one is perfect!! Perfect tanning drops for fair skin
