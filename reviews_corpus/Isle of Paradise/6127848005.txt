There is nothing gradual about this product.  I was light last night and woke up patchy Orange and brown pattern.   Mind you, I regularly exfoliate and followed the application instructions.   Returning immediately and I take my 28 showers to get rid of this color pattern of awfulness.    Advice, get some good sunscreen and get yourself a tan the good old fashion way.  Please note that I did purchase the correct tone, my skin tone is naturally olive and tan very easily. Buyer beware. Currently on Amazon right now ordering a tanning remover.  Oh boy!!!!!!!!!!! Nothing gradual about this product.
