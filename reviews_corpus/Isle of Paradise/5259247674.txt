Okay listen, if you’re new to self-tanning and afraid of streakiness/patchiness or looking orange like I was, this product will not fail you. BUT ONLY IF you use it properly! (keep in mind, I have light-medium brown skin, so if you have super fair skin or dark skin, I’m not sure how the Medium shade will show up on your skin). But this gives me the perfect natural glow within 6 hours. I’ve used it 10+ times already and experienced ZERO streakiness or patchiness. But that is because I am very diligent and careful when applying. Here are my tips:1) WEAR GLOVES (vinyl/latex gloves to protect your hands).2) MIX MIX MIX the drops in your moisturizer very well (i usually use 2-4 drops for my face).3) RUB IT IN well. When you think you have rubbed it in completely, RUB IT IN MORE.4) BLEND. If you are using it on your face, blend it down to your neck and/or chest, and consider using more moisturizer around where you stop application as a buffer to ensure there is a smooth transition. If you do these steps, I don’t see how this product could not work well, unless you have specific skin issues preventing it from looking good on your skin. Also, be mindful that you could be experiencing patchiness or reactions because of the products you apply UNDER the drops. I suggest using cleanser only before applying this, at least on the first use/application.Overall, I love these drops so far. MY ONLY, and I repeat, ONLY issue with it is that the tan doesn’t last very long. It could be because of the other products & exfoliants in my skin care routine, but the tan & glow I get is pretty much gone within 1-2 days. However, I honestly don’t consider it a dealbreaker because a little goes a long way and there is actually a great amount of product in the bottle for my face. Since I don’t use it that often, it will last me monthsss. I’m interested to see how the darker shade compares in terms of colour, so I’ll probably get that next! Use it properly, and you will LOVE it!
