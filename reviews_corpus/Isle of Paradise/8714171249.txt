These are the BEST. It’s just a DHT solution so you don’t get bronzer all over your clothes or bed. I mix mine with lotion after drying off from a shower and slather it all over. I get so many compliments! The dropper means you can customize your shade. I try use the same ratio of lotion pumps and drops to keep it even. I’m quite fair and the results I get with this look great. It’s not orange at all. I also have the water that I just on my face just so it’s not too intense. I would recommend using a plain fragrance free lotion to mix since the alcohols in fragrance lotions will negatively impact the reaction process for the DHT and you might end up a bit patchy!You get a bit of the DHT smell like you would from a tanning lotion but honestly I love it haha. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
