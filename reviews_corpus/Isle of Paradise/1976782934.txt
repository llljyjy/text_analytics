Love the isle of paradise products already, so I was excited to try the butter and it did not disappoint! It applied easily and my skin absorbed it like regular lotion. It has this really pretty blue sheen as the lotion, which unfortunately stuck to my black sports bra as I was removing it to tan my body. Otherwise it had a nice scent for application and left an even tan. Just beware if youâ€™re wearing darker clothing! Love it on my skin, not on my clothes
