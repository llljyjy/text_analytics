Works great and easy to use! Did not find it to be streaky or uneven at all (I did use the mitt). The colour is natural and doesn’t look like “fake tan” (for me anyway). I also tried it as a setting spray (per Jules Von Hep’s advice) and honestly I was VERY nervous that it may not work BUT you definitely can do it and it does look good without disturbing your makeup — so that was a nice surprise! If you want something quick and easy, the water is a great option for you! Quick and easy with beautiful results!
