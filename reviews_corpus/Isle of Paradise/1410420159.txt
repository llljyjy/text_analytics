Im an experienced self-tanner and love IoP’s drops and water but this oil is not doing it for me. Tan came out splotchy but luckily was so light, despite being dark color, that you could barely tell. Additionally I had to use the better part of a bottle to apply one coat, so definitely not cost effective either. I’ll stick with the drops and water. nan
