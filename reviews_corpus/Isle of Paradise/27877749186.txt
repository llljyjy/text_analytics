these tanning drops are really good, they don’t stain your hands if you wash them and aren’t streaky in the slightest bit when applied properly. i really wish these drops didn’t have coconut oil in the ingredients though. it makes the scent linger and it’s not a sweet coconut; it’s the kind you cook with. it’s not completely “scentless“, but it doesn’t necessarily stink. you smell like you just got out of the sun which is alright if you like that smell. pretty good but has a slight lingering scent
