They work pretty well as long as you’re careful with how evenly you spread your lotion. If not, you can end up with streaks. I’m impressed with how long the tan lasts, about a week for me, and I use only three drops. Unfortunately, they can be quite greasy, and in my case, these drops left me with really significant breakouts, meaning I can only really use it on my body:/ It does have that fake tan smell, but it isn’t overpowering. Definitely start with a few drops at first, because it fully develops after 24 hours and can give you that orange hue if too much is applied. I would probably only recommend this for people who don’t struggle with sensitive skin or breakouts, they just werent a 10/10 for me… they’re pretty okay
