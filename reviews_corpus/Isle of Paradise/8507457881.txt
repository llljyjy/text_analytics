I am honestly so torn on whether I will repurchase this product. The color is so natural, glowing and gorgeous. I got so many compliments while wearing it! But after about four days, the tan comes off in giant chunks - it does not fade evenly at all but instead leaves giant, random patches without product. I applied this two days in a row to get my perfect color, and it was easy to layer. I would suggest this product if you only need a self-tan for a few days and then plan to exfoliate it off before the product has a chance to start fading. nan
