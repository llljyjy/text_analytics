I’ll forever have a love/hate relationship with self-tanners. I found this looking better on my face than it did on the test trial on my arms/hands (fades abit orange) so if you’re like me who doesn’t let the sun sit on your face for too long and your face doesn’t exactly match your body then you’ll be good. Mind you this does have that horrendous self-tanner smell that I despise but it’s a price to pay for the look. Also, I have sensitive skin and thankfully this did not break me out Worth the glow
