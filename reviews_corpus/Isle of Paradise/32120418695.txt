I love self tanning and have tried like 20 self tanners and was so impressed with this one. Itâ€™s incredibly easy to apply, has a nice scent, and lasts long. A lot of tanners dry my skin out but this is rather hydrated due to the ingredients like hyaluronic acid though I still recommend applying lotion all over to help! I especially love that it lasts longer than most tanners. So easy to use and leaves you looking fab. nan
