It’s a great self tanner but not good for beginners because it’s intense. I also love how long lasting it is! The best one that I have tried on that category. It gives a very beautiful warm tanned that I am in love with. The spray is so gentle but you still need to blend it with a glove. It leaves a very hydrated skin and has a nice fragrance. Very long lasting
