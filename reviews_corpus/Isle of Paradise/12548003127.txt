I try so many self tanning products and I feel that this one is really unique. It goes on clear so you don’t have that “muddy” look if you need to go out while you have the tanner on. It does have a smell but not like a traditional self tanner. This smell is much more manageable. After about 5-10 minutes it completely sinks into the skin and doesn’t have a sticky texture. I would recommend trying this product! Easy to apply
