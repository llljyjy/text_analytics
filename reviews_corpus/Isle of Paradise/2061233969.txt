As soon as I unwrapped the plastic, I noticed there were strange particles inside, it looks like it’s old & I definitely saw a couple black dust particles, and what seems like a piece of white string. I don’t feel safe using this, and hugely disappointed in this brand. I’ve used this exact spray in the past and never had this issue, but seems like it’s happened to several other people recently as well. strange particles inside!
