Nope. Iâ€™ve used a fair bit of sunless tanner over the years and this is worse than drugstore tanners as far as orange tone and blotchiness. Not to mention that, as you try to rub it in, the gold shimmer (what, why?) in it clumps up on your skin. That seems to be a part of the blotchiness for me, so a bit irritating since this seems to be such a popular brand! That said, thinned out with regular lotion might make it work. Not worth it.
