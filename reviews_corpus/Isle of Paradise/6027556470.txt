I really like this I think it’s super easy to apply. With that being said because it’s a lotion I do think it’s easy for it to become streaky because you don’t remember exactly where you put it. I love the ease of using a lotion because I honestly have no patience for normal self tanners. It moisturizes my body while also tanning which I love! It gives the skin a really nice glow and is buildable overtime which is great since you don’t get as much payoff with this product as you would a normal self tanner. You definitely need to exfoliate before you use this just like any other self tanner. Would purchase again! Great for beginners!
