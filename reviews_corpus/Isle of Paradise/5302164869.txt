I am so in love with this new Isle of Paradise Self-Tanning Oil Mist! The application is the easiest out of every self tanner I have tried! All you do is mist your entire body down and rub it in with a tanning mitt and it dries in 5-10 minutes and your tan will appear within a few hours! It looks so natural and glowy as if you just got back from vacation! The formula smells so good and not like traditional tanners and it provides moisture for 24 hours and the tan lasts up to 7 days! This is definitely my new go-to! Super moisturizing!
