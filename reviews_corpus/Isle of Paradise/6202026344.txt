This is the face tanning spray I’ve been looking for! I’ve always hated applying faux tan in the winter because it dries my skin out so much. But because this is an oil, it helps to hydrate the skin! It doesn’t smell like transitional tanner either. The light version gives such a glowy, natural tan that is perfect if you have fair/light skin. I would repurchase this! nan
