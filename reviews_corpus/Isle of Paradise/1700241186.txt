Forgot to exfoliate beforehand so a little splotchy, but infinitely superior to trying to mix the drops with lotion. Idk why I have so much trouble but I do! The body butter fixes most of my issues with the drops. Slightly uneven but a nice fake tan. (NOT gradual other than in the sense it can keep getting darker the more often you apply - first application makes it medium, any additional applications just make it darker/splotchier) nan
