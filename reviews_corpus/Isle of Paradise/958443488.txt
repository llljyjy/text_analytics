I have tried this brand before and liked it so was excited about this one. I love the oil, it’s easy to use and I actually like that there’s no color guard. I noticed almost no smell, which we all know is the main drawback for tanners. The only issue is it does get darker in dry areas but it’s all about prep with exfoliation and moisture first. I also get spots on my pores, which seems to happen on my legs from almost every tanner I’ve used...no issues on other areas of body though. (Can see what I mean in pics) Overall, this is a pretty decent option for tanning if you want to try oil over the lotions or foams. Color is pretty natural too. nan
