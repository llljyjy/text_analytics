I received these complimentary from Isle of Paradise. These are your standard high quality tanning drops. As always, you can build up coverage by using more drops or using them more often. I love the option to mix into another skincare product because that really helps ensure even coverage.   These have the standard smell (unavoidable) but it doesn’t linger too long. I love uding these every few days in the summer, depending on how much I’m exfoliating. Speaking of exfoliating, they also fade pretty evenly. I do have some issues with it looking patchy on my neck over time but it’s not too obvious. Great tanning drops!
