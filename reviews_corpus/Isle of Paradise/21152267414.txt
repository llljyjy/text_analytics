I received the dark self tanning drops complimentary from Isle of Paradise for my real and honest opinion. I had heard amazing things about this product on social media prior to getting the opportunity to try it for myself. It’s very nice easy to use, just a few quick drops in your moisturizer, and that’s it! As soon as it’s applied, there’s an instant glow to the skin that just increases as time passes. I now see why this product has such high remarks. instant glow!
