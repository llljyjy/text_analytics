I’m pasty, and I love the golden glow these drops give my skin without making me look like I’ve used self-tanner. No tell-tale streaking or patchiness! I look healthy and like I go outside (I don’t.)

If you’re one step away from being a Cullen, these are the tanning drops for you. Strictly indoor girl looks like she goes outside
