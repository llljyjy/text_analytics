I’ve used a mousse self tanner in the past and my biggest issue was the mess / waiting for it to dry. I really enjoyed how this oil applied, however I did miss some spots since it’s hard to tell where you applied it. I moisturized before and my skin was left extra glowy with this product! Would be perfect for that SUMMER TIME tan. Would recommend to anyone looking to try out something knew! A learning curve for sure
