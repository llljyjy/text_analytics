As someone who is super pale I absolute love self tanning products, especially ones that are easy to use and this one is one of my favorites! I mainly use these on my face and love that they are mess free, easy to use, and don’t transfer onto clothing! They do have a slight scent to it, but it’s not overpowering or bad! I’d describe it as a light fresh cucumber scent! I also have the self-tanning body butter that I also love and use quite frequently for an all over subtle glow! I received these complimentary from Isle of Paradise and couldn’t recommend them more! nan
