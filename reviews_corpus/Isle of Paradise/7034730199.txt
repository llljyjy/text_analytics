Omg! I literally just applied In 10 minutes!No mess, no steaks, doesn’t smell weird! It’s as if I just misted myself and now I’m hydrated and glowy! I love it! The only thing I’m not a fan of it the packaging... when i opened the cap was off and it was everywhere. I hate that I have to turn it upside-down, it lightly leaks so I have to store upright in a container... but the tanner itself is amazing! The BEST self tanner I've tried!
