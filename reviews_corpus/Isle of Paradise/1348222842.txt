Isle of Paradise is my favorite self tanning brand because their products are mess free, donâ€™t make me orange, and leave my skin hydrated. This product is all of those same things but even more hydrating and I am obsessed with it. I leave for spring break this weekend and am using this to have a nice base tan (currently in MN so have not seen the sun for months). The product was so easy to use, I just sprayed it on using the bottle it came in and rubbed it in. It took 10 minutes to do my whole body. This is one of my favorite brands and this product was another hit. nan
