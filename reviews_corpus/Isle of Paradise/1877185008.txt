I already use the Isle of Paradise tanning drops on my body (with moisturizer), and I liked the idea of a facial spray that can be used after the last step of my evening skincare routine.  So I tried this and I do like it.It has a fragrance, but it’s not terrible or overpowering to me, and it wears off by the time I go to bed.It’s pretty subtle (I use about 3 sprays on my face and a couple on my neck), and I like that - not too orange or dark, just a nice glow.  Be sure to rub it in, as per the directions.There are some skincare ingredients like hyaluronic acid, and my skin likes this, which is a bonus! I like it
