Absolutely love! I was new to the self-tanning game, but this product is great. Post-shower, after I am towel dried, I simply spray a few sprays all over different parts of my body and simply rub in circles to ensure it is evenly spread. I can immediately get dressed for the day as this dries within minutes, with NO staining of towels, sheets, etc. Provides a very natural, light-glow as if I just spent a few days at the beach. It is easy to stack to make it darker by applying again a few days later! One fault is the smell though. It smells great when applying, but within a few hours smells similar to peanuts or chex-mix? Not a terrible scent, but enough to drive me to shower again the next morning. Great for beginners!
