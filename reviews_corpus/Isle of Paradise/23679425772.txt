I’m very particular about self tanners and this is a winner!! I’m very, very, very pale and a lot of self tanners come out orange on me and stain my bedsheets. This is amazing and doesn’t do those things. Exfoliation and hydration/moisturizing is very important. I exfoliate, apply a lotion, use a base self tanner (st tropez mousse), and about after a week when that starts to come off, I use this to extend my tan. Just don’t apply this over a sun burn! (Rookie mistake, I know.) Once the burn healed, it took the tan with it. And also make sure it is evenly distributed otherwise it may turn streaky. It may stain clothes when it’s not dry but it’s fairly easy to wash off. It only takes a few minutes to dry which is nice. The amount of product you get is the best of all the options I saw. Love it Love it
