So, I’m not the type to write reviews, but I would like to highly advise that this isn’t the best self tan out here. I got the sample size and applied as directed. The next morning, my skin was patchy, and overly orange. I assume this is because there is only one tone of the tan product. Overall, I am very disappointed. nan
