Guess who has a new fave self tanner?! I love how easy the Isle of Paradise self tanning oil most is use and the fact that it doesnâ€™t have any orange tones is an extra bonus. It smells very light and fresh, nothing like a typical self tanner. Very well thought out product and the light shade is perfect for a sunkissed look on my very fair skin. An absolute instant fave
