Who is ready for spring and summer? One way for me to get ready is with this Isle of Paradise Medium self-tanning oil mist. It smells nice, like a fresh ocean breeze, not the typical self-tanner smell. A bi-phase solution that needs to be shaken well before misting on exfoliated skin. Has color correcting actives to even out skin tone.Feels a little tacky as it dries, but it’s not too bad and takes a few hours for the color to develop, but a very nice tan is achieved with just one application. Skin felt hydrated, and not dry. I love that this is easy to apply and doesn’t leave a streaky orangey look. This product is vegan and cruelty free. nan
