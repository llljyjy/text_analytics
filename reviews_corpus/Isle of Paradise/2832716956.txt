In terms of sunless tanner, this kinda misses the mark for me. My biggest issue with these drops are they are clear, and the tan takes several hours to develop. So, you have no idea if you have spread the lotion completely evenly, or if it is too heavy in some areas until it is too late. I was very mindful to really make sure I spread my lotion evenly, but still somehow the tan was uneven. And don’t get me started on what my feet look like, ha! Also, once this settles on your skin, there 100% IS a fake tanning smell.  I won’t be buying this again and will stick with my Coco and Eve. Not worth it
