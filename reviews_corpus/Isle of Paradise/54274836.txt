I received the Self-tanning drops gifted by Isle of Paradise and love them. I have been using the medium for my light skin tone and they give my skin a pleasant, sun-kissed appearance. I like that I can easily change how deep of a tan it provides by simply adding more drops. I simply mix into a moisturizer (particularly since I have somewhat dry skin) and I’m all set! I haven’t experienced any irritation or breakouts while using. Highly recommend for anyone. nan
