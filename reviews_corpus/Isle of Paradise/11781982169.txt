I love the isle of paradise glow clear tan mousse and wanted to try out the express ultra dark mousse for a quicker option. I am relatively pale so I was hoping this would give me a dark tan. This is very transferrable when you have it on. It rubbed off and left a mark on anything that touched my skin. After having it on for over 2 hours I rinsed it off in the shower and I felt like all of the color rinsed off! I got out of the shower and could barely notice any color left! Iâ€™ll be returning it and sticking with the clear mousse from now on. Disappointing for an isle of paradise product
