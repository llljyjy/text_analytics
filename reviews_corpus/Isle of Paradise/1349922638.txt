Annoying bottle that only stands upright when the cap is on & you can’t spray it upside down. You also need to shake it constantly to keep the oil mix right. It smells great, but the color is far from from a medium. I’m very fair (mufe shade r230) and this tanner is maybe 3 shades darker than my usual skin tone after 8 hours. I sprayed it on heavily enough to coat my skin but not drip off then I used the mitt to buff it in. It’s a nice shade, but again just nowhere close to a medium tan. It’s also really really sticky. Since it’s not on the bottle, leave it on for 6-8 hours before a shower, and avoid chlorinated water which will strip it right off. Next time I’d skip this, st tropez express mousse is far easier and faster. Skip it
