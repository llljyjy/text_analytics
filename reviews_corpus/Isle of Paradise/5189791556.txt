I’m not a fan of self-tanners, lord knows I’ve tried SO MANY (spray tans included) and I can never land on one that doesn’t make me look like I’ve dipped myself in a bag of Doritos or has that lingering self-tanner smell that I immediately want to wash off. This one is no exception TBH. However, the application is pretty easy, the result revealed nice, bronzed tan and far less orange than others. It is still slightly patchy but probably by my fault of not having exfoliated right before. I would probably buy this one over most others but I can’t say it’s a love… still searching … Nice bronze tan
