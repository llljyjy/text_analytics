Ok wow. I genuinely did not have many high hopes for this product, because it was clear on my skin. BUT WOW. I just did a test patch, but I will use it frequently. It was so so easy to apply & I’m pretty sure the more you apply, the darker it will get. The smell isn’t my favorite, but it is different than the self-tan smell if you don’t like this. I like this better than the tan with a glove that I have to rinse off in the shower. nan
