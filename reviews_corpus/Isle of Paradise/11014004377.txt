This is the only self tanner I will use for my face. I have sensitive skin and this is the only one that doesn’t break me out. I’ve used the medium and deep at this point and I think I’ll stick with deep solely because it will go further because I don’t have to add as many drops. Packaging is cute and the scent is light in my opinion plus I don’t have to rinse off after so many hours like normal self tanners. This was gifted by isle of paradise but it’s honestly the only one I’ll buy simply because it’s incredibly easy to use and can go with any moisturizer I own. nan
