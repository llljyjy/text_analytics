I bought this product in the kit that comes with the mist and mitt. I’ve used this product for over a month now and can’t seem to love it. I’ve tried tweaking the amount of drops and used different moisturizers and nothing works. It’s super splotchy and not “natural and glowy” like some claim. It always comes out splotchy even though I exfoliate and prep and apply evenly. The tanning water mist is 10/10 though! Not it.
