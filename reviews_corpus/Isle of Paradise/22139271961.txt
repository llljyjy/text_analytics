Strong typical self tanning smell, that lingers. After reading reviews I exfoliated, shaved and applied - wearing latex gloves. It went on like butter for sure! So far I canâ€™t see any streaks, the colour is subtle. I plan on showering tomorrow and reapplying for a bit more colour. Has colour corrected my skin tone for sure. I did notice it looked like a green colour correction lotion while applying. Strongly scented like self tanner
