I really like these Isle of Paradise Self-Tanning Drops in medium. I used about 12 drops mixed with my body lotion on each side of my side. They give me a beautiful, bronze glow in about 4 hours. I didn’t have problems with streaking either. I did apply these after I showered, shaved, and dried completely.  I didn’t notice a strong odor with these like you get with some self-tanners. I’m definitely going to continue using these. I was gifted by Isle of Paradise in exchange for my honest review. Great Self-tanner
