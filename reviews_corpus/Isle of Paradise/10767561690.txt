Love this product! The onky issue I had is that it did cause my skin to break out a bit on my face, but I have sensitive skin and was prepared for that result. The tan looks amazing and fades out very naturally, no patchiness or streaking! I have very fair skin and bought the darkest drops hoping I would be able to achieve a natural tan with fewer drops, but it did make me look a little orange. Definitely purchase the bottle intended for your skin tone! nan
