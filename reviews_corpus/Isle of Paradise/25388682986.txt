This tanning mist is so easy to use, blends easily, and did not leave any streaks or orange color on my skin. I really like the mist application as I feel like itâ€™s very easy to cover large parts of my body quickly. I just used my hand to rub it in, then washed my palms with soap after application. I really like the nice golden tan look it gave my skin and I highly recommend it! nan
