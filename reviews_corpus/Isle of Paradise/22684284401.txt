I love this self tanner! I put two drops in my morning moisturizer and a nice glow develops as the day goes on. It smells *ok* - I have had other self-tanners that smell way worse. It goes on super even when mixed in with my lotion. I wash hands immediately and they don’t turn orange. The glow looks pretty natural in the summer or winter months. It’s lasted a long time too so worth the $ IMO! This is a staple!
