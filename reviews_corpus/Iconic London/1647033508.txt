I really had high hopes for this product. I bought this in the original and the buff brush. I followed the instructions step by step . Misted it on face , neck and arms and buff it out with the brush . I was deeply disappointed when the color developed after a few hours. Super Orange ! And yes it smells just like fake tan. The smell still lingers the next day. When I washed my face this morning my white towel got stained. I spent over $54 for the tanning mist and brush just look orange ! The only difference is you get hyaluronic acid , vitamins, glitter and fancy packaging from other products on the market. ORANGE!
