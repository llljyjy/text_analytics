Ok I was not into this at first in fact I considered not using and returning because I didn’t know it had glitter in it. BUT I applied this by spraying onto skin and rubbing in with a mitt- after 3 hours I saw a slight glow, but I left it on for about 12 hours (all day) and ended up with a BEAUTIFUL medium glow, it’s incredibly natural and has worn beautifully. Cons: one application for my entire body used about a third of the bottle. I was very sticky and wet for probably 20-30 minutes afterwards. It’s a little hard to spray and tricky apply It’s expensive Pros:It’s beautiful It did not transfer to my clothes or sheets It’s wears beautifully (day 4 and my hands even look good) It smells good (not as strong as other dha)I’d recommend it but I’m not over the moon. nan
