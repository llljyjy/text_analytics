I am a fan of Iconic products so my husband gave me this product as a gift along with the tanning mist (original). I have never used a self tanner before because people used to say that it would leave spots, that it would leave orange skin... but this product is a great choice because it leaves your skin natural and the smell is amazing. I applied the tan directly onto the brush before blending into the skin and it looks great. Love this Brush
