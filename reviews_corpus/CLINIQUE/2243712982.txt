Honestly really impressed. It’s a gel-like base and a little bit of product goes a long way. Given that you really only need a pea sized amount (maybe 2) to cover your face using skincare products I’m impressed with the distance that I think I could make this one go. It’s unscented and is ultra smooth. Feels great on the skin and definitely makes me feel hydrated both morning and night. Really Impressed!
