I’m not sure how this product gets such good reviews. I expected much better from this brand. It’s no better than something I could pick up at the drugstore for half the price. I had better luck with CeraVe. First of all, this smells terrible. It’s supposed to be scentless but it smells like horrible chemicals. Second, it’s a small bottle for the price. And I have to use at least 5-6 pumps to get any effect whatsoever which means this bottle isn’t going to last long. Especially compared to Kiehls, which yes, is expensive, but in comparison I can used a pea-sized amount and it’s more effective than 6 pumps of this lotion. I’ve been using this every day for two weeks and my skin is still dry. On the plus side, it hasn’t caused breakouts for me like some of the other reviewers. But I won’t be purchasing this again. Going back to Kiehls. Expected better from Clinique
