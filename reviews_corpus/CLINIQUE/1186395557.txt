I’ve tried a few peptide creams over the years and this was all right. Good but not great. Where I think it falls down is how log the hydration lasts. My skin feels great initially, but it loses that feeling quickly. I can’t speak to the anti angling benefits of peptides, as the sample was too small for that, but I certainly didn’t see any detrimental effects to my skin and it did feel nicely bouncy after application, but again, it didn’t last on my skin. Okay but but great
