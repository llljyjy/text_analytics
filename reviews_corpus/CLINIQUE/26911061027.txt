I like this product. I received it as a sample and I was excited to try it. I have a dry but oily forehead and my nose area gets dry. This product goes on nicely, it isn’t greasy or too thick. There isn’t much of a smell which I like. This product has not irritated my skin. It feels nice when applied and soaks into your skin nicely. I would recommend this product for someone with dry skin who doesn’t want a greasy cream. nan
