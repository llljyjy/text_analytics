Got this from #topboxcircle as a #freeproduct to sample. I have combination-dry skin that can be sensitive and liked how the product has a faint pleasant smell, but is not overpowering and perfumy. The cream texture is not heavy/ greasy nor liquidy, so I have used it before bedtime and under makeup during the day with no issues. It does not pill under make up, but I appreciate how it makes my neck and forehead look and feel firm and smooth. I would try the full-sized product to see its effects for the long term.
