I had the opportunity to try Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It felt very good against the skin, went on very smoothly, and was really hydrating.  My skin type has changed from oily to more dry as Iâ€™ve gotten older. I like that when I wake up, my skin feels more moisturizing than it was before I started using this product. I would recommend. nan
