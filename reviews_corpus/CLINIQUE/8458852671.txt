I was sent this product for free for review and honestly I really enjoyed it. The consistency is a bit watery and not what I had expected but it was definitely moisturizing! I’m overall super dry and flaky and I didn’t feel like it gave me enough moisture for the winter but for the summer it’s a perfect everyday cream! nan
