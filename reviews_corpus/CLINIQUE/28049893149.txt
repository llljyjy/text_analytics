I used this product for a solid month because I wanted to make sure it worked. I applied it after my morning cleansing right after I wake up and found that it did depuff your eye area in about a minute. I truly believe in moisturizing and with age showing in your eyes first, it’s extremely important to take care of that area. I found that it did reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles. Did it make my eye area feel stronger and more resilient? Not that I could note, but it did hydrate and smooth that area. Definitely love the whipped texture and I would most likely personally  purchase this eye cream in the future based on the results I got. And there’s a lot of eye creams that promise the same results. I’m glad I can stop searching now that I have found that product that works for me. Works for me!
