I received this as a sample from Influenster and I’m so thankful I did! It is a mini size (5ml) but it gave me just enough to test it out for a few days. The moisturizer goes on so nicely and doesn’t feel greasy at all. I always get upset when I use moisturizer and then sweat as most products feel heavy - this product is nothing like that! It’s light and fragrance free. It helped keep my face moisturized and smooth all day. If I hadn’t already found my dream product I would 100% be purchasing more of the Moisture Surge! Amazing Moisturizer Choice!
