After having had an opportunity to sample Clinique’s Smart Clinical Repair ’ Wrinkle Correcting Serum’ on behalf of Topbox, I can say that I enjoyed the products rich texture and its lack of odor.  Although it may have been due to the very small packet, I cannot say that I saw a difference in terms of my fine lines.  But I may be interested to try out a more regular size.
