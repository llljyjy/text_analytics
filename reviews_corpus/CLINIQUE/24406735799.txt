I received Take The Day Off Charcoal Cleansing Balm by Clinique for free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. There was no odor at all which was nice. It didnâ€™t take off all my eye makeup but it did loosen my makeup up and I am currently using this product to double cleanse. My skin felt very soft after using this balm. Nice!
