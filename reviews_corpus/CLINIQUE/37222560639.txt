I was very excited to try this as part of my complimentary sample . However I wasn’t super impressed , I felt like it just coated my face but didn’t actually absorb into my skin , I wanted to love it but it just wasn’t for me , the sample was very small so maybe I just didn’t give it enough time Not for me
