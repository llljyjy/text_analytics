I have been using this eye cream for a couple weeks now and I really like the whipped consistency and how it glides on very smoothly and isn’t very heavy or greasy. I have noticed my eyes being brighter, less puffy, & more hydrated after using it. I have not noticed a major difference in correcting fine lines but hopefully it’s reducing any future ones from coming. Overall it’s a good eye cream that I would recommend Eye spy a good eye cream
