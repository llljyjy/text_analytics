I was given an sample size of product for my honest review..... I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful when I use Retinol; this didn’t irritate my skin or gave me any redness. I like that this product isn’t sticky or have a strong scent. I only used this product at night and it worked well with my other nighttime products that I used. I didn’t really see any results cuz my sample didn’t last too long but perhaps if I used this longer I might have. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct nan
