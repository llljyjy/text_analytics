I absolutely love this moisturizer! I have combination skin that is generally extremely oily with dry areas, plus I have rosacea. I also have an autoimmune disease that causes my face to break out in rashes frequently, so my skin is very sensitive. I’m incredibly particular about the skincare products that I use. Clinique Smart Clinical Repair was a delightful surprise. It’s rare that I find a moisturizer that is so perfect for all of my skin’s needs. This moisturizer is very lightweight, yet it feels rich and luxurious. It almost has the feel of a water cream. I would compare it to Tatcha Water Cream, which is one of my favorites. It’s unscented, which I truly appreciate since I’m so sensitive, and it glides on smoothly over my skin and soaks in completely, without leaving any greasy or tacky residue behind. It’s so light and refreshing, but it definitely does its job, and it’s so soothing on my skin when I’m flaring. It also works beautifully on its own or under makeup. I received a complimentary sample to try in exchange for an honest review, and I will say that the sample jar was rather small, so I can’t judge how this moisturizer would preform long term. I’m 48, so I need all the help I can get, and I will definitely purchase this! Excellent moisturizer for sensitive skin!
