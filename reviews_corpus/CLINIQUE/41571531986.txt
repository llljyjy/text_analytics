I was given the opportunity to try this product in exchange for an honest review.  I like how the cream supports natural collagen for a visibly stronger skin.  Anyone that has oily, dry, combination or normal skin can use it.  The potent retinoid helps to support natural cell renewal to shed dull surface skin.  Your skin is left hydrated with hyaluronic acid with less visible wrinkles.  I used the serum in the morning and then again before bed.  I put a little bit on my fingertips and smoothed it all over my face and neck.  The sample I received was very small, so I’m not sure about it’s effectiveness over a longer period of time.  I combined this with the other wrinkle repair samples I was given for my daily routine.  The serum was light and not greasy and had a nice light scent.  All of the sample products I was able to try felt very luxurious.  Would love to try a bigger sample for all of them.   #freeproduct  #topboxcircle A Must Have!
