I received a tiny packet of this serum as a #freeproduct to #trywithTopbox, so I cannot say anything on long term effects, as it was barely single use. I found it to be smooth, with no fragrance. Was not very hydrating. I like a good retinol and Hyaluronic Acid is always my favourite, but could feel nicer on the skin. nan
