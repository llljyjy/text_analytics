I received the #freeproduct for review from topbox circle. The serum is very similar to most wrinkly correcting serums i have tried. It spread nicely and absorbs quickly. The initial application was OK but i developed significant redness about 20-minutes after application. I have rosacea which makes me sensitive to retinol but usually i can tolerate small amounts in a product. I couldnâ€™t figure out how much was in this product. I received a small sample sachet so i am unable to comment further since results are based on using for 16-weeks. Be careful if you're retinol sensitive
