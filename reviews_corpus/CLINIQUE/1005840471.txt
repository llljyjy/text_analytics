Free sample lasted 3 days with using it only in the morning with the eye/face cream from the same line. This serum was pretty gentle as I sometimes have reaction to Retinol products even if only a little is in product. Serum was light not heavy, skin was soft & smooth. Canâ€™t say if it worked on wrinkle correcting as you need more time to try the product out. nan
