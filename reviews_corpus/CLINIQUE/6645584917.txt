I received this product for my honest review. The cream has a nice, light, refreshing scent. A little goes a long way so a small amount will do. The cream made my face feel so moisturized, but didn’t leave it feeling greasy at all which was great compared to other products. I’ve noticed a slight change in my skins overall appearance but only very subtle difference in fine lines/wrinkles in the 2 weeks Ive used the product. Perhaps with longer use I will notice a bigger difference. Nice Moisturizer
