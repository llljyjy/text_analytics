I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review from Influenster and Clinique. I was really impressed with how well this Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream worked. I noticed visible results within the first week to ten days. The cream has a good consistency and absorbs well when applied. I did not feel like it was sticky at all and left my skin feeling well moisturized. I feel that the packaging of the product was pleasing as well. I felt that the cream helped reduce my fine lines around my eyes. I would recommend this to others. It is a great addition to my skincare routine and I will be purchasing this product! Excellent Eye Cream!
