the perfect sunscreen. listen, if you have skin of color, mineral sunscreen is always better than chemical since chemical can cause thermal interactions on your skin that lead to hyperpigmentation ( thanks dr V!). however most mineral sunscreen leave a terrible white cast. The only SPF 50 one that i found that didnt do that is the Murad one ($90). UNTIL I FOUND THIS ONE. honestly it feels like a better packaged dupe of the Murad. Muradâ€™s packaging is terrible and annoying to apply. this one is just perfect. If you have skin of color do yourself a favor and buy this. nan
