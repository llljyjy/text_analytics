I received a sample size of this product free from Clinique and Influenster in exchange for me honest review. I used this product daily as directed for about 3 weeks, I would have used it longer before reviewing, but it was only a sample size. The product was very nice and light and it had a clean, gentle smell. It went on easily and provided a fair amount of moisture. I noticed some, small reduction in the fine lines around mr eyes but it was not very much of a difference. Itâ€™s a Decent Product
