I got this sample free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have combination skin and it’s slightly sensitive. It’s hard for me to give my usual detailed review because it was a small sample. I noticed that it’s great in quality I find the mixture not to thick and not to thin. My skin didn’t have a reaction to it like it does with some of the other products so I think it’s fair to say it’s safe to use if you have sensitive skin. I feel like my skin is a bit more hydrated after using the product. I would recommend others to at least give it a try to see if it makes a difference in your skin but I’m not sure if I’m going to be purchasing this in the future. In the middle
