I received a complimentary sample of this cream from #Clinique and #Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The texture is soft and silken and the consistency is very thick and rich. I used it in the mornings after cleansing my face and neck under makeup and sunscreen. Each night I used it after again cleansing - I skipped my regular serum and eye cream as I needed to see *this* product was affecting my skin either good or bad. As it was a very small sample I was not able to evaluate whether this Wrinkle Correcting Cream did indeed smooth out wrinkles over more than a week of twice daily application. I did enjoy the plumping the hyaluronic acid provides which made me look less tired and more radiant. My skin stayed hydrated til morning and under makeup - its also a nice primer. I’d have liked to continue with a larger sample to evaluate Clinique’s other claims but I was generally pleased with my results. So Far, So Good…
