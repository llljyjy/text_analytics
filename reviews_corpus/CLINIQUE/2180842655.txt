I really enjoyed trying Clinique Smart Clinical Repairâ„¢ Wrinkle Correcting Cream - it definitely helped hydrate my dry skin, but was not greasy at all. I noticed a difference in the smoothness of my skin, & diminished my fine lines around my eyes & on my forehead. Will absolutely purchase in the future! Hydrates Skin, But Not Greasy
