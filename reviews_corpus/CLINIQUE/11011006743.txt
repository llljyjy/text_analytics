If you’re looking for a one step cleanser this is NOT it. Yes, it ’removes’ waterproof mascara, but it just smears it across your face, and needs to be followed up with an oil removing cleanser or wiped off. I will keep things simple and go back to using a one step, more powerful make up remover. Not for me! Can't be used alone
