I received this #freeproduct from @topbox so I can give evaluate it. Supposedly, it reduces wrinkles, brown spots, and dryness, however, it’s a very small sample and I could only get 2 uses from it.  I can say that I loved how this serum glided on and how it sinked in pretty quickly. It’s costly, if you can take aging in control, why not! Outsmarting wrinkles is possible!
