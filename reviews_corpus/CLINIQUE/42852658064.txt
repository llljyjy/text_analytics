I received a small sample of the Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum as a #freeproduct from Topbox Circle. This serum was not sticky and absorbed very quickly into my skin. It instantly made my skin feel much more hydrated, and helped my skin look much brighter. I have very sensitive and reactive skin, and this product did not cause a skin breakout, which is very rare for me when I try a new product. The sample was a small 3 day sample, so unfortunately not long enough to really see much improvement in the wrinkles on my face, but it was promising enough that I would consider buying it to try it for a longer period. Great product!
