I received this #freeproduct from TopBox in exchange for my honest review. Serums aren’t really a part of my usual skincare routine, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. I used it before bedtime, instead of my usual moisturizer step. I found the serum very easy to apply, with a little going a long way. It absorbed quickly without any sticky feeling, and left my skin looking and feeling hydrated and well cared for! First time trying a serum!
