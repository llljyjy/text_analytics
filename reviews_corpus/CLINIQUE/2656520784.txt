I like that this is a physical sunscreen with good broad spectrum protection from both titanium and zinc that rubs in easily and does not leave a white cast (at least on my Asian skin tone). However I have no idea how this manages to look so glowy while drying the crap out of my skin. I literally have skin flaking around my mouth by the middle of the day when I use this. I do have normal to dry skin from years of tretinoin use but I definitely do not flake like this with other sunscreens. greasy AND drying
