I’ve tried alot of moisturizers before but I would end up coming back to this one. My skin is very dry and stubborn so finding a good moisturizer is pretty hard for me. I usually put this on before I sleep and my face the next morning feels pretty nice and soft. I only reapply when I know I’m going to wear makeup or if my face is on the drier side that day. I honestly recommend this product for people with dry skin cuz it is on the richer side of a moisturizer. The only things cons are that it’s pretty expensive imo and the smell (it’s doesn’t have any fragrances btw but the smell does take some getting use to). nan
