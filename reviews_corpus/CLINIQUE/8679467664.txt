I received this as a sample size to test out from Topbox in exchange for my honest opinion. Once again, I liked the texture, it is moisturizing and lovely. However, the sample is so small I cannot tell you if it is any more special than other serums out there. I was only able to test out a sample for a one time use thus recommending it at this stage would not be as helpful as if I had more product to try for a longer period of time. Lovely, but use for a while for best results
