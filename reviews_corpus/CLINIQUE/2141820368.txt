I had received a sample of this product and I was sceptical to try it because I have used Clinique in the past and it didnâ€™t really work for me. After trying this product I really liked it. The texture of the cream was thick but soft. It left my skin feeling refreshed, hydrated and supple. Since only using the sample it was not long enough to see results but in the short time of using this product, I did see a slight change in my skin. I would like to purchase the full size and give this product a fair chance because I did like it and loved how my skin felt. A definite must try!
