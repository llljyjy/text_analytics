I like the consistency of the product - it’s somewhere between a gel and a cream and it feels really soothing to the skin. It doesn’t provide enough hydration for my skin during cold weather, but I think it would work better for me in warmer weather! Overall, I don’t love it, but it’s not the worst! nan
