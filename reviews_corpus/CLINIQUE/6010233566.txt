I was given the opportunity to try this product courtesy of Topbox for my honest review and opinion.  I applied Clinique Smart Clinical Repair wrinkle correcting serum on my face and neck and it was absorbed quickly into my skin and left it feeling very refreshed.  This product contains no Sulfates, and you  must remember to limit your sun exposure while using this product and also for the week afterwards.  It was a very small sample so Iâ€™m not sure how effective it will be.#freeproduct Feels really great on my skin
