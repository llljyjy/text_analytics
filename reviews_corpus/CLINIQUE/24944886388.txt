I received this product from Topbox Circle to give my honest reviews. I applied this serum after my toner. I like its smell and texture. After applying in my face for 5 days, my skin gets brighter and softer. My skin is getting hydrated, so I would recommend it for winter skin care routine if you live in NA with winter. I would like to buy the full size in order to test “wrinkle correcting“ function. Highly recommended for your skin-care rountine
