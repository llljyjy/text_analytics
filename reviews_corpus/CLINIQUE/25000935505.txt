I received this in exchange for my honest opinion. First the pros... It feels great, it is also very moisturizing. My skin didn’t feel sticky or dry. I also thought it had a pleasant smell. Sometimes these creams are to much. Now the cons after using this for the last month I don’t see any difference. I don’t have many wrinkles but the few I do have, haven’t changed. I don’t think I will keep using it. Felt good but I see no change
