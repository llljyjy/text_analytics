Thank you so much Topbox Circle for letting me test this new Clinique Skincare product for FREE in exchange for my honest review. I received three Clinique samples, including a 1 ml sample of Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum to try. I used this new serum on my face for two days, applying it both day and night. It absorbed quickly into my skin. The texture of this creamy serum is silky, not sticky feeling. It is fragrance-free.Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum promises to help visibly repair, replump and resurface your skin with its new “CL1870 Laser Focus Complex”, Retinoid, and Hyaluronic Acid formula. It is suitable for All Skin Tones and All Skin Types. I found this serum to be rather gentle, and it did not irritate my sensitive skin. It claims to be “as effective as one laser treatment” after 16 weeks of using this product. After using this serum my skin felt hydrated, soft and smooth. I applied Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream to my face after using this serum. It is recommended you apply an SPF sunscreen during the day while using this potent retinol-based product. I recommend Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum to anyone looking for a hydrating serum that helps plumps fine lines.#trywithtopbox #freeproduct #CliniqueSmartClinicalRepair #topboxcircle #topbox #Clinique #Sephora Smart Plumping Serum
