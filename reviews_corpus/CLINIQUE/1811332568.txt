To start with I have extremely dry skin and was excited to receive this product for free in exchange of honest review since I’m always up for a good moisturizer. To summarize, the texture felt similar to the Laneige water mask but the effect was not as long lasting. I did not like how it didn’t get absorbed into my skin. Although my skin temporarily felt moisturized it was only for a short period of time. I would not recommend it to others and definitely wouldn’t buy it in the future. The Clinique Moisturizing lotion in the yellow bottle is a much better product than this and I highly recommend that one over this. Meh! Nothing exciting.
