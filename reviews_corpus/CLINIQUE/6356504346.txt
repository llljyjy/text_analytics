Received the sample from Influenster, I’ve been using it at night the cream is pretty smooth on the skin which I do like and it’s not greasy.

Would I buy it if it was a bigger size and I did notice the cream worked I would buy it. But a sample size of cream that will not give me the full results not sure. Sample size
