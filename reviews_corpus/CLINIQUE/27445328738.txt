I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox for my honest review. I only received a sample so was not able to use it long enough to see any real results regarding smoothing of wrinkles and fine lines. I must say I did find my skin felt softer and smoother! I love the fact that it is fragrance free and has hyaluronic acid and retinol. It didn’t irritate my skin and a little goes a long way! Application went on smooth and didn’t leave my skin feeling tight or irritated. Not bad!
