I received a small sachet sample of this product in exchange for my honest review #trywithtopbox #freeproduct as part of a 3 product line. It was a small sample so I was only able to use the serum twice. I really liked the serum and found  that it made my skin look and feel refreshed.  It is lightly scented and is not too heavy on your skin. I will definitely purchase in the future Works great
