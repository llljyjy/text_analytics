In my honest review, I didnâ€™t have a chance to try this product with complete satisfaction since I received this CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum as a sample-sized product from TOPBOX CIRCLE #freeproduct However, it applies smoothly, very well nourish right into your skin without leaving you feeling sticky, absorbs quickly, and leaves your skin feeling smooth. I wish I had been sent a full-sized product to try but getting a full-size product for sure. Overall, I am happy with this serum. #trywithtopbox Must try!
