I got the opportunity to try from influenster, I have tried for about 3 days and it has a cooking effect which I like but it did not hydrate my skin as much as I would like . It has a nice texture and it’s comfortable in the skin, in my opinion it’s okay but nothing above and beyond . not too hydrating for my dry skin
