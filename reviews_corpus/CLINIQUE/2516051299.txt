I received this sample from Influenster and have been using it for about 2 weeks. Itâ€™s very creamy and hydrating. I use it morning under my makeup and I find my concealer goes on much smoother. I have been using it in conjunction with my current skincare and it works in very well. I feel the full sized jar is very reasonably priced in comparison to other eye creams. Nice everyday eye cream
