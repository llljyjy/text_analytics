This eye cream is top notch. It didnâ€™t cause any irritation around my eye (my skin is so sensitive). I saw results immediately! It was almost magical how quickly it started working. And it actually look like it helped my dark circles too! Texture is so nice and cream feeling. This is definitely worth buying! Best Eye Cream I've Used
