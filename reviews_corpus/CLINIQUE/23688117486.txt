I received a sample of this with #trywithtopbox.  While the sample was too small to see results after 2 days, I am still super impressed with this serum.  It had no scent, which is awesome as I react to scents.  the texture was thick and creamy and was absorbed instantly.  It left a pleasant tingling feelingS. I would definatpurchase this. Velvet skin!
