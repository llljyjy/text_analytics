I received a small sample from topbox for free in exchange for a review. The sample size makes it hard to judge how it will be long term. It felt smooth and not sticky which is great in a serum. I noticed a slight change in my forehead but itâ€™s hard to say for sure. I would recommend people to try it based on the way it feels when being applied. Goes on great.
