I loved the lightweight moisture that this product had. It does not feel too thick or cakey when applied and was more of a gel-like texture. I did find my skin glowey still a few hours later which was a nice surprise. My skin can be quite dry feeling and even though it didnâ€™t necessarily feel super hydrated the way that some moisturizers do, it definitely looked hydrated. Overall, I enjoyed the product and will likely continue using it as a summer moisturizer. Great summer moisturizer
