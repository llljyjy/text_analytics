I got the Clinique smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting serum sample for free to try and share a honest review. I used it in the night as the packet instructed to use sunscreen and avoid sun while using this. I saw instant plumping effect where skin felt hydrated and supple. The sample was enough for one time use so cannot comment on the long term effect of the product as I usually use product for two weeks before reviewing it. Overall as a Clinique product it was gentle and absorbed well and felt good for dry skin with wrinkles or lines. Clinique smart clinical repair - plumping !!
