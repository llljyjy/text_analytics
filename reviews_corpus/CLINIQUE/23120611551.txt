This moisturizer has potential to become my holy grail. It is nourishing, hydrating and soothes my skin and makes my skin and me feel so good. The texture is rich but it effortlessly glides onto my skin and gets absorbed quickly without any greasy or sticky residue. My skin looks overall healthier, shinier, dewy and glowy. My fine lines look plumper too. Very pleased with these first results. It is fragrance free and free of any harmful ingredients. Holy grail alert
