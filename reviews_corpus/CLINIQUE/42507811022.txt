CLINIQUESmart Clinical Repairâ„¢ Wrinkle Correcting Serum I recently received a sample of this product courtesy of topbox circle.After just one use, my skin felt more plump and hydrated. I have a love/hate relationship with retinol and I am happy to say that I did not experience any breakouts.It has zero scent to it, which is perfect for anyone with sensitive skin like me.For all these reasons I will be buying the full size! #freeproduct Good for my sensitive skin
