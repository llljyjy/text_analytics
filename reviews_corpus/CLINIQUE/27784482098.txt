I received the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum #freeproduct and I really enjoyed it. It was a small sample but I was able to get four days and four night uses out of it and noticed a difference in my small wrinkles on my forehead. The serum wasnâ€™t overly thin or thick and had very little smell, it absorbed fairly quickly with no sticky feeling or residue after being absorbed. My skin felt a lot smoother after using and I will definitely be using this again. A must have
