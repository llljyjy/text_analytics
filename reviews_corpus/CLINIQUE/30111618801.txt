I love how it treats the whole eye, lid included! I was hesitant at first, thinking it would burn or run but it really doesn’t. The cream is soft and cool, perfect for calming down at bedtime. Scent free and rubs in nicely.  I wish it was able to work faster, I’ve been using for 5 weeks and just now starting to see some slight changes on my lids. Soft and cooling with results
