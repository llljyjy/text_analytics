I got a small sample to try from Influenster to try for free. Although I feel like the sample was a bit small to fully criticize for my the full face effect, I used it on my nose as it’s always dry unlike the rest of my combination skin type. I found after using on my nose for a week it helped out the dry, flakiness repair itself. It smells good as an added bonus!  Over night I like to use a natura facial scrub (which I also got free to try) to freshen up then replenish the moisture to my skin. It definitely helped out with keeping my acne at bay on my nose since it’s not oily. nan
