I have been using the Smart Eye serum for a little over a week. I noticed it depuffed the area under my eyes as well as reducing the fine lines. I definitely hydrated and brighten as well. I keep it in my skincare fridge so when I apply the cream its nice and cool to the touch. I would definitely purchase this eye cream in the future based on the results I have seen thus far. Loving the results!
