I received this product from Influenster to give my honest review. I have used countless eye creams. This eye cream actually seems to work!! It definitely seemed to depuff the eye area. I think it also helps with the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It is very hydrating and feels wonderful on the skin. To me It didn’t have that much of a whipped texture… seemed more like cream. I would def order this again as my daily eye cream! This just might be the real deal!
