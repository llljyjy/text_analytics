This is one of my favourite Clinique mosturizers for my dehydrated skin. My skin feels nice and hydrated and plump after applying this on top of my toner and serums. A thick, gel consistency that feels so nice and absorbs quickly into the skin, but still provides hydration for the entire day. I would definitely buy this moisturizer again and again! nan
