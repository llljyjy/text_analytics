I have combination skin concerns. This helped my skin so much its unreal!  A little bit goes a long ways too. It has made my face feel moisturized and not dry no longer. Over time of using it, it has started to take my fine lines away from my eyes! I would recommend to anyone with combo skin concerns and whoever is looking for a good skin cream this is def it! In my skincare routine!
