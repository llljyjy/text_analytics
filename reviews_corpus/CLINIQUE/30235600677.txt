I’ve been a long time on and off Clinique user and have normal to very dry skin in the winter - I used this in conjunction with my normal serum routine as a last step for approximately 4 weeks both day and night - a little goes a long way and the texture is definitely lux, it is boot greasy absorbs well and I definitely felt it locked in moisture more so than some other last steps I’ve used in the past - I cannot give a full five stars as I did not appreciate a reduction in any fine lines but I only used for a month - I received this sample product free from Clinique and Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. Definitely a contender !
