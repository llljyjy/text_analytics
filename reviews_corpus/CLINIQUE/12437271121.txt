This is a great serum. I’ve been using it nightly and daily for the past few days as part of my skin care regimen... My skin is already quite nice, but even then I’m already seeing an improvement {no joke} in my skin, especially around the eyes, mouth and forehead. Cheeks too though! Better is always good, regardless of how good your skin is.The consistency is great, not sticky, and smells nice. I’m looking forward to continue using this product and see even better results. I’ve also been using it in combination with the Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream and Wrinkle Correcting Cream, as well as some facial oil. I definitely recommend this one.#freeproduct A+ Serum.
