I received a 5 ml sample from influenster in exchange for my honest review I definitely will purchase a full size! This moisturizer leaves my skin feeling softer and hydrated throughout the day. I live in Canada so it tends to be cooler and dry most days which causes blisters and dryness around my mouth area but with this moisturizer  it really keeps prevented that from happening. What I loved about this moisturizer is I love how it applies really easy on your face and the light feeling of a gel-cream is my preference. From somebody who suffers with breakouts occasionally this moisturizer does not leave my face greasy or oily. new favourite!
