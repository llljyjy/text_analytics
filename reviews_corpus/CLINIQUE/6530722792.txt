I received a sample of this product to try and was pleasantly surprised at how light yet refreshing it felt on my skin. Since trying it I am debating purchasing it for my summer moisturizer I liked it so much. I am usually a thick moisturizer gal because I have such dry skin but this felt like I have my skin a glass of water. Would recommend it if you’re looking for a gel moisturizer. Only have it 4 starts because I found it didn’t leave me hydrated all day but it did until it was time for my nighttime routine. Refreshing gel moisturizer!
