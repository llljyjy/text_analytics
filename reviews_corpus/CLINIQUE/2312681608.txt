Wonderful moisturizer!First let me say that I have very dry skin from introducing retinol to my routine. This moisturizer is fantastic for day time use. It has no scent and does not sting my very aggrevated skin! It sinks into my skin very nicely and leaves skin feeling very soft and hydrated! Love!! nan
