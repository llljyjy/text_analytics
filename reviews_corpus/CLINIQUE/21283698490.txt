This serum was alright. It did help moisturize my skin but felt a bit tacky on my fingers. I received a small sample to try out, so I wasnâ€™t able to really tell how well the serum works over time and if it even helps correct wrinkles. It also does smell a bit like chemicals so I was not a fan of that. Thank you Topbox #freeproduct. Feels a bit tacky
