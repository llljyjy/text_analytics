I received this #freeproduct from Topbox and was excited to try, as I’ve heard great things about the Clinique smart clinical repair line. I did find it to be moisturizing and non irritating to my sensitive skin, however the sample was a one time use, and I know this is meant to do it’s best over time- so I’m unable to give a true review of the effectiveness of this product. nan
