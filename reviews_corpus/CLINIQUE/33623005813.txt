I received a Free Sample to try from Influenster and Sephora in exchange for my honest review..... I Used it for a Little over 2 weeks now (when I give a review or read other reviews) I really want to how to feels with multiple uses. You truly canâ€™t get an honest opinion of an item until you have used it regularly. After I have used the Clinique Repair Wear Anti Aging Eye Cream regularly now I can honestly say that I Really Loved Trying this out! Truly hydrated my skin and could notice a difference in the wrinkles....not a dramatic difference but yes a noticeable difference which is GREAT and look forward to further use. Skin feels softer and no greasy feeling to it at all. My skin soaks it up great! Highly Recommend trying this Item. PS  Also at a Great Price too ! Definitely Worth Trying
