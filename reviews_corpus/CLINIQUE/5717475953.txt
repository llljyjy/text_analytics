I received a small sample of Clinique Wrinkle Correcting Serum. I liked the fact this serum was not sticky and had a light texture and absorbed into the skin quickly. Left my skin feeling very smooth and stayed on my skin throughout the day and night when applied. Hard to find a smooth serum, so loved this! I will purchase this product to see how the long term affects will leave my skin. Great quality. Not sticky
