Really like this cleansing balm. I’ve used the original Clinique Balm as well and I’d say both are equally effective at removing makeup. I feel like this one feel s a little less slippery and oily but still gets my makeup off. It comes off black but easy to clean in the sink. I’d say you should give it a try if you like the original.
