I had Great success with clinics peptide serum’s but this was a major fail.    Supposedly in order to get the full benefit you the client have to burst a little bubbles or a little balls that are in the gel.   Huh?  So it’s already problematic.  I tried rubbing it between my fingers thinking that warming it up would collapse the little bubbles but not always. It also seem to sting not every application but most. I like Clinique products generally but not this one.     Back to  better products. . nan
