I’ve only been using this for about a week and haven’t really seen improvements in my under-eye wrinkles, but I don’t think that’s enough time to totally discount this product. So far, it works really well as an overnight under eye moisturizer. I noticed my skin looks and feels smoother in the morning after I wear it at night, but that goes away throughout the day. It has a nice, thick, creamy consistency and is very easy to apply. Start with less than you might think you need because a little goes a long way. Also there’s no noticeable fragrance, so it might be good for people who are sensitive to scented products. I was between rating this a 3 and 4, but went with 4 because I think any under-eye cream would take at least a month or 2 to start noticing effects. Good moisturizer, unsure about wrinkle-correcting
