I received this #freeproduct sample from TopBox. The product did not have a scent which is very nice. The product is a clear serum that applies very easily and it absorbs into the skin fast. I only had a little sample so I only applied it at night time therefore I cannot comment on how well my make up would apply on top of it. I donâ€™t see myself buying the product due to the price but I would recommend it, it a a nice product which feels good on your face. Nice serum that absorbs fast.
