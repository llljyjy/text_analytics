I have been using the Clinique smart clinical repair eye cream for about 4 weeks. During these past 4 weeks I have noticed that the skin u see my eyes is moisturized and looks brighter. The cream goes on smoothly and isn’t greasy or heavy. My skin feels so soft after I apply. Throughout the day my skin stays moisturized and doesn’t get oily. I would recommend trying this product. Essential to my skin care
