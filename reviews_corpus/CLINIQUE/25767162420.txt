I really liked Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Serum! It’s nice and light weight no scent which is always nice. It absorbs really quickly into the skin which I like so I can do my make up. I am not to sure about the limit sun exposure warning. As I spend a lot of time outside so maybe I will use more in the winter. Nice absorbs fast
