I recently had a chance to try Clinique Smart Repair Wrinkle Correction Serum thanks to topbox.The Serum is much thicker in consistency and gives skin a very smooth and silky finish with out leaving any trace of heaviness.I felt my skin instantly moisturized. I am always nervous with serum as they don’t suit my skin! But this one is pretty good and didn’t gave me any skin trouble! A definite thumbs up! A wonderful Seum..
