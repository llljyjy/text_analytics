I loved the rich thick texture of this gel cream. You only needed a dab to cover your whole eye area. It hydrated well and absorbed quickly with no greasy residue left behind. My skin was noticeably softer and plumper and I noticed the small crows feet I had started to notice had faded significantly. I used this eye cream both in the morning and evening as part of my skincare regimen. One plus was that this cream  absorbed well enough into the skin around my eyes that within about 20 minutes I could apply face and eye makeup without worrying it would slide off. I liked this eye cream so much I now plan to try the rest of the Smart Clinical skincare line. I’d say this eye cream works just as well as high end eye creams I’ve tried  yet is a bit more affordable. I’ve been using Clinique makeup and skincare products for decades and this eye cream didn’t disappoint. This eye cream didn't disappoint!
