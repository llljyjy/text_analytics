This product does it all. It is easy to apply and you don’t need very much. It leaves skin hydrated and bouncy, without being greasy or overly matte. It behaves under makeup and is refreshing to apply. I’m almost 40 and have early aging signs, but am pretty skin care savvy and have tried many many daily creams. This product is one of the very best I’ve tried. Stellar product!!
