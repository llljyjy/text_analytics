I purchased Take Clinique The Day Off Cleansing Balm Makeup Remover as part of a trial set and enjoyed its gentle and effective qualities however after a few uses I opened the cap and noticed mold or something growing on it. I only ever used it with clean hands and just 2-3 times so I am concerned as I’ve been having an issue with my eye and suspect something may have been transmitted from this pot to it. I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I hope it was an isolated incident and doesn’t happen to anyone else. But as for the product I liked it but I have to give it 2 stars for the scary moldy experience. Pic attached. If you like mold in your product…
