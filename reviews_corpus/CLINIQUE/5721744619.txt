I received a sample sized sachet from topbox Canada in order to test this product and give an honest review. The formula wasn’t sticky and absorbed quickly. My skin feel hydrated afterwards. Didn’t cause dryness, sensitivity or breakouts. No fragrance. Liked product and with more uses could see opportunity to fight signs of aging. Luxury serum.
