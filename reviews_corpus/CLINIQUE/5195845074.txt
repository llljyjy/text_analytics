This is a thicker cream, so I’ll reserve to using it at night. I have oily skin and do not find this to be too heavy. It provides great hydration and really seems to plump my skin. I don’t notice a fragrance, which I love. I’ve only used it a few times so I’m not sure if the long-term results, but the ingredients seem promising. Night cream
