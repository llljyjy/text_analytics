I received this product free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this for about a week now and so far so good. I’m 37 with concerns about my under eye skin and thinning/loss of volume there, so I was excited to get this. I haven’t noticed any major differences yet but the formula seems promising. It stung a little the first time I used it, but I don’t think there are retinoids in this product so it wasn’t terrible (unlike some other eye creams I’ve used with potent retinoids). The texture is lovely and the cream stays out and doesn’t run into my eyes. Overall, I like it and will finish the jar before I determine whether or not I’d buy the full size. If you’re on the fence, I’d give it a shot! So far so good
