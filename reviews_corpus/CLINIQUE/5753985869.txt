I have very sensitive and dry skin, so at first I was worried this would not be thick enough for my skin.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. This definitely helped the appearance of fine lines on my skin while keeping my face hydrated.  It did not irritate my skin, like many wrinkle correctors do, and helped it feel smoother and more supple. Definitely worth it
