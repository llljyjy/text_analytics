I received this #freeproduct from Topbox as a sample to try. I’m already a fan of Clinique and enjoyed using this product as well. It’s just the right consistency and texture to make your face feel hydrated and plump, before following up with their cream. I used it both in the morning and at night.  The fragrance is very light. I cannot talk about the long-term effects of the product because the sample was quite small and only lasted for 2-3 uses. Plump plump!
