I received a sample of this moisturizer in exchange for a review. I enjoy quite a few Clinique products, but this one was honestly a little “meh” for me. It is a nice gel texture and it very light on the skin, but even on my combo skin it didn’t feel overly hydrating. My skin felt tight on my forehead and chin which are normally my drier areas. It also unfortunately pilled under my SPF and my foundation. It sort of feels like it was just sitting on top of my skin rather than being fully absorbed. It’s not awful, but I think Clinique has better moisturizers. nan
