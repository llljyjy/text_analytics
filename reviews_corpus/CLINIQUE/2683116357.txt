I received this product as a free product to try for a review. It has extremely creamy consistency and no scent. I’m not sure it did too much for my slight wrinkles but it did keep my skin moisturized. I know wrinkles take a time to correct but after several weeks I haven’t noticed much. If you are looking for a moisturizer you can try this. Not their best product
