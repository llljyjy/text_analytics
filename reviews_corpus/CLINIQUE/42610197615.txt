I received the Smart Clinical Repairâ„¢ Wrinkle Correcting Serum as a #freeproduct from TOPBOX #trywithtopbox. I applied this serum twice a day, AM & PM. The serum is very hydrating, non-greasy and light on my skin. I think if used in long run it might have great effects on my skin. I might consider buying it. Light Weight & Brightening
