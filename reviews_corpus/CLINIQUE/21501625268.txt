I received a small sample of the Correcting Serum as a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox. It was enough to last me two applications, which I used as part of my evening skincare routine. The Serum has a nice texture and it looks so pretty too! It has a soft purple shimmer to it. Goes on smoothly and it is not oily or sticky. Zero fragrance. I followed with the Clinical Repair Cream and it is evident they make a great duo.  My face was soft and velvety smooth, well into the next day. No breakout nor oiliness, simply a nice natural glow. Beautiful shimmer and glow
