I was able to try Clinique Smart Repair wrinkle correcting cream for free in exchange for my opinion. I enjoyed the texture of the cream and it went on easily and did not feel greasy. I have combination skin that is staring to show signs of aging. I felt like this product helped with the signs of aging but the sample size product given was hard to evaluate fully. I have included pictures. Good Overall
