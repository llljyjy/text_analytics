I received a 2 week supply to test out. I’m not 100% sold on this product but it did a good job. My skin is fairly oily and I found that later it the day it would start to feel sticky. It applied very smoothly and I didn’t find that it had a smell. I really enjoy Clinique products and would likely purchase a full size of this. nan
