I received this as free product for my honest review. I love Clinique moisturizers and this one is no exception. It is light weight but makes my skin plump and soft while giving it a ton of moisture. It hasnâ€™t broken out my sensitive skin and sinks into the skin quickly so dry and oily skin peeps with like it. Light but very hydrating
