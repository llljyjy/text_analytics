Not sure how Influenster expected me to give a full review on a tiny sample size. It seems like a decent moisturizer. I didn’t have enough to say if it’s going to be a miracle product for my skin. It was hydrating but doesn’t leave a greasy residue. Good for day time, under makeup and for nighttime use. nan
