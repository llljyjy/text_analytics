Received a sample from Influenster to try out. (I’ve also received multiple samples of these from Sephora purchases in the past). Although I do like the moisturizer it still isn’t enough for me to purchase a full size. It’s hydrating but I have combination skin but more on the dry side in the winter so I find it isn’t enough. The summer days this is fine for me but I’ve found other products that will do the same for all seasons. If you have normal skin this moisturizer should do you justice. nan
