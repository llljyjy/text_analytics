I received this product as a free sample. I’m new to the cleansing balm products world.  This is the first one I’ve used that contains charcoal. The balm is pretty “fragrant free” and has a very mild scent. It does the job of melting away makeup and leaves your face feeling clean. I noticed I still dirt/makeup remaining after using the cleansing balm after using toner and doesn’t completely take away all makeup. Another thing is the charcoal leaves a dark residue behind that takes a bit of extra washing to clean up. Overall, a good product and would consider purchasing and using again. Cleanse away
