I received a sample of this product through top box. Unfortunately it was not a very large sample so I only got to try it for a few days. In those few days I didnâ€™t see a lot of improvement in my wrinkles are fine lines. However the cream itself is a nice texture, with a pleasant mild fragrance. A little bit goes a long way. I may try more someday for a longer trial. nan
