Super creamy and hydrating product. Feels like a rich moisturizer for your eyes without it being too heavy. I can see this working for most skin types but especially for drier skin types. I love that when I wake up in the morning, I notice the moisturizer is still present but only to the touch while washing the skin because I donâ€™t feel it on my eyes.  Need to test out long term whether or not it wrinkle corrects or not, but with the high hydration I can see why it is called such. Super Moisturizer for the eyes
