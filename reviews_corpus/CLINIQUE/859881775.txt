I received a sample of this moisturizer from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The sample seemed small, but it’s actually lasted me a couple weeks, given how spreadable it is. The cream has a nice consistency, and feels smoothing and hydrating. Because it doesn’t contain SPF, I prefer to use this cream at night, layered under my retinol serum. I didn’t notice any significant improvement in my wrinkles, which tend to be focused in my undereye area and a little in my forehead and “11”s. I would compare this cream most closely as a slightly-less rich version of Peter Thomas Roth’s Water Drench cream. I prefer PTR’s version better - the SPF45 Water Drench lotion is part of my daily routine. I was happy for the sample, but don’t see myself switching to this cream. Good, but I’ve used better
