I received this product as a sample to try. I have combination skin bordering on oily most of the time. My skin is also prone to hives when the product does not agree with me.The texture of this moisturizer is very soothing and light (similar to Laneige’s water sleeping mask but with a slightly lighter feel). It kept the moisture in my skin without an oily-feeling and no breakouts. The only complaint I have is that there is a faint chemical smell (reminiscent of nail polish remover)- I have a really sensitive nose so I noticed right away but got used to the scent.I would recommend this product if you are looking for a long-lasting, light feeling moisturizer but don’t have a sensitivity to fragrance. Soothing and soft
