I’ve used Clinique a few times in the past, I love it for the summertime, it keeps my face moisturized the whole day. Unfortunately, this didn’t work for me in the winter time it’s not moisturizing enough for me. You only need a little bit to cover your whole face. I like to wear it underneath my makeup because it’s absorbed very quickly and doesn’t leave dry patchy spots, skin stays hydrated even with makeup. Great Summer Moisturizer
