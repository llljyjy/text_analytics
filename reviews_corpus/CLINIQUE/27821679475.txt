I do have a combination skin type and so I was excited to try it out. It has a light weight texture which glides smoothly on the skin and gets absorbed very fast and easily. It has this dewy finished look on the skin. Skin feels and looks soft and supple afterwards. I loved how it made my skin feel and would consider purchasing the full sized . Love it, feels good on the skin
