Makes for a great overnight cream or a moisturizer applied under a water based foundation. It applies smoothly. My skin soaks this up and feels hydrated for the whole day or night, but never leaves my skin feeling sticky or oily. This will be my new go to moisturizer. Note: it works well with Rare Beauty Foundation and Smashbox Halo Foundation A Must Have Moisturizer
