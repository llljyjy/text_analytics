I received this product from Topbox #freeproduct in exchange of my honest review. Tbh the sample was not enough for me to share long term benefit. I was able to use the product for couple of days only and I felt that it absorbs in my skin very well. Fragrance is great because it is mild. My skin is dry but felt it didn’t make any huge difference. Didn’t see any huge difference
