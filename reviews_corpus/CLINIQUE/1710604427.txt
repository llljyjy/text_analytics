I received this sample product free from influenster and my honest opinion is I like the fact this product is a gel format rather than a cream. I have combination and sensitive skin so this was soothing and I loved how it absorbed the product making my skin feel extremely hydrated. This product doesn’t last 100 hours and merely only a few hours before you have to reapply. I don’t know how I feel about it as I only received a sample size rather than a full product. My opinion is from 3 days of using this product before it ran out. Most likely won’t be purchasing it. Ok!
