SkinTo sum it upA couple of months ago I asked for a few samples at the Clinique counter, one of them being the Smart Night CustomRepair Moisturizer, WOW WOW WOW it did immediately make a huge improvement in plumping my lines and gave me a glowing radiant look that wasnt shiney or greasy It dries to a smooth soft feel with no residue that comes off when I thouch it. Clinique said it makes an immediate difference and it does My face including under my eyes looks smooth, hydrated, glowing, bright and awake with this product I cant wear the Smart serums due to irritation but the Smart moisturizer actually soothes it. A definite must have
