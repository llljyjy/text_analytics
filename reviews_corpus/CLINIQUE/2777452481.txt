I have oily combination skin, and one of my concerns is my wrinkles on my forehead and other fine lines on my face.  The cream does moisturize, but I’m not sure about it’s claims.  I didn’t notice any immediate results.  Supposedly 85% say lines and wrinkles looked reduced after using for 4 weeks.  I received a sample size, so I was not using this product for 4 weeks.  I didn’t notice a change in my forehead wrinkles.  My smile lines may have softened slightly, but I feel like I need more time to give a thorough review. Moisturizes
