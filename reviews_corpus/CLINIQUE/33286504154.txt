Thick and creamy texture. I use mornings and before bedtime. Received from Clinique & Influenser for my honest review I love Clinique products and so far .y skin is so soft and my lines are getting softer. This is based from 1 week usage. I have a small sample but a little goes a long way weâ€™ll see if it gets better before I waste my money. So far I will be purchasing this. I suggest people with dry or oily skin because I have both. To give it a try they do have the 0.05 jar so everyone can try before they purchase the big one for a cheaper price. I LOVE CLINIQUE
