I’ve been using this cream for about 3 weeks and while I don’t see much change in my deepest wrinkles, my skin does look more youthful and even overall. It’s definitely improved my skin tone. The cream is fragrance-free, non-greasy and surprisingly hydrating for such a lightweight product. It’s not a miracle worker I’m terms of wrinkles, but it’s a really good overall moisturizer. A solid overall moisturizer
