I received a tiny sample to review so not sure if I got a good enough trial with it but the formula is much thicker than the gel like consistency this used to have. It felt a bit sticky and too thick for me. Iâ€™ll be sticking with my IT Cosmetics confidence in a Gel moisturizer instead. Thicker formula but not loving it.
