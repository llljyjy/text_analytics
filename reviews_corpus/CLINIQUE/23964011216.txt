Receive this from Topbox for trial. It is lightweight serum, it is easy to apply , but leaving my face a bit dry after I used it. It caused some mild redness. It feels and smells nice. Smooth, silky, soft after I use a thick moisturizer. I do have a sensitive skin, so no irritation which is good. nan
