My skin type is normal-dry. I loved the consistency when putting it on before bed. It didn’t stay wet or tacky and dried down nicely and my skin felt plump. Rinsing it off in the morning, I could still feel the slip so was excited about that. Although after removing, my skin doesn’t feel different. It feels dry now and I have some redness where I didn’t before. so my skin might be too sensitive for it. nan
