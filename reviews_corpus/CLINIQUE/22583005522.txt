I received this product free for my honest review. The sample i received was so tiny I dont know its fair to review ths after 2 uses. Did my combination skin see any benefit after 2 applications? No. It was slightly greasy to apply but I felt like it might have been a good product. My skin felt a bit of a moisture boost. I wish I could give a bit more info but Iâ€™d have try it for a week straight to form an honest opinion. Might be ok
