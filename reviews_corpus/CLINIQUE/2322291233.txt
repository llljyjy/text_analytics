I needed a good night cream but this one is one you need to use for several weeks to see results. I’ve not seen any difference after 4 weeks, but the ad photos say 12 weeks. I don’t think the sample will last that long. It’s unscented but still smells like chemicals. Wish it were more natural. Still waiting…
