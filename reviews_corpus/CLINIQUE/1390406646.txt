My skin is fairly dry so I need a hydrating moisturizer. This cream is thick but not greasy. It glides on smooth will no strong odor and soaks into the skin well. It’s perfect for day and night for all skin types. I will layer on a nightcream over it if I need very deep moisturizing though. My skin never feels tight or irritated when using it, but I also haven’t noticed anything dramatic. If you’re  looking for a good all purpose face cream, this will do fine. Good all purpose cream
