It has a nice light consistency and absorbs fairly quickly as you gently massage into your skin. When thoroughly absorbed it leaves no sticky or oily after residue. A single use left my face feeling softer, smoother and hydrated with zero irritation. Itâ€™s packed with incredible ingredients and works for all skin types/tones including my sensitive skin. Its fragrance-free, allergy tested, oil-free, SLS-free, SLES-free, sulfates-free, free of denatured alcohol. I would definitely want to try full-size to see more noticeable results over a longer period of use. Thanks #trywithtopbox and @cliniquecanada for the #freeproduct Soft, Smooth & Hydrated
