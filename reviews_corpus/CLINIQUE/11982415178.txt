Feels good!I received the smallest sample from TopboxCircle which is impossible to say if it reduces fine lines and wrinkles as it advertises. But I am here to give my honest review. I can say it has no fragrance and is moisturizing. It would take a month of continuous use to know if it indeed is reducing wrinkles and fine lines. I can say it moisturizes without any irritation to my sensitive skin, beyond that I am not able to confirm it does anything more. Itâ€™s expensive and I will not be purchasing a full size bottle so nice
