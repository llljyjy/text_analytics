I received a #freeproduct sample from #trywithtopbox for my honest review. I found that this serum works at softening my skin. It is absorbed quickly into my skin. It has a light scent and no greasy feeling. My skin looks firm, smooth and hydrated. I only have a sample size (onetime) to test, so I cannot tell whether it would get rid of wrinkles in the long run, but I would be  buying the full size version to continue using it. nan
