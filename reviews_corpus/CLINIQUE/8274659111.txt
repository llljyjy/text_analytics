I was gifted the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair eye cream from Influenster and Clinique. My skin is combination to normal.This cream contains hyaluronic acid (yay! My skin loves this!) to hydrate the skin and sigesbeckia orientalist extract which is supposed to help skin maintain density. Love that too!I have been using this every morning and night for over two weeks now and here are some of the things I LOVED about this product: —fragrance free —feels hydrating but not greasy —thick texture that absorbs quickly —leaves skin around the eyes feeling velvety —wears well under eye makeup —does not migrate into my eyes Honestly, I have no complaints about this product! Well, other than the price… Does what it claims!
