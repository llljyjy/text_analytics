I received this #freeproduct in exchange for my honest review through the #topboxcircle sampling program.  I enjoyed this serum (as I am a big serum fan) but the sample size was so small I only got two applications out of it so I cannot speak to mid to long term usage. Of the two applications, the serum goes on light and non greasy and is not heavily fragranced. It did not leave my skin greasy or shiny.  Unfortunately I cannot speak to more than what I have already detailed due to the sample size being so small. Non Greasy Serum
