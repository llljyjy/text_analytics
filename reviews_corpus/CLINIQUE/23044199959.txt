Personally, I am not a fan of products that are heavy on dimethicone, especially for night routine as it slightly clogs my pores and causes products applied after the serum stage start pilling. This serum did cause me a minor breakout but I continued using it; however, I used up the 1ml sample up before I noticed any wrinkle correcting effects.I appreciate the opportunity to try it out for a honest review as, in general, I like Clinique and use a couple of their other products (purchased by myself) #freeproduct Caused minor breakout
