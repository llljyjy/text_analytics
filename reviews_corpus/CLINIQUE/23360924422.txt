This cream is fragrance-free and has a lightweight, non-greasy texture that is surprisingly hydrating. It goes on super smoothly, feels refreshing, and tightens too!!! It doesn’t take much each time, a little bit goes a long way.A great moisturizer overall… Not too sure about it being wrinkle fighting as it isn’t an overnight miracle cream but if you are looking for one, a richer more luxurious cream might be a better option for you! Long time Clinique fan!
