I received the Clinique smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting serum as a #freeproduct from Topbox in exchange of an honest review. I used it twice a day, during the day and night. I like how the product did not pill when I put my moisturizer and sunscreen on top of it. I like that it is fragrance free. I did not see a visible results with my wrinkles as I received a sample size, so I am not really sure how effective it is. Fragrance free
