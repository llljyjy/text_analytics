I highly recommend this product for day and night and I’ll speak on both. With the importance of making sure the skin is prepped and ready under our makeup, I always struggle finding an eye cream the moisturizes and depuffs my under eyes without pilling or irritating my skin or my eyes. This is the cream for that. My under eyes feel plumped and my under eye concealer goes on so smooth. At night, my under eyes feel very calmed and I wake up with my under eyes looking very refreshed. I’m noticing a difference in my fine lines after only two weeks of use. This will be a regular product in my skincare. Great for morning and evening skincare
