I received this #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox for my honest review, It was a small sample size of 1ml or .03fl.oz. I used this serum for a total of 3 times, once in the morning and twice at night. I noticed a slight smell and the consistency was nice. The first time I used this product at night I used it with the other, same line, eye cream and cream/moisturiser and found my face feeling very sticky! I tried using this serum and the eye cream together but with a different moisturiser and my face felt really smooth and NOT sticky! Something to do with the combination of this serum and cream/moisturiser for my skin just does not work, makes my face feel all sticky. But using them individually and/or with other products/brands seem to be fine. In the end I would not recommend this serum; and that’s just based on that it doesn’t seem to work with their other same brand/line of products. doesn't work well with the cream
