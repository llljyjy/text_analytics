I received this #freeproduct from Topbox to review. I like that this is fragrance free. The serum has a nice consistency. It absorbed nicely into the skin. It did feel hydrating and left my skin feeling soft. I cannot speak on the efficacy of this serum in regards to lessening fine lines and wrinkles as the sample was only enough for a few uses. nan
