I had a pretty good experience with this cream. It has a gel-cream texture and doesn’t feel too heavy. It goes on smooth like a balm and absorbs relatively quickly. Feels instantly moisturizing-not greasy or oily. And leaves my skin looking smooth and plump. As far as significant results go, I’d need to use it for a longer period of time. nan
