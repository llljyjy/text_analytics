I was fully expecting to be disappointed with this purchase as $31 for a Clinique chap stick is a lot. But I wanted a more “elevated” chapstick and this one caught my eye. It feels buttery and creamy on the lips. It wasn’t until half way through the tube that I realized this stuff actually works. My lips felt different- almost how they do when I get a botox lip flip. Finally I realize it’s because my lips were plumped.  They don’t look bigger but all of the little lip wrinkles were plumped up and filled in which makes them look smoother and younger. I will be repurchasing. I wish I could take half star off for the price. filled in the lines on my lips!
