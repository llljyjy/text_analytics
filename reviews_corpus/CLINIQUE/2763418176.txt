I liked how this made my skin feel upon application - soft, hydrated, plump. It didn’t cause any texture (I’m prone to bumps in my T-zone). Not sure if it maintained 100 hour hydration like it claimed. Overall it was a good daytime moisturizer and I’d use it again but it wouldn’t be my first choice. nan
