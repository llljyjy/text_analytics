I overall really enjoyed this balm. It really took off even the toughest of makeup. It did not burn or irritate the eye area which is a huge plus. I would recommend double cleansing because it is so thick, it can leave a greasy feeling if you donâ€™t. I did find it to be a bit heavy for my skin at times and I got some clogged pores from it so I would recommend using it on days where you are wearing stubborn to get off makeup, not every day if you have sensitive skin. Overall I really enjoyed this! Really enjoyed!
