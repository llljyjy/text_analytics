Clinique products work good for my skin and this is no exception. I have dry skin and I love using this as my day time moisturizer. I prefer using gel like moisturizers during the day. This product just soaks into my skin, so it doesnâ€™t effect my make up I apply afterwards. It has a pleasant light scent. I would recommend this product to others. Love it!
