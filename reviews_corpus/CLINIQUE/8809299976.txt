I received a sample as part of the Topbox Circle program #freeproduct. I used this as part of my night routine. It is a nice serum consistency, not too thick and not too runny. Feels really nice to put on and I like that there is little to no scent. The serum absorbs pretty quickly and leaves the skin feeling soft and with a nice smooth texture. I would consider using it during the day as it seems to form a nice base for a moisturizer. Lovely texture from a serum!
