I really like this moisturizer! The texture is lightweight and a bit velvety feeling on the skin, and it does a good job of making my skin feel hydrated without feeling greasy. Even under a mask all day working in the hospital my skin doesnâ€™t feel overly oily, which is a welcome change! I have combination skin, and this provided the moister I need without looking too glowy. Wonderful texture!
