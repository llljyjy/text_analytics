I really liked this balm to oil cleanser. I didn’t notice any scent. It felt like butter on the skin but in a good way. Lol. A little went a long way and it removes all my mascara. It didn’t cause any breakouts on my sensitive skin. It also didn’t irritate my eyes. Definitely Recommend. Removed all mascara
