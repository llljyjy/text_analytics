I have been using Clinique skincare and makeup since I was a teenager. In the past 15 years they have never let me down! I have oily/combination/occasionally sensitive skin so I am super picky about my skincare products. I have been using their Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel for about 15 years so when the opportunity to try this came up, I couldn’t have been more excited to try it! This did not disappoint either! I start off my nighttime skincare routine with Clinique liquid facial soap then I use their toner and wait for my face to completely dry. When I first applied this I was so surprised at how little you need! A tiny bead was all I needed for my whole face! Almost immediately my skin felt plump and hydrated without that super wet sticky feel that some lotions cause. Sometimes when I use other lotions I wake up and my face is super oily but when I woke up after using this my face wasn’t oily at all and still felt just as hydrated as it did the night before. I would say this is a bit too hydrating for myself to use every day so I have been using it every other day and I am IN LOVE. I will definitely be using this in the future and recommending it to all my friends! Game Changer
