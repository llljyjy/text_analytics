The Clinique moisture surge 100H auto replenishing hydrator was very moisturizing. It didn’t leave my skin feeling sticky wet. It absorbed and beautifully went into my skin to nourish it. I really love that their is lady thistle in the ingredients, and aloe leaf. It was great to use day or night. Before bed applying the Clinique moisturizer would leave my skin feeling supple and plump in the morning. During the day the application of this moisturizer really helped my make up application go on, and look smoother. My skin wasn’t dry, and felt great during the last few days of heat we’ve had where I live. Moisture Surge Clinique
