I received this just in time as I ran out of my previous moisturizer! I have combination skin and tend to get really dry spots and within the first use it has so far mended those spots. I am a huge fan of the gel consistency! A little goes a long way. And It leaves my skin feeling almost like satin or velvet. nan
