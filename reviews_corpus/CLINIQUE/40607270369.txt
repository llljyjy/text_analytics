I used this Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum for a couple days after receiving a #freeproduct sample. I feel I needed to use quite a bit of it to really cover my entire face and being that the sample is pretty small, I used this serum up pretty fast. The texture is nice and it absorbs into the skin very well. Overall it felt nice on my skin and my skin felt smoother. Skin felt smoother
