I received this #freeproduct from Topbox Circle in exchange for my honest review. The texture of the serum was slippery and moisturizing upon first application but quickly became dry. I do not like the scent. It is difficult to comment on the effect on wrinkles/fine lines as the sample was very small and I donâ€™t have any wrinkles. nice texture but weird scent
