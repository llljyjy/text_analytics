I received a sample size of this moisturizer for free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for an honest review.The Smart Clinical Repair™ moisturizer claims to visibly repair lines and wrinkles for smoother younger looking skin.  Key ingredients include their CL1870 Peptide Complex™  which is a peptide blend engineered to fight the look of wrinkles by boosting natural collagen, leaving skin feeling soft, smooth an stronger.  Hyaluronic acid helps to plump skin and provide lasting hydration.   It also has Soybean seed extract which helps nourish skin.  This is a very nice moisturizer for those with mature or dry skin, although it is intended for all skin types.  I was a huge fan of Clinique when I was younger, in fact it was my first foray into skincare.  I liked how everything was fragrance-free and how products tended to be safe for all skin types.  This moisturizer does have a very light scent, which I don’t mind.  I like how there are several peptides in this moisturizer, since I am getting older and want to combat any fine lines and wrinkles.   I used this sample for about 3 weeks, both AM/PM, applying to my face and neck after applying my toner and serum.  It is a thick cream, non-greasy in texture and it melts into the skin quickly. It felt soothing and lightweight on the skin, and my skin appears more plump and softer.  I didn’t see much of a change in my fine lines/wrinkles in such a short time, but perhaps with continued use, I will see some improvement.   I do like how hydrated my skin felt all day, and I do notice a smoother texture after using.I would recommend this moisturizer for dry skin types, if you are combination or oily, perhaps it is best to use a small amount as a spot treatment. nan
