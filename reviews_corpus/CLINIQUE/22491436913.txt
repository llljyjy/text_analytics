I love the whipped, creamy texture and the way it hydrates and smooths my skin. It’s fragrance free, so it’s safe for sensitive skin, especially in the eye area. I haven’t noticed a major difference in wrinkles, but I don’t have many to begin with, and I’ve only been using the cream at night rather than twice daily as recommended, so that could be the reason why. Loving the whipped, creamy texture!
