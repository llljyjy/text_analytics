I feel like the people complaining aren’t using this right. I take a small amount, probably the size of a pea and massage it and it takes my eye make up off with ease. I use primer, shadow, liquid liner, and mascara and all of it comes off with a gentle massage. You don’t have to “scrub” like someone else said in the reviews. I still double cleanse but you don’t really have to. Also I’ve tried other balms and they left my vision cloudy for a short period of time after using them! This one does NOT affect your vision like that that. Easily makeup away
