I have quite dry and sensitive skin so I typically tend to reach for thicker/rich creams, especially in the winter months, but I received a sample of this moisturizer and was intrigued. 100h of hydration? Sign me up!This moisturizer had no scent, didn’t break me out, and it sank into my skin very quickly. I woke up in the mornings and didn’t feel any residual moisturizer left on my face at all.This would not be good enough to keep my skin hydrated during the winter, but I believe it may work well in the summer as its quite lightweight and would work well under makeup. Definitely think it’s better suited to non-dry skin types, but it’s not a bad product! nan
