I’m in love with the texture of this eye cream. It’s not too thick but not watery at all. Perfect eye cream in a bottle. It makes my under eyes moisturized and helps with wrinkles. It goes on easily by patting it under your eyes and smooth it out all over your eyes! I have truly found a eye cream when I wasn’t a eye cream type of person! My favorite eye cream ❤️
