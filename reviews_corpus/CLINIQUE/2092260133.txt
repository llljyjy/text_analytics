My favorite things about this product are the cream texture and that it’s fragrance free. It was hydrating and felt lightweight. Applying it nightly as part of my skincare regimen assisted in depuffing under my eyes. I didn’t notice a drastic change in the appearance of fine lines but was still pleased with results of smoothness and brightness. Great hydrating product
