It’s not a bad moisturizer at all. It does well at balancing the skin, and adding moisture especially in the summertime. It’s lightweight and easily absorbed. Overall, it’s a good moisturizer if your skin is not overly dry or overly oily. To address the smell, I will admit it does have a slight gas smell immediately after application but does disipate quickly, and I’ve never noticed it when I wasn’t thinking about it. Good overall for mild skin
