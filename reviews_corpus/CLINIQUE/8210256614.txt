I received a sample of this product from Sephora and Influenster in exchange for an honest review of the product. I love that this product has no scent. It did not feel greasy at all which is also a huge plus when it comes to a moisturizer. Unfortunately, despite those big positives, I did not feel like it really left my face feeling moisturized. After using this for several weeks, I’ve gone back to my regular moisturizer because this one just doesn’t really do it for me. Not a big fan
