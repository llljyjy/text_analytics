I am 53 and have combination aging skin, so texture of product is important. I need it to hydrate but not feel too heavy, and this fit the bill. I have been using this for a few weeks and I’m happy with the way it plumps up my skin. Huge doggy in my skin texture, soft and smooth. I can’t comment on long term effects yet, but this has an immediate effect on they way my skin looks. Lines seem to diminish thanks to the deep hydration. I want to purchase a large size and keep using this to see it’s capabilities long term. Very happy with short term results! Immediate Results!
