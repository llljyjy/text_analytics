I received this product from Topbox to try  #freeproduct  and give my honest review. I used this serum about 3 times and fell in love.  Although, I cannot say it helps with wrinkles as I was only able to use it a few times, however, it provides lots of hydration and made my skin glow.  I also noticed that it plumped up my face and wears well under makeup.  It has no fragrance and does not feel sticky on the skin either. My skin felt so soft and tight after using it.  It absorbs very well into the skin and seems to last all day.   Thank you Topbox ! so glowy
