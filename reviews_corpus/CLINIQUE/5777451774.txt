Thank you #trywithtopbox for the #freeproduct CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum. This serum is very fast absorbing and feels nice on the skin upon application. I really like how it is fragrance free because sometimes I am sensitive to fragrance. I did not notice any reduction in wrinkles from using a sample of this product. Not sure if I would repurchase as I did not see any results as promised with the product. Worked okay for me but nothing too amazing nothing too amazing to me
