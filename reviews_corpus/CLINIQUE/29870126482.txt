I applied this product at night time. It’s non sticky unlike other serums and is easily absorbed by my skin. I can’t unfortunately comment on how effective it is as the sample size isn’t enough to allow me to test over a few days to see results. That said I like the way it felt on my skin and moisture it provided. I think I would lokenit even better also if slightly scented. So far so good!
