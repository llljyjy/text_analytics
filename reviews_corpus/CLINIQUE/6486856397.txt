I have found my Holly Grail!I have always had good skin but at 38, it has started showing some signs of aging. I have a few fine lines and I’m starting to notice a little bit of sag in my cheeks (nothing major but it bothers me). Also, I noticed after having children my skin went from normal to dry and that tends to show my lines even more, plus it makes my face feel tight in the afternoon. I added retinol to my routine about two months ago and that made my skin even  dryer. After I introduced this holly grail of cream to my routine, I have noticed my skin looks more plumped and super moisturized. It even feels moisturized by the end of the day!! I don’t apply retinol to my eye area because it just gets too dry and I was looking for something to help my fine lines under my eyes. Well, this cream has worked wonders for that area too and hasn’t caused any sensitivity at all. It feels a little greasy (which I don’t mind) and rich and feels very smooth when I apply it. My foundation also goes on smoothly over it. I have been using this product for a few days now and already love it and can see a difference, I can’t wait to see how my skin looks after a few months of using this daily. For me, it really is a life changer! nan
