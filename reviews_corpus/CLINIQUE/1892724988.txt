I received a sample as a gift to review. The texture is nice gel like texture so it didn’t feel heavy on the skin and applied easily. It penetrated well but didn’t completely keep my skin feeling completely hydrated. This is a great beginner cream with its price point, a great cream for younger skin. great beginner cream
