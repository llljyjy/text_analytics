I have been using the Clinique Wrinkle Correcting Serum for the past two days and I like that the serum has a highly concentrated and lightweight formula that is absorbed into the skin quickly and does not leave a sticky residue on my face. I felt a noticeable difference in how my skin looked and felt. I appreciate that the serum effectively addresses my skin problems whether it be anti-aging, brightening, or even hydration. I also like that it is fragrance and oil-free. #freeproduct Absorbs into the skin without any sticky residue
