I received a free foil sample of this serum, and it was a one-time use for me. It has a very thin, watery texture and absorbs very well. It layers well with other serums. Although it contains a “potent retinoid” I didn’t experience any redness or tingling. I can’t speak of any other effects after using it one time. No redness
