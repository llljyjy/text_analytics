Okay product but would not buy this myself. I was given a TINY sample from Influenster. The scent of this product was very strong for me, it did go away within 10 minutes, but if you don’t like scent I’d avoid this.  I have oily skin and I found this to be a light moisturizer, good for summer but didn’t really provide the moisture I need for the typical Fall, Winter and Spring seasons. I assume this means it also wouldn’t be a good product for those with dry skin types. scented & expensive
