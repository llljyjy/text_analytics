When I received this cream a few weeks ago I was excited to try it.  I have now been using it for about 3 weeks.  The packaging is nice but not extravagant which is fine what matters is the cream itself.  There is a clean skincare scent to it so I would say unscented technically.  When I applied it the first time it had a great moisturizing feel and did absorb into my skin.  After a few minutes I could feel my skin was moisturized, soft, and I could not see the cream, so it was absorbed fully.  After a week of use I did notice a difference in the way my skin felt and looked.  Around the time of writing this I could see my crowsâ€™ feet looking less noticeable.  I would say it is overall pretty good but would need to buy a bigger size to use longer. Absorbs Perfectly
