I received a sample of this to #tryforfree so was only able use it on my face a couple of times because of the size of the sample. The serum is cloudy and fragrance free, and it absorbed really well onto the skin without making it feel oily. I like it a lot based on the few times that I used it. I could not see any immediate reductions in wrinkles after the limited number of uses but it did not irritate my skin and I like how my skin felt after application. Gentle and fragrance free
