I received this as a sample from topboxcircle to try. The sample was too small to see any real results but it did smell nice & absorbed quickly. Didn’t feel greasy at all & normally serums feels greasy to me. It didn’t bother my skin which can be sensitive. I used it at night during my night time skin routine. #Freeproduct #Trywithtopbox Absorbs quickly!
