Iâ€™ve been using this product for a couple of weeks and I already see a difference. I do notice that the wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable.  The whipped texture is good and not greasy.  A little bit goes a long way. It did make the eye area feel stronger and less puffy. I would definitely purchase this eye cream in the future. Great product
