I received a sample size of this product from Influenster to review. I found this product to be slightly tacky but not sticky on the skin. It absorbs very quickly and I really liked the lightweight texture. It left my skin feeling hydrated without leaving any weird residue. Enjoyed this a lot. Big fan of the moisture surge line.
