I have received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for a honest review. I have used this product in the mornings and evenings along with the other wrinkling creamsin the set. My skin started to look healthier and fresher. It does appear smoother in certain places. You have to let it absorb into your skin before makeup application. If you are using this serum, ensure that you use the set as a part of your skincare. nan
