This cream fights wrinkles and it’s supposed to make your creases less visible which I believe it does. Its light goes on smooth and, has a fresh scent to it as well. My skin does get oily at times, but this has not made it worse at all. I believe it has helped with circles and puffiness I have had on some occasions. I wanted to find something that is good for anti – aging and wrinkles and hydrating my skin and this has been working well so far. I love the Clinique brand. I will continue using this and hope to continue to see this work even better. The price isn’t too bad as you only need a pea size that will get you along way. I would definitely recommend this to anyone will try and decrease your creases Amazing eye cream
