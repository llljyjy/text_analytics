I have typically dry skin and before purchasing this Clinique moisturizer used the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream. Great product by the way, definitely recommend the Ultra Repair Cream over this to those with dry skin! Unfortunately, I thought this moisturizer would be better than the Ultra Repair Cream, but I was wrong. The moment I put it on my face for the first time, I hated it and immediately washed it off. It had a very off-putting smell that I see no one else talk about? It also made my face crazy greasy. I just wouldnâ€™t recommend this product. If you are having issues with dry skin though, you should definitely look into the FAB Ultra Repair Cream! Did NOT work for me
