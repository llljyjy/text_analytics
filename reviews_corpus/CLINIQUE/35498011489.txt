I received a #freeproduct sample of Clinique Smart Clinical Repair wrinkle correcting serum and thought it was only a small packet, a little goes a long way! The serum is thin, translucent, odourless and goes on silky smooth. It isn’t greasy and I can apply makeup over it without issue. I really liked how soft it made my skin feel— after just a few daily uses in the mornings I found my aging skin to appear smoother and more moisturized than my regular serum. Wrinkles are softer and less pronounced than if I had gone without. Because you only need such a small amount for application a full size bottle would definitely last a long time and is worth the price imo. Very nice
