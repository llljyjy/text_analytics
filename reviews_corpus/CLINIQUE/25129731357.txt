I received this product from Influenster and Clinique for my free for my honest review. I love this correcting cream. I already own the eye cream and use it nightly so I was very excited to try this one as well. My skin feels so much healthier. I love that it doesn’t have a strong scent like other brands. My skin is sensitive and like all Clinique products it doesn’t bother my skin at all! I’ve been using it 2 weeks now and already see and feel the difference. I can’t wait to continue to use it. I highly recommend this product! I love this cream!
