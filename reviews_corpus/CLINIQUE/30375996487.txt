I received this #freeproduct Clinique Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review. The serum is hydrating and absorbs quickly. I used it at day and night for two days after I cleaned my face. Unfortunately, it was impossible for me to notice any effects on my skin because sample was not enough. Nice product
