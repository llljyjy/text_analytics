I received a sample from topbox to try out this serum along with the under eye cream and moisturizer. The serum is really nice and light and unscented which was amazing. It absorbed nicely into my skin... it was a bit shiny but that disappeared after 15-20 mins. I only used the serum for 3 days since it was a sample so I donâ€™t know what long term results looks like but it did leave my skin feeling hydrated. nan
