I am always looking for a face cream that also helps smooth wrinkles. I recently tried this Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream. I’m so happy that I did. This cream immediately made my skin feel hydrated, smooth and soft. It absorbed in my skin quite nicely too. After using this daily, I feel that my face looks nicer after using this cream. It doesn’t really have a scent that I noticed. It comes in a beautiful bottle with an easy screw on top. I am very impressed with this Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream. I recommend this product. Great wrinkle cream!
