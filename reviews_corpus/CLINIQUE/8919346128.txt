I received this mousturizer a few weeks ago to test out and I thought it was good. It did what it claimed to do. However, as someone who has oily skin, I found that it was a bit too thick and sticky for me personally. It’s a thicker moisturizer that sits on top of your skin. It didnt quite sink in for me which made it feel odd. I’d most likely recommend this product to people that have dry to normal skin. It would most likely work best for them. It was a good moisturizer
