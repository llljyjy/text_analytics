I honestly don’t think there is a product on the market that can reverse aging.This is a nice cream, smells faint, glides on nice and absorbs quick so there is no greasy or gooey feeling. However - as for fighting the signs of aging - I doubt it will do that.One can’t turn back aging, unless you opt for cosmetic surgery.I do like using it, and it does make the skin under my eyes softer.I’ve only been using it a couple weeks, so to soon to tell if it actually does what it says it will do.I say - if you want an under eye cream that won’t burn or make your eyes water, this is a good choice.A little goes a long way to so a small jar will last a long time. A little goes a long way!
