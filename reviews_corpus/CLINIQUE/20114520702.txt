I received this #freeproduct in exchange for my honest review. I absolutely love the feel of this serum. The formula is on the thicker side for a serum but did not cause any break outs.  It spreads beautifully like a gel and is not sticky at all. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling so smooth and hydrated. It almost feels like a luxury primer. I think itâ€™s a great option for someone with sensitive skin wanting to use retinol. First impression review
