This is the first product that I used in the oil-balm cleanser segment. After this, I used several other products as well. This is the best one I’ve used up to now. It removes the make-up easily, doesn’t irritate the skin, especially the sensitive eye area.Removing heavy eye make-up is so easy. Maybe it is because I started the double cleansing, I see a change in my skin as well. Finally, it lasts longer. Good product, worth the products
