I have been using this product for a month now, and love it! It’s light, and really has smoothed any visible wrinkles near my eyes. It has a very night scent, that’s almost undetectable. It’s non-irritating and non-greasy. Absorbs well into the skin. I use it in the morning after washing my face, and in the evening before bed. I will buy in the near future, and I definitely recommend. Awesome Eye Wrinkle Cream
