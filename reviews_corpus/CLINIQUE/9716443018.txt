Received three Clinique skincare products - #freeproductSmart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Cream  Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting SerumSmart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream There was only enough serum and eye cream for two uses and four for the cream; I used them at night. Full disclosure - I haven’t had the best results with Clinique in the past so it’s not my go to skincare product.  The eye cream was surprisingly light, it felt comfortable; having only two applications, I can’t be sure if it would do all that’s promised, but it was hydrating and hydration long-term should soften fine lines. The serum - It’s a clear, lightly scented serum, it automatically made my skin feel firmer while it was applied. The full benefits in the description say results will be seen in 10 days, so I can’t comment on all the promises that it states. The Correcting Cream - It’s close to being an unscented cream; it absorbs quickly and creates a smooth effect, a natural finish. I like it; it says it’s a de-aging cream. Full benefits weren’t reached in the time I tried it, but I can see the smoothing benefits in the time I did use it. If you are a Clinique, fan I think you’ll be extremely pleased with this de-aging lineup. #Topboxcircle Clinique, fans rejoice
