I received this #freeprofuct from #topboxcircle in exchange for my honest review. Honestly, the sample size was very small, hardly enough for a good review. That being said...it was enough for me to use twice a day for about 4 days. The serum itself was pleasant to apply, it left no oily residue or shine. As for my fine lines, it did in fact reduce the look and made my skin appear firmer and more hydrated. It worked especially well when paired with the eye serum. Overall, this product works as advertised. A great serum!
