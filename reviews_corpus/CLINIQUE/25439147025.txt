I received a sample of Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum #freeproduct from Topbox. It was a small packet but I was able to get 3 uses out of it. It was fragrance free, and applied smoothly. It was not sticky. It felt nice on my skin and I did notice my skin looking refreshed and plump. I am in my 40s and this product is a good one. Very nice serum
