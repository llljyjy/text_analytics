Product has more of a gel feel to it then a cream and it feels very lightweight with no residue. Unfortunately, it does not feel ultra moisturizing at all. I applied it at night and in the morning my skin felt dry as if I hadnâ€™t put any product on the night before. I also tried using it in the morning and found myself needing to reapply a moisturizer and couple hours later. Not a fan. Not impressed
