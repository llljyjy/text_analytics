I really likes this product. I was experiencing dry skin and it really helped moisturize my skin. The consistency was great too, not too thin. The only thing I would change is personal preference in the scent. It doesnâ€™t have much of one which I would like it to smell a bit stronger. Otherwise I would use this product again. Good product
