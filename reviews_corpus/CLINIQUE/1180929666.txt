Removing my makeup is usually my least favorite part of my day, but this product makes it much better. I love that it starts off as a solid, so I don’t have water dripping down my arms right away while removing my makeup. When using this product, I have to spend extra time on my eyes to really make sure all my mascara has been removed (and I’ve never tried it with waterproof mascara), but I’d still recommend it. My FAVORITE thing about this product is that I use a small amount almost every night and the standard size has lasted me 10 months. Keep in mind that due to the pandemic/lockdowns/masks I haven’t had as much makeup on my face, so there hasn’t been as much to remove. But still, it has lasted for so long that it’s WELL WORTH the price. Great Value for Money
