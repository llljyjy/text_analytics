I received a sample size as a #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox in exchange for my honest review. The texture of this serum is nice and smooth and I love that it quickly absorbs into my skin. Like other products in Clinique’s Smart Clinical Repair Wring Correcting line, it has a mild scent which doesn’t bother me like many other products do. I was also happy to find that it doesn’t bother my skin which is often incredibly sensitive to products. That being said, I didn’t notice any noticeable difference in wrinkles. This is likely due to the fact that the sample I received was very small and I couldn’t use it for very long. Smooth Feeling Serum
