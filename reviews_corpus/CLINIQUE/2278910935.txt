I received a Deluxe sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I was a big Clinique fan in the 90’s. Tried all the things. As I got older the products didn’t work/appeal to me as much. I started breaking out from the skin care so I stopped using Clinique. I was excited to get a sample of this to try. I can’t speak to the “wrinkle correcting” because the sample I received didn’t contain enough product for me to see results. The cream itself is lightweight but a little “sticky”. Not bad sticky…reminds me a little bit of primer consistency. It lays well under makeup. Skin feels moisturized. Has a slight chemical smell to it. It’s just a cream and I think there are some other products out there that I prefer over this. nan
