I received a sample sized container of this moisturizer. I have normal-to-dry skin that is showing some signs of aging. When I first opened the jar, I was concerned because the product looked so thick. I was afraid it would be heavy, but I was pleasantly surprised. This cream is rich, but a small amount smooths into the skin effortlessly. It absorbed  quickly into my skin, leaving my skin feeling soothed, hydrated, and refreshed. It did give my skin a healthy glow, but my face didn’t look greasy at all. Instead, it felt soft and smooth. I didn’t notice any immediate improvement in my fine lines, and it is hard to say what improvements may have happened after using the moisturizer long term. I also liked that this moisturizer wasn’t perfume-y! Nice rich hydrating cream that isn’t heavy
