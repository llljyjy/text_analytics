Got to try this moisturizer and I really enjoyed it. I have combination skin but lately itâ€™s been really dry so need something to really help keep it hydrated. I liked the texture of the cream and how easily I could apply it. It kept my skin relatively hydrated for the day. I would consider purchasing again. Good moisturizer
