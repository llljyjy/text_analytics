Thank you Topbox circle for this #freeproduct.  I used this serum in my night skin routine. I had enough product for 2-3 applications so my review is based on that. The serum goes on skin smooth, didn’t feel greasy. Didn’t have overpowering smell. I didn’t notice any difference in my skin texture. I have very dry skin so I need creams and serums that are extra hydrating. And this serum was not hydrating. I wouldn’t be buying full size. I feel there are lot of better serums on market and at cheaper price point too.. nan
