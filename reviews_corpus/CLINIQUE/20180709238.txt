First of all, unless you’re very oily, you’ll need to moisturize underneath this before you apply it. However, it’s not marketed as an “all-in-one,” so that shouldn’t be a surprise. Once I figured out that I needed to moisturize, then apply a pea-sized blob of this and let it “set” for about 30 seconds before doing my concealer and bronzer, I fell in love. I did use the older City Block SPF 40 for years and can say that one was indeed more spreadable / emollient. But this newer version really is not as bad as people make it out to be — if you have realistic expectations for what it is, you’ll probably be pleased? I’ll happily use it for a long time to come. Protects my skin, doesn’t burn my eyes, holds up for long periods of time and outdoor use. It’s not water or sweat-proof, but I have another sunscreen to use if I’ll be swimming or overly sweaty. Amazing if you use it correctly
