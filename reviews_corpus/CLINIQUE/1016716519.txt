#freeproduct I received a small sample from Topbox for my honest review of this product.  I am a huge fan of Clinique and have been a loyal user for about 20 years.  I used this wrinkle correcting serum product FIRST before applying my  night time moisturizer.  I found the product absorbed super quick (which I appreciate) and I was taken aback at how smooth my skin felt the next morning.  I only received a very small free sample and wouldâ€™ve liked more....much more to check out the lasting smoothing longevity of this product.  I also appreciated that the product was fragrance free. Morning after smoothness!
