I received a sample from Topbox Circle #freeproduct. It’s a nice serum. I don’t find it any different from other brands’ serum. Although I have to say it absorb fast comparing to some brand’s serum. Same with this wrinkle-correcting line of products, the serum doesn’t have fragrance which is a plus to me. Nice Serum
