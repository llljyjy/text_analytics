My skin is combination, some areas are more oily than others but overall my skin prefers gel moisturizers to cream. This gel-cream combo was the best of both worlds - the gel consistency my skin craves but without the shiny aftermath that often follows from a cream. My skin is happy Clinique released this! Gel-cream combo is great!
