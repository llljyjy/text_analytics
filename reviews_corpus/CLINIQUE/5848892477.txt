I received this sample as a #freeproduct with Top Box. It was a small sample so I cannot comment on the overall effectiveness of this product in terms of wrinkle correcting. I can say that the cream has a nice light scent and did not irritate my sensitive skin. I used it at night along with their wrinkle correcting cream and eye cream. The scent is light but not overwhelming and I woke up the next day with bright and fresh skin. I did like this product and would use it again. nan
