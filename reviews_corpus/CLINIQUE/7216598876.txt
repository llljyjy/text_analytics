i absolutely love this moisturizer! i actually wanted to give it a few days of trial before reviewing. Itâ€™s so light yet hydrating, glides on the skin effortlessly, and works very well under makeup as a primer. no scent, and worked to rid my face of dry patches!! i definitely recommend this for dry skin! Great hydration, works great under makeup!
