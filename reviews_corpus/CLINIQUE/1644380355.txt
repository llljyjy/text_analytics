I really like this eye cream! -1 star because it pills a little if you layer a sleep mask or night cream with it. Overall though, I’m enjoying using this. It’s creamy without being too thick. It spreads easily and provides even coverage without effort. It hydrates well, and my eye area isn’t dry after 12 hours. It doesn’t irritate my eyes like some other higher-end ($70-90) eye creams have in the past. Overall, I’m quite happy with this cream and would strongly consider purchasing it again when this pot runs out! Creamy, great texture
