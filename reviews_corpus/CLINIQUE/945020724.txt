I received this complimentary from #influenster to try out and share my honest review. Perfect eye cream! I am trying to keep any wrinkles at bay and I think this will do the trick. It is rich and creamy but not too much so (esp for undereye), so it doesn’t feel heavy, and it is easy to apply. I will need to continue using for a bit to figure out whether it’s truly a keeper, but so far, I’m a fan! Like it so far
