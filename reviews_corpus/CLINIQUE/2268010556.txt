Excellent application. Light weight and great for the summertime. A reasonable price, fragrance free, and a fuss less moisturizer to wear. This doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of a 100$+ moisturizer but that isn’t what Clinique is about. It’s very basic, but some people need that. I could see it being really good for senesitive, flair up prone skin. It hydrates without being overly moisturizing. Big fan! I received a sample of this complimentary from Influenster. No frills moisturizer !!
