I received a free product in exchange for my honest review of this Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream. I  think it works really good on my face and neck area. It  moisturizes well and is making my fine lines lighter.  A little goes a long way. Only con a slight bit sticky. I  would recommend it. nan
