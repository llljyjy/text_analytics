For the last year, i’ve struggled with acne, hyperpigmentation, and acne scars. This product is my HOLY GRAIL! The first picture you see is from late February, and the second picture is now ( mid June ) this completely got rid of the redness and hyperpigmentation I had. Ever since I added this product to my routine, that’s when I started seeing a difference. I definitely would recommend using this product consistently if you want to see the best results. I also wouldn’t get discouraged if you aren’t seeing results too quickly; it took me about a month or so to see a subtle difference and about 2 months to see bigger results. Ive seen some reviews that this has dried out people’s skin. However, in my experience it hasn’t. I have combination skin ( dry cheeks, oily T - Zone ) and my skin isn’t too sensitive. A little goes a long way with the product. I use about 1 pump for my forehead and chin. Will definitely repurchase this! Love it
