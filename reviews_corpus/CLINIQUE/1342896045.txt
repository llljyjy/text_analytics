This slightly thick gel-cream textured moisturizer is packed full of peptides, St. Paul’s Wort, hyaluronic acid, soybean extract & other ingredients. The product targets fine lines, texture, wrinkles & dry skin. What I personally noticed was how the moisturizer addressed my tech neck lines. The St. Paul’s Wort firms sagging skin. The tech neck lines are softer, smoother & less defined. My skin feels healthy, soft & nourished. I highly recommend this product. Delightful anti-aging moisturizer
