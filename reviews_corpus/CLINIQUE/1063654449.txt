I like how lightweight this serum felt on my skin and it absorbed nicely. I did notice my skin looked more plump and bright after a few uses. It also felt immediately hydrated. Since it does contain retinol, I used the serum at night instead of the morning. Because of this, I appreciated it being fragrance-free. Love it!
