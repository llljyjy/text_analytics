I really liked this serum! It was thin and easily absorbed and you do not have to use a whole lot to cover your face! the scent is mild like the rest of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair line of products! It definitely left my face looking more dewy and hydrated, and make stayed on quite nicely when I used it in the mornings! I cannot say much on the effectiveness of the wrinkle reduction because I only used it for 5 days, but it is definitely a serum that I would buy to try a full bottle, full of potential! Thank you Topbox Circle for the #freeproduct that you let me try! A serum with a lot of potential!
