This is a great product to take off your makeup at the end of the day. I havenâ€™t used makeup wipes in about 3 years and this is such a great alternative. I have sensitive/dry/combo skin and it works great. This never broke me out and I have a history of terrible acne as well. Sometimes when it gets in my eye by accident it goes blurry for 30 mins or more but other than that I do recommend this cleansing balm. 100% recommend
