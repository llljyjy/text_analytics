I really love the texture of this product. It really helped the dryness under my eyes that I get in the winter time. It helped my make up not to settle on those dry areas. I donâ€™t know if it really helped my wrinkles go away but it definitely helped hydrate the area. I would recommend trying this if you have a dry under eye area. I also have a really sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin at all! Great moisture
