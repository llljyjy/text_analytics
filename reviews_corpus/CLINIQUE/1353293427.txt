This moisturizer is so hydrating, especially during the day while wearing a mask. I have combo skin, and creams tend to make me greasier in the day time during summer. This gel is refreshing and uber hydrating during the day. It hasnâ€™t caused breakouts so far and has a nice smell. It layers well with other skin care or makeup as well. nan
