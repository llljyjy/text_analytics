I received a small sample size in exchange for my feedback. The sample size was enough for me to use 2x a day for about 5 days so unfortunately I can’t really give feedback for any long term use results. In the 5 days I used this cream I really did enjoy it. I like the gel-cream formula because it absorbed really well and was very moisturizing. It didn’t leave my skin sticky and it did work really well with my other skincare. That’s super important to me. My makeup did apply really nicely over this too. I didn’t notice any reduction in my wrinkles but that’s prob due to the amount I received. I did notice that my skin did look a little more plump. Nice!
