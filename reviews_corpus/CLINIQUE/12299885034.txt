Full disclosure, I have very dark under eye circles, so there really isn’t much an eye cream can do to help that. That said, I did like the feel of this cream. I was also happy to have an extra boost of moisture when things are super dry in the winter. For someone who usually gets good results with eye creams, I would say this is worth checking out. For me, the price isn’t quite worth it to buy again. Nice for dry skin, doesn't help with dark circles
