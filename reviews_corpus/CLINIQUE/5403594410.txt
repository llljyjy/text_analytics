I received this product to try for free in lieu of my honest review. I put this serum on each morning after washing my face in the shower. It glides on smooth and smells great. Itâ€™s light and airy not thick and greasy. My skin felt soft and supple after. My make up went on perfectly and lasted all day. I would recommend this to everyone and I will buy it again. Amazing
