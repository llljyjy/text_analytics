I’m 53 and I’m fighting this whole aging thing as much as I can with just skincare and an occasional facial. No shade to those of you that do more, just not for me. So it’s no wonder that the first thing I look for is a good eye cream. The eyes are the first thing that tell your age, in my opinion. I’ve tried every eye cream from la mer to drugstore searching for a winner. But I may have finally found my winner in Clinique. I’ve been testing this Clinique eye cream for about 4 weeks now and I’ve seen a difference in my dark circles AND my fine lines! YES! Holy smokes usually an eye cream gives you one or the other but this one has improved both! I use this at night and it leaves a nice cooling sensation. It sinks in to my skin beautifully and I’ve had no irritation. I wake in the morning looking a little more refreshed and plump under the eye area. Consider me a convert! The only eye cream for my 53-year-old eyes!
