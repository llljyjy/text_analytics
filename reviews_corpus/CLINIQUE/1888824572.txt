I received a sample of this correcting cream and absolutely loved it. I’m not sure about correcting because it was only a sample, but It felt so great on my skin. It’s a light cream that kinda feels like a gel on the skin and the best part is I felt it was kinda like a base for applying your foundation and stayed on all day no touch ups. I will be buying the full size for sure. Awesome Face Cream
