#TopboxCircle When receiving this product I agree with the other reviewers that there was not enough product for myself to see the benefit of the formula for that reason. Otherwise when trying the product with the others I felt the application had a nice distribution, hydrating, and had a very nice revitalizing tingling sensation finish. Some of my facial problems include dermatitis, and in conclusion with the trial that Iâ€™d received I had no problems with the formula which was wonderful! Revitalizing!
