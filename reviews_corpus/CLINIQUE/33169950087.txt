I recieved a sample for this from influenster to try for free. My skin was actually dry and peeling so it was the perfect opportunity to see how quickly it would make a difference. On small application from the sample size (which still has some left!!) Made my face smooth  again which during my pregnancy, no other moisturizer could. I plan to actually purchase this now. A tiny little amount goes such a long way with my dry skin and Iâ€™ve never found that in any other product. Incredible!!!!
