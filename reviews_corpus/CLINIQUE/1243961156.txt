I like that this is dye free and fragrance free. My eyes gets really irritated with thick perfumed eye creams, but this didn’t feel greasy or heavy. I think it would be a good daytime eye cream, even for oily skin. I didn’t see immediate results. But it felt good on application. Non-greasy, dye-free, fragrance free
