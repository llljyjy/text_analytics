Good moisturizer!!! I was given a sample size product from Influenster and clinique to try for an honest review. I will say it is a very hydrating thick, creamy product. I have textured uneven skin and wrinkles. It did start to give my face some needed hydration and glow. I only had enough for 2 weeks and even though I don’t feel that’s a fair review I still gave it 4 stars because you could definitely see the potential in a short time. It never made my makeup go on bad and soaked in well. It doesn’t have a strong smell and a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend it to try. Staple product? Maybe....
