I love clinique, and I love this cream. I like the purple jar.  Its light, not greasy. No smell. Goes on and soaks in very quick. I noticed it working a little bit, but not much after the first application. My eyes underneath didnt feel tight like other creams can do, but did notice my wrinkles fading. I might have had better results but it only lasted about a week. I would definately recommend it if you have wrinkles or just circles under your eyes. Love the Purple
