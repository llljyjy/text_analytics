I received this as a complimentary sample from Influenster. I have a normal skin type. I used this moisturizer for two days during my morning and night routine. After using the Clinique Moisture Surge moisturizer, my skin felt soft, smooth, and plump. My skin looked healthier and hydrated. My skin also looks flawless and glowing. The texture of this moisturizer is a thick gel and has no scent or colour. The effects of the moisturizer lasted all day. I felt my skin on my face hydrated and looking beautiful. I would recommend this moisturizer to anyone who has sensitive skin or anyone who wants beautifully hydrated and glowing skin. I would buy it in the future as l can see lasting results with Clinique Moisture Surge moisturizer. Skin Moisturized & Beautiful
