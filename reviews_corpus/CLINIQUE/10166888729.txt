I received this product for free from Clinique & Influenster in exchange for my homest review. I noticed that my pores looked smaller & my skin appeared brighter after using my product. Unfortunately, it also left my skin feeling very tight which makes it a no for me. Also the sample is too tiny to be able to determine whether or not it helps with the appearance of lines and wrinkles. nan
