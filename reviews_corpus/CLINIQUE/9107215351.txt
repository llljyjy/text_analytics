This is overall a good moisturizer. The sample I received was small, so I only have a limited time I used it. I didn’t notice if my skin was moisturized for the 100 hours it claims or not. It doesn’t have a funky scent to it like some unscented moisturizers or lotions have. This is a nice light moisturizer. nan
