I was given a 1mL sample packet of the Wrinkle Correcting Serum by Topbox Circle and Clinique as a #freeproduct for trial and review.  The packet only contained enough product to use for about 2 days & nights, so my review is limited to first impressions and cannot speak to long-term results (for which you need at least a month of use) or value for money.  The formula felt nice and light on my sensitive skin and I had no adverse reaction.  That’s all I can say about this product, unfortunately.  At this price point I just cannot recommend the serum without at least a full-month’s trial. Lightweight.
