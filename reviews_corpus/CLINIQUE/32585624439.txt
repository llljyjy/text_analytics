I had the chance to try as #FreeProduct the Cliniqueâ€™s new Smart Clinical Repair line (serum, eye cream and corrective cream) thanks to #TopBox and these are my experiences:I needed quite a bit more of the Serum that I am used to feeling like I could really spread all over my face. Beyond the initial sensations on my face, the reality is that the product is quickly absorbed. I tried them before going to sleep for three days in a row and when I woke up the next morning, I felt the sensation of having my face with a layer of protection, very bright and really rejuvenated and hydrated thanks to the CL 1870 peptide complex with which they have developed their new formula.All formulas offered by Clinique are hypoallergenic and fragrance-free so they can be used with peace of mind on all skin types.#Clinique #SmartClinicalRepair #TrywithTopBox #FreeProduct #SamplesCanada nan
