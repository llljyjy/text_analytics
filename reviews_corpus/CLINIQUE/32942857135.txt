I recieved this product as a sample in exchange for a review with Influenster! The sample size was very small so I can give a long term review but just from the couples times I used it I found it actually make my face more dry. I do have sensitive skin. The second time I kept my face a little damp and that definitely seemed to help so there’s a little tip. Personally I wouldn’t buy it. But if you don’t have sensitive skin I think it would be great. nan
