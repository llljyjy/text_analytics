Clinique’s Pep-Start was my HG for daily, gentle exfoliation but sadly it was discontinued, so I purchased this scrub instead. Unfortunately, the tiny beads are hard, sharp, and scratchy. They don’t dissolve and stick to your face even with the shower water pouring down. They also got in my eyes, under my contacts causing significant irritation. So disappointed, Clinique. Hard, scratchy, sharp beads
