It’s a bit difficult to give a full review based on a sample, so I’ll go with my thoughts regarding what I did observe! I really loved the gel texture and the feeling it left my skin after applying it. I have sensitive skin and this wasn’t drying. My makeup applied nicely right after.  Now, I wouldn’t know the full term effect of this product, but from thw 2-3 times I used it, I liked it. Live the texture
