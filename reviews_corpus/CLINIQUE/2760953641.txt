Just ordered the 3.8oz again after purchasing the first round more than a year ago. A little goes a long way and it’s a miracle worker for removing every layer of the most stubborn makeup. I also use this to take off my sunscreen in the summer, since I’ve typically got 2-3 coats of it on by the end of the day. Follow it with a moisturizing cleanser and my skin is always glowing after. Will use forever
