Clinique Moisture Surge is an oil free gel-cream that locks in moisture for up to 100 hours. Its formulated with Aloe Bioferment, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamins C & E, and an Auto-Replenishing Technology which activates your skins rehydration system..Upon applying this cream my skin instantly felt soft and hydrated. I have combination skin with noticeable dry patches and I feel like this cream hydrated even my driest areas quite nicely. This cream is lightweight, absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave any greasy or tacky residue behind. I didn’t notice any scent to this product and loved the creamy gel-like texture. I can’t vouch for the 100 hours of hydration as I applied it during my morning and nighttime routine but it did however last throughout the day..Although there was only enough product for a few applications, I would likely try out the full-sized product based off first impressions.
