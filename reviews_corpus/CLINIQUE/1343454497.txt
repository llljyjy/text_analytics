I was needing an eye cream to help sooth my tired eyes and the Clinique smart eye cream worked wonderfully! I hadn’t been using an eye creams as part of my regular routine but I know Clinique eye creams have a great reputation. It is not a miracle worker but I noticed my eyes feeling less dehydrated and I haven’t had any breakouts from the eye cream. The texture easily absorbed into my skin. I have noticed some softening of the skin and wrinkles underneath my eyes. I also feel like it helped the delicate skin feel more supple and helped with dark circles on those days when I have to get up at 4am! I would repurchase this eye cream because it was soothing, non irritating, and I didn’t have any breakouts. Extremely sensitive skin approved! I am now using an eye cream daily thanks to finding this eye cream! nan
