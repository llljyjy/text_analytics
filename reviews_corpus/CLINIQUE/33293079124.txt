I like this product a lot, the first time i tried it, it did unfortunately flake on my rosacea parts. So instead of doing it twice i day i used it at night till my skin was use to it for about 2-3 nights. after the third night there was no more flaking so i changed it to every morning and night with my hyaluronic acid being under it. My uneven texture has gotten a little bit better and the redness by a bit so far :) Works for my uneven texture, not so much my rednes
