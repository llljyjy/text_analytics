Received this from #topbox #freeproduct for my honest review. I liked this serum. Rich and almost feels hydrating texture and didn’t need a lot, very small amount provided enough. It absorbed well and didn’t leave a sticky residue like some serums. I can’t comment on if it worked or not given the amount in the sample. I would think I would need to use this for some time to notice a difference. nan
