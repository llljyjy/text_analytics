#freeproduct #topboxcircle I received this product free to try for an honest review. I was able to get 2 uses out of the sample packet that I was sent. This review is purely a first impression review as even noted on the card, results are seen in 4 weeks of regular use. Upon first application, the scent is pleasant and my skin felt nicely hydrated and prepared for moisturizer. I had not adverse effects from application. It went on smoothly. Good first impression
