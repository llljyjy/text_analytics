I received this product as a free sample. Wonderful moisturizer for sensitive skin! No reactions or burning. Felt light and easy to blend into skin. Unfortunately because it was a small sample I cannot confirm if prolonged usage would have a different affect or cause flare ups. Loved the feel, the smell and the packaging. Good for sensitive skin
