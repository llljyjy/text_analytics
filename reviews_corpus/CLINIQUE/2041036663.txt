This works so well for my skin/makeup. I use long-wearing foundation (Lancome Teinte Idole) and Thrive mascara. This takes everything off soooo well. I tried a few of the K-Beauty brands but they didnâ€™t work nearly as well (still had makeup on despite multiple rinses), so I keep coming back to this old faithful. Works well for long-wearing makeup
