This product was ok but not sure I would be willing to splurge. I received a sample size from Influenster to try. I have aging concerns so I was excited. I have dry/oily combo skin with aging concerns and dark spots. This cream FELT rich and soft but it also clogged my pores and caused breakouts. The directions advise for twice a day application and I was glad I only did once a day. It was very small so I only got 5 uses total. Overall I cant tell if it lessened any lines or wrinkles. Just ok/caused breakouts
