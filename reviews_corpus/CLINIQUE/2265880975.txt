Lightweight on my skin. Makes it feel like a smooth silicone finish without the silicone.  My face was dry in spots and breaking out after one too many face masks and this cream seemed to heal my skin barrier!  I received this as a free sample but wouldConsider buying when my regular moisturizer (Peter Thomas Roth cloud drench) is finished! would buy this after using a trial size!
