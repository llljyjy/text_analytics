Sample size of this product with #topbox #freeproduct . I have used Clinique products for many years but this was the first time using the Wrinkle Correcting Line. I started using the serum a week ago and after a week my skin feels smoother and more plumped at the same time. It is a gentle non irritating serum that makes my skin look and feel more hydrated. I will continue to use this product as it is going into winter and in Canada that is a very drying time of year. Clinique put together a really great skin program with their Wrinkle Correcting Line. Definitely a Winner!
