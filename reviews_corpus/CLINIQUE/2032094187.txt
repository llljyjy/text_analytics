I really like this for a gel textured moisturizer (it’s like a crème-gel). I have incredibly dry skin and it added enough moisture, without adding any weight, so I love it for under makeup. I still reach for something heavier at night time but this is perfect for me for a day cream, and most aren’t plumping/ hydrating enough or just too heavy under makeup. This works just right. Perfect
