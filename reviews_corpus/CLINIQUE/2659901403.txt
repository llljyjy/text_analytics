I usually am pretty particular about my eye creams. I like them to be very moisturizing, sink in quickly, work well with my makeup routine, and they can’t leave a sticky or tacky feeling. I’m so happy to be able to find this cream because it checks off all those boxes for me. It’s a very rich creamy texture but isn’t oily at all. It’s layered well under my concealer, and still kept my eye area plump and hydrated all day. Nice formula
