This was a gel moisturizer. It was very lightweight, had no scent and felt really nice on the skin. However skin still felt a bit dry later and wasn’t fully moisturized like it is when I use other moisturizers. Retails for a great price compared to other brands. This would be a great cream for anyone who doesn’t need a ton of hydration and prefers a gel very lightweight but not great for dry skin
