I received a sample for review.I found this gel-cream pretty hydrating and it worked well on my combo skin. I love the fact that it is lightweight as it does not cause my skin to feel oily and heavy. I cannot comment on the product for its long term benefits as the sample lasted for less than a week; however, it is worth the try. nan
