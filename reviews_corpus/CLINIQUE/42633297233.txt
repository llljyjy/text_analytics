Received this #freesample from #topbox in exchange of my honest review. I really enjoy the texture of Clinique wrinkle correcting serum. I used it in morning and night. It absorbs quickly without leaving oily residue. This serum is very hydrating and works great under the makeup. But the sample was so small so I cant say how good this serum is for wrinkles nan
