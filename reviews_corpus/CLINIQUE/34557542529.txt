So I am in love with this hydrator. I got this as a free sample from Clinique, and have been using it religiously in my night and morning routines. I live in Canada so winters are harsh and hydration is a must.The first time I tried it I had it on for 16 hours and still felt the gelatinous like substance when removing at night. I did not feel like my skin was dry at all during the day and it had a beautiful glossy glow to it.The cream is lightweight, slight peach tint to it, goes on the cheeks clear and absorbs really fast into the skin, so I layer it under sunscreen for daytime. It is gel-like and watery, has a cooling sensation as it goes on the skin so I imagine it feels wonderful on burns or broken skin, especially since it has aloe as an ingredient!I’m not sure if it hydrates for 100hours because I re-apply every 16 hours or so as I cleanse my face in between and I just love the sensation as it goes on my skin. I also don’t find it overly sticky as with some other brands which is a big plus, nor does it feels thick and heavy and occlusive which would cause breakouts on my face. So far so good, I am loving this hydrator! Lasting light-weight hydration
