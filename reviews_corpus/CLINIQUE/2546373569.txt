I have dry skin with some fine lines on my forehead, 11 lines, and a fine line on each side of my nose.  Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream is rich and creamy.  The texture is silky soft.  My skin felt smooth and moisturized after applying the moisturizer.  It took a little while for it to feel absorbed, but once it did my skin felt great.  The fragrance was light.  I didn’t notice any anti-aging results initially, but over time I noticed my fine lines were less noticeable.  It’s not as potent as some other creams I’ve used at higher price points, but I would recommend it. A great choice from the Clinique line up.
