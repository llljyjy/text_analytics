I recieved a 5mL sample from Influenster for testing. If I had oily skin, I’m sure it would be wonderful. But since this is an oil free gel cream, my skin was unbalanced and started over producing oil in the three days I used this product. Also, like when I formally used Clinique’s classic yellow cream, my face became instantly red. Other than that, my skin was soft but I cannot speak of long term or if my skin were to adjust since I was asked to review from 5mL. nan
