I received this product to try out and have been using it consistently for 4 weeks. The key is consistently. You will not see results unless you use the product for at least 2-4 weeks. I do think this product does a great job of hydrating and minimizing the appearance of fine lines. I’d like to use it longer to see if it will correct wrinkles - that a tall order. But as long as it plumps out my wrinkles by minimizing their appearance and keeping my eye area hydrated, that is a big win. I’d definitely recommend trying this product for sure. Clinique has a great skin care line usually. liking it so far
