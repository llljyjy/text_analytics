I have used alot of eye creams, as I love skin care. I love the consistency of this eye cream. I love how it really moisturized under my eye. I use my ring fingers to gently apply. This is the first time my eyes have really felt moisturized. I have used this for a week now and I  loving it. I canâ€™t say anything about results as I have not used it long enough. I can say that I love the way it makes my eyes feel. I also can say it makes a difference in the puffiness under my eyes. I have really enjoyed using this product. I do love Clinique products I have not found a product I have not liked so far. nan
