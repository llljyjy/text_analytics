I received this product for free to test and give my honest review. Excellent offer because I love everything Clinique! It didnâ€™t disappoint! My eyes are sensitive so I must use a product that is anti-allergenic, no fragrance and still works. I think I found it. Still working on applying it twice a day but running out of product so may have to go get me one at Sephora! So far loving it! great product
