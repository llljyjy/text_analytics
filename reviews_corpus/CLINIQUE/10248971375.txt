I didn’t use Clinique products before. This moisturizer matches my skin perfectly. I have combined and sensitive skin. I also use some pharmaceutical creams with retinol nighttime. my skin is very sensitive and when applying the cream, I can experience a burning sensation. I hadn’t any reaction when I applied this moisturizer. Like it! Light moisturizer
