I received this from Topbox Circle (#complimentary #got it free) in exchange for my honest opinions. I received a sachet for trial and was able to squeeze out about 6 uses. The serum is light and feels very soothing on the skin. Being so lightweight is perfect for my oily skin and a little goes a long way. It is very easy to spread it all over the face and the skin feels well moisturized after using it. I will definitely recommend this to friends and family and will also get it myself. A lovely serum
