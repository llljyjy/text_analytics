I received the Clinique Smart Cream from Influenster for free for my honest opinion. I’m really enjoying this line. I have now tried the cream, eye cream, & serum from this same line. All are phenomenal. Work well with my middle age skin. Keeping mey skin hydrated all day. My skin is glowing. Has a slight scent but packs a serious punch. Continuing to use the sample wasn’t enough for a 2 month review to see if I’m seeing true results. I’m definitely noticing my make-up applying better daily. Water hydration for the face
