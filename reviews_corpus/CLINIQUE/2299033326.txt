I got this as a complimentary gift from influenster but my reviews are of my own.I have some smile lines around my eyes as well as dehydration.  This cream is lightweight (compare to the Kiehls avocado one) so it absorbs quite quick but I don’t feel like it hydrate  as well as other eye creams.  It doesn’t leave a greasy finish which is nice.I don’t have enough product to see if the promises are true but my lines are not as noticeable as before.  Could be product or could be the hydrationI like it as it’s fast absorbing and the rest are meh Not sure if it helps with wrinkles
