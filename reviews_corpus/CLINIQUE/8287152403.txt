I was given a sample of this to try via Topbox Circle and thoroughly enjoyed it. I’ve always been a fan of Clinique skincare and this did not disappoint. I found the serum to be fragrance-free and a little thicker than most serums, which I like. I tapped it into my freshly cleaned skin, before I layered the wrinkle cream from the same line over it. It seems to absorb easily.  I woke in the morning and my skin looked smooth, hydrated and slightly plump. Hard to tell what the long-term effects would be since I got a foil sample that’s 2 nights worth but a great serum I think ! Love it and that I got the opportunity to try #freeproduct with #topboxcircle. Love serums, including this one!
