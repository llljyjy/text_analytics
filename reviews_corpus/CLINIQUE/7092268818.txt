Disgusting feeling on your face like rubbing coconut oil all over with makeup, but the absolute best makeup remover I have ever used, especially for someone who wears a full face of full coverage makeup. I also like how gentle it is on your skin and I can easily remove makeup around my eyelash extensions without having to have any left over or damaging my lashes. Definitely my new go to makeup remover ! 100% worth the price. Obsessed
