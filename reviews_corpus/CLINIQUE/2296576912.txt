I love how this moisturizer is practically scentless, it is lightweight, smooth and easily absorbs. I found my skin absorbed it quickly and my skin felt fresh and supple. For me i had to reapply 1-2 times a day for it to keep my skin moisturized, I get quite dry on my nose. Besides that I was quite happy with it! nan
