I received this free sample from Topbox in exchange for my review. Sample size was only enough to use this product once so I wasnâ€™t able to properly try it. This serum has a nice light scent and contains peptides. I have dry to very dry skin so it was hydrating but more suitable as a summer serum for me. It absorbed well into my skin and feels nice. Sample size too small to properly try
