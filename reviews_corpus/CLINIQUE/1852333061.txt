I received a sample of this product for review and was pleasantly impressed. As a regular serum user I felt the consistency of the serum was thick and made my skin feel plump and hydrated throughout the day. I used it in the morning before my moisturizer and felt smooth and silky all day. I only wish it was a larger sample so I could see the long term effects but I like what I had  #freeproduct Smooth silky serum
