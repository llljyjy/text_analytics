This is a great all-around wrinkle fighting cream. It’s a little hard to get out of the jar due to the texture, but once I apply it to my face, it feels so soft and smooth! The scent is very similar to other Clinique products, so if you are ok with others, I’d definitely recommend this one! Soft Skin for the Win!
