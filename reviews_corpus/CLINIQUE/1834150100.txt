This is an easy-to-use, non-pore-clogging serum. It has a thin consistency which makes it easy to spread all over the skin. It has no scent which I greatly appreciated as well. I used it mostly at night and having sensitive skin, I was worried my skin would react but this was super gentle. Iâ€™m not sure if it did anything to prevent or repair wrinkles but it did no harm. #free product Easy to use serum
