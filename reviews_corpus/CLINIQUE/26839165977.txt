I received this product as a free sample from Influenster. I have a really dry and flaky skin. Its really tight once I wash it but applying this moisturiser gave it a fresh hydration making my skin feel quite soft and smooth. It immediately absorbed the gel like consistency of this moisturiser without feeling dry again. It worked for me whole day long without reapplying. I am a sucker for gel cleansers and moisturisers and I have used the clinique moisture surge before as well. I love it and will surely keep using it in this summer weather conditions when my skin has tendancy to be drier around the mouth zone. Hydrating and absorbing
