CliniqueI received a complimentary sample of Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream from Influenster. As skin care - and eye care in particular - is of importance to me, I was excited to test the product. Born with genetic creases under my eyes, the deck is stacked against my favor.My eye area easily gets irritated with allergies and lack of sleep. I’ll admit to not helping the situation by being chronically dehydrated. (Oh, and aging!)The Verdict?There has been a noticeable difference with my crows feet. My under eye area shows improvement as well. (See before/after pic. Seriously.)Note:- The cream did not irritate my eye area. - If there’s a scent, it must be very minor. - After applying the cream, my skin feels velvety. - The feeling is so different, that I started applying cream to the top of my hands and forehead.- My skin is smoother. - With makeup my skin sins are more well hidden.I dig it! It works!
