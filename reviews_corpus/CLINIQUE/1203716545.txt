I received this as a free sample from TopBox.  After using it for the past 2 weeks I can say that, along with the Clinique Smart Clinical Repar Wrinkle Correcting Cream and Eye Cream I’ve noticed that it has left my skin feeling soft and plump feeling.  I can’t say if my wrinkles have been reduced but I would be willing to buy a full size product to give the product more of a chance to work. Definitely worth a try
