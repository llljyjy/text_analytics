Definitely is an underrated product but honestly i’ve come across the perfect moisturizer that i was always looking for. Its perfect for combination and oily skins . I am going buy it again for sure it has that perfect gel like texture that will leave a glow and onto your skin as i had flaking skin around my mouth and nose. But now all of that’s gone it helps balancing my skin . I highly recommend it.. A perfect moisturizer
