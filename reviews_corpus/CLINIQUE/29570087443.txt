I received this product as a sample to review. I think it’s light and has a good texture. The cream soaks into your skin nicely and doesn’t leave it oily or wet residue. It has a pleasant scent. It feels like it would be a decent moisturizer. I can’t even vouch for the wrinkle work as I have not used it very long. Good!
