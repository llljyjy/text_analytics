I love this 100 hour moisture surge by Clinique. I have combination skin that is on the sensitive side. My skin absorbs this light weight cream gel like a sponge. Moisture surge leaves my skin feeling so soft and silky. Its not often I find a product that leaves me running my fingers across my skin because its so incredibly smooth. I have a day and night routine so Iâ€™m not certin on the 100 hour moisture effect, but I can confirm it absolutly keeps my skin hydrated and supple while im wearing it. I cleanse and tone my face than apply serum finishing off with the moisture surge morning and night. I definatly recommend all clinique products, this one sits high on my top 5. Beautiful silky-smooth skin
