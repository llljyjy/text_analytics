I have combination normal/dry skin and my main concern is signs of aging on my neck.  This formula is fragrance free however there is a slight chemical scent that fades quickly.  My first impression of this wrinkle cream was horrible.  I used a pea sized amount and I felt that it did not absorb well, felt sticky and appeared to cause a thick barrier on the surface of my skin.  I was determined to try again so I finally found that a tiny amount (less than half a pea size) was enough for my face and neck area.  I still wasn’t entirely pleased how my skin felt when I used the cream alone, under make-up it was much better.  I will say that I did feel like I had a bit of improvement in my skin’s texture in a short amount of time.  Despite feeling heavy on my skin I did not have any problems with breakouts or irritation.  Overall, I would prefer a formula that absorbed well without feeling heavy. A bit heavy for me
