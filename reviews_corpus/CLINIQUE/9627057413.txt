I’m an overall fan of Clinique products, and this was overall good; however, the sample size didn’t last me 12 weeks (as seen on their before and after photos) to see a long term difference. The formula is suitable for sensitive skin and worked fine as a day moisturizer. I would recommend the product. Good
