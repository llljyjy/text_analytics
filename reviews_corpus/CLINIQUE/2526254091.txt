Received Clinique Moisture Surge  100H Auto-Replenishing Hydrator Moisturize from Influenster to test. From the 5ml tester product that I tested, my skin felt hydrated. This gel moisturizer doesn’t have a strong scent to it. If you are looking for a light, non-greasy moisturizer that does its job of hydrating, this is the product for you. I personally won’t switch. nan
