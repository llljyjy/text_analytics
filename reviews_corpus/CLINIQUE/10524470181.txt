I received this as a small packet single use size so that makes it harder to test and give a full review for. #freeproduct .  It has a gel like texture that absorbs into the skin well. No offensive, strong fragrance which is nice. Not oily or leaves a residue. With a bigger sample size I feel I could give a more thorough review of the product. I could see that with prolonged use it would have benefits for the skin. Love Clinique products anyways and would try it out in the future. Great new Clinique product!
