I received a sample of this product from topbox. It’s hard to say if product was really effective since I only got to try it for few days worth. Texture was okay for me, a bit sticky at first but leaves dry finish after few seconds. I applied this first before the correcting cream. I didn’t get any harsh effects after application of this serum. nan
