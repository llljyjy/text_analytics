I recieved a sample from TopBox Circle for my honest review. I found it very hard to actually see if any repairs to the wrinkles around my mouth were repaired from the small sample. The serum was very easy to apply and it dried on my face very quickly. It was incredibly light and didn’t feel oily, I actually didn’t feel like I was wearing anything! I also didn’t have to worry about my face breaking out in a rash from irritation. Small Corrections
