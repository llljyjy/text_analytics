his every night for 30 days because I really wanted to test it out, a little does go a long way. I didn’t notice any visible changes in my 38 yo wrinkles. I felt as if I had to also apply a night time serum for this to feel as moisturizing as it should feel. All on all I wouldn’t recommend jt and I would repurchase Not my favorite....
