I received a small sample from TopBox as #freeproduct and I tried for 1 week using it in the morning and at night. I liked how a little goes a long way, doesn’t really have a fragrance and it’s not sticky after applying. In a week I found that the area around my eyes were felt softer and I am sure that a full bottle would show significant results. I intent to buy this product. So soft!
