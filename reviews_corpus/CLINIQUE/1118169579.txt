I just received a sample size, but it was enough for me to try and fall in love with this cream. A little goes a long way and it sinks right into the skin after application. Admittedly, I don’t have many wrinkles, but I feel that my skin stays hydrated and supple enough to help prevent any crepy skin from developing.It’s a keeper for my skin arsenal! Sexy Skin Staple!
