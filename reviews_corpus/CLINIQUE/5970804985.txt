Grateful to have received this #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox in exchange of an honest review. The amount of serum given in the sample for trial was small, so I could only test it for a couple of days. This was good for being able to see if there were any sensitivities or reactions, so that was a nice positive. For most serums you need to be able to test the product for at least 3 weeks, and this product even claims results over a period of 10 days. So unfortunately I am not able to accurately state if it corrects wrinkles, even when used in conjunction with other items in the sample pack since I saw no marked difference. It seems like a nice serum, but I would have to get another couple of testers of it in order to say if I would actually purchase it. Anti-aging serums are a competitive market so be sure to see what to invest in. Worth trying again in the future for a longer period I suppose. needs time to test
