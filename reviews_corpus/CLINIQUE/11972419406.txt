This is a great hydrating serum for fine lines and generally smooth, healthy looking skin. It’s a nice, lightweight formula with minimal fragrance—a bonus for sensitive skin. I used a sample of this for a couple of days and could already feel and see a difference in my skin. It seemed brighter and more firm. Looking forward to seeing the long term effects of this! Recommended for sure. Leaves skin feeling smooth and hydrated!
