Feels refreshing while applying and is your typical light weight moisturizer which feels great for the summer. I am a more oily/acne prone skin type and this did not worsen my acne or make me oily, but it didn’t feel sufficient enough in moisture. I think it’s not a bad moisturizer to use for the summer, but not sure about the other seasons. Would not personally purchase, but could work well for others looking for light weight and not overly hydrating. nan
