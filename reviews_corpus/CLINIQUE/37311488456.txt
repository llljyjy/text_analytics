Firstly the packaging is really nice, simple really is better in most cases! With the design it provides a great amount of product for the consumer. It truly is scentless so no worries about skin irritation and it glides really easy on the face. I always fight with my mascara removal leaving smudges behind but this cleanser instantly removed them. The one thing I prefer to have had was instructions on how much we are supposed to use, like a general average amount so we donâ€™t overuse or under use. nan
