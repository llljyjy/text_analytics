Really good product!This is a nice serum. It spreads easily. Not greasy or sticky at all. It is a light weight almost watery formula.It has a nice light scent. I liked the scent of it.I wore it at night and during the day. I noticed my skin was a lot softer after about 3 days or so and my skin was less dry. It moisturizes as well.I wore it under make-up without any issues.#freeproduct #Topbox nan
