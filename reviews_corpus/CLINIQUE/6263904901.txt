#freeproduct #trywithtopbox I received a sample size of this serum to test and review and so far I think I like it! Unfortunately, the sample size was quite small so I donâ€™t feel like there was enough product for me to see the long term benefits. It did, however, leave my skin feeling hydrated and soft and did not irritate my skin in any way. I think this has the potential to be a great serum! Really nice
