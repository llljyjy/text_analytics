I received this from Topbox in exchange for my honest review #freeproduct. The sample I received was too little and it was very hard to actually see the results. I was able to use it both in the morning and evening for a couple of days. I loved the consistency of the serum. It didnâ€™t feel sticky & applied smoothly on the skin. My skin was feeling hydrated and glowy. Definitely worth giving it a try! Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum
