I received a sample sized version of this product to test out and review, however, the sample size was incredibly small and therefore I cannot review it thoroughly. From my first impressions, this is a lightweight moisturizer suitable for the Spring and Summer months. It is hydrating and does absorb quickly. I would not agree that it keeps the skin hydrated for 100 hours if that is the claim. Itâ€™s a decent lightweight gel style moisturizer, but nothing earth shattering. nan
