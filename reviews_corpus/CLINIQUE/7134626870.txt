I received this product free from influenster in exchange for an honest review so, here it is! I have combination skin. I have some dry patches, oily in my t-zone and struggle with enlarged Pores. I didn’t mind the gel like texture, it was just something I wasn’t used to. I found it hydrated my skin well without making it super oily throughout the day like some moisturizers I’ve used. I does leave my skin super soft and I didn’t break out using it. I would buy this product in the future Enjoyable moisturizer!
