Personally, I had good results with this product in that the vitamin C did help lighten the patches of my skin discoloration.  The problem for me though, is that the instructions say to use one container per week, but you actually have way more product in there that is more than a week.  I used up the product day and night until it was gone and for me it took a few weeks to use it up (I wasnâ€™t going to throw away any product).  The other issue for me though is just the way that it is packaged, ideally I would like to use less plastic, I would like to buy more items packaged in glass or other recyclable and/or compostable packages, I know that is a nit picky complaint, but I would just like to have some better way to use a fresh made vitamin C for topical use. Good for skin brightening
