OBSESSED. Iâ€™ve tried so many different eye creams and all of them burn or do nothing. I use retinol eye cream (helps prevent milia too) and nothing else is hydrating enough to prevent the irritation of the retinol. This and retinol are the DREAM combo for eyes. My bags? Gone. Dark circles? Gone. Incredible. nan
