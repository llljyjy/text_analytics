I have been using the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum for the past couple days. I applied it on in the evenings, right before going to bed. I have seen a nice improvement to my overall skin texture and I love that my skin feels hydrated. Will be purchasing for more results. I received this #freeproduct in exchange for my honest review. nan
