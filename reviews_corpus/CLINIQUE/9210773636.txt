I received a sample size to test and give an honest opinion. I have used it daily for 2-3 weeks now. I found that a small amount is easily absorbed and easy to smooth onto my skin. It doesn’t feel tacky or greasy. My skin feels softer and some of the very faint fine lines are faded, from my skin looking plumper. I have noticed that my skin seems more hydrated and no dry skin spots recently. I docked a star because I don’t see the value at $68/jar and I’m not seeing the results like I would want for that price point. I will continue to use up my sample. I docked a star because there is a really long ingredient list that I don’t know what 1/2 of the ingredients in this are supposed to be doing for my skin. I don’t think this is a bad moisturizer, just one I don’t plan to purchase for myself. Good but not great
