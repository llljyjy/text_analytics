I have been using Clinique products since high school and now in my late 30s, I felt like I needed a product that was suitable for my aging skin. I received a sample of this from #topbox and found that it worked wonders. Itâ€™s very hydrating and found that the wrinkles around my mouth started to fade almost instantly. I used this before applying the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting moisturizer. I would definitely recommend this product! Love it!
