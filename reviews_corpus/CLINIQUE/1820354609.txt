I have combo skin and I’ve been using this moisturizer for about two months.  I’ve been very underwhelmed by it; it doesn’t feel very moisturizing for a product that claims to be very hydrating, and under sunscreen it’s even worse. I don’t typically have intense dryness, but on days where I use this under my normal sunscreen I have flaky patches and my skin feels tight. Wish I’d saved my money for something better than what is functionally no better than a tiny pot of Jello. Very light moisturizer, meh
