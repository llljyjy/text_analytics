I’m surprised and pleased by the texture that’s like coco butter but not greasy. It’s easy to apply but it won’t get waterproof mascara off so I need to use another remover after. That’s a shame because otherwise, I would stick to that product. If you don’t use waterproof makeup than it’s great. nan
