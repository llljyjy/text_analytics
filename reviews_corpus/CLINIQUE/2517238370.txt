I received this product as a #freesample from @trywithtopbox. The serum wasn’t too thich or sticky, but once applied I could still feel it’s presence on my skin and I didn’t really enjoy the feeling. There is no scent which is a bonus as I am sensitive to fragrance but this did not bother my skin in that manner. I only received a small sample so I cannot speak on the long-term benefits of this product. nan
