My wrinkles honestly did disappear, or at least itâ€™s not as apparent. It is as if this cream is magic. I definitely would recommend this product, it is worth the splurge for sure. It goes on so smoothly and a little goes a long way. The scent is mild so that helps with people who are sensitive to scent! A must have!!
