I got this trial-sized product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have tried this product before and I used it regularly during spring/summer. Was happy to be given this for a review as well. Love the cooling and light hydrating effect it has on my skin. It’s quite light as a concentrate and easy to apply. Totally recommend if you’re not looking for a heavy/creamy moisturizer. Great moisturizer for the summer
