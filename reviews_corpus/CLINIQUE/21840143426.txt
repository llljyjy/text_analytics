I like that this serum is fragrance free, because I have sensitive eyes. It absorbs quickly into my skin and just feels like a boost of hydration. I love that it has retinol in it.  I prefer using this in the evening.  I only used a sample size so it is too soon to notice any real results as far as correcting wrinkles goes but I would like to try it again in the future. Feels like a boost of hydration
