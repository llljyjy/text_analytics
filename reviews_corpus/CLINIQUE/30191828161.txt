I’m exchange for my honest review, I received a sample size of Clinique’s Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum.   I was able to use this  product for a couple of days so it wasn’t enough time to notice too much of a difference but I did like the serum. My face can be sensitive to some products but this one felt nice on my skin. Wasn’t greasy or too fragrant. I would like to try a full sized size of this product. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Wrinkles be gone!
