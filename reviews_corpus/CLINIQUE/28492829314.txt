I was recently sent a sachet sample size of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum for free from Topbox and Clinique to try in exchange for my honest review.From my past experiences of using Clinique products, they are always of very high quality so I was excited to try out this product. The texture of the serum is very watery and light weight and absorbs really easily into the skin, but doesnâ€™t leave a sticky feeling, which can be common with many serums. This serum left my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized immediately after use.However, I am unaware of the long term effects and results that this serum would provide in terms of correcting and minimizing wrinkles as I was only sent a sample size of the product.
