I love this moisturizer because it worked and kept my sensitive skin moisturized throughout winter! When I moved to canada I started having very dry skin to the point that it would  crack, I went to shoppers and this was the one recommended to me by the sales person, I tried it and loved it! I do have an acne prone skin and I never really had a problem with this. Incentiviced
