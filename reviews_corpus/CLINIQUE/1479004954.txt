I received this product as a sample in exchange for an honest review. Out of all the samples I have received in this Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting line, this serum is the one I liked the most. This serum is light and absorbed quickly, leaving a nice, smooth feeling to the face. For the wrinkle claims, because the sample was too small, it is hard to judge whether it would work in that aspect. #freeproduct nan
