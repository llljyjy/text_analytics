I’ll be honest, the sample size wasn’t really enough to give a full review but the agreement was review for product. In the 3 nights I used it, the consistency is nice. Smell is non offensive. Seems like a decent moisturizer but I wouldn’t say deep hydration. I have some dry spots from retinol use and they didn’t really improve them. Once I switched back to my regular one it improved overnight. Not convincing enough to make me buy it. Meh. Trial sample wasn’t enough to sway me
