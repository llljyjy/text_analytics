I received this #freeproduct from Topbox Circle. I love the serum because it is easily absorbed by the skin. No greasy or oily feeling afterwards. It made my skin feeling soft and radiant. I didn’t see any noticeable effect on my wrinkles since I haven’t used it for a long period of time. Sample is a little small to see visible results. I’m interested in buying a bigger size though. Interesting!
