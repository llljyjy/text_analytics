I received this as a sample with a purchase although I had tried it before. I have oily skin so I would find this too rich for daytime use. Iâ€™m winter, for nighttime it is great! I live in a cold climate so chapped skin is common in winter. No scent and only need a little bit to cover entire face. Would recommend and would buy full size. Very moisturizing for dry skin!
