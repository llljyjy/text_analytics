I’ve been using CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream for about 3 weeks, since I received a free sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I can’t say I’ve noticed any results yet, but I do like how smooth the product feels on my skin, and I like that it is not scented. I’m definitely going to keep using it. Smooth and light eye cream
