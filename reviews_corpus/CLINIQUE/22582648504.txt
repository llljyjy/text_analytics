I have combination skin that is very breakout prone. I love thick moisturizers that really feel like they quench the skin. This is it! Itâ€™s lightweight and soaks in quickly, but leaves the skin feeling refreshed. I used it morning and night, and the moisture seemed to last all day. It did not cause my very sensitive skin to breakout, which is a problem I have with many moisturizers. I would definitely purchase for myself, although I did receive this one through Influenster. Love It!
