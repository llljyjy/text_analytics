I have been using Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream since last one week and really liked it. I used in in the night after cleansing my face. This cream felt very smooth and absorbed quickly. I liked the mild fragrance. I am starting to see the reduction in the wrinkles but I need to try this cream for much longer to see itâ€™s full benefit. I will definitely keep using this cream. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Great Cream
