I’m a little confused by this product. I received such a tiny sample I don’t feel it was enough product to be able to properly test and try out. There was no details on the product explaining use or benefits. The texture of this product felt like a primer and left a smooth layer on my face, so was it actually giving me hydration or was it an illusion? Is it a Primer?
