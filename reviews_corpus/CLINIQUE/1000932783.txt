Influencer sent me this product free in exchange for my honest review. I have dry, aging skin and I live in a really humid climate and i have a pretty set skincare routine. Since this is has peptides and HA as it’s major ingredients I used it 2x day for about 2 weeks in place of my normal peptide serum. Not really long enough to see any major impact, however I did enjoy the cream. It feels very luxurious and sinks right in without feeling greasy or sticky and it is hydrating enough that I didn’t always need my day moisturizer. It played well with my daily sunscreen and made my skin look and feel great under makeup. Although I wasn’t able to use it long enough to see any noticeable results, it felt great and I like the ingredients enough that I would continue to buy this. Feels great
