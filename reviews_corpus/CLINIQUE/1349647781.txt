I first would like to note that I received this complimentary from Influenster to try and give my honest review. I have been using this for about 3 weeks. I can’t say I really notice a difference but it it does leave my skin soft and I don’t have to use much and the texture is creamy and not oily like a lot of serums / creams. It absorbs rather quickly into the skin. I am sure the results vary per person and if probably notice a significant change with prolonged use. However, I also don’t have really defined wrinkles (yet. Lol) Smooth Cream, Not Oily
