I’m 38 and out of no where started having acne on my back. Ive tried the Versed Back Up Plan and Topicals Clearing Mist and neither worked, but this does! I don’t love that it’s in a bar form but you only need a little at the end of your shower and you’re good. I’ve started using it on my face for any random breakouts and it’s been great but slightly drying. I just can’t believe that I don’t have a single spot on my back now. I’ve felt so embarrassed and now I finally wear backless clothes and bikinis with confidence. it works
