This was a great moisturizer! Although I was only able to try this a few times due to the sample size, I appreciate that I was able to try it out. It was definitely hydrating and even though I didnâ€™t see very much improvement yet, I liked that the consistency was nice and had a stunning scent. I used this in the evenings, and I would definitely try it again. Great!
