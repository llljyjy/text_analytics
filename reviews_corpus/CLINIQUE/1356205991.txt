This is a great product. It may take some adjusting for those not used to a cleaning balm, but itâ€™s an excellent makeup remover and detox solution for skin. It bonds to anything built up on your skin and easily removes it. This will be a staple in my products now. I received it from Influenster just as I was looking for a new solution to makeup removal. Yes, yes, yes.
