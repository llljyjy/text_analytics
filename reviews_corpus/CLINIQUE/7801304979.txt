I got this from Influenster & was excited to try it. I just started it so I’d like to give it a few weeks to see what it really does, but it hydrates nicely, doesn’t feel oily & if u use it with daytime skin care it doesn’t alter makeup application at all. I’ve been using it both day & night so I’m eager to see how it works after some time. give it time
