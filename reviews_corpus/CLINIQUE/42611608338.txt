I received a sample of this serum as a #freeproduct as part of the topbox circle program. Although the sample size was small, I was able to stretch it out for a couple of days as part of my nighttime routine - followed by the face cream and eye cream. The serum is lovely, it is not greasy or sticky as other serums can be and it just absorbs right in to the skin. I can’t speak of it’s lasting effects, as the sample was small. nan
