The Clinique Smart Clinical repair cream is smooth and lightweight which is perfect for the under eye area. I have been wearing it daily, in the morning under my makeup and at night after my cleanser. When I wear it under my makeup because of its lightweight consistency, my concealer doesn’t clump up over it. I have very dry, delicate skin and some brands irritate my skin and this one doesn’t. I also like that it doesn’t wear off, since I have very dry skin some products do not keep my skin hydrated throughout the day and this keeps my under eyes smooth and feeling moisturized all day. Great texture and consistency
