I received a small sample of this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I have sensitive and dry skin, and I’m in my early 40’s. I’m happy to say that this product did not cause me any irritation and it is very hydrating. It has great skincare ingredients and I would purchase this on my own when I run out. Non-irritating and hydrating
