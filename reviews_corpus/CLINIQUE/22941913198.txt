Glad to have received this sample from Influenster and on day 4 of usage. It feels nice on the skin and is a great base under make up. I typically get dry spots between my browns and you cannot see a single sign of dryness. I don’t understand the marketing of 100H…why that’s even necessary…but I can say my face feels the same at the end of the day. I’ve added it to my cart but I am struggling with the price point. Still on the search for something comparable…
