Received a sample for the wrinkle correcting serum from topbox circle. It was a sample size so I couldn’t use it for a long time to it’s effect but I would love to add that the serum felt really good on the skin & didn’t make it too dry or too oily. Would love to try a full size product to see it’s effect. Good
