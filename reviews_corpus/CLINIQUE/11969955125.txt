I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion. I have normal skin and only received a small sample. I do like the consistency of the cream and the feeling of it under my eyes. You do not have to use a lot of the product. I use it at night with my night time routine. I can’t say I have seen a noticeable difference because it’s only been 2 weeks but I will continue to use it. nan
