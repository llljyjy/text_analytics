Clinique products work good for my skin and this is no exception. I have dry skin especially living in a cold part of the country where winter is 8-9 months out of the year and I love using this as my day time moisturizer. I prefer using gel like moisturizers during the day. This product just soaks into my skin, which is exactly what I need. It has a pleasant light scent. I would recommend this product to others. Great moisture hydrator!
