I was sent this from Influenster to try out and give and an honest review, and now I’m about to spend $68 to get a full-sized container. Shocked. I tried this out for almost a month and by the end of week two was starting to see a difference. Those wrinkles in the side of my eyes are nearly gone, but more shocking was my chin. I have been gifted with a gloriously double-chin by the women in my family. The wobbly part gets crepey really easily. I tried this there as well, and although it didn’t make my extra skin go away, it did make it smoother and plumper (in a good way). I also have exceptionally sensitive skin, and have had zero reactions to this. Total win. Given for free, will be buying when gone
