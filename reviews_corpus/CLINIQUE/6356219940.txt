I received this product for an honest review. This was a great product, with a luxurious feel and absorbed great. I don’t think it lasted 100 hours, like we’re talking 12-15 hours before my skin felt like it needed another moisture boost. But perhaps that’s Canadian climate for you. I would possibly purchase if I found this on offer. The neutral scent was appealing, and I liked that my skin felt supple, and not sticky after use. Great product, but does not last 100 hours
