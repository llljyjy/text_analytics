I have normal/combo skin and I used this product for a few days to see the results. Right away it absorbed straight into my skin leaving no residue behind, it has a very unique light weight texture thatâ€™s quick absorbing. My skin felt soft and light and not weighed down. Later on in the day I noticed that my skin continued to feelmoisturizer and hydrated. This would be a good formula to use during the summer months, or if you live in a very humid area,  but I would not recommend for super dry skin or for dryer months for combo skin. Good for humid areas
