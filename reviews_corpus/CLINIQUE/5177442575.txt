I got this #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox for an honest review. I have been using this serum as a part of my morning and night time skin care routine and I must say it is a staple for anyones anti aging skin care routine. I started noticing fine lines slowly fading and my skin looking as plump as ever! I am suffering with major dry skin as I live where winters are harsh and ruin my skin, but I was amazed that it kept my skin hydrated and plump. This is a must have product for anti aging skin care routine. Best serum for anti aging skin care routine!
