I had high hopes for this product.  Who doesnt want younger looking wrinkle free skin.  I really liked the texture and it went on very smoothly.  However 20 mins after I put the product on my skin is still sticky. I have used it several and my skin does seem moisturized.  I am going to continue using it for another few weeks to see if I have a change in my skin. nan
