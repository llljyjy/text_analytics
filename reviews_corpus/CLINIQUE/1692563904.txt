I received a sample from Topbox #freeproduct.  I liked how light weight and fresh the serum felt while leaving my skin feeling hydrated and primed for the lotion.  It was hard to assess if there was any change to the fine lines on my face given the limited amount of time that I used it for. Iâ€™d need to use it for a longer period of time to see results. I would definitely consider including this product as part of my routine. Good serum year round
