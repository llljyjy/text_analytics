So this felt like a regular moisturizer to me. Considering the price I was expecting a bit more of a wow factor. Yes it’s unscented, yes it was slightly smoothing upon application but there wasn’t a drastic change immediately for me. It spread easily and didn’t feel sticky, it sank into the skin fairly quickly. I didn’t use it long enough to test out long term wrinkle results bc I did get a large white head when I was using this but I was also trying a new hair oil so I don’t feel comfortable blaming the moisturizer for it but I did stop use of both. I just can’t fully back this one especially when you take the cost into consideration as I feel like for almost $70 usd there are better options. basic moisturizer
