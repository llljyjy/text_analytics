I have been a loyal Clinique user for at least 15 years. I love their make up, cleansers/ moisturizers and perfumes. When I found out I was selected to try this reparative eye cream I was so excited! I was a little thrown off by the size of the package, but a little goes a long way! I love this eye cream! It really helped with my puffy morning eyes and I did see a subtle decrease in the small creases or “wrinkles” around my eyes. It’s also very hydrating and doesn’t leave an oily residue. I will absolutely purchase this when I run out! I highly recommend this eye cream if you’re in the market for a gentle eye cream that packs a big punch! Simply amazing.
