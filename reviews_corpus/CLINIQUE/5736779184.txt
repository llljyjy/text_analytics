I am pleasantly surprised by this serum, which I received as a sample #freeproduct #trywithtopbox. Although the amount is not enough, I only used it at night and I liked how well it moisturizes. It absorbs well, isn’t geas or sticky, and doesn’t have a particularly strong smell. I would love to try it again over a longer period of time. Moistutizes well
