I was chosen to be a part of group to try Clinique Smart Eye creme. I’m a big fan of eye cremes especially those that promote lessening fine lines and puffy eyes.  I tried this and used it for two weeks consistently, but I wasn’t as impressed with the results with what I have been using.  (My husband is using the sample and loves it!) First, I did not notice any changes to my under eye circles. I have fair skin and they remained. Second, I noticed milia appearing in the corners of my eyes after use. Third, the creme seemed rather heavy and I only used it at night after the first week. It felt greasy and thick on my under eyes even when using a small amount.  I’ve used Clinique in the past and had no issues, but I’m disappointed with this product for MY skin. It may work great for others, but not for me. nan
