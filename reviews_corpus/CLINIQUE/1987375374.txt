As an avid, long time Clinique make up user I have never actually tried the skin care line. I’ve used another high end face cream for the last few year, but then I received a sample to try and will absolutely be purchasing this for now on! It only takes a small pea sized amount for the face and goes on like silk. It absorbs and moisturizes so quickly and leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft and smooth. I’ve noticed a big change in my skins clarity, evenness and moisture after using it for a week so far. Incredible moisturizer!
