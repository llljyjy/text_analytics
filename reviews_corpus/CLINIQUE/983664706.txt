I bought this because I decided to start using waterproof mascara again, and I’m so glad I decided to try it. Usually my eyes get super irritated with makeup removers, but this balm doesn’t irritate them at all, and you don’t need to spend a long time rubbing your eyes to remove the makeup. It’s gentle and feels moisturizing (like it doesn’t strip all natural oils and leave your skin feeling tight). I definitely plan on repurchasing, and I love how Clinique offers a few different sizes. The 1 oz was perfect for me to try, and it would also be great for travel. Best Makeup Remover
