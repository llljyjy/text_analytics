I received a sample of this product from Influenster for free. I really liked this moisturizer. It’s a very lightweight texture, which I like because I find my skin doesn’t do well with a heavier face cream. I typically use this moisturizer at night and my face does feel hydrated when I wake up. I would definitely consider purchasing a full size of this product…I think it would be great for dry skin in the winter. Review
