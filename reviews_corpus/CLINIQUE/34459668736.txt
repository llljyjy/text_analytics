received a complementary sample of Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream in exchange for my honest opinion from @Influenster.  I’m in my late forty’s and have dry and aging skin.  I used this product in the morning and at night. I will be buying this product soon.  This cream is light weight, silky, creamy, and fragrance free.  You only need a small amount and it absorbs fully into the skin.  It’s non greasy and I was able to apply my make-up over it with no issues.  This left my skin feeling Smoother and more hydrated. I noticed the fine lines and wrinkles are slightly less noticeable. Hydrated and Stronger Skin
