I love anti-aging serums. This is really good stuff as it helped make my face appear smoother and more youthful. I do prefer slightly scented products but this is fine as well. I like that it is sulfate free and contains retinol. A little serum goes a long way so a bottle will last quite awhile. I applied this each night after my skincare routine and did notice some results within two weeks. I would like to continue to use to see the wrinkles fade a little more. I think used together with the other Clinique skincare products you will be guaranteed to notice results. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to fight any signs of aging in their face! #freeproduct A little goes a long way!
