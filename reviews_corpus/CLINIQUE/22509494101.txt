My initial review is based on a 5ml sample, so I can only speak to the short term effects. i LOVE this moisturizer! The texture is thick for a gel, and applies really smoothly. My skin feels immediately moisturized. I have combo skin, and this didnâ€™t make me break out. I am 100% going to buy a full size bottle of this. LOVE the texture!
