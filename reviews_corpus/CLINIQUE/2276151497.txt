This is by far the best cleansing balm I’ve ever used! I have extremely sensitive and reactive skin and this is the first cleansing balm that hasn’t irritated my skin or eyes. The ingredients are really simple and there is no fragrance (which is an A+ in my book). Great for sensitive or reactive skin
