After receiving a sample #freeproduct from #TopBoxCircle, I tried the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum. I used this serum twice a day on my morning and evening beauty routine. On a clean face this luxurious serum is easy to apply and you get instant results. My skin is glowing. It’s light, it helps to repair, hydrate and boost my natural collagen production. It also prevents further deep wrinkles to develop and it’s for all skin types. Magical! Glowing Serum
