I received this product from Influenster for my honest review. I wouldn’t say this is a wonder product; there isn’t much you can do outside of Botox or surgery to actually correct wrinkles. I am hesitant to deduct more than one star, though: it’s simple and effective. It’s not too expensive. And it provides great hydration, which can effect how wrinkled your skin appears and can certain help keep your skin from wrinkling more quickly or you maintain proper hydration. Also a bonus for me: most under eye products clog my pores and cause weird under eye breakouts. Did not have that happen with this product, so it appears to be slightly less rich and non-comedogenic. Also, no weird smells. So many “anti-aging” products have a scent that seems to actually try to hasten aging. Quality under eye hydration
