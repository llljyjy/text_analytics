Iâ€™ve used this cream for 2 weeks now, applying it to my face twice daily. The cream has a light pleasant scent that is not overpowering and fades as it absorbs into your skin. It did not irritate my sensitive skin and after just 2 weeks of use, my skin felt moisturized and there was some improvement to the fine lines around my eye area. A little goes a long way. I used it sparingly as I was given a sample size that lasted only 2 weeks. Good results in as little as 2 weeks!
