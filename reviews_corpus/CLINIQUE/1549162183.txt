I received this #freeproduct from #topboxcircle in exchange for my honest review. In the information I received with the sample packet (enough for two to three uses), there was not information that clearly indicated this contained a retinoid. After the second day of use, my skin was quite red and itchy, and there were no noticeable benefits given the short time period.  Given how my skin reacted, I think I will stick to my retinol alternatives. May be Effective, but my Skin Reacted Poorly
