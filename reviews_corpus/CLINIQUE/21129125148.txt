It is what it says on the can: it’s a moisturizer. For me the best part is that it’s a super basic moisturizer with a nice light texture so you can add pretty much any serum or other treatment to it. It’s a great staple in any routine because you can add new products without ever worrying if they can be used together. Ok on its own but GREAT for mixing
