I received this product free from Clinique and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is a decent cleansing balm/makeup remover. I actually have never tried the original so I don’t have anything to compare it to, but I like it. When i first opened it, I have to admit I didn’t think I would like it. It’s black and seems a little hard/waxy to the touch at first, but as soon as you rub it between your fingers it transforms into a slippery oil that is effective at removing my everyday makeup. My only complaint is that it’s a bit messy… even though it rinses clean, I tend to be a pretty messy washer so there’s always some black drips on my sink/the front of my shirt if I’m not careful.I think this would be ideal for people with combination/oily skin as it helps to detoxify pores. If you are a pretty dry girl like me, I might opt for something a bit more nourishing, but this could be nice for the warmer months! nan
