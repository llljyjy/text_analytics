I being using this product for couple weeks, I definitely feel my eyes area more moisturized, when applying feels thick, but absorbed really fast, making a quick process, when u doing couple of steps in your routine ( at 40 feels u need a product for each small part of your face lol). So far I Also notice help with puff eyes, specially when u sleep isn’t going great! Didn’t notice any changes when comes to wrinkles, but also I think wasn’t enough time! Will keep using!!! Moisturize is the key word!!
