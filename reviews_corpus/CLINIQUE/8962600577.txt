I really liked this moisturizer! It does have a sticky feel once it’s applied but that eventually goes away. My skin felt super soft, bouncy and hydrated. It absorbs well and doesn’t feel greasy at all. I have combination skin and break out very easily with new products sometimes and this didn’t break me out at all. I did receive a free sample but that has zero to do with my review for this product, as I am to leave an honest opinion, which is exactly what I did! I have no doubts, that if you can get past the initial sticky feeling, that you’ll loce the results. I feel like it helped my skin barrier heal, after using a few chemical peels as well! It most definitely heals your skin barrier!
