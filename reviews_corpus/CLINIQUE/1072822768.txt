1 received a sample size of this eye cream complimentary from Influenster from review purposes. I wanted to use the whole sample size before I wrote my review. The sample lasted about 3 weeks. I used morning and night. I am really picky about eye cream, but I really enjoyed this one. It was thicker cream and absorbed into the skin nicely. My under eye felt super moisturized after use. My makeup in the am applied nicely over it. I have only been using short term so I canâ€™t attest to the long term benefits this eye cream is suppose to provide, but I like it enough I would repurchase and continue to use Enjoying so far
