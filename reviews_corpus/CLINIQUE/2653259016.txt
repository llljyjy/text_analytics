I received this product for free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. I really liked this cleansing balm because unlike some other ones, this one was smooth in taking off my makeup but it didnâ€™t leave my skin feeling too greasy or oily. I have oily skin so greasy residue is always one of my concerns with cleansing balms. I really liked this new product from Clinique. Great not too greasy cleansing balm!
