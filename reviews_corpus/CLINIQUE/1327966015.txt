I’ve been using this cream for several weeks, and I’ve definitely notya few positive differences. My eyes are hydrated, I can’t remember the last time dark circles were noticeable, and some of the fine lines around my eyes seem to be reduced. Now, in full disclosure, I don’t have really any noticeable wrinkles in the eye area -- maybe some crinkles when I smile. So I’ve mainly been focusing the cream there, and I’ve noticed some tightness, although it’s not consistent. Regardless, I’ve always found Clinique products to be pretty solid. Good eye cream
