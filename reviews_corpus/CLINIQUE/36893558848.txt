I’ve never really been one to use a serum, I find them oily and heavy and it doesn’t agree with my skin.    I received this as a sample and was asked for my honest review, so I gave it a try!   After a week, my skin feels so refreshed.   I wish it wasn’t so expensive as it love to integrate it into my daily routine!  It’s not heavy, not oily, absorbs nicely.   My skin feels so fresh wjth the fall weather that snuck up on us! Saving grace face lift!
