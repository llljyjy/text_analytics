I received this #freeproduct from TopBox and I found that this was just a typical serum. It did absorb well into my skin without feeling greasy but I was underwhelmed. I didn’t enjoy the scent of the product. I can’t speak on the long term effects because I only received a sample of it. I used it at night. I would suggest trying this in-store before buying it. nan
