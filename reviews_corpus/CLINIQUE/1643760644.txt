I received this product for my review. As someone with oily and acne-prone skin, I appreciate a lightweight moisturizer that won’t break me out. This is a refreshing gel-cream that has an oil-free texture. Upon applying it to the skin, it immediately gets absorbed and deep moisturizing is felt. The skin feels plump and healthy! It has such a subtle scent that it’s pleasant to wear. I would have liked to have received a bigger sample in order to have been able to test the product out for a few days longer to see how it really acts on my skin. Refreshing and hydrating gel-cream
