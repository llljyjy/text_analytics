I always love using Clinique products.They were a staple in my teens and twenties. This product is new and fresh and works well. It is a perfect face cream textureâ€”not too light but also not heavy at all. Moisturizing and absorbs quickly. My face looks hydrated, which is step 1 for younger looking skin. I have noticed improvement in fine lines as well. Photo below is taken after 3 weeks of use. Nice face cream!
