It’s okay for dry skin. If you have oily skin I fell this would be perfect. It doesnt leave a tacky finish at all and the skin absorbs it right away. My skin’s quite dry and it may work in the summer but definitely not enough for other times of the year. Love that it’s not scented! not enough for dry skin
