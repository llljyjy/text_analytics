I love that this product doesn’t have a strong smell! I was wondering if there would be a scent with the charcoal but there really isn’t! I also love how easy it is to use and that it doesn’t take much product to take off literally a day’s worth of makeup without a wipe! We love saving the environment. I wish it would do better at taking mascara off, though. I wasn’t sure how to get the mascara off and wish it would do that a little better, but it does great with everything else!!! nan
