I received this product for free from influencer and Clinique, for me to try out and give my honest opinion of their product. I was impressed with this Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream. I really love this formula because it goes on easy and absorbs quickly into my under eye area. The formula is a little thick, so a little goes a long way, but it really works to smooth skin and reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles. I like using this in the morning because it helps my eyes look refreshed and gets rid of puffiness, lines and wrinkles. I noticed results in less than 24 hours. The eyes are very important. I was happy to see my eye area look smoother and more rested. This is a powerful little wrinkle-fighting cream. Powerful wrinkle fighting cream
