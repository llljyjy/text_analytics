I received this #freeproduct sample from topbox in exchange for my honest review. As the sample was not very big I can only provide my initial thoughts on the product. I used this serum on my freshly cleansed face. It went on nicely and was absorbed into my skin very quickly. I did not find it to be overly scented. I did top it with a moisturizer however; it did not seem to dry my skin out or cause any irritation. It seems like a great product. nan
