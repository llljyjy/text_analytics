So disappointed that Clinique changed the formula of this product. Moisture surge has been my holy grail of moisturizers for over five years. It used to be perfectly lightweight yet moisturizing for oily skin. Now, this is way too heavy for oily skin and takes so long to sink into skin. Might be a nice winter/evening moisturizer. Change in formula
