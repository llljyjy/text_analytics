I really love the texture and fluidity of the Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum. It has a beautiful pearlescent sheen to it with a very light scent that just glides over my skin and absorbs beautifully. It feels almost velvety to the touch and instantly transforms my skin by supplying a rush of hydration. My skin feels so soft to the touch and it works very well under makeup. I personally found the same size to be too small to provide noticeable wrinkle reduction, however I do love this serum and am very impressed with the smooth texture and instant softening of my skin! *I received this #freeproduct for testing purposes. Beautiful lightweight texture
