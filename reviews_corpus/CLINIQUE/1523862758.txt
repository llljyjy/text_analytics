I receive this product for free in exchange of my honest review. #freeproduct #trywithtopboxFist I have to tell that I only a 1ml sample... so it’s hard for me to tell if this product works well. I was able to use it only once. I use it at night. It left my skin well hydrated. I love that it’s non greasy and there is no fragrance, so it’s great for my sensitive skin. I use a serum every morning and night. I did like this one! Serum
