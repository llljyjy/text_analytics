Thank you @topbox and @clinique for sending me this CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Serum for free to review. This serum definitely fights wrinkles, it made my skin feel more younger-looking and even more rejuvenated, nourished, moisturized, hydrated, softer and smoother! This Serum is for normal, Dry, Combination, and Oily skin types! This is a perfect Serum for anti-aging and for people like me who have skin concerns like fine lines, wrinkles and dryness! This is a laser-focused serum that targets the look of wrinkles from multiple angles and helps care for, visibly resurface, and re-plump the look of skin. This advanced serum visibly targets the full range of lines and wrinkles from three separate angles. It supports natural collagen production with CL1870 Laser Focus Complex for visibly stronger skin, smooths the look of texture with a potent retinoid for a resurfaced appearance, and hydrates with hyaluronic acid for a re-plumped look with less-visible wrinkles. Skin is left visibly rejuvenated, smooth, and supple to the touch with a look of youthful radiance and bounce restored. This serum is made with a CL1870 Laser Focus Complex™ that supports natural collagen production for a visibly stronger skin-support structure. It is made with potent Retinoid that supports natural cell renewal to shed dull surface skin and speed fresh cells to the surface for less-visible wrinkles and is also made with Hyaluronic Acid Concentrate that rapidly hydrates, visibly restoring suppleness and volume to diminish the appearance of fine, dry lines. I also love that this product is oil free, fragrance free, free of sulfates, SLS and SLES. I definitely would recommend this CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Serum and I definitely will be buying it. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Amazing Serum!
