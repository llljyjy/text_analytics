I received a complimentary product in exchange for my honest review. I am in my late 30s and though my skin tends to look younger, I do have a couple of stubborn wrinkles, including my “concern wrinkle“ on my forehead (it shows up when I’m making my concerned face!). I tried this product and I feel like a little goes a really long way, which is awesome. while my wrinkle still exists, it does seem much softer after using this product. nan
