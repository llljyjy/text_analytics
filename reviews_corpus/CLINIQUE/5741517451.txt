I received a free small sample from Topbox Circle to try in exchange for my honest opinions. I was able to use it for 3 days before it was done so it wasn’t enough to see any real change. I found the serum very light and easy to apply, and didn’t stick on my skin afterwards. The scent wasn’t overwhelming and didn’t aggravate my skin. nan
