I have been searching for an eye cream for awhile and I have to say I’m very impressed with results so far.  The whipped cream is light and airy, no fragrance (I love this) and it’s not sticky like some products.  A little bit goes a long way, so the price point is actually very good.  I use this in the morning before my moisturizer and sunscreen.  It leaves my eye area hydrated and smooth, something I desperately needed.  This will most likely become a staple in my daily routine.  Give it a try, I promise you won’t be disappointed. I'm so in love!!!
