I received this product for free in a Voxbox incentivized by Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are genuine and my own.Usually, I use sensitive skin baby wipes and/or water to remove my makeup, because I feel like using a whole makeup remover is too much work and a lot of products tend to irritate my skin. However, I was surprised at how easy to use this cleanser is. It’s a balm that you just warm up in between your fingers and rub over your makeup and rinse with water. That was all it took to fully remove all of my makeup from the day, I found that a little goes a long way. I even used a makeup wipe to test if it removed all of my makeup, and it came out clear without any residue. My skin felt clean and moisturized after using, and it didn’t irritate or break me out. Gentle but effective
