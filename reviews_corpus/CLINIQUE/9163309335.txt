This will always be my gold standard for cleansing balms. It truly does take everything off + the soft lather makes it feel refreshing and doesn’t leave a residue on skin. It’s not stripping, doesn’t break me out, and one tub lasts forever for someone like me that occasionally wears light coverage makeup. The only downside is that it can leave your eyes blurry, but I don’t care enough for that to affect how much I love this product. Simply the best!! Forever my holy grail product!!
