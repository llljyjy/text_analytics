This whole lineup of products from Clinique is great. I received this serum as a #freeproduct from Topbox. I tend to stay away from Serums as they tend to feel oily going on and dry my skin out. This one did feel a little sticky aftwrwards, however when paired with the cream, my skin felt perfect. I could instantly feel my skin tightening too. nan
