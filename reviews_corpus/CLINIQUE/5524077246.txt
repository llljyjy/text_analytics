Love the texture and the way it applies to the skin. Not oily at all but extremely moisturizing. Noticeable difference after one use. I use a lot of acne treatment creams that dry out my skin and cause flakiness. I use this before bed and my skin is much smoother and make up applies much easier the next day. 10/10 for this one. Great results!
