I love this sunscreen!  It’s weightless, mineral, and doesn’t leave a white cast on my light to medium skin. Leaves a gorgeous dewy, glowy finish similar to Charlotte Tilbury’s Hollywood flawless filter. I’m sightly irritated that it’s only 1 oz for $31, but this stuff is so good, I’ll continue to buy it.
