I’ve tried many, many, many mask over the years. I love face mask and this one is probably my all time favorite. This particular mask isn’t too thick, drys down nicely, and really helps with the oils in your face and helps with your pores. The 1 percent salicylic acid is just enough to gently get the job done! It has a very light and simple scent. You can leave it on for a few minutes or for a few hours if you want and then wash it off. This can also be used as a spot treatment; I usually put the Clinique 2 percent spot gel on the pimple first and then take a little dot of the face mask and put that on top. The mask should last a while too. Each one that I’ve had lasted for months; and because of the price point is worth every penny. I definitely would recommend giving it a try! Awesome Mask!
