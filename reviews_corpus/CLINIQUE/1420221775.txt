I have very fine wrinkles on the sides of my eyes that seemed to be less obvious after a few weeks of use. The crème is very silky and does not feel sticky like some of the other products I have used. This is not a miracle fix but I am overall very happy with it. I don’t know how well it would work for deeper wrinkles though. Worth a try
