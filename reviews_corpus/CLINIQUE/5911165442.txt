My skin is normal- combo oily side. Basic everyday moisturizer. Feels great when first applied; absorbs well, works good under makeup, doesn’t have a strong scent. Skin feels soft and hydrated. (But not nourished, which isn’t what this moisturizer is for anyway.)The texture is not creamy or sticky, it’s a gel consistency. Not sure about the 100 hours.. You will still need to use moisturizer nightly. Plus price is a little expensive. I do like that the packaging is recyclable. Nothing exciting about this guy but he gets the job done. I did receive this product for free to review. I don’t think this is something I’d purchase in the future- I need more nourishment. Nothing Exciting
