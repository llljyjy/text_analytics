I picked up this set because I needed to replenish my supply of moisturizer, and it was the exact same price so I have zero complaints as for the bonus freebies that came with the full size bottle. If you have dry skin, it doesnâ€™t get much better than this lotion which is more like emulsion and it keeps your skin nicely hydrated. Tried and True moisturizer!
