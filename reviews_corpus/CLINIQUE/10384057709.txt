I received the Clinique’s Moisture Surge 100H Auto-Replenishing Hydrator Moisturizer as a free sample from Influenster — the name says it all. It is extremely hydrating on my sensitive leaning combination skin.Lately my skin has been quite sensitive because of retinol and I find that the moisturizer gently calms it down without being to heavy on my skin. It’s instantly adds a shine on my face and I think it comes from the thin gel-like texture of the moisturizer..Typically, during retinol, I have to moisturize every few hours or pat on some face oil, but the Clinique Moisture Surge moisturizer did well on my skin overnight. I like the product and I have recommended it to a few of my family members already.. I bought a bigger size of the product since the sample got done in a couple of days. Buy it, it won’t disappoint!! #moisturesurge Moisture surge indeed!
