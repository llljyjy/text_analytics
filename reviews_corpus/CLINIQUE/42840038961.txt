I received the product as #freeproduct. I love this product as it is fragrance free. Not super pleasant when applying, but later itâ€™s ok. The sample I received is too little and it is very hard to give a fair review based on the little usage. Therefore, I hardly see any effect of winkle reduction as I only used for short period of time, but I think this product is worth to try. nan
