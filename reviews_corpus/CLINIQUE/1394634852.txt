I first tried this from a sample I got with an order and just after one use I knew I needed to order it. My skin felt so hydrated. After ordering the 100ml size I ended up receiving the product in a sample size to test out which was perfect timing as I already knew I liked it. I use this product after I apply my serum and put a moisturizer on top to mock everything in as o sleep with the ac on so my skin is even more dry. Hasn’t broken me out or caused any inflammation. Definitely will repurchase once I’m done with my mega size I just bought. very hydrating
