I started buying this for my daughter two years ago when her acne situation was raging. I gave her a little container I got a from a Sephora sample bag and she fell in love. She had been prescribed benzoyl peroxide and I knew she would need a good moisturizer. It saved the day and she swears by it today. I just purchased the 5th or 6th jar, I’m not sure because when she’s running low, she lets me know. She also uses Niacinimide by the Ordinary at night. Moisture surge may seem a bit pricey but it’s worth it and a little goes a long way. She may get the odd pimple every few months but her skin his clear and smooth. Happy teenager, happy life. Loved by my teenage daughter.
