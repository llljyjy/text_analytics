I received this Clinique smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting serum for my honest review. The sample size lasted me about two applications, my skin felt smooth and soft instantly right after using this serum. I love how it absorb quickly and leaving my skin feeling super smooth all day. Too soon to tell if this product helps with the wrinkle repair but if I used it long enough I am sure I will see a good results. Thank you topbox and Sephora. #freeproduct,#trywithtopbox. A must try!
