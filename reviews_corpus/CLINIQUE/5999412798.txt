This moisturizer was really nice on my skin (normal/sometimes dry). I’m generally not super picky when it comes to moisturizers, they just can’t be overly fragranced or leave my skin feeling tacky or like they haven’t absorbed. This moisturizer sinks in, doesn’t have a strong scent and left my skin feeling hydrated and soft! Nice lightweight moisturizer
