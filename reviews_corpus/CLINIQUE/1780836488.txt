I received a sample of this product to review, but I have actually been using this product for a couple years. I love this product because it is hydrating and gives me gooey skin without feeling sticky. It also has very minimal scent which is nice for those that are sensitive to smell. The only downfall is that I find that my makeup pills at times so I tend to use this as might night time moisturizer. nan
