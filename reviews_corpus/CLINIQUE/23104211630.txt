I got a sample of this serum from Topbox in exchange for my honest review. It was a tiny sachet for all skin types. It smells okay and does not have a very heavy texture. I have been using it for several days, but I cannot say if I noticed any changes in my skin texture. I would not purchase a full size product just because I still prefer water-like serums that do not sit heavy on the skin. I am not sure if I am impressed by it
