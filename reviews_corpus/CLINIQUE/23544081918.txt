I received a sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve used this for about a week and a half, and there was no notable difference. It’s fragrance free and lightweight,  which was good since I have sensitivity to scents and sensitive skin. It’s worth continuing to try to see a difference.  Clinique is a great brand especially if you have sensitive skin. nan
