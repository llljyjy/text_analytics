I have dry skin so I was excited to try this moisturizer. I only received a small sample that lasted a few days but it made my skin feel soft after although a little grippy as well when first applied. Skin looked plump after use and brighter and It definitely left my face moisturized but would like to try longer to see more skin effects. The texture of the product was more like a primer feel. Overall, seems like a good product and sits nicely with makeup if you let it sit properly. I would recommend this product for people with dry skin and I feel it would be good for acne as well as itâ€™s not oily what so ever. I will probably buy product to give it the real test. It seems to be good !
