I got sick of using makeup wipes because they made my face dry so I was looking for a good cleansing balm and the young man at the store said this was the best one and i do not doubt him it leaves my skin hydrated and clean after I remove all the makeup. I still use micellear water for eyes because the cleansing balm kinda sucks for the eye area but thatâ€™s OK. Will buy this again 100%. Great cleansing balm
