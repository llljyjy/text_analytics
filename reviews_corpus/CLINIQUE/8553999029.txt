The same size I was given to test and review was only enough for 2 uses at most. So it’s hard to say how I feel about this product after an extended use. It’s a gel cream, so it feels like splashing your face with water when you apply it - which I lovely! But I seriously question the 100hr claim as I felt like I needed to rehydrate my skin midway through the day. And I did not apply any makeup and went with natural skin while testing. Would be a great product if you have an oiler complexion! nan
