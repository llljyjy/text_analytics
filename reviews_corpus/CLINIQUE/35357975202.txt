Yep, it really is great. This is the only thing that gets my eyeliner and mascara off entirely. I have sensitive eyes and am a contact lens wearer, so if I donâ€™t get my eyes perfectly clean I wake up itchy and red the next morning. This stuff really works wonders. I bought the mini size and only use it for eye makeup so it is lasting forever, need a 1/2 pea size amount. Really is worth it.
