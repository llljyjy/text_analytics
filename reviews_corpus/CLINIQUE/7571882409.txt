I received this wrinkle correcting cream free for my honest review. I love the texture of the cream and I can use it as a primer before makeup or after I take my makeup off as a night cream. It stays on and does not feel like it is caked on at all. As for the wrinkles, I have been using this for 2 weeks and I can see the difference especially on my forehead and neckline. I would recommend this product. It works
