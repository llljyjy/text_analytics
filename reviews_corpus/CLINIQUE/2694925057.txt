I bought this by accident instead of the Pep Start tinted sunscreen by Clinique which is one of my favorites for when I need SPF 50 protection. This one isn’t as good. It’s untinted which means it leaves a white cast. It has a thin, runny texture that I usually prefer for sunscreen rather than thick lotions because I find the thin texture easier to spread. I don’t find this overly moisturizing or drying so I can use it now that it’s warm without becoming a greasy mess. Overall this is a decent choice if you have fair skin (and the white cast might be less obvious on the lightest skin tones) or if you have any skin tone other than fair and plan on always wearing some kind of foundation or tinted moisturizer on top to hide the white cast. Overall I’d still recommend the Pep Start tinted version of this product (which confusingly is cheaper than this.) Just get the Pep Start SPF 50
