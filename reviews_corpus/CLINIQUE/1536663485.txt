I haven’t used Clinique products in while, but received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. I was pleasantly surprised at how moisturizing this product was without feeling overly heavy or greasy. I replaced my night cream with it for approximately two weeks and woke up with skin that felt nourished. While I didn’t receive a same big enough to gauge long-term results against fine lines and wrinkles, overall it was a pretty powerful moisturizer that I’d definitely consider adding to my daily routine. nan
