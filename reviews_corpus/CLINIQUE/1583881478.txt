First off, I’m a huge skin care advocate and Clinique falls right into the category of favorites. This absorbs right into your skin to moisturize and nourish and leaves the skin feeling amazing and rejuvenated. I love all the aspects of this! You won’t be disappointed! After prolonged use, the fine lines diminish and you glow! I'm very pleased!
