As someone with dry skin and small patches of reoccuring eczema, I’m always worried about what goes on my face. I received a sample of this and was pleasantly surprised. While I will say it’s not a “perfect product“, it did make my dry skin feel softer and moisturized and didn’t irritate my sensitive skin at all. I probably wouldn’t buy a bigger bottle but perhaps a smaller one. nan
