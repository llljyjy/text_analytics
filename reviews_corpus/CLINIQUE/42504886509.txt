The product is a watery-hazy-transparent liquid of medium density, odorless. I used Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Serum once a day on dry skin after cleansing and toning. After “closing“ the night nutrient. The serum moisturizes the skin, but it does not smooth out any wrinkles, much less get rid of them, as it is written in the promises. I had a sample of the serum, so I can’t see how the serum changed the skin how much I can’t. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair
