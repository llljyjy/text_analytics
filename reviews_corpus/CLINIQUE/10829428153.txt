It’s a nice cream, the texture, the way it absorbs, and the way it feels. Is it life changing? No. Did I see instant results? No. Did I see results after 2 weeks. Again, no. It’s a moisturizer, no special powers and I’ll prob stick with the stuff I usually use. This product was complimentary for review purposes. Feels nice
