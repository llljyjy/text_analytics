Absolutely in love with this product! Was sent to me as a gift and I couldn’t be happier! The consistency of this is what gets me! It is thick and creamy and goes on like butter but does not feel cakey at all or like my skin cannot breathe. My skin has definitely been way more hydrated and it’s loving all the ingredients packed in this moisturizer. Clique definitely outdid themselves with the amount of ingredients, such a big piece bc of goodness for your skin! Loving the peptides. I definitely notice after almost two weeks the skin around my eyes getting tighter, a little bit longer of use and I’m sure they will continue to fade! I love that they decided to make this a moisturizer and not a serum, leaving no greasy feeling behind. I think this could be good for all skin types! I will absolutely be purchasing this now again and encourage you to try it. Well done Clinique! I just love skincare! nan
