I received this free from Influenster in exchange for an honest reviewThis is the FIRST Clinique skin care item I’ve tried that has not inflamed my skin. I don’t know what they usually add but thankfully this didn’t have it. Feels moisturizing, not heavy and a little goes a long way. If you love the brand, add this to your arsenal Didn’t turn me red
