Listen, living in Michigan a girl can get slapped in the face by wind, drenched from head to toe in sleet, then get sunburned in the same day.This eye cream not only protected me from the dreaded flaky eye, I saw results from the retinal in a matter of days.Best part for me (I have crazy sensitive skin and am prone to watery and stinging eyes from heavy products) is the fact that itâ€™s light enough to wear both day and night!As I age I am increasing aware of lines around my eyes and mouth. This eye cream made me feel like all those years of damage I did were invisible!This is a must try! Must try!
