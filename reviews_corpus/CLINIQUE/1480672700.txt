I have combination skin, so i love to use the gel texture product to avoid the oily cream feeling. This product is a great gel cream that provides enough moisture without making my skin feels stuffy or oily. I can see result right after one use. This product wonâ€™t disappoint and I would recommend this moisturizer to my friends. Good Product
