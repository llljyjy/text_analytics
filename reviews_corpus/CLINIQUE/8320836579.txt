I actually really like this moisturizer, it absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave your face slimy or sticky. I have combination skin and it’s hard to find a moisturizer that it ain’t over bearing. I don’t think it has a smell.. if it does it’s super mild. But overall a very light feeling moisturizer. Not too shabby
