I received this #freeproduct in sample size from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review.  I did notice some difference in my fine lines for the 3 weeks I used it.  I only used it at night and I have no deep wrinkles, only fine lines around the eyes and mouth.  The product absorbed into the skin nicely and leaves the skin feeling moisturized and soft, which I really liked.  I would love to see what prolonged use of this product can do for my fine lines.  Overall, based on my sample product, I have high hopes. Loved this serum
