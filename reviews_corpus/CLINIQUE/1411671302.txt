I like the cream. It’s lightweight enough and doesn’t feel greasy. I do wish that it was scented- at least a little. I haven’t noticed a huge difference with my eye wrinkles, but I wonder if I had a full size sample to try if long term use would make a difference. I received this sample in exchange for my honest review from influenster. Lightweight Unscented Moisturizer
