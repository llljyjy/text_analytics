I received a trial size sample of this product in turn for my honest opinion. I really like the consistency of this but I wouldn’t use it as a moisturizer… I mix it with my primerbase and it left my face hydrated, plump and soft and my make up went on like a dream. A little pricey for what it is.  As it’s a sample I am not sure of long term benefits. nan
