I received a complimentary sample of this product from Influencer.I have combination skin and live in very dry climate. I do like the consistent and absorbancy of the product. It seems to hydrate my skin well and I like that it’s unscented. As I have very sensitive skin, I am happy to report this product didn’t cause any breakouts or redness for me.Due to the size of sample I only used the product a handful of days so not sure if this product would be a staple or not as I can’t say for long term effect. nan
