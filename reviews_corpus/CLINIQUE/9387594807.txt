I received a sample size of this product from Influenster to try and honestly review.  Since I only had a sample size I was able to get two uses out of it.  Iâ€™d say this is a very good mousturizer. As soon as I put it on I knew I liked it.  100 hours of moisture is a huge claim but I have very dry skin that is acne prone and sensitive.  I feel like it would maybe be 100 hours of moisture for some one with oily skin, but for dry skin it seems good for daily use. It's pretty good!!
