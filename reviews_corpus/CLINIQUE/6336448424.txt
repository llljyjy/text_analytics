I really enjoyed the silky texture that really just melts away makeup and dirt. I used this as a pre-cleanser before my Philosophy cleanser to get rid of some heavy holiday party makeup!  I enjoyed the neutral charcoal smell and that it kept my winter skin hydrated. A fun new addition to my makeup remover routine!
