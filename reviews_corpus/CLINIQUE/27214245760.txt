I got to try CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Serum from TopBox Circle for free for my honest review. I used this for 3 days in the morning and night. This is a fragrance free Serum. In my opinion it was good in terms of giving my skin a smooth finish post application and made it feel hydrated. The product sample dint last me long enough to know the true effect on my fine lines and wrinkles sadly, so I don’t really know how long it would take to see a difference in that area.#freeproduct#trywithtopbox Fragrance free hydrating serum
