I have dehydrated, acne prone skin here in my 40s. I need a hydrator that does not cause breakouts, but does keep dryness at bay. Unfortunately I believe this cream to be the cause of multiple small pimples. It is very rich, but it does soften and plump the fine lines above my upper lip, making them appear less deep. I think I would have preferred this peptide formula in a less rich formula, like a gel, but then it might not smooth wrinkles out as much.If you are not prone to breakouts, have fine wrinkles, and enjoy a richer moisturizer, this would be a cream to check out. Thanks to Clinique and Influenster for the opportunity to try this moisturizer. Rich plumping cream
