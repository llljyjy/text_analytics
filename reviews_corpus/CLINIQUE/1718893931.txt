I received a sample of CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum #freeproduct for my honest review from Topbox. I used it day and night along with their correcting cream and eye cream. It absorbed well into my skin and cause no irritations on my acne prone skin. It wore nice under my make up but it did make me a little oilier than usual by the end of the day. The sample didnâ€™t last long enough for me to see a difference for my fine lines. Sampled for 2 days
