Pleasantly surprised by this product! A small amount goes a long way, and the consistency is smooth and easily absorbed. I didnâ€™t find that it lasted quite as long as my regular moisturizer, but it did have immediate and noticeable positive effect on my skin. The smell was a little strong but not unpleasant. Smooth, easily absorbed and lightweight moisture
