Honestly,  not overly impressed with this moisturizer! I will say though, I received a micro sample in the mail “for review purposes” and could only use it for two days, however my skin was left wanting more. I have dry skin so I’m always on the hunt for moisture miracles and sadly this didn’t hit the mark! Wanted to love it
