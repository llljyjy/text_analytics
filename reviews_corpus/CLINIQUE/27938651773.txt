This wasnâ€™t for me. I used it at night care skin routine after washing my face. Can I just say that this whole line, the scent is weird? It smells almost chemically to me. The serum has a light watery texture, absorbed into the skin, but my skin felt dry after. I got a sample satchet, got two applications out of it maybe, not nearly enough to give an informed review. Considering the price this is going for, I would have expected a lot more from the product. And it was not enough product to see if my skin improved in any way. I got this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox A Pass for Me
