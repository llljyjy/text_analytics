I received this as a #freeproduct sample. Overall this seems like a good serum. I can’t comment on its wrinkle repair over time as it was just a sample packet size. The consistency is l not as thin as serums that come with droppers, but not exactly a cream either. It did feel nice when applied and dried well. It doesn’t have a powerful scent which I prefer as I do have sensitive skin. I had no issues with a reaction. nan
