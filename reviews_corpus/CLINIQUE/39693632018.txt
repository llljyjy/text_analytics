I received this #freeproduct from topbox in exchange for my honest review.I applied this serum under the wrinkle correcting cream at night and on its own in the morning before applying makeup. I really loved the feeling of the serum on my face. It is very light weight and I found that it had almost a watery consistency. It felt smooth, not sticky and has no scent. When I applied it in the morning it made my makeup application so much smoother! My skin looked so nice and plump after use! I am definitely interested in exploring this product more! Loved it!
