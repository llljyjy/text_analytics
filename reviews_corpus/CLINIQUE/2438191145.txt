I received this #freeproduct in exchange for a honest review.  #tryitwithtopbox The sample had about 3 application content of the serum. I enjoyed unscented smooth serum which felt quite pleasant. Some serums Iâ€™ve used felt very sticky and just sitting on the surface. This serum absorbed into the skin well and quite hydrating. I used it with the other eye cream and the wrinkles correcting cream. Must have wrinkle serum
