I received a small sample of this Clinique Wrinkle Correcting Eye Serum from Topbox for my honest review. #free productWith such a small sample i can’t give a full review on how well the product works over time. I did love the actual feel of the Serum. It is not greasy and felt like a light water like serum that absorbed very well and quick. It was completely odourless as well which was great. I hardly had to use much as it spread out amazing so that’s awesome when wanting your product to last long!I used it in the morning after I washed my face & following the use of Clinique’s Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream and I used Clinique’s Wrinkle Correcting Cream right after to get the full potential effects.I did enjoy this product and would recommend it to everyone! :) Great non-greasy & quick absorbing Serum!
