I didn’t receive enough of this product to use more than a few days, and in those days, what I noticed was a silky feeling cream that glides on the skin. That usually means lots of dime the one or similar ingredients, which I don’t normally care for as they don’t do much other than disguise the problem rather than fix it. I wasn’t thrilled with the chemical scent either, but that is not a deal breaker if the product preforms. It was moisturizing and feels luxurious. The purple and silver jar is pretty on my vanity (nice touch) and I am intrigued by the claims. Just wish I could give a review based on a longer trial period rather than a first impression only.
