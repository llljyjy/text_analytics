I have mostly normal skin and used this sample sent for review. I used a cleanser that results in drying skin to test the results. It has a gel consistency and performs like most gel moisturizers out there. The moisturizer absorbed quickly on the skin and felt soft. I still felt tightness on the skin but did not need to apply it again throughout the day. The moisturizer compares in cost and affordable. nan
