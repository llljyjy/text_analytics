I received this Clinique Wrinkle Correcting Serum sample packet from TopBox Circle as a free product. I got to try it with my evening routine and it worked well. I like the non-greasy lightweight texture and it doesn’t have any smell which is awesome. My skin didn’t get irritated and felt hydrated after applying it over my face. However, I didn’t get to see a huge improvement on wrinkle reductions because the sample only served about 3 times usage. I enjoyed using it and would like to try it again to see its benefits. #freeproduct Non-Greasy and Lightweight!
