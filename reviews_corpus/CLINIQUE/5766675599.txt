I tried a small sample of this in exchange for my honest review. I liked the feel of this a lot. I have oily skin and generally avoid gel creams because they go on like silk and then just turn to grease after a few hours. This one stayed soft with a satin finish. It’s lightweight but you can feel the hydration it gives. I think it balanced out the moisture for my skin. Because of the pink colour, I thought this would smell like grapefruit but it didn’t actually have much of a scent. I think this is supposed to give 100 hours of moisture but I’m far too oily to know if that’s true. I just washed it off in the morning and went on with my skincare but there were no dry flakes. nan
