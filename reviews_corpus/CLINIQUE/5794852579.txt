Ok eye cream. I received this complimentary in exchange for my honest review and unfortunately the amount of time to leave the review is limiting. I wish I could have waited the 12 weeks for the full effect. But so far, I think it’s an ok eye cream: it applies nicely and smooth, it doesn’t run into your eyes and it doesn’t interfere with my makeup. Unfortunately, I haven’t noticed any changes as far as wrinkles or signs of aging. I’ll continue to use it, as I love Clinique’s gentle ingredients, but I probably won’t be paying over $50 for another one once this is over. Just Ok
