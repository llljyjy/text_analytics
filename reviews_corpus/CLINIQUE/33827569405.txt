Thanks to Influenster and Clinique for the free Clinique Smart Clinical Repair eye cream.I want to start by saying wrinkles and lines are a good thing. We are so fortunate that we get to age and have life.I will say that I am a huge believer in moisturizer and giving our skin hydration.So this new Clinique Eye cream was fun to try out. Over the past 3 weeks of using, I have noticed an increase in the hydration under my eyes.The cream is thick, but glides easy as it’s non-greasy. There is also no fragrance which I prefer in creams for the face. It also didn’t sting or make me red, which is an ongoing game my sensitive skin likes to play.If you’re looking for a new moisturizer to add to the mix, I’d recommend this. Hydrating
