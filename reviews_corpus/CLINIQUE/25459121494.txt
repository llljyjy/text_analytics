I recieve d this product from Influenster and Clinique free for my honest opinion. I LOVED this cream! Use sparingly, a tiny bit goes a very long way! It soaked into my oily skin and kept me looking hydrated but not greasy. The scent was clean and light, barely there after rubbing it in. I can’t say enough possitive things about this cream, BUT the price is up there. I removed a star because it’s so expensive. It’s not a miracle cream, it’s just great not perfect. For that price I’d expect more product. I didn’t see any amazing transformation with my little wrinkles, but I only had a tiny sample that lasted about 2 weeks. Great moisturizer, but pricey!
