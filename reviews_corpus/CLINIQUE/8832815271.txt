I received this as a promotional product for honest testing and reviews. I love the way it feels on my skin and how I can feel the difference after just the first week of use. I would recommend if you want to prevent fine lines and wrinkles or to tighten up fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes and those pesky smile lines. Well worth it for crows feet and smile lines
