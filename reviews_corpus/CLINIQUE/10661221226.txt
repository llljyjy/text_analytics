✦ I received this product from @topbox #freeproduct in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using the wrinkle correcting serum for the last few days. So far I’m happy with it, no irritation as I sometimes have sensitive skin towards new products. It has a slight fragrance but it’s nice! Texture goes on nicely as well. Not bad!
