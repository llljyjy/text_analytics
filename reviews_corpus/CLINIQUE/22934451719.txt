Literally my favorite. I always try different cleansing balms and come right back to this one all the time. Takes off a whole face of makeup and base with a small amount like a pea size. This is all you need. Must have, worth the price. Will not be buying any others. STAYING WITH THIS ONE. Do not turn your eyes, must buy
