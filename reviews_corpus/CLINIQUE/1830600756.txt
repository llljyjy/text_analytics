I’m deducting one start because the directions say to apply over entire face, and I feel this product is simply too drying and irritating to use that way. That said, I think this is an excellent product to use as a spot treatment. I use it directly on blemishes, and it clears them up within a day or two - the only exception is deep, under the surface acne. This may help with those, but it will take time. When applying to surface acne, it can sting a bit, but it doesn’t last long, and I find the sting is absolutely worth the results. Excellent spot treatment!
