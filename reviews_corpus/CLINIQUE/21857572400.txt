I received a sample of Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serumf rom Topbox #freeproduct I applied it at night after cleanser. I like that it doesn’t have a strong scent, is lightweight and contains retinol. Overall, I’m satisfied with this product and will consider purchasing it in the future. Great correcting serum
