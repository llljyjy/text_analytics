I’ve been trying this product for a couple of weeks now. I love the creamy texture of it, it’s not watery and stays put as I apply it around my eyes. It’s hydrating and cooling and It instantly made my eyes feel refreshed, de-puffed & smooth. I don’t think I’ve been using it long enough to see major improvements in my crows feet when I smile but we will see with time. I smile a lot so it might be a lost cause. Creamy and hydrating
