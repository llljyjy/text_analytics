I do like this eye cream. It’s very hydrating bt doesn’t move my concealer around. I like to apply it twice, it has a whipped fluffy cream gel-like texture thats not greasy. It kinda brightens the eye area a bit. The star rating is bc I Did see a lil difference in my under eye lines bt it didn’t completely diminish them. I like it better than BB & my daily Cerve so yes I’d buy it agin! Is it worth it?!
