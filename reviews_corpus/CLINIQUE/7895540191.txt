I received my Clinique Smart Chemical Repair Moisturizer from Influenster and I was so excited to dig in and see what it can do for my skin. I have fine lines and wrinkles but my skin is normal otherwise and I’ve never had an issue with any product that I have used. So lucky me, I don’t have sensitive skin. I have used other Clinique skincare and have loved each one. I received a deluxe sample size but a little goes a long way. It is enough to give my honest review. This moisturizer is a thick gel like cream but applies smooth and immediately seeped into my skin, leaving it soft, silky, and hydrated. After the first application I noticed a slight plumping effect that made my fine lines less noticeable. This cream has a slight scent but is not at all overwhelming. Upon using the cream for several days, I noticed that my skin felt softer and more hydrated, which help to make my fine lines less noticeable. I most definitely would recommend this cream to anyone and everyone because it does work wonderfully. Excellent Anti-aging Cream
