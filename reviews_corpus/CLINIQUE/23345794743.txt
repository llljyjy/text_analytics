Okay, I love this stuff. I have oily skin and large pores. I got this bc someone was raving so much about it. I feel like if I were more consistent I’d love it even more. This has definitely reduced the appearance of my pores. My skin is still oily but I’m still trying to figure out how to fix that. I only use it at night. But I really do love it. Minimizes pores
