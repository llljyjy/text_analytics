I am not someone who ever really thought about stopping wrinkles. My skincare regimen up until now has been an anti-acne wash in the morning. I received this tiny jar, and have seen a difference despite only using it for about a week! It’s impressive to me how far a tiny dab goes, and at this price, you want to know it will last a long time. There is minimal scent, it’s a wonderful texture - never felt oily at all! The pics I attached are 1 week ago and today. I feel a difference and I think there is a visible difference. Full disclosure, my 4 yr old woke me up after 4 hours of sleep and then we spent the day in the sun and hiked, so the pic may not be as illustrative of the effects as it could be after only one week. That says a ton to me because I can see a reduction on the crows feet. Worth trying! Working so far!!
