Coming from someone who has combo skin but very skin in winter. I also have hormonal acne. Is never broken me out during those 5 risky days my skin likes to freak out.  This is amazing all year round. I’ve been using this for months and loving it. A little goes a long way. I’ve also been using at times just as a primer. All the way around best moisturizer I’ve used and I’m pretty sure I’ve tried everything out there! nan
