I received this @clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream for FREE from @influenster in exchange for my honest review. It’s hard to judge results since I’ve only been using it for a few days and I wouldn’t expect to see a noticeable change for at least a month. I will report though that it has a mild pleasant sent, silky texture, and quick absorption.If it will help with dark circles I’ll be in heaven! So far, so good
