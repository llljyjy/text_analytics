I used this for a few days as my skin gets extremely dry in the winter. On the third day, I woke up to 10-15 bumps on my forehead. My skin is generally relatively clear and I have not had a breakout in years. My Skin is not sensitive. I donâ€™t recommend this product. Caused breakouts and whiteheads
