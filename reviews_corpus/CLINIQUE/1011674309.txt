I am already a fan of all things Clinique as they are allergy tested and fragrance free, so I was very excited to try out this Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream! I am slightly over 40 now and have noticed my skin is not what it used to be. This little jar claims to nourish skin and reduce lines and wrinkles, creating a younger-looking finish. I found the cream was easy to apply, absorbed well, left a baby-soft finish, and I have to say, my skin just looks nicer. I tend to have drier skin in the summer, and my dry skin was no match to this miracle in a jar! Iâ€™m excited to see how things progress as I continue to add it to my skincare routine, as I am absolutely loving it! Dry facial skin be gone!
