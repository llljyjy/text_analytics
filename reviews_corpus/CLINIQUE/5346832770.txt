I have used multiple jars of the 72-hour version of this moisturizer, so when I got the opportunity to sample the 100-hour version, I was stoked. My skin loved it and this lived up to all my expectations - it was light, non-sticky, but gave beautiful moisture to my dehydrated skin. Most importantly, it didnâ€™t break out my sensitive skin. I will definitely be purchasing a full sized jar of this. A MUST for dry/dehydrated skin.
