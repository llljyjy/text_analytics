I received this product from Influenster to review and I am so glad I did!  This product works well.  I love the ritual of morning and evening eye creams and this one impressed me the most.  I could see an improvement after only a few days of using it.  I don’t have keep winkles, but at 38 I definitely have some age around my eyes.  It’s gentle on my skin and I had zero reaction.  I like the smell of it-so fresh!  Will buy it again when my sample runs out. Clinique for the win!
