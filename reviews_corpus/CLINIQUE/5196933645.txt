I received this #free product from Topbox Circle to test and for my review.  I applied it sparingly morning and night for a couple of days.  As it was only a sample packet, I can only give my initial impressions.  It has a medium consistency that when applied spreads evenly and absorbs nicely.  My skin does feel smoother and hydrated.  As I can be sensitive to fragrances, I like that this does not have any fragrance.  As I only used it for a couple of days, I canâ€™t say whether it reduces lines and wrinkles. Hydrating
