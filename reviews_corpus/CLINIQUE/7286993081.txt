When I received this product, I was curious to see how well it would take off my everyday makeup. I use waterproof eyeliner and mascara, brow pencil, and brow gel, which I‚Äôve had problems taking off effortlessly in the past. I used Clinique Take The Day Off Charcoal Cleansing Balm after a long work day, and WOW, it took everything off in a few swipes! Not only does it take my makeup off, but it also makes my skin feel refreshed and clean for the rest of the night. I will definitely be recommending this product to my friends and family!üòç LOVEEEEE! A new staple!
