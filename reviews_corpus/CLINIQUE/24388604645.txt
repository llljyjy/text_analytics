I just turned 41 so I am always looking for anti-aging aging products ! I really enjoyed the fact this was Allergy tested,  so this is for all skin times.This is also 100% fragrance free. I loved the texture of this cream, it goes on and feels cooling to the skin. It also absorbs into the skin quickly! Unfortunately I’m not sure if it works for anti aging the sample size wasn’t enough to keep using to see results but I 100% recommend trying this product !! Clinique smart cream
