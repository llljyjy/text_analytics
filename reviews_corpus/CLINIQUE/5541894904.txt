I really enjoyed this product, especially going into the dry winter months. It is thick, moisturizing and leaves the skin feeling nourished and plump which does make lines look smoother. I think people with dry skin can use this day and night but if you are oily it might be too much under makeup. A little also goes a very very long way so I think this will last you a long time. This is a tried and true brand and if you like Clinique you will like this! Dry wrinkles be gone!
