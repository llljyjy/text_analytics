I used to have oily skin but after having a baby it’s now severely dry. The moisturizer helped with my dry patches and  it didn’t feel too heavy on my skin. I wouldn’t say that it replenished my skins moisture for very long though. I receive a complimentary sample of this product to review via Influenster. Good, but not great
