My skin type is normal to dry. My skin felt as per usual prior and felt a bit of a difference afterwards. No changes noted. The texture was smooth and felt like a great moisturizer, until it absorbed and dried, it started flaking likes other reviewers described. It only lasted 30 minutes,  when it dried up and flaked. I myself would not buy this, but can’t say it wouldn’t work for a different skin type. nan
