I have combo/oily skin. The combo parts of my skin usually get as oily as the rest of my face during the day in the Florida heat and humidity. This moisturizer has transformed that!! It is amazing. It absorbs and dries down so fast and is very mattifying. Iâ€™m taking one star off because on its own, I think it is great to wear but it is too mattifying under makeup (foundation or concealer). However this can be a true holy grail for my oily skin girls. If you have drier skin, try the lotion, it is AMAZING! I also have the lotion for wintertime. This line is the BOMB!! Great mattifying moisturizer
