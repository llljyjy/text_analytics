I received this Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream complimentary from Clinique and Influenster for a honest review.I have a dry skin which occasionally acts up showing temporary oiliness in certain spots, and overwhelmingly oily products clogging pores causing breakouts. So, it’s not easy to get appropriate cream for my face. Clinique products has always been beneficial for this complicated skin type of mine!! This time again Clinique brought a wonderful product. This Clinique wrinkle correcting cream I have been using for over 7 days now. This cream moisturizes my dry skin absolutely beautifully and my skin keeps feeling moisturized even after considerable time has passed after application!! However, it is not overpoweringly dense , so it doesn’t clog my pores. It applies on my face very smoothly. After application my skin looks nourished and glowy. I have started developing some fine lines in my forehead and around my mouth. After 7 days of application, I saw these areas started looking more plump and supple. The fine lines were not visible as much anymore. Worked wonderfully
