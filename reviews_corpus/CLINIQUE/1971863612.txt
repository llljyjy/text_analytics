I own the moisture surge 72 hr cream and feel they are really similar. It’s a gel cream formula that would work well for oily skin types. It’s a lightweight formula that absorbs very quickly and leaves the skin silky smooth. I have dry skin so I find this doesn’t give me the amount of moisture my skin needs. I can actually wear this during the day and it seems to work better for me. I use something heavier at night. Overall I recommend for normal-oily skin. Light weight
