I received this product #freeproduct for review . So far I love it . It’s very hydrating and on the thicker side so perfect for the colder months . I only got a small squeeze tube, so I’m not sure on the long term results , but so far I love it . It’s got a slight scent to it, but nothing over powering . Great for dry skin
