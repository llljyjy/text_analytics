I got this sample from #freeproduct to try on. Didn’t see much difference on wrinkles but the cream itself was light-weighted and didn’t leave any greasy feeling on my face. I used it at night only after serum. It provided a moisturizing effect on my face which my face absorbed easily. Will highly recommend for everyday cream. Very nice face cream
