I received this #freeproduct from Topbox for my honest opinion.I used this serum twice a day along with the other Clinique samples under the same product line. The serum absorbed quickly and left my skin smooth and hydrated, not sticky or greasy feeling at all. Skin looked and felt smooth, fine lines seemed to have minimized/disappeared. Great product! Would definitely recommend! Smooth and hydrating!
