This seems like a good moisturizer. I don’t know that it does anything really with wrinkle reduction as my sample was used for a little over 3 weeks. It is quite thick, so it’s great for nighttime use or possibly night/day use in colder months. But it is heavy for daytime use during warmer months. My only complaint is that is does have a significant scent. It’s that typical Clinique scent, so not overly offensive or chemically, but it is there. Good cream
