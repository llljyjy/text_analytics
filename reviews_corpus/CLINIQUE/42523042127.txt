I used the #freeproduct sample that I received for a few days and found the serum to be quite pleasant to apply on my fine wrinkles. I did not have much product to work with but what I did have was very light and had little fragrance to it. I applied a small amount each morning to the fine wrinkles on the skin around the outer edges of my eyes where laugh lines have developed over the years. I found the serum was easy to apply and absorbed quickly into my skin. I felt that the lines looked a bit improved even after a short time period of use. Morning skin routine
