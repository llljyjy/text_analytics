I’ve never been good at using eye cream so I’m glad I received this as a complimentary product to try.  I used it for 2 weeks and have noticed some differences with the wrinkles around my eyes.  I like how creamy it is and also absorbs easily into your skin.  This is also a good starter for my new skin routine. Absorbs well and does the job
