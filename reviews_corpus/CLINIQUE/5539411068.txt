I have been using clinque makeup products for years. I have very sensitive skin and Clinique is very gentle and soothing. This was my first time using a wrinkle correcting eye cream. I really like how smoothly it glides on and how easily it is absorbed into my skin. A little bit goes a long way. It has no scent to it at all which is good since my skin is so sensitive. After using it for a short while, I have already noticed some improvement in the skin around my eyes. I will definitely add this to my skin routine. Works really well
