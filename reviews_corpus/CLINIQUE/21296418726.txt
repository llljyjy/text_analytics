I received this product complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have used the cream for the last e few weeks and feel like it’s a good moisturizer at best. The fragrance is subtle, it glides on easily and is not sticky. I even used it as a base for my makeup on days when my skin felt a bit dry. Another plus is that it doesn’t make my skin oily. How ever, it didn’t do anything for my wrinkles…I was hoping it would. But nada! Overall a good cream from a moisturizing stand point. A good moisturizer at best
