This cleaning oil is amazing. It removes all of my makeup instantly. I use it as the first part of my 2 step cleansing routine. I have used the cleansing balm with great results too. I do find the cleansing oil is best kept for home and the balm for travel. Either way both are on my repeat for purchasing! nan
