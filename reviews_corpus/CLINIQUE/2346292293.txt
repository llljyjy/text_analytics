I received a sample of this product from Topbox for review purposes. The sample size was too small to be able to really determine if it lives up to its claims, pretty much only enough to use one time. However, the serum was light and had a mild fragrance, which I really liked. The serum absorbed quickly into my skin without leaving a greasy cast. #freeproduct nan
