I tried this product free with Topbox #freeproduct. First of all, this product’s texture made applying it a dream! It goes on effortlessly smooth and left my skin feeling well-nourished, glowy and soft like a piece of fine silk. The consistency was super light and effective, which I appreciate. Blending it in didn’t leave my face feeling greasy, like with some products. The main ingredient CL1870 Peptide Complex is a game-changer in the Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Serum! I predict this product will fly off the shelves soon because it does work for me and others! nan
