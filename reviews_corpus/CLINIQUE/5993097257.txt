I received a sample of CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repairâ„¢ Wrinkle Correcting Serum for free from Topbox Circle in exchange for my honest review. I used this daily in my morning skincare routine. I applied no clean skin. The serum was light and absorbed well into my skin. It did not leave a greasy feeling. After a few days of using, I noticed my skin was plumper and wrinkles were visibly reduced. I would definitely repurchase and recommend this product. I love Clinique products. #free #trywithtopbox nan
