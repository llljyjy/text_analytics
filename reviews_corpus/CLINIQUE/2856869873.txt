I was the lucky recipient of a complimentary sample of this product via Influenster. I have very dry skin and had hoped this product would work miracles for my skin. Although it didn’t quite hydrate my skin the way I had hoped it’s still a really nice moisturizer and I think it would be perfect for those of you that don’t have very dry skin. I should also note that the sample I received only lasted me 5 days and that was with me using it once in the morning and once before bed so twice daily. Perhaps had I continued using it I might have seen more of a difference in my skin. The moisturizer feels like a creamy gel, it covered my skin nicely and didn’t leave any residue, it made my skin feel soft. A little goes a long way for example my tiny sample lasted me 5 days and I was using it on my face and the backs of my hands. It went on very smoothly and didn’t feel wet for very long after application. This meant it was great to apply before doing my makeup. I did notice it helped with the dry skin I get on my nose and felt very light. There was no strong fragrance to this product which is another great bonus. I can’t stand creams that have such a strong fragrance that you can smell it for hours afterwards. All that being said, it’s not a product I would purchase myself in the future. However, I would say if your on the fence about trying this you should still give it a try. Everyone’s skin is different and it might just be the miracle cream your searching for. Not for Me but Could Work For You
