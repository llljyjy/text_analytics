I am 43, and have combination skin with aging concerns and acne concerns. I had a good first impression of this cream. A little went a long way, it felt moisturizing and hydrating. I love that it is fragrance free. The immediate results were hydration and radiance. I do not know the long term results as this was a small sample. I would recommend trying it out. nan
