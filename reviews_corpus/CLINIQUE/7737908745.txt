I’ve always gotten this as a sample from Clinique and I’m so so happy that I finally purchased a larger size. This has helped my combo skin sooo much this winter. I have an oiler face with patches of darker and drier skin. This is perfect after my toners as a daily and nightly moisturizer. I also have been using it on my problem dry/dark spots as a 5 minute mask and seen awesome results in terms of softening and even lightening the area. This product feels like a cheat code! My final use I’ve found for it is using it to remove makeup with a q-tip. This is a must have for any healthy, glowing, soft skin routine. Moisturizing cheat code!
