Ran out of my usual face moisturizer so I grabbed this mini size. I’ve used this before so I knew this would work well with my skin. I’m 49 and I still have combination oily skin and prone to small breakouts. This moisturizer is good for someone with oily skin. I don’t get pimples and it still gives me the moisture my skin needs. Because it’s a gel formula, you may need a little more because of the consistency and it spreads out into a thin layer. Once it dries you can’t feel that you have anything on your skin which is good for hot humid climates. I have in the past used this with a sheer foundation and it didn’t pill. Although I can’t speak for all foundations. Definitely would recommend this because it is a great moisturizer and within a good price point. Great For Combination Oily Skin
