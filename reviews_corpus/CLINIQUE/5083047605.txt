I received this item complementary to test. I personally love using this product. As a new mom it keeps my eyes looking rejuvenated when the rest of me isn’t. It isn’t heavily scented and goes on  smoothly. Also a little goes a long way and I think this will last a long time so it is definitely worth the cost. nan
