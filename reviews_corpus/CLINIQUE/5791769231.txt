I very much enjoyed my #freeproduct sample of this wrinkle corrector. It definitely made an improvement on visible wrinkles but I’m not sure how long the impact would last as I haven’t bought the full size yet. It’s light like a serum and feels really comfortable on my skin. No harsh scents and I enjoyed using it at night after cleansing. nan
