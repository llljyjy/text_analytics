This cream feels very soothing and hydrating to my very dry winter skin! I do think it makes a difference in wrinkles although I have not used it consistently enough to make a long term evaluation yet. I have noticed that if I donâ€™t give it enough time to absorb it can make concealer pill up in eye area but with a few minutes to absorb it works great. The ingredients are high quality and seem wonderful for the sensitive eye area! nan
