I received this as a free product from #topboxmarketing. I was so excited to know that a serum is part of the package that I will have to review. I am a fan of using serum, I feel and trust that serum makes wonders for my face. Again, any facial product with Hyaluronic Acid ingredient is a plus to me, it works well with my face and I believe is the reason for my younger-looking glowing skin. The serum feels soft and gives the extra hydration my face needs especially now that winter is coming. I could always consider buying this as part of my daily facial routine. A must-have serum
