I received this product for free for my honest review. I really liked the texture it just looks hydrating! It goes on nicely and soaks into the skin quickly. It didnâ€™t leave a sticky feeling. I felt it did hydrate my under eyes well, and I have incorporated it into my daily morning routine! I think the quality is great and I would recommend it! nan
