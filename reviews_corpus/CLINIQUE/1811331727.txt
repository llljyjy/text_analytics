I received a small sample of Clinique’s Smart Repair Wrinkle cream as an incentive for my honest opinion. I tried it for 14 straight days and night. I have combination skin and it’s summer (90+, humidity, sunny days). I learned real quick a little goes a long way. It applies super silky. Too much will feel goopy. It will keep your skin moisturized without feeling oily. I can’t honestly say I saw reduced wrinkles or fine lines in the 14 days of use. Skin stairs moisturizer
