#freeproductWith all the samples I was given to try out, this was the one that I loved the most. I used to work for Clinique back in the day and have always enjoyed thier serums. They are effective without being fussy. I immediately loved the look of the serum, it had a unicorn glow to it!! My skin loved it ito, absorbing it instantly and screaming for more than the sample allowed. I’m used to having to wait for my serums to ’settle’ before layering and was very impressed with how quickly this absorbed. My skin was ready for other products without pilling or tackiness. Craving more!!
