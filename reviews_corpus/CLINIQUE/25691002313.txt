I really enjoyed using this product!  It is a thick, luxurious cream that goes on easy and absorbs well. My skin felt softer and looked more moisturized after using. I received a small sample size to review and the sample only lasted a little over a week. Because I am an older woman in my late 40’s, I didn’t see a huge difference in the wrinkles on my face, but I think it’s hard to know what effect it will have on wrinkles long-term since I only had enough to last a week. But,  because it made my skin feel softer and more moisturized,  it is a cream I do recommend. Luxurious, moisturizing cream!
