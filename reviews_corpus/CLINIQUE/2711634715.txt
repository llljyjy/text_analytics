I received this product on a complimentary basis from Influenster & Clinique in exchange for my honest review. This cream thick but still absorbed well into my skin, and was pleasantly moisturizing. There is a very faint fragrance but this fades quickly and was pleasant. Tip: I really love this under my eyes. The rich moisture and quick absorption really shines there and have noticed improvement in that area. Try it under your eyes!
