I am in my early 40’s and I have some fine lines around my eyes, the 11’s between my eyebrows and some dark spots. I have been great about my mourning routine, but I would really benefit from using a moisturizing repair cream like this on a nightly basis. The Clinique Smart Repair is Ophthalmologist tested, I know this doesn’t mean much to some, but my oil glands get clogged easily. It has no scent that I can smell which is nice and the light texture is nice.  It spreads well on the skin and a little goes a long way for me.  It is very light, but I like to use it at night since it is a little too hydrating to put under my makeup. My skin can be a little sensitive sometimes and this just left it soft with no irritation.  It’s in the pricier range, but you also get what you pay for. Very light weight!
