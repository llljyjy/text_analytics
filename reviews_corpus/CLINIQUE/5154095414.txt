Love Clinique and so excited to receive this eye cream from Influenster to try in exchange for this review. It is unscented and non greasy. Absorbs quickly into skin. Definitely hydrates around my eye area. I have only used it two Weeks so I have not seen a difference in my lines around my eyes yet. The hydration is very good though. My eyelid skin tends to get flaky and this cream resolved that. All Iâ€™m all a nice cream and I like it. nan
