I have combination skin and this did wonders with n regards to hydration. The texture is like a gel and I found it had a slight cooling effect; which felt so good. The only downfall was that it dried a bit sticky. Other than that it’s absolutely perfect and I would definitely recommend it to other’s with sensitive or combination skin. Perfect hydration for combination skin
