I used this moisturizer a couple times and I found that it didn’t leave my skin sticky. I have combination skin type and most moisturizers make my skin oily. I recommend this to people with combination skin. This moisturizer doesn’t have a fragrance which I personally liked. Overall it’s a good product.I received this product for free for review from influenster. Good everyday moisturizer
