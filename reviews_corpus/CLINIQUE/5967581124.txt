This gel-cream moisturizer is unscented and contains great ingredients like hyaluronic acid and aloe vera to help the skin re-plump and keep moisturized.I added it to my skincare routine and was able to make the sample last for five days, using it mornings and nights.It feels light and gets absorbed fast, without feeling oily or sticky. It worked great for my combination skin and did not make it break out or oiler. After the first use, I felt that my skin was softer and hydrated. It did not feel like a deep moisturizer, more like a summer one. I also tried using it over makeup as a dewy highlighter, as suggested by the brand, but it felt a little sticky, and I did not see a dewy effect (no shininess at all).  Overall I found it a good product to use during the hot months of the year, and I recommend it. Good for combination skin
