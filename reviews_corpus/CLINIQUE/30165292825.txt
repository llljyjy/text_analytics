This is a very thick product & does the intended purpose. However I have oily skin so this product is too rich for me causing breakouts and excess oil. I recommend for really dry skin but combination and oily skin stay away from this very thick cream. I received this free from influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. For very dry not for oily skin
