I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion. I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now, which is all the very small sample would allow for. I have normal skin and am 39. I loved the consistency of the cream. A little bit will go a long way and too much made my face feel greasy. But, just the right amount made it feel supple and soft. I found, for myself that it was better to use the cream at night vs in the morning bc of the shine it produced. While I found it to be a very great hydrating cream, I did not think it did much for my wrinkles, sadly! But, would still consider purchasing in the future as a moisturizer! nan
