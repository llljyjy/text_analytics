I love a serum and always use one as part of my skin care regime.   The Clinique Clinical Wrinkle Correcting Serum was easy to use, absorbed quickly into my skin leaving my skin feeling smooth and silky.I found that patting the product into my skin worked best for me.  The size of the sample allowed me to use it for 4 days - twice a day - morning and night.  #freeproduct nan
