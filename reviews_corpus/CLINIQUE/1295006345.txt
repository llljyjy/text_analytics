I was excited that I received this new Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Cream for free from Influenster. My first impression of it is great! I have combination skin that is acne prone and it did not break me out. It absorbed well and left my skin very soft to the touch throughout the entire day. I could notice an immediate difference in softening around my crows feet and crinkles under my eyes. I have not used it long term and so can’t say how it will work in the long term, but I’m definitely excited to try it and see! So far, so good! Has potential!
