This cream is very lightweight and absorbs pretty fast. I use it twice a day, morning and night. It’s very gentle and moisturizing. My skin feels smooth and soft after each application. I haven’t seen any improvements in terms of wrinkles but it’s been a nice experience and I plan to continue using it. I like that my eye area looks brighter and less puffy. nan
