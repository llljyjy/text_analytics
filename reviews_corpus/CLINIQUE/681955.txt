I have used Clinique skin care for many years, and have always thought of the brand as decent and effective but kind of basic. But since I got to sample Clinique Smart Repair Cream-- which is up in the ranks of the most advanced skincare products I’ve ever tried-- I have new respect for the brand. Smart Repair Cream is a twice-daily moisturizer that sinks into my skin immediately and leaves it smooth, soft and restored. It’s as if the cream knows where my skin needs the most moisture. During the day, my makeup goes on smoothly as if I’m using a primer. My skin, which is dry in winter and combination in warmer months, looks bright and clear. After a two week trial, I’m ready to purchase the full sized jar. The cream is concentrated, so just a little dab covers my face, neck and decollete. One warning-- there is no SPF, so for day I’m careful to also include this step in my skincare routine. nan
