I received this #freeproduct sample packet from #tryitwithtopbox.  I have combination skin and fine lines/wrinkles.  I really love the consistency of this serum, milky and thicker than most serums I have used, also goes on so smoothly.   This serum is fragrance free and does not have an oily feel either.  I used this serum at night along with the eye cream and face cream in this Smart Clinical line.  The next morning my skin looked plump and hydrated.   I am really interested in purchasing this to try for a longer time as I believe this will show some results. Must buy this!  Love the consistency!
