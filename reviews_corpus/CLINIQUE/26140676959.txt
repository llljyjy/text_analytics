I received a 1ml sample from topboxcircle #freeproduct of this wrinkle correcting serum to try for free in exchange for my honest thoughts. I can only give first impressions on texture and feel. I liked how soft my skin felt after the single application. The  serum also absorbed fast and not too thick. Great absorbing serum
