I enjoyed this moisturizer,  it seemed to sink into my skin pretty well, and I didn’t feel greasey at all. But that’s as far as it went. I noticed no difference whatsoever after using it for several weeks (as much as I could with the sample I received from Influenster). It’s fine as a moisturizer,  but I’m not sure that the price is justified. Good enough
