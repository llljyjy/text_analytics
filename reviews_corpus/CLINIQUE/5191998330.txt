I was a little wary of the smart clinical wrinkle repair living up to its claims. I have new (40s) dry skin that I’m still learning how to navigate. I always had hydrated skin with few blemishes. As I have aged it needs moisture but then the products cause breakouts or clogged pores. That is not the case with this Clinique product. I’m going to sound cheese saying this, but using this nightly has caused my skin to be younger again. It stays hydrated, no breakouts and my emerging wrinkles are kept at bay. I’m shocked. My biggest applause is keeping my skin hydrated all night and into the next day. I put a very light moisturizer on in the morning and I’m golden. I got this as a sample and already bought the full size. It’s a holy grail for me now. Young skin again
