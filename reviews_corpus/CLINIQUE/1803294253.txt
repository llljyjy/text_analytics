Overall this is a good moisturizer! I have normal skin with no real issues, and after using this moisturizer several times I noticed it was keeping my skin very hydrated. I feel like I noticed a more glowy look to my skin as well right after! I love the texture, itâ€™s very lightweight and almost gel-like which I prefer over very heavy moisturizers. I would recommend this moisturizer to anyone who has normal skin and is looking for a medium level of hydration! nan
