I received a sample size from Influenster. I love Clinique because they make fragrance free skin care products. I think this is an excellent moisturizer. I wasnâ€™t able to use it long enough to notice a drastic difference, only to be will tell that. I have combination acne prone skin and this dud not cause any breakouts. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead if 5 is because I found to me kind of a hybrid cream that also had a feel of a gel. I dislike the feel of gel creams, but I have tactile texture issues. That being said, it absorbs quickly. I still highly recommend this for anyone else. Highly recommend!
