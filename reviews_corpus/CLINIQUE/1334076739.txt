I received this product from Influenster for my honest review.Great eye cream, I like the consistency and that it doesn’t really have any fragrance. I only applied at night and noticed it really helped with puffiness but after two weeks I did not notice any change in the darkness of my under eye area. I had just received the Charlotte Tilbury one and I like that one more because I noticed a difference in the darkness are just a few days. I would recommend this tho, nice product for Clinique, I hadn’t tried anything from this brand in years, this reminded me to try it out again. Good eye cream
