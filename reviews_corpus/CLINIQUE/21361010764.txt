I’m not particularly a Clinique fan because  I feel you can usually do better for cheaper but I have to hand it to them with this balm. I wear tubing mascara that’s impossible to get off with any other make-up cleaner: I ended up losing eye lashes because I struggled to effectively remove it. When I tried this balm, my mascara practically slid off-I was amazed. On top of that, it removes my make-up without stripping my sensitive and dry face. You don’t even need a whole lot of product, just a little on the tip of your fingers is enough. Tip: let the balm sit on your face for at least 30 seconds before washing it off, it really helps “melt“ the make-up. Great product
