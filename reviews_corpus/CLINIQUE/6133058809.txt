I really like this eye cream. I feel it absorbs quickly, it is not greasy as other eye creams Ive tried, but it is super moisturizing and fresh. It runs smoothly and has no scent which I loved. Ive been using it night and day as it doesn’t leaves a greasy film and I can use it under my makeup. I haven’t use it 12 weeks to say if it really get rids of the lines but it sure gives you a soothing, refreshing feeling with instant glowing results. Great eye cream
