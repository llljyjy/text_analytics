Skin type: CombinationMy skin felt softer after using the moisturizer.The texture of the product is amazing. Super light weight, not sticky or heavy.  Very little fragrance, barely noticeable.It would be great in the summer with sunscreen because it feels so weightless.  I would recommend to others.  The only downfall is the price. nan
