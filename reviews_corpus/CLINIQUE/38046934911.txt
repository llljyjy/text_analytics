I received this free sample of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream to try for my honest review. With it being a sample sized product, I didn’t have enough to see what long-term effects it would have reference it’s wrinkle reducing properties. However it goes on smoothly, soaks in nicely to the skin leaving it feeling moisturized and refreshed. It has a light yet pleasant scent to it, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth. I am pleased with this product and read recommended for others to try. #CliniqueSmart Wrinkle Correcting Cream.
