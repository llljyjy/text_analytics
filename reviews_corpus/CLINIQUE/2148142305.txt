I received the wrinkle correcting eye cream sample from Topbox Circle in exchange for my honest review of this product. The serum is very moisturizing, quick absorbing which leaves face and neck feeling plumped with no tacky residue. I have mature skin and this product works well for me and Iâ€™m sure if you use this product religiously, the results would be great. The scent was not overpowering at all. #freeproduct quick absorbing serum
