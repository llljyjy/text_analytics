I received a small sample to test and review, and although no wrinkles have drastically improved, they do have a slight minimized appearance. This applies well and feels good on the skin. I like that it’s a moisturizer and not a greasy wrinkle cream. I don’t love the scent, but it’s bearable. Overall, would recommend! nan
