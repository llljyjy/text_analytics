I received a sample of this through Influenster. It’s a nice gel moisturizer. Sinks into the skin quickly and leave your face feeling soft, almost a silky feeling. I have normal to dry skin so this is a good moisturizer for day but would definitely need something richer for night. I can’t speak on long term effect as I only received a sample size but it seems pretty decent it’s nice
