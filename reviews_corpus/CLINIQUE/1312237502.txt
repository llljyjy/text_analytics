I really liked this cream, it went in smooth and absorbed pretty quickly. Didn’t feel sticky or greasy. It also smelled really good! I’m just not 100% sure it did much for my wrinkles, but I’ve only been using it about 2 weeks so it might just take a little more time to see results. Not greasy, smells good
