I am sad about the change in packaging. I have used the 13 oz pump for the past few years and I keep it in my shower for easy access. The new packaging and smaller volume is less convenient and more wasteful.  I love this face soap but I will keep an eye out for another brand that is a larger pump. Convenience matters. A squeeze flip top is not convenient I miss your old packaging,
