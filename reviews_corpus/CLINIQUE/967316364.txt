I love trying new serums so I was very excited to get this #freeproduct from Top Box to try.  It has a really nice texture, not too thick and not too watery and it instantly made my skin feel hydrated and bouncy.  I used it at night underneath my moisturizer.  It works well with other products with no pulling like Iâ€™ve experienced with some other serums.  This is a great addition to any routine. Nice Serum
