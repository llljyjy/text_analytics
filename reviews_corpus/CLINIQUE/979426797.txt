I received a small sachet sample of this product from Topbox. It was enough serum for three nights used all over my face. The serum has a slight milky texture and soaked in very quickly and didn’t leave any stickiness. I didn’t notice any scent. It felt nice on my skin but was not moisturizing enough to use alone and I used a cream moisturizer after. I have quite dry skin so I always need more moisture than a serum can provide. It layered well and didn’t pill. I can’t speak to long term effects but I enjoyed using it! #freeproduct Layers well and feels pleasant
