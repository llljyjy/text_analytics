I was very pleased after trying this moisturizer for a few days. I have combination skin and tend to find that many moisturizers feel heavy on my face and leave my skin feeling sticky all day. This one did not! The texture was a creamy gel that went on very smooth and spread nicely. It was very light feeling and left my skin feeling smooth and silky, no stickiness. Hours after I applied it it still felt fabulous. No irritation to my skin. Will purchase this product regularly. Light and smooth moisture!!
