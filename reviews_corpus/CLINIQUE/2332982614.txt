I like this product more than the cream for its light feeling on the skin. I’m not sure it’s a miracle product for wrinkles but certainly helps with the look of aged skin or lack of firmness with an increase in youthful plump effects. Doesn’t tingle or feel sticky after application. Worked well under other products and makeup. I sweat alot and found it did run a bit with makeup over, but I usually have to have a matte finish and primer anyways. Would recommend to others but probably best in a pack set with the other products of this line. One items price seems high alone when all of them give the best results used together. Thank you for the try. Nice effect, smoothing and plumping
