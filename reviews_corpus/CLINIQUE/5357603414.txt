The first two things that I noticed when using Clinique smart clinical repair were that it was very moisturizing and a little bit goes a long way, at least on my combination skin.  If you use too much you can get a somewhat waxy buildup.  I haven’t noticed a difference in lines or wrinkles yet, but I won’t be able to use it for the 12 weeks that the study pictures show because of the campaign length and size of the mini container.  I do find the results promising. Very moisturizing
