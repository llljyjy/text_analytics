I have received this product complimentary from influenster and Sephora for my honest review. I was super excited to try out this product. I am in my upper 30â€™s, and do have a few wrinkles that I would like to take care of before they increase. I love the super light whipped texture to this cream. It is very soothing. I have seen some improvement in the crows feet around my eyes and excited to see even more improvement as I continue to use this in the future. Love the product so far!!
