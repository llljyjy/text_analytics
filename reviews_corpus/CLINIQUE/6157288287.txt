This is THE STUFF. I use this on my no-makeup days to give my face some color (bc I wear SPF on my face every day and my face is much lighter than the rest of my body). I mix it in with my moisturizer, apply, and that’s it. I’ve used the Drunk Elephant Bronzing Drops, and LET ME TELL YOU  this is soooo much better… it’s more pigmented (which I love, bc with the Drunk Elephant I would end up looking like a greaseball once I got the color to where I wanted).. and it’s not orange or shimmery like the DE, it gives a beautiful subtle brown. I’m telling you… try this… it does not disappoint. BETTER THAN THE DRUNK ELEPHANT
