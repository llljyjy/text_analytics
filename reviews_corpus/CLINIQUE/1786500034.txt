I have sensitive, combination skin, and I found that this product added moisture to my skin nicely without any poor reactions or breakouts. I really do like that this product is fragrance free. This is a slightly thicker moisturizer, which spreads nicely on the face and leaves the skin feeling soft for at least a day. Very nice moisturizer
