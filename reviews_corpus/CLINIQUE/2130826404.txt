I have sensitive and dry skin, but this moisturizer did a fantastic job!It is a gel texture, but melted into my skin so well and did not leave a greasy residue. My makeup went over without any issue, which was an added bonus! Plus, a little but does go a long way.Unfortunately, the trial size was not large enough for me to be able to use it long enough to know whether my skin would stay clear with continual use, but the impression I get is that it would be totally fine! Beautiful base
