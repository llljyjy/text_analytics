Let’s start with the basics; I’m a combo/oily skinned gal with sometimes reactive skin that will beam red if it doesn’t like a product. I received a 5ml sample of this product from Influester (complimentary) to give my thoughts. All-in-all I really enjoyed this moisturizer. It has a gel like consistency and a little goes a long way. I thought 5ml was going to barely be enough product for one use but it has lasted me about a week! I think if you had dry skin this product would be a show stopper and I plan on getting it for my husband. With my skin type, I do quite like it but I tend to use something to help keep my oils at bay (like Clinique) or something I know for sure won’t  exacerbate my oiliness (Nudeskin moisturizer). If I had been able to test this a bit longer, I might have had a better idea on that aspect. Hope this helps!!! Lovely Moisturizer
