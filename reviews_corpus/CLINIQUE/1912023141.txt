I received a free sample of Clinique smart clinical repair wrinkle cream. Unfortunately the sample was so small that it was not enough to see any long term improvement, only what happened instantly. It is a nice cream. I like the consistency and absorbs well. Seems to moisturize lightly. I liked the way my face felt after using it, no sticky residue. Nice cream
