I received my #freeproduct sample of Clinique’s Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream through #topboxcircle #tryitwithtopbox. I used a small pea-sized amount of this product on my entire face every morning for about a week. This product contains a complex to increase collagen production, retinoids to replenish new skin cells and decrease wrinkles, and HA to hydrate. Retinoids are definitely a trendy skincare product at the moment, and I do use retinol on my face in the evening 1-2 times a week and have noticed a difference. I personally can’t say whether I had any direct results from this product, but considering it contains retinoids, I imagine it’s having the same effect. The product instructions say it’s ok to use during the day but that might be a bit risky and can lead to sunburn, so I would only use it at night. Also, make sure not to mix Vitamin C with this product otherwise it can burn too. This serum is the most expensive product from this line ($71 for 30mL) and I absolutely don’t think it’s worth it. Retinol is so accessible right now for such cheap prices that I suggest seeking it elsewhere. Would opt for a cheaper retinol serum
