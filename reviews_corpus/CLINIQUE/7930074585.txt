I received this product from Topbox Circle in exchange for an honest review. I used for 1 week together with the Wrinkle Correcting Cream and Eye Cream, both also from Clinique. I have a tendency for dry skin, and am over 30 years old so I was really hoping good results in 1 week using twice daily. It was not as rich as I expected, spread quite easily but did not feel as hydrating as I hoped. Did not experience any breakouts with this product, but also did not notice any significant effect for fine lines, maybe this is only noticable after a couple of months after using the product. Interesting to try, but not sure how effective in the long run. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct. Not impressed
