I am so excited to discover an oil-free cream suited for aging skin that doesn’t feel greasy or clog my pores. My skin is well hydrated, and feels healthy. The formula goes on smoothly, absorbs well, and works nicely with my other skincare products. I received a deluxe sample, which I don’t think is sufficient to see significant results in wrinkle reduction, but I did like the product well enough to purchase a larger size now that my sample is almost gone. nan
