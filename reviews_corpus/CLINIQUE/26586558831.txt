I got this sample free from influenster, in exchange for my honest review. Since I live in Canada, my skin gets very dry, especially in the cold and wintery months. Within the first few minutes of applying this, my skin did feel kinda sticky ish. But that went away in a few minutes once it was absorbed into my skin. It did feel long lasting. I did notice a change in my skin after using for a few days. It definitely did look and feel a lot healthier and helped it to glow. Itâ€™s good for sensitive skin as well since it is fragrance free. I did not experience and breakouts using this either. I will definitely be purchasing this in the future. Definitely restores moisture to dry skin
