I recieved this from Influenster a couple of weeks ago in exchange for my own personal & honest review and held of giving my review until I felt like I had ample time to use it and give a review that was indeed honest. I do love how moisturizing this product is, I am 39 so I am started to see some signs of aging and was pleasantly suprised when I did start to see a difference. It wasnâ€™t huge ir crazy out there noticeable but then again, which product is? This left my under eye and lid area softer, less noticeable lines, and kind if felt like a little wake me up when I used it in the morning. I would recommend this product. Suprised!!!
