I received this product free from Influenster. Iâ€™m always a fan of Clinique products, especially this anti-wrinkle formula. I turned 50 this year, so wrinkles are a concern. This cream is a thicker consistency for nighttime use. It applies softly and absorbs quickly on my combination skin. I love the formula, such as peptides. The package was small, but I would buy again to see the longtime effects. Great Nighttime Cream for Aging Skin
