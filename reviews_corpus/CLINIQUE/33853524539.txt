My skin is fairly dehydrated right now in this Canadian weather. Moisture surge smells nice and feels nice you first put it on but I did not find it was as great as I thought it would be. In a hydrating cream I do like a heavier feel and my skin still felt tight after applying. But I will say you can tell my skin did get some hydration but not to itâ€™s full potential. When you first put it on it does feel great but it absorbs a bit too quickly for my liking. I think this cream would be great in the summer when you want a lighter feeling moisturizer. nan
