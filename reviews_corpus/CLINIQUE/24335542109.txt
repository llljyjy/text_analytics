After receiving the #FreeProduct sample and using it for 3 days, I would sayI liked it in general. It was okay.Pros: light cream, so it gets absorbed quickly Fragrance free It didn’t irritate my sensitive skinGood hydration (I have dry skin)Cons: didn’t notice any change or improvement to the fine wrinkles, could be because the sample was finished in three days (used twice a day) Would like to give it another try though because it has very good level of hydration Good hydration, no improvement to wrinkles
