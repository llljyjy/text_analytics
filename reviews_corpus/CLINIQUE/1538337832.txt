Did not work for my skin at all. I have oily skin that agrees with nearly any moisturizer. After using this moisturizer for 10 days I experienced dry, flakey patches on my skin around my nose, eyebrow areas & chin. Areas that are usually very oily completely dried out & flaked off. I havenâ€™t been able to wear foundation because the makeup clings to the patches & flakes off. I have never had dry skin in my life. On day 10 I started to break out in the areas experiencing the dry patches. I have been a lover of most Clinique products since I was a teenager but this simply did not work for me at all. Nice consistently but it wreaked havoc on my skin
