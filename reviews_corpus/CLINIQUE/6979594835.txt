I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review.  #trywithtopbox #freeproduct.  I was only able to try the cream once but I found it to be lightly scented and that it felt very nice on my skin.  I have sensitive skin and the cream did not irritate at all and left my skin feeling moisturized. Good for sensitive skin
