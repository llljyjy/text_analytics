This eye cream goes on super smooth. A little dab will do ya- itâ€™s very lightweight but too much makes my eyelids super greasy. I always apply eye creams with my ring finger- apparently it is our weakest finger and least likely to damage sensitive eye area skin- and this went on very smooth. As it absorbed, my eyelids felt a little greasier than I would like so I dabbed them with a cotton pad to get rid of the filmy feeling. A dab will do!
