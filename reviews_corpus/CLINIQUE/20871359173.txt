I received a sample of the new Clinique smart clinical repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream (5ml sample). I creams texture on my skin was smooth and silky and  did not feel too heavy or greasy.  However, in order to provide a full and accurate review for this product, the sample size would need to be adequate enough in order to use the product for more than a couple of days so that as with any other new skincare product you can actually see results of continued use.  So I am not able to confirm one way or another that this product is worth trying. nan
