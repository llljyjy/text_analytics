I am so glad I got to try this product! I love how light it is on the skin. It gets absorbed so quick but still keeps my skin hydrated. I can actually feel to touch how my skin is hydrated. It doesnt have that greasy feel which is a plus plus plus. I dont always wear make up but this moisturizer is so light i dont think ill even have to worry if I put make up on it. Lightweight and not greasy at all. So hydrating!
