I recieved this product as a sample in exchange for a review with Influenster.  The sample size was very small so I was only able to test it twice, and can’t give a long term review. I found that it left my face very dewy feeling, but did not provide the moisture I expected. I have sensitive skin and this product did not cause any bad reactions, it just wouldn’t be my go-to choice after a couple of uses, as it left my skin feeling sticky. nan
