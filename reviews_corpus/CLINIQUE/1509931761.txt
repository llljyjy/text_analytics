I prefer this over the Clinique cleansing balm because it’s more convenient for me to use a pump than it is to open up a jar and scoop out balm.  I also like that this is unscented because while I’m not against fragrance my eye area doesn’t tend to love scents and since I use this to remove eye makeup it’s nice that it does so gently.  I have tried many different cleansing balms and oils and the Clinique products, for me, clean the best. I love the size of the bottle too because it tends to last me a few months whereas the Clinique balm doesn’t usually last me more than two months. Favorite for removing makeup and SPF
