To be honest, I have never used wrinkle correcting eye cream.  It is not something that I really thought that I needed.  However, I have started to notice aging, puffiness and a few fine lines in this area.  I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion and this is my honest opinion. A little bit of cream goes a very long way.  I have very sensitive facial skin, especially around my eyes.  I do not care for scents or heavy facial cream products.  This eye cream is very light weight.  It is not scented, at least I could not detect a scent.  It did not feel heavy on my skin and most of all, it did not irritate my skin or eyes.  I feel like it moisturized my under eye area more than made lines or aging disappear.  It was overall pleasing to use and I did feel like my undereye skin area was better overall. A little goes a long way.  Satisfied customer.
