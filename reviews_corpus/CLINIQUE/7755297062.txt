Maybe is good for other skin type but not mine? I normally use Kiehl’s breakout acne control lotion but it’s sold out everywhere, I tried this and it’s not good; dried my skin to the point to breakout more because of the dryness, I think it burn it, I have a little dark spot because of it.  Be careful  there nan
