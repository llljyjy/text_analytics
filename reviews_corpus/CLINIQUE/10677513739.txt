After using this for weeks, all I can say is WOW! You just can’t go wrong with Clinique products!  This cream has no scent to it. It leaves your face soft and silky. My favourite part is that it’s non-sticky and not oily! Great product for those wrinkles as it makes them look less noticeable. I used this cream day and night as part of my morning/night routine. It’s great for all skin types. I used it on my neck as well because I started getting wrinkly in that area. So I was happy to receive this product for that reason and give my honest opinion.I really recommend this correcting cream! #freeproduct A staple in my daily routine!
