I have dry skin.Before applying, my skin felt and looked dry and dull. After applying, my skin felt smooth and less dull but under the surface the skin was still dry. The effect lasts all day or until you wash your face.It’s a very light weight gel moisturizer. A little goes a long way. I would recommend using this on top of an actual hydrating moisturizer. I would not buy this. It’s not worth this price. Smooth Skin Finish
