This Clinique Moisture Surge moisturizer has a really nice gel cream texture that absorbed very quickly into my skin. Its light weight and very comfortable on the skin. It immediately leaves my skin looking more hydrated. I canâ€™t speak to the long term effects but overall it does a good job moisturizing the skin and is good quality nan
