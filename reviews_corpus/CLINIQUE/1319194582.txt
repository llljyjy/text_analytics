I rate this 3 stars right now because I haven’t had the chance to use the product enough to see a difference. I can tell you it’s lightweight, but doesn’t quite absorb into the skin as good as my favorite eye cream. I’ll keep using until the sample size is done to fully get the benefits of the product. It is also unscented, which is ideal because its next to the eye. Not Fully Sold…yet
