Unfortunately, this ended up clogging my pores and breaking me out when I have tried it previous to Influenster sending a 5ml sample for me to review. I think it is strange that it did but I’m assuming an ingredient didn’t agree with me. I will say that the texture and hydration was very nice for my combo skin. It would be best to use in the summer when you want something a bit more lightweight. No fragrance is always a plus! Didn’t work for me but nice!!
