I was so excited to review this Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Cream from Influenster. I have a hard time finding product that I am not allergic to lately and was a little tentative BUT after using it on my under eyes, forehead, and around my laugh lines I can truly say I really love it. No irritations, no dryness, and it seems to be doing something. I need to try it out for longer to look for huge results.  So far it rocks!  Thank you for allowing me to try this free product out for my honest opinion! Psst did you know?
