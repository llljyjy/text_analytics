I really like how this cream feels. It’s almost a gel-like texture. It goes on easily and feels soft. My skin drinks up the hydration and is left feeling moisturized and soft. I haven’t worn this under makeup so I’m not sure how it does with that. It feels a bit thick on the skin when applied but once it’s fully absorbed you can’t feel it. I don’t notice any glow or change in my wrinkles but I haven’t used it long enough to see any difference. It is a nice moisturizer for sure. Good moisturizer
