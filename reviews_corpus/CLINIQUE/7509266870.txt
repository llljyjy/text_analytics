I received this product for free from Influenster. I was pleasantly surprised after the first use!I found the texture to be rather cooling and light weight. I like the fact that it dries down more matte but still provides decent moisture to the face. It did not feel sticky or tacky afterwards. There is no smell either! My reasoning for not giving it a 5/5 is because I feel that it didnâ€™t moisturize the drier patches I have on my face very well. It did help a bit but not entirely. For those who have normal to oily skin it may be a better fit. But for super dry areas it was not very helpful for me. Decent!
