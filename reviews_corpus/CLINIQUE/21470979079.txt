I starting using Clinique Clinical repair wrinkle cream about a week ago.  The cream is soft and creamy.   It goes on thin and easily.  My skin absorbed the cream without it feeling tacky or sticky.   I have noticed any changes in the fine line or wrinkles that I have.   I will continue to use it hoping for the best.  I am thinking it may just take more time than 7 days Soft and creamy
