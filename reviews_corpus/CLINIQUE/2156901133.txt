This product is not worth the money. Yes, it’s hydrating so it might help those with dry skin. It doesn’t benefit me since I have oily skin. I was looking for something to help with dark circles under my eyes. Doesn’t dry any good at all. Don’t waste your time on this product. If you have dark circles like me, just moisturize under your eyes and use a good concealer like Tarte. DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY
