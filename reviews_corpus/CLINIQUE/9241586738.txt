I’ve been using this product for just over a week now and can honestly say that I like it! I was worried it might break me out but it didn’t. I’m use to using an oil makeup remover and I still do prefer an oil, but this does it’s job at removing sunscreen / makeup, I would repurchase. Also a little goes a pretty long way! So if you’re thinking about trying the smaller size to test it out, it’s worth it! would repurchase
