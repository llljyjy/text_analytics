I received a small sample of this product from #topboxcircle #freeproduct for my honest review. Gorgeous, super light with a silky texture. I want to prevent wrinkles, and I think this product will do it, but honestly I didn’t have enough product to test that out. I always look for retinoids & HA - which it contains. I used it at night, and the next morning my skin glistened, and lined areas felt smoother. I can’t get passed the price on this one though... yikes!! Only 4 stars because of the price!!! Beautiful serum - a bit pricey!?!
