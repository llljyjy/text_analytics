I have dry skin that is sensitive. I do like that there is no fragrance oils and the overall ingredient list isn’t too bad. It is a gel moisturizer so feels like Vaseline going on which not something everyone will like. I’ve been liking as my morning moisturizer, it’s a good base for under my SPF. Did expect to feel more hydrated with the claims from the add but overall this is a good moisturizer. nan
