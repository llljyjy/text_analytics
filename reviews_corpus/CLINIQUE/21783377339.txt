I really enjoyed using this moisturizer - Clinique never fails to disappoint. The formula was light, and hydrating, easy to work into my skin, and left my luminous but not greasy. I applied it before bed but Iâ€™m sure it would be a good base under makeup too, to keep it looking fresh and hydrated during the day. Deeply Hydrating & Silky Texture!
