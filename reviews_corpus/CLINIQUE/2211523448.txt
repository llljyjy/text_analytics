I received this tiny packet sample as a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and out of the 3 Clinique Smart Clinical Repair products, this was my favourite. Although there wasnâ€™t enough product to see a significant difference in my skin, I enjoyed the texture of the serum and how it felt being applied to my skin. It seemed to absorb nicely and moisturize my face even before applying moisturizer. I would seriously consider trying this serum more to see if it becomes my go-to daily serum. nan
