This is a very thick and creamy balm that melts your makeup right off. I love that it’s fragrance free. The only down side is you must use a wet cloth to remove it. You can’t just rinse with water alone. My skin felt soft, but almost like I needed to take another swipe with the washcloth. I felt it worked well on my mascara, so that’s a plus. Melts it off!
