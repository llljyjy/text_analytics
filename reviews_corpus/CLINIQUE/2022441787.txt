I have tried this entire line - first the serum then the eye cream and now this product. I will say this is my least favorite as I loved and repurchased the other two. The instructions say to use day and night but as with any retinol containing product I only use as night and every other night. Also the consistency of this cream seems as if it would be lightweight but when applying it is more suffocating than it seems - which makes for a beautiful night cream but not a day cream. For reference I have a normal skin type - not oily whatsoever but not dry either - just balanced for now. In winter I can become dehydrated. As far as wrinkle fighting benefits, it is too soon to tell but judging from the entire line I believe this would be promising to use as a set if that’s your thing. To me, investing in their serum may be enough and I’d really recommend that route first. Good night cream but I’d invest in serum
