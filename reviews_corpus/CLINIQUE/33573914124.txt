The Clinique Smart Clinical Repair is lightweight but packs a punch. It contains the cl 1870 peptide complex. I used this cream for 10 days and really enjoyed how it made the texture of my skin feel. I have mature skin and like the way this makes my skin feel moisturized all day without making it feel greasy. Basically,  it makes my skin feel supple. I applied a pea sized amount to my entire face and it was the right amount. My make seems to look more even and wear nicer throughout the day. I would recommend this wrinkle cream to anyone with mature skin  looking for a wrinkle cream. Clinique for the win
