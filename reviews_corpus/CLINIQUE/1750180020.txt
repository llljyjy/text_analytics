I have been looking for a new eye cream for a while now, so I was thrilled to find this cream! I have been using it for a few weeks now, and so far I am loving it! It has certainly made my tired eyes look less swollen and puffy, and they just feel more hydrated and firm. I haven’t yet noticed a huge difference in my fine lines and wrinkles, but I didn’t have that many to start with. I am looking forward to seeing how this product continues to help my eye area over time! Loving this eye cream so far!
