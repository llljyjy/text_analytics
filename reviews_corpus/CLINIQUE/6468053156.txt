Iâ€™m not sure how many times I have bought this but lets say alot, ALOT! I love this, I have sensitive skin, and a little rosacea and this does not irritate me at all, it is super easy to use and gentle around the eyes. This is a holy grail for me. But please follow instructions and use just a dab, a little goes a long way, and use on dry skin, it will melt your makeup, then go in with water lather if you wish and rinse with water, I go with in for second step with the clinique facial soap in mild. holy grail status
