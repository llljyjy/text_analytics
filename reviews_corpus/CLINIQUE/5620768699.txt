I wish I would have discovered this YEARS ago, like in high school. I’m in my 40s now and still dealing with acne from time to time. When I first start to feel something coming on, I put this on a few times the first day and it really makes a difference! most of the time it just is an irritating bump that clears up with the gel. Once in awhile it gets a little worse but I know this gel stops it in it’s tracks and reverses whatever is going on. My acne would be way worse without this product! It definitely speeds the healing process and prevents acne from coming to a head. I keep one in my bathroom and one in my truck (I don’t carry a purse anymore but I used to keep it in my purse instead, now it’s in my center console) so I am never without it because you never know where you will be when it first starts to come on and I want to be ready! Love it! Highly recommend! In fact, I just bought one for my teenage niece - I hope it helps with the teen hormone thing too... I keep one in my bathroom and one in my vehicle!
