I received a small sample from Clinique & Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  I love the way this cream feels on my skin.  It’s a bit on the thicker side, but absorbs very well on my skin.  I only received a tiny sample so it’s not enough to tell if it works for wrinkle repair.  I don’t like using this for the summer because it feels to thick for me.  But I can see myself using this a lot in the winter time when my skin gets very dry.  no overpowering scent, and super moisturizing.  Definitely will buy more when I run out. Thick and moisturizing
