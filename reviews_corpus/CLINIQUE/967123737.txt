This balm works just as well as it’s non-charcoal version. It’s hydrating while it helps clean off all types of make up including long wear lipstick, waterproof mascara, and glitter eyeshadow. But does the charcoal really make a difference. Not that I could tell but I also don’t have super oily or ance prone skin. Works well but is it magical?
