I received a deluxe sample of this and suffered through using it twice before discarding the rest. It REEKS of alcohol, and another reviewer’s assessment that it is akin to putting nail polish remover on your face rings true. I saw and felt no noticeable results, either. If you’re looking for a similar product that actually does something, you’re better off buying the Tarte Knockout toner. no thank you
