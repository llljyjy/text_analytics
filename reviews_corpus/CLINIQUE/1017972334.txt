I received this sample product complimentary for an honest review. Iâ€™m impressed with this cream! Goes on smooth, not too think. The texture is cool, gel like. Was able to wear under makeup. Did not cause breakouts or eye irritation. Not sure about wrinkle reducing ability, but I will use daily/nightly for long term results. Makes my skin feel fresh and dewy but not greasy. Love it. I like it!!
