I received a very small sample of this in exchange for my honest review. The directions say to use twice a day but I only used at night. Clinique says results will be visible after 4 weeks but I ran out after 2 weeks. So my review will be very limited. The cream is fairly thick, and feels luxuriously smooth on my skin. It has not clogged my pores or caused any breakouts, which is amazing considering how thick it is. I did not notice a decrease in wrinkles/fine lines, but perhaps I would have if I had been able to use as directed. Overall, itâ€™s an excellent deep moisturizer and I would use again in the future. Excellent moisturizer
