I received this #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox in exchange of my honest review. I tried the Clinique clinical repair wrinkle correcting cream for 7 days. White it is hydrating and smooth I don’t think it did much for wrinkles. Maybe it needs a more prolonged use. The cream went in smoothly and felt great. It did not smell or feel oily. I liked the cream but not sure that I can speak to it’s wrinkle fighting capabilities. Hydrating!
