I love this wrinkle correcting serum!! I got it from Top Box Circle #freeproduct and was so amazing. Even though it was a small sample, definitely make me enthusiastic to buy a full size. I have a combination of dry and oily skin and this serum e just perfect. The texture is great, itâ€™s smells great and the serum is easy absorbed by the skin. Definitely a go to! Perfect for any type of skin
