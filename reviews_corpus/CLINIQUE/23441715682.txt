I have a combination skin type. I typically avoid lotions that are too moisturizing because they tend to leave my skill glossy and oily. However, this is not the case. I found my skill to be incredibly hydrated (especially during winter) with little or no breakouts. Definitely recommend it as an add-on to your cleaning routine. Gave it 4 out of 5 starts because I will need to wait until summer to see if I can obtain the same results. Great moisturizer for winter!
