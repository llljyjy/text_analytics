I’d like the price point to go down a bit considering I need to use a nickle amount each time I cleanse.  Any less and I don’t find it removes my sunscreen and eye makeup effectively.  It is however, something that I’ve repurchased numerous times and I’m always happy to have it and sad when I run out.  My favorite feature is the ability to use it on my eyes without any irritation or oily residue after washing off.  It was wash off without a face cloth as well! Excellent cleanser
