I received a sample of this Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Serum from #tryitwithtopbox. There was only enough for two applications, so I could not tell a difference in fine line reduction. I applied it morning and night, pairing it with the other Clinique samples. I feel like it absorbs into my skin, rather than leaving a greasy feeling that other serums leave behind. I like that it is fragrance-free and oil free. #freeproduct Simple and Effective
