This moisturizer has an interesting almost gel-like consistancy. It has a very quick dry down and my skin looked dewy but felt dry to the touch and almost bordering on a tacky feeling. The texture was different and almost felt like I was putting a silicone primer on rather than a moisturizer and for that reason I don’t like it as much as a regular cream moisturizer but it did make my skin less dry and didn’t react with my skin in any weird way. nan
