I absolutely love this product! It feels so lightweight on my skin, but moisturizes so well. I love the gel formula as it doesn’t feel like it’s clogging my pores. I’ve always trusted Clinique as a skin care brand and this product really lives up to the brands name.  The price point is really great as a little product goes a long way. I would definitely recommend to anyone struggling with dry skin in need of a rescue! nan
