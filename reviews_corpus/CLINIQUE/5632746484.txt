I have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin and I really wanted to love this moisturizer because a lot of the typical gel formulations don’t hydrate enough when my surface dryness is flaring up. I did  really enjoy it at first, but after using this for a few days I started breaking me out. I may be able to continue with it more sporadically rather than every night, but I’m a bit disappointed. nan
