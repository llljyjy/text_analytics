I received this product for free in exchange for my honest feedback. This products goes on nicely and is thick enough that I feel like it is moisturizing. I have only been using it for a few weeks so can’t say yet how much of a difference it makes. It doesn’t feel oily though like many do and it does hydrate my skin. Goes on smooth!
