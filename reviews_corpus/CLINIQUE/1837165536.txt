Do you want to keep from wrinkles on your face and neck? This one works great. I already have fairly supple skin still on my face and neck at 40, but I could tell with this cream it tightened a little more. I know if I kept using it that I can have tight face/neck for at least another decade. There is no scent and that is a plus for me… finding out heavily scented skincare has been breaking me out. I received a sample for free from Influenster to try and give a review… I may need to get a full size. Keeps things tight
