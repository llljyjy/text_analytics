I received this product in exchange for my honest review. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox The ingredient listing for this product sounds great. Retinol with hyaluronic acid for moisture. I use hyaluronic acid daily and retinol alternating days as part of my regular routine. While this serum has a great texture, the sample was far to small to use for more than two nights. I cannot speak to any long term benefit and would be hesitant to purchase given the price is much, much higher than the products I currently use. Based on the ingredients, I would say it should be gentle enough for regular use. Nice texture
