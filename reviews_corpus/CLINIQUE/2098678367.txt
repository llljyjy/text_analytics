I received this product for an honest review. I have combination skin with dry patches on my forehead and around my mouth area. I saw the most improvement of my skin with the cream after using it overnight. I also like the texture of the product is very smooth and a lot goes a long way. I wanted to see how the product will work on my neck area to tighten my skin so I focused on that area when applying. After using for 3 weeks I found that my skin on my neck was smoother and I saw less lines. My skin felt very hydrated after using and I didnâ€™t notice as many dry patches over time I had no patches.  I would recommend this moisturizer to others and I did have results over time with reduced lines on my neck. My immediate results was moisturizing and softer skin on neck and face. Hydrate and smooth skin all in one
