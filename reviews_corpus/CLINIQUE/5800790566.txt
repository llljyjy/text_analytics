I received the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream for free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. I have dry, mature skin that I tryI’ve been using this cream for a little over a week now and I love it. It feels so luxurious going on my skin. There is no fragrance, and the consistency is like a cream-gel hybrid. It absorbs great and my makeup applies over the top without any trouble. I use it both morning and night, and I can tell after using it for several days that my skin stays hydrated and doesn’t feel as tight after I remove my makeup at night or when I get up in the morning. My main drawback is the price. In my opinion, it feels very luxurious but has the price to match. I only got a sample size and haven’t used all of it after over a week, so I can see splurging myself and being very frugle with how much I use. I would be willing to buy this maybe if I catch a promotion for points or on sale sometime. Overall, it is a wonderful cream and I do recommend it. nan
