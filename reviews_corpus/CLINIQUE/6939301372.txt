I got this product from influenster. Here is my honest review. This moisturizer is a thicker formula. I only used it at night because i didnt prefer the way it sat under makeup on my combination skin during the day. It is hydrating and cooling upon application which is lovely. I didnâ€™t notice any change in moisture to my skin after using it. To be honest it was just okay for me Not for me
