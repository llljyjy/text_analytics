I suppose the very small sample-sized #freeproduct I received was not quite enough to really make a solid assessment. I thought the product itself had a nice smooth texture, and very mild smell. Upon use it seemed to be quite hydrating. Perhaps it was the small amount I was given, or my personal wrinkle situation, but I really did not see any changes at all in regards to what is supposed to be the main function of this product. Absolutely no discernable change in wrinkles for me. I even developed a few pimples which may have been from this or the moisturizer from the same line. I don’t know, I just had a very mediocre experience with this line of products. Doesn’t seem to do anything for wrinkles but it’s a nice product for the hydrating factor. nan
