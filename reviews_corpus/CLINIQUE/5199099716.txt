I liked it. It’s a heavier cream, so I suggest using this at night only. I feel like it made my skin more supple and definitely helped prevent transepidermal water loss. It being fragrance free was a bonus. Even if you didn’t want to use it all over your face, it can be used as an eye cream or lip treatment. I can also say the few signs of premature aging I did have may have disappeared because of it. All I know is this cream keeps the skin young looking and moisturized. Extremely Hydrating
