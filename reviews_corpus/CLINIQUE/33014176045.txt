I’ve used Clinique for 30 years. I have also been very loyal to Estee Lauder for their skin-care line. I received a mini sample of this product, and was a bit skeptical because I wasn’t expecting a big change from a sample. Boy, was I wrong!  I have developed wrinkles over the years from squinting in the sunlight. I am very aware of them and have used various expensive eye creams to treat this delicate area of skin in the hopes of minimizing fine lines and wrinkles.  There was a noticeable difference only a week after using this cream. The skin around my eyes looked supple and almost radiant. The cream is very emollient with a wonderful slip to the touch. I applied a small dot beneath my eye on the orbital bone, one above my eye just below the brow, and one about an inch to the side of my eye, gently patting it in.  I used this once in the morning and once at night. The tiny amount used for each of these three little dots ensures that the cream will last several months. I have submitted a photo, untouched, that shows the new brightness and decreased lines in this area (especially compared to the other lines on my face).  I also noticed that the area of application, particularly under the eye, seemed brighter. This was also apparent in photographs. As a bonus, I placed a couple of dots around my upper lip area during all of my applications, and got the same result!  This is now my go-to for eyes. I like the powerful result but the gentle feel, which is often hard to find. Thank you @influenster @clinique Definitely Recommend! Great Eye Cream
