Not a life changing eye cream for me but then again I do not have much need for zm eye cream yet unless for preventative measures. I do not have many fine lines or crow’s feet nor under eye bags or puffiness. Maybe it would be more noticeable of a change if I did? It is lightweight and sinks in nicely. But I cannot justify spending a pretty penny on an eye cream and usually clinique is a more “affordable“ skincare brand! Nothing new
