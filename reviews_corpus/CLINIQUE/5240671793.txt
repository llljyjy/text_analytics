I have super oily skins. The moisturizer was good but I felt really thick on my skin, which makes sense given that this is meant for 100 hours of moisture. I wouldn’t prefer this for my skin oily skin type but I’m sure it’ll do wonders if you have dry skin. Overall, I wouldn’t purchase the item myself (I was gifted this through Influenster) as it doesn’t fit my skin type or skin care routine. Nothing wrong with the product itself ! Not for Oily Skin
