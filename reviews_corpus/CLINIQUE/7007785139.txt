I received a sample size of this product through Influenster. Although it was a small sample size these are my thoughts so far: I love the texture of this product it doesn’t feel greasy and feels so soft and watery and blends and sinks so nicely into the skin. I’m currently pregnant and noticed my skin a bit more dry than usual and this has kept it moisturized for majority of the day with no breakouts. I would like to continue trying it out, but I would recommend people to try this out! nan
