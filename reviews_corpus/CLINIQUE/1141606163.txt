I received this product from Clinique and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve only been able to use the product for a week so far.  It has a nice thick consistency which is perfect to use during the winter time. It works well underneath makeup or alone. I haven’t yet been able to see any drastic differences in fine lines, but I’m sure once I use it for 4 weeks, it will start to show. Good so far
