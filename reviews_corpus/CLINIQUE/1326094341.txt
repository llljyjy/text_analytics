I love this moisturizer and have been using it for years (I used the previous version before, I think it was 72 hour rather than 100). It has a great gel texture that is very moisturizing but not at all oily or greasy. I have acne prone, combination skin and this has never made me breakout. I also use a prescription retinol (tretinoin) at night which is very drying and this provides great hydration. I use this at night and the Clinique Dramatically Different Gel in the morning and I would highly recommend both, especially if you’re using other topicals in the morning (vitamin c serum, etc.) and at night (retinol, etc.) since these are just straightforward moisturizers that won’t counteract with the rest of your skincare. Great, straightforward moisturizer
