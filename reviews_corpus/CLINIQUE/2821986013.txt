I received a complimentary sample of this product for testing purposes, however I will be purchasing it in the regular size! It is a gel like moisturizer, that has very little scent and works great for day to day. I have oily skin and I find this does not increase that feeling at all, in fact smoothes and softens skin quickly. I only gave 4 stars due to the fact it doesnâ€™t seem overly moisturizing as I said , but is great for day use under makeup. I would recommend this product. Moisture surge
