I’ve been using Clinique’s new Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Cream every day for the last week, and I’m here to tell you that it’s a winner.I’ve tried a tons of creams and lotions in my life, but this one is different and unique. It’s thick and luxurious, yet it goes on like a much thinner cream—it leaves my skin refreshed and glowing. My skin feels soft and silky, and my husband has commented daily on how beautiful I look. He started telling me I looked extra beautiful the day after I began using this cream!I definitely plan on making this a staple in my daily routine now! I’m hooked! This one is a winner!!!!
