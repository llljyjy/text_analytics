I received this free from Influenster for my honest review. I am 42 with dry skin and fine lines that are standard for my age. I first noted it had a strong smell, like paint almost but it went away quickly. Smells don’t bother me but it’s worth noting if you are sensitive to smells. The smell did go away quickly when applied. It was very moisturizing. Made my face feel very soft. I did not notice any major difference with the fine lines but the added moisture in the cream made it work very well under make up. I used to with three different types of foundations. A serum, a bb cream, and a stick foundation. It worked under all 3. Thank you Influenster for this to review. Nice moisturizer
