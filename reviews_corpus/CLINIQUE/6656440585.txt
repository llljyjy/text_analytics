Thanks to Topbox Circle and Clinique I received this Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum free in exchange for my honest opinion.   It’s unfortunately very difficult to rate a product with such a tiny 1ml sample. But I can tell what I like about it. I used it for 3 days and nights under the Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream and I can say that it is refreshing and that my skin felt smooth. As for the result I would expect….more product would of been needed #freeproduct #trywithtopbox REFRESHING
