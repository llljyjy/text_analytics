I use this as a 5 minute mask and it is non irritating. I am pleased to see less blackheads after washing. Prior to using, I was skeptical about blackhead treatments as most I have tried did not work. I bought this on sale when it was $10 off. If it continues to go on sale, I would like to stock up. Blackhead solutions - yes
