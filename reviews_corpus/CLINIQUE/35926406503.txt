I received this product to try and give an honest opinion.  My skin tends to be dry and I am starting to get fine lines around my eyes and mouth that come with age.  I love how this product felt on my fingers .  It is very smooth and not very heavy.  I applied it to my face and loved that it didnâ€™t make my face feel heavy or my skin to feel clogged the way some products do.  I noticed the lines starting to fade after about 5 days of using the product.  I will continue to use this because I like the results so far. Watch your fine lines fade away
