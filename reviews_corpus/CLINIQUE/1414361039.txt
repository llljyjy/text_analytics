So far I like it and it doesn’t irritate the skin around my eyes! While I haven’t had it long enough to talk about long term results, the hydration is amazing, and I think for me that helps the most with wrinkles (I live in a super dry state). The hyaluronic acid helps the next day with my concealer sitting better under my eyes. While I do think most eye creams are glorified moisturizers, I would still recommend giving this one a try! Not too bad! I like it!
