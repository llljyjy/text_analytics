i’ve used the oil control gel and texture insert for some time now and it’s the best lotion i’ve ever used. I struggle with oily skin but also most lotions clog my pores and create a horrible texture and acne. I tried to use the first aid beaty lotion instead of this and my texture came back instantly and i broke out, i don’t know why this lotion isn’t more popular!! please don’t discontinue i will fie!! Never found a better lotion for my oily skin!!!
