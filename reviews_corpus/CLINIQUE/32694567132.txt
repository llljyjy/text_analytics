I received this product as a sample size to try and give my honest opinion. I gave it 3 stars because I do love how it made my skin feel, it is light weight, little to no smell, and made my skin very soft. It does not leave my face oil and blended well with my skincare routine. I did not give it more stars for I did not see a change in lines and wrinkles. I have noticed bigger changes in less time with other products. For the cost I do not feel it does what it says. BUT I will say if you are looking for a really good moisturizer this is that! I think a little went a long way. I used in my face and neck twice a day and had enough for several weeks on the sample jar I received so I feel like the regular size will last awhile if you aren’t slathering it on. Great moisturizer… meh in wrinkle correcting
