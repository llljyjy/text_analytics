I received this as a free sample, but I don’t know if I’ll get a full sized version any time soon. It’s very gentle, not irritating at all, but it doesn’t really live up to its claim of being super hydrating; like a lot of other clinique products, it falls a bit short of its main claim, but not so much to make me hate the product altogether (but that’s only because I haven’t had the misfortune of finding this out after purchasing a full-sized tube of this mask!). Personally, I think it’s good for using when you introduce new products/ingredients to your skincare routine and just want to see how your skin will react. non-irritating, but that’s about it
