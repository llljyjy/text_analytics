Been using this for 1 week and so far so good! I have oily skin and I live in AZ, so it’s always dry and hot here.  This cream does not make me break out or irritate my skin. I know with this brand, my skin is pretty safe! It does a great job of hydrating but not making my skin even more oily than it already is. I’ll be repurchasing this cream from now on. So far so good
