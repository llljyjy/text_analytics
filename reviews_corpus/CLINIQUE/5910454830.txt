Ive been using Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum for a bit, and again it seems ok. It’s really hard to tell how the product works if the sample is so small. All it tells me is that it doesn’t irritate my skin which is great but that all I know. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox hmmmmm!
