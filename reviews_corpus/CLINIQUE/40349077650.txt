Having received this product as a sample to test, I was excited to try it! Being 46, I’ve now reached the age of “maturing skin.“ Yikes! With that said, I wasn’t disappointed in this product. It’s light, airy and fragrance free. I love the I don’t feel it laying heavy on my skin. Does it work? After a few weeks of us, I have notice a slight change in appearance. If you’re expecting a “one use: miracle, this product isn’t it. If you intent to use it daily, over an extended time, you won’t be disappointed. With this, slow and steady wins the race! A long haul win!
