I can’t change my review on the resculpt so I’ll post it here. Love the product, but the jar is literally half empty. I assume some shifting will happen in transit, so I smoothed out the surface to see the real level. Disappointed. I glad I got this on sale, but doubt this will last a long time. Not worth 90$ for sure. nan
