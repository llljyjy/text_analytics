First off, this cream is THICK. While Clinique says this is for all skin types, I would disagree. I’ve had oily skin for most of my life that has only calmed into somewhat more combo skin as I’ve approached 40. This cream is just too heavy and greasy for my skin, though it would probably be a dream for dry or normal to dry skin. It also goes on and stays on the surface of the skin for quite a while, rather than absorbing right away. So if you are looking for a really super moisturizing, thick, serious cream moisturizer that will target wrinkles and fine lines, give this a go. It may be your jam! Would be great for dry skin!
