Got to try a sample of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum through #freeproduct from Top Box along with a sample of Clinique’s correcting eye cream and wrinkle correcting cream from the same product line.As the sample that I received was quite small, it was hard to get the full effects of the serum but not much of the product seemed to be needed. I applied the serum to some fine lines that are starting to appear and used the serum every night during my nightly routine for a week.I noticed that the forming lines seemed to be less apparent after the week but it wasn’t a huge obvious noticable change due to the usage of a week.Easy to apply the product and would love to try more of the product in the future. Overall, solid product! Solid serum!
