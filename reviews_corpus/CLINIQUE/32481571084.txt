I got to try this complimentary product in exchange for my awfully honest review. This is a nice addition to the Clinique lineup.  It’s creamy, absorbs wonderfully,  it doesn’t irritate my skin or eyes, and a little bit goes a long way so this will last ya a while.  My eye area looked hydrated and refreshed, and it wore well under my makeup.I like this! Absorbs well & hydrates great
