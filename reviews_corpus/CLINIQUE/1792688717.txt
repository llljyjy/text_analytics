I have combo skin and this cream made my skin a little oilier than other creams I have used. It has a nice consistency but it’s not very thick. It’s a good moisturizer, I guess, I haven’t bem given enough time to review it. I can’t say its potent either in terms of fighting wrinkles. It layers well under makeup. It may work for some people…
