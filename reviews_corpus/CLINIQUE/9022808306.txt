Love this Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream, feels so smooth when I put it on. Doesn’t feel greasy and very low on scent. I must need to use this for more than a couple of weeks for it to work. I didn’t notice any difference on my self. It did make my face feel smooth and hydrated. Hydrated
