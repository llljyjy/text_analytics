This moisturizer cream has gel consistency that I actually quite liked. It absorbed quickly and has no scent. It’s not oily or sticky at all.As someone with sensitive skin this product was actually kind of perfect. My skin has been quite dry lately (pregnancy hormones) and this helped quite a bit. It helped with the tightness I’ve been feeling. Such relief. nan
