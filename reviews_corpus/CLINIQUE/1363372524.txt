I received this eye cream for free ro try and give an honest review.  The formula is smooth and absorbs right into the delicate eye area.  It does not have a fragrance and has not bothered my eyes upon application. I  have been able to apply makeup after application without issue. I cannot attest to the effectiveness since I have only been using it for a few weeks but I will continue to use it and would consider a repurchased upon finishing this jar. fast aborbing and good under makeup
