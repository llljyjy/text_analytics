I received a sample size of this product and I have to say I am impressed. I tried it both in the being when I went to bed and in the morning before I put on my makeup. It kept my skin feeling moisturized through the day and night. But only set back was that I did find it slightly scented, so if you have a sensitive nose I would be careful applying it to that area. All in all I am very happy, and I plan to purchase more for myself. Great product
