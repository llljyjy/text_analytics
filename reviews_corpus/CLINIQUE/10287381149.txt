I received this sample thanks to #Topbox.  I’ve used the serum in the line before and I am glad to try the cream.  The cream is pretty rich, but not oily.  Perfect for the cool dry fall weather we are having now.  I’ve used it for about a week so far.  I like the texture, the feel and the light scent.  I haven’t notice much about the correction part of it.  It would be a nice night cream for the winter. Rich but not oily
