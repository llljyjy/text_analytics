I have combination skin and sometimes it’s hard to find a good product but smart clinical repair by Clinique felt great on my skin! It’s a nice thick cream that’s not to greasy and it made my skin feel instantly hydrated! I didn’t notice any reduction in the fine lines on my face but I did notice that it made my skin feel a lot softer after using it for a couple weeks! I think I will buy a larger size and try it out. I recommend others with combination skin try it as well! Thanks Influenster
