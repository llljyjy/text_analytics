I received a sample size to test out. I tried to use a little at a time and was able to get 3 uses out of it. It is unscented, so great for those with perfume allergies. I have a patch of dry skin just to the left of my eye and it got rid of the flaky skin almost immediately. I have combination skin but tend to get random dry patches. I might try this product but prefer skin care products with some sort of scent to them, and itâ€™s a bit in the higher price range for the amount that you get. nan
