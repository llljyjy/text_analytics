The product itself is good, very thin and liquidy more than a traditional salve but it took a good hour to open this. I had to bring it to my dad and he ended up having to use pliers to open this tiny thing. There really needs to be a twist top or a tube really anything but that because without even opening it, there was product all over the container making it even harder to open. horrible packaging
