It’s ok? it feels like Vaseline but less heavy, the color is so off from photo online and the tint doesn’t really show on your lips- also the packaging is kinda annoying because if your hands are the tiniest bit greasy you can’t open it. Just spend the extra bucks on the laniege stuff it’s so good. eh?
