I am obsessed with chapsticks. Smiths is by far my favorite! leaves my lips super soft and hydrated. I find some chipsticks leave my lips a little dry so I need to keep using the product, Smith’s doesn’t not leave my lips feeling that way, but I still like using it lots and I haven’t had chapped or burnt lips in over 3 years. It is about $8 a tube but well worth it. lots of different scents as well which is nice. haven’t found one I didn’t like. My must have chapstick
