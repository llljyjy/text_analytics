Looks like Sephora sent me the dented product. It is very difficult to open the lid. Every time I want to apply lip balm, I have to use all my fingers and my fingernails to open the lid. The lip balm product is so good, but I don’t think I’ll buy the Rosebud tin in the future. I would buy a tube-type instead. The best lip balm in the worst tin hard to open
