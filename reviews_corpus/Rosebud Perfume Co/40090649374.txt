I received a lip balm today, and there’s no way I can open the lid. I even can’t break it. I watched a few videos and went to one store, but nobody can’t open it. I can’t believe such beautiful packaging has this impaired function that trouble opening a lid. I need a replacement with a proper lid so I can open it and use the product. nan
