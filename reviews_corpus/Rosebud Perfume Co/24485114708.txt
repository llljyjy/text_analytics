This is my fav of the 3 tin balms I’ve tried. It’s so smooth and offers the slightest red tint to make your lips look juicy and healthy. It lasts a long while and the minty tingling is just the right amount, it doesn’t burn. I also love the packing, it came tightly wrapped and despite most of the reviews it’s easy to open (twist it) A comforting product
