I’ve been using this on my lips before bed for almost 4 years now. A little bit goes a long way, and it feels pretty moisturizing. However, my lips still feel kind of chapped and dry by the morning, so I think it’s time to upgrade to something like the Lanegie sleeping mask. Too bad  because it’s triple the price!
