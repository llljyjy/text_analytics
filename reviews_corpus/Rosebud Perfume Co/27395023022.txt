First the packaging, is hard to open, almost impossible to open,also when I try to open it, it was greasy on the outside too, even tho I just wash it offSecond the product, is greasy, melted. it does not look like the image, after you open the lid, it stick to every where, all over the lid(of course not out side the lid, but in side the lid, which make it hard to open)Third the price, this does not worth the price on my opinion, I haven’t use it on my lip yet, but just like what others review have said, it feel like Vaseline but more greaser and have scent the product are now in the refrigerator DON’T buy it
