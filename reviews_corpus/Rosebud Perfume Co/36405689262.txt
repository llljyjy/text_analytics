I think that if you really hate someone getting them this as a gift is probably the most evil thing you can do. While the product itself is great, this little tin is so hard to open I just don’t wear the lip balm sometimes for the sole fact that I couldn’t get the tin to open. Great Product, Horrible Packaging
