I bought on a whim due to dry lips in the checkout. I had never tried this line of lip balm before and always see it, so thought I would give it a try. It is horrible. The smells is of vicks and the consistency is like a non-nourishing thin vaseline. It does not hydrate the lips at all and in fact, they feel less hydrated once it wears off. Ideally I will be able to return this. Strong Dislike
