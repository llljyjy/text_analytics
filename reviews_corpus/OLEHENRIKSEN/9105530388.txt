I received Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence as a gift from Ole Henriksen In exchange for my opinion.  I apply to freshly washed skin. It helps to prep my face for my makeup. It protects my skin from the pollutions in the air. It’s my first defense against environmental stressors, helps bind moisture and strengthen my skin’s barrier function.  This has a light and clean scent of oranges. Feels wonderful as I apply it to my face.  I have noticed my fine lines look softer. My makeup looks flawless. I love the look of the glass bottle setting at my makeup station. It’s orange with a twist off lid. Very attractive and functional. Fresh Faced
