Got sooo excited trying this product because Iâ€™ve been looking for a good quality night cream. First of all, I love the consistensy and creaminess of this product. The smell was a 4 out of 5. It has been my first two days using this product and I already feel my skin is doing a lot better. I have this fresh pimple that I popped the other day and it was very red, the next couple of days the redness and soreness already subsided down. I love how this cream also has AHA to heal dark spots that you have. Amazing product!! New fave night cream
