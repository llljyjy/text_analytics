Gifted by Ole Henriksen, their Dewtopia 5% acid firming night creme makes me feel like my skin is going to work every night. I have dry skin with pores and wrinkles so this creme does the job when I wake up seeing neither from the glow from the night before. I highly recommend if you’re looking for something to hydrate and reduce creases. I’ve been using it nightly due to its ingredient of AHAs which should be avoided with sunlight. Dewey dream
