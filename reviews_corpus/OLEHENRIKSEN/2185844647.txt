This product is has instant results for sure . I usually apply retinols during the fall / winter and because of the extreme weather as well my skin dries out a lot . I have used products that are moisturizing ( contains peptides and hydrologic acid ) but they can be too thick or take a while to sink in . This one was not the case . It has a light citrus smell that goes away after you apply it . Also the consistency is light and a little goes a long way ( my only deduction is because one should be warn ) . My mistake that I did applying it for the first time I applied too much and my skin look too hydrated and it wasn’t working well with my SPF . So it started to peel . Next time I applied less than a quarter size for my face and neck and it worked fine . So totally my fault . But at night I do apply more and when I wake up my skin looks totally plump and glowing. My husband asked me recently what I have been doing to my skin because it looked radiant ( which my husband has never said that to me lol ) . So it’s doing what it claims and I been using it for about 3 weeks . Super excited to keep using it and will update after the eight weeks ( it claims you can see visible results by then ). To show how it performs , I am tagging a photo . New favorite for sure and it’s up there with DE and Kate Somerville. Instant Moister and no allergic reaction !
