I got this product from Influenster and Olehenriksen in exchange for my honest review. I was very excited to try this eye cream. I had yet to find an eye cream that worked well with my skin. This was a very nice product. I did notice the brightening very quickly, along with an improvement in the fine lines under my eyes. I did also note an increased sensitivity to sunlight, so make sure youâ€™re using your sunscreen with this product! Very nice for a vitamin C eye cream
