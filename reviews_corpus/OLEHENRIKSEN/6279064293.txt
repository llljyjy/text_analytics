This night cream is extremely hydrating. It leaves behind a dewy look and feel, not greasy or sticky. The texture is kind of balm/cream like , it initially feels thick but a little goes a long way and once you spread it out it feels light weight and nourishing.  It has a very subtle citrus scent to it (similar to the banana bright eye Creme). I love that this is an instantly hydrating product that plumps my skin. It layers well with other skincare and didnâ€™t cause me any sensitivity! I love this night Creme. A new holy grail!
