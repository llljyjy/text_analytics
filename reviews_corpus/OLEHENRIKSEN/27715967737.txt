I was gifted this Truth Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Vitamin C Essence by Ole Henriksen in exchange for an honest review. As a woman in her mid-forties, I am always looking for any products that offer anti-aging benefits to help with the appearance of my skin. Dullness, lack of hydration and fine lines and wrinkles are definitely causes for concern for me and I appreciate skin care that addresses these and even better when a product tackles more than one of these issues at a time. So with all of that being said, I was quite excited to try this essence and have been loving it so far! Packed with fermented orange peel extract, orange stem cells and vitamin C, this product is designed to nourish and moisturize, provide anti-oxidant benefits, brighten skin dullness, and also fight the signs of aging such as fine lines and wrinkles while strengthening the skin barrier. I have seen a wonderful glow to my skin since adding to my routine and feel like my skin has looked more youthful and hydrated as well. The essence itself has a fabulous orange scent and a lightweight texture that of between a toner and a serum. I typically apply by dispensing a few drops in to my palm and then lightly pressing into the skin after Iâ€™ve cleansed and toned and prior to applying my serums and moisturizer. I am loving the results thus far and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an essence geared to provide anti-aging and brightening benefits. Refreshing Essence!
