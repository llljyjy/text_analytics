My husband has been stepping up his skin care routine. He has been trying several products. He tends to have oily skin. He tried this facial scrub and has raved about how it makes his skin feel so much cleaner without being too drying. He has sensitive skin and it doesn’t irritate it at all. I’ve noticed also that it’s really helped clear his skin. He raves about it and it has quickly become a favorite product. Fantastic results
