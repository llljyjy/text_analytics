I love everything about this product other than the fact that it makes my skin a little too greasy.  If you have super dry skin, this will be perfect for you.  Just a bit too moisturizing for me.  It literally stays on for over 24 hours though.  Smell and consistency are also 10/10. Amazing for Dry Skin
