I liked this product fairly well. I wish the creme wasn’t yellow tinted as I have a pink undertone. It feels nice and not too heavy. I haven’t noticed it working better than my other eye cremes, but it wasn’t worse. I probably wouldn’t purchase for myself but I’ll use what I’ve got. Bright but not brightest
