I received the Barrier Booster Orange Ferment  Essence complimentary.  I really like the product and hope with continued use it will really brighten my face.  The product went on easily and was more of a serum then lotion.  Once it dried, I continued with sunscreen, moisturize and make/up.  I also loved the fresh orange scent. nan
