Ole is stepping up their game! It was one of the first brands I used when I started my skincare journey in my 20’s but fell out as I moved on to more sophisticated brands/products.  I love their new peptide moisturizer and was happy to try this essence I was gifted by Ole Henriksen. First impressions is this is a heavier, milkier essence than I’m used to. Packed with Vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide it delivers a boost to my routine and gives my skin a hydrated glow. I’m also really impressed with the packaging. It’s a heavier glass bottle and looks nicer than their previous design.(side note: I think my profile states the wrong age, I’m 36 for reference) A Whole New Ole
