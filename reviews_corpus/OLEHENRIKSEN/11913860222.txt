My skin is so dry and flakey over winter months (dry and cold weather) and this moisturizer works like a charm! I put it on at night before bed and the next day my face feels soft and not dry and not heavy. Itâ€™s also not heavy, so no sweating or the product sliding off your skin. Perfect for winter skin!!
