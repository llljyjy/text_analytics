I have been using it for more than 2 weeks by now, it instantly hydrates and illuminates the skin around my eyes which is the best, it makes my under eyes area  look healthier, brighter and smoother, this eye cream absorbs nicely it doesnâ€™t give me any irritation. I use it mornings and nights every single day. It works wonders under concealer. For days with no makeup this cream gives me the healthy bright and color needed around eyes. Definitely see the difference on my skin around eyes. This new formula fragrance-free is my new favorite. My new favorite eye cream
