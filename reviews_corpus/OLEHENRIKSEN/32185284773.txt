I really like this moisturizer and so far, my skin likes it too. My only real problem with it is that it doesn’t come with a spatula to scoop out the product. Even if my fingers are clean I don’t like it. Has to but one for it. Aside from that, it has like a cool sensation to it. Feels nice. My skin likes it
