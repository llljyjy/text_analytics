I received this product for free from Influenster and OLEHENRIKSEN in exchange for my honest review.  I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks and I put it on before makeup. Makeup goes on well and it has a nice shimmer to it that gives it a brightening effect. The formula is pretty thick; it’s great under the eye, but is a bit heavy for the eyelid. Nice formula
