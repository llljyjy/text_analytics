Give me anything and everything Olé! I am so excited to add this night cream to my evening routine after falling in love with the dewtopia serum. Currently, my skin is leaning combo/dry with this seasonal change. After a few uses, this has already shown my skin so much love. After applying and the dry down, it has a bit of a tacky feel, like the serum but after applying a face oil, it leaves my skin feeling so soft. In the mornings, I notice my skin looking extra plump and smooth which I love. It doesn’t have a scent and doesn’t pill with other products. I love it! nan
