I applied this under my eyes and I right away noticed the difference on how bright my face looks. I used to highly rely on highlighter to take away that tired look. Now with this, I feel like my makeup looks better. This brightens my eyes and makes them feel hydrated. It is not scented so no need to be concerned about the scent. Also, a big plus is that it has vitamin C. I highly recommend this product! nan
