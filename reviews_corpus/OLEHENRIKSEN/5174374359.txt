I was so glad to receive this beautiful orange ferment essence from Ole Henriksen. As a lover of essences, I was quick to want to try this. The scent is divine! Not too strong but enough to make me look forward to using it. Itâ€™s left my skin soft and hydrated and ready for the next steps. I highly recommend! Amazing essence!
