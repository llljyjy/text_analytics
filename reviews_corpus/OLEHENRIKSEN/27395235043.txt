This night cream smells and looks like a lemon cream dessert! The texture is buttery and massages so nicely into my skin. This cream is nourishing but doesnâ€™t feel heavy or sticky. It makes my skin feel instantly hydrated and so soft and smooth the next morning. I love that the acids resurfaces my skin overnight for a next day glow. nan
