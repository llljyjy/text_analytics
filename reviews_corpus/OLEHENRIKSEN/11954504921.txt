I am a big fan of face masks and I have tried many from Sephora but I keep going back to this one. It feels like your face just got a cold flash of life to it and feels amazing when you rinse it off. I find my skin feeling so refreshed after I use it and it helps calm down any imperfections & redness I have going on. My favorite mask
