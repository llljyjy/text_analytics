I was taking selfies on Snapchat and thought I had a filter on-it’s made my skin look that good! I’ve been using this almost for almost two months and today realized just how much of an impact it’s had as I’ve not changing any other skincare/makeup/eating/drinking/exercise routines at all. My skin is glowing (this and glow recopie water melon toner are a match made in heaven to get glowy skin), looks blurred and air brushed in real life, my under eyes aren’t crepes and I can get concealer to not only stick to them, but look good (ik it’s not advised to use around the eyes, but I do and nothing bad has happened yet, it’s actually improved them)and the lines as deep as craters in my forehead are only there if I scrunch my eyebrows up really hard, not when my face was resting like they used to be. You have to try this! results are amazing, and if it doesn’t work for you….Sephora has a great return policy nan
