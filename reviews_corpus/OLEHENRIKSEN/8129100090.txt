I have combination skin with dark under eyes and this product is great for moisturizing, I also noticed a significant wrinkle reduction after a couple of weeks. It did not help my dark circles, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. It has a good scent and texture. I received this product for free from influenster to test and review. Great moisturizer
