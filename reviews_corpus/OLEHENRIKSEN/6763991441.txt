I received a little jar sample of this from sephora and I wanted to love it so bad because of all the good ingredients. However the first thing I noticed is that it smells like MOTOR OIL. Maybe I got a bad batch, I duno, but I’ve never hated a product scent so much before. Second, its fairly thick and ended up pilling bad. Don’t recommend. So disappointed
