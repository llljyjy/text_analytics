*Received this product in exchange for an honest reviewThis eye brightening product is something I was anticipating trying since I have such dark under-eye circles. I think an element of it is genetic but a large portion of it is probably lack of sleep and proper skin care over the years. This banana bright eye cream is a newer, fresh formula used to brighten and hydrate your skin around the eye. The packaging is definitely bright and it reminds me of citrus and summer colors. I was anticipating that it would have a strong citrus smell (which I do not like) and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it has no citrus smell at all. In fact, I did not find it to have any smells or perfumes. The product itself is a small size, but itâ€™s a pretty standard size for eye creams. The texture of the product is good - there is depth to it, but it is not heavy, which is important because the skin around the eye is tender and sensitive. I find that it is a perfect base for concealer and it blends well. The makeup applied seamlessly. The cool thing is, I noticed the difference probably after my second or third application. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an anti-aging or brightening eye cream. nan
