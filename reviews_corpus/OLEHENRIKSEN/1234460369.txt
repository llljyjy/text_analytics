The olehenriksen banana bright plus vitamin c eye creme was very hydrating and perfect for my somewhat sensitive skin. Some eye creams in the past made my skin more sensitive but this formula helped a lot. I already saw a big difference in just about two weeks for dark circles and elasticity for my skin. The price point was fair and well made. I recommend this product. hydrating
