As a beauty retail expert who has been in the industry for over 8 years, I have to say that I love the quality of products Ole Henriksen has to offer! I love their Banana bright serum and face moisturizer. The new addition to my skin favorites includes their Banana bright + vitamin C eye cream. Firstly I love how this product smells! You can instantly smell the tangy vitamin C present in the product. Secondly I love how smooth it feels on my skin. After continuous use of this eye cream, I have seen a visible improvement in my dark circles. My under eyes are brighter and less puffy after using this cream. I give it 5 stars! You must try this eye cream if you are looking for an effective solution for tired looking eyes. Get yours today! OleHenriksen Banana Bright + Vitamin C eye cream
