** I received this product for free from OleHenriksen and Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion and review***This under eye cream gives a nice brightening effect to my under eye area, but there are two problems that I have with it. It’s quite subtle, but it does have a little bit of an SPF/citrus-y smell to it, even though to my knowledge this product doesn’t have spf. Also, even though it seems to do a great job at moisturizing my under eye area, even after the product absorbs it has a bit of a slick feel to it. It’s not necessarily greasy, but it feels similar enough to it to the point where it made me think of that. Otherwise, this is a great under eye cream, and I will definitely consider purchasing it when I run out. Love it but there are problems
