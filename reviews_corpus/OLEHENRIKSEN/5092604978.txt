I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review and I was so excited when I saw it was a OleHenrikson product! Every product of theirs I’ve used has produced such great results to my skin. This cream does kind of feel like a gel-cream hybrid. It’s so smooth and feels so nice being applied! There’s a very light, I would say lavender scent.. but it’s very light. It actually reminds me of the Tatcha Dewy moisturizer in some ways. However, the scent is way lighter in this one. Also, it’s not a thin moisturizer at all.. I would say it might seem like it’s thick at first until you actually apply it and realize it’s just a gel-cream hybrid, it’s not a heavy moisturizer that can leave your skin kind of greasy and heavy if that makes sense. It absorbs almost right away. I applied mine  about 6 hours ago and my face still looks healthy, plump in the young looking way, and had a glass skin appearance. Also, makeup applies beautifully over this product! It glides right on and looks a lot more healthy with less texture! This is the first time I’ve ever used a gel-cream hybrid moisturizer and I am in love! I need the moisture for my dry skin in the winter, but I also don’t want any of it to sit on top of my skin. This one checks all the boxes and I can honestly say I’ve found my new favorite!!! Another W for OleHenrikson!!!!
