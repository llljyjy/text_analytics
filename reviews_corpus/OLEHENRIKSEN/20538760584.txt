If you want glass skin give this a try. Within minutes I noticed my skin pulling slightly tighter due to the exfoliation and I noticed even more the next morning. I’be only been using this for about two weeks (using every 2-3 nights to not over exfoliate) so I haven’t seen any long term results, but I can tell this actually dissolved dead skin cells and dirt on my skin. My husband and I both tested this out and we both noticed a slight tingling/burn after application, which I don’t tend to notice with a lot of acids/chemical exfoliants. Along with just seeing the results, this made me feel like this product was actually doing something, which I don’t always notice instantly with other products. This feeling did dissipate after a few minutes, but something to be aware of it you have ultra sensitive skin. I have very sensitive skin, although I am use to using acids/retinol, so the sensation didn’t both me or cause any irritation. Again, I don’t use these kind of products nightly. I alternate days and just pay attention to the state of my skin. I should also mention I have normal-to-dry, acne prone skin (no issues with breakouts with this). My husband has a very normal skin type and he personally didn’t love the tingling sensation, however his skin isn’t super use to acids, like mine. And to be fair he stated at the time he felt like his skin was more dry than normal, which may have caused a more intense sensations.Overall I’ve been really enjoying this product and I’m excited to keep testing it. Also, I typically dislike fragrance, but this does have a slight lemon-y scent. nan
