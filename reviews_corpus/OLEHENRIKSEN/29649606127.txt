The essence is backed by a wonderful company you can count on for great products the vitamin c essence is part of my routine.  The texture is light and has a bit of fragrance but nothing that would bother anyone especially since I have sensitive skin and it made my skin soft and dry plump after using over time. Worth it ! Great product
