Makes skin feel soft, absorbs quickly and completely erases any dryness. Love that it has a more gel like consistency for application and doesn’t feel heavy even though it’s just as moisturizing as a heavier cream. I would give 5 stars if it weren’t for my oily skin, doesn’t help with oil control at all and leaves skin shiny by mid day, but perfect evening moisturizer for me and I’ll continue to purchase for extra dry days and nighttime use Lightweight and super moisturizing
