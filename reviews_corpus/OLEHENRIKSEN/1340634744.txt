I found this eye cream to be just okay. It was very nice feeling and quite thick, which I like in a eye cream because I have a tendency to have dry skin around my eyes. It also absorbed very quickly & left my eyes feeling quite moisturized right after using it, but otherwise that’s it. I didn’t feel like it brightened my eye area at all. No noticeable positive differences at all really. In reality I found that I would wake up with puffier eyes than normal after using this eye cream. I will likely not continue to use this in the future Moisturizing, but not amazing IMO
