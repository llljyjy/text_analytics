Ole Henriksenâ€™s new Banana Bright+ Vitamin C Eye Cream is a dream under makeup. It is amazingly hydrating and has no fragrance. It also helped with my concealer from creasing. I mostly use the eye cream during the day when I wear makeup because there is a slight pigment in the eye cream. Highly recommend! nan
