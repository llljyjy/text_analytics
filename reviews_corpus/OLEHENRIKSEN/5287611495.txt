I’m surprised how much I ended up liking this cream. I have really dry skin especially in the winter, so I’m always looking for a moisturizing night time routine. This has been a great addition. It’s hydrating, gentle, and the formula doesn’t feel heavy on the skin. My skin has been looking brighter, healthier, and glowy. At first I was hesitant about using AHA everyday but this is gentle enough and I haven’t had any issues lately. nan
