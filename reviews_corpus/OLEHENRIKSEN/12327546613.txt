This moisturizer starts out as a balm feel, which I love in the winter months with my drier skin. After you apply, it sinks into your skin and feels amazing, particularly under the eyes and on the lips. I usually use Kiehlâ€™s moisturizer, but after receiving this as a sample to try from Influenster, this is a product that I would introduce into my routine, especially in the winter months or if I am feeling particularly dry. Amazing for winter skin!
