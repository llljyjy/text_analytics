I bought this to see if I’d like it better than the OLEHENRIKSEN Pore-Balance™ Facial Sauna Scrub. Overall, this lemonade scrub is fine and does the job, but I would not buy it again. It smells like a lemon pie lol but it’s kind of overwhelming. The scrub beads are very small so they seem to get into my eyes and irritate them, and I have to rinse my face a lot to get all of the product off my face. I don’t have any of these issues with the other OLEHENRIKSEN scrub which is why I prefer that one. I prefer olehenriksen's other scrub
