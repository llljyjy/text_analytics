I love this cream. I have hereditary dark circles and usually don’t bother to try to brighten them. I’m so happy that I gave this a try because it really does make a noticeable difference. This cream is light in texture and color. It doesn’t leave a white cast or anything but has a “banana powder effect”. It’s not oily and it absorbs beautifully. I love the copper in it. I’ve dabbed it in problem areas on other parts of my face for faster healing. I’ve also incorporated an eye brightening serum to pair with this and the results are incredible. Great Results
