So I am someone with reactive and super dry skin. I am also a new mom, so I need an easy routine that brightens and awakens my sleepy sleepy skin.  Because I am sensitive, I replaced my Ole Truth Serum with this essence to start out. It simplifies my routine while still giving me the vit C benefits, PLUS the hydrating hyaluronic acid. I absolutely love the texture and how this sinks into my skin. It also has the amazing scent all the Ole Truth products do. My skin looks immediately more glowy and bouncy. It simplifies my AM skincare routine and is SO effective. I love how balanced, happy and bright my skin looks using this. The BEST
