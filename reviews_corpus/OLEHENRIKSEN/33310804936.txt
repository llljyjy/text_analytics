I was lucky enough to receive this free from influenster and ole henriksen! I have very oily skin, always have. This is the first thick, jam packed moisturizer that I didnt finish my day with an oily face! The next morning it wasn’t even oily. I even noticed it being softer after I washed my face. It works even after exfoliating. One of the ingredients that isn’t highlighted is niacinamide, which my skin seems to need and love! My face has been less red, less oily, firmer and 10x more moisturized since using. I’m in love. Don't sleep on this!
