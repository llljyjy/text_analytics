I received this Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence as a complimentary gift from Ole Henriksen. It comes with a glass package with a very rich orange smelling. I love it! I always use it as a morning serum since itâ€™s a vitamin C serum. You can find your skin is smoothing and Brighting after 2 weeks of using this. Pretty reasonable price for a serum. Would recommend it! nan
