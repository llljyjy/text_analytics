This is my first time trying out a product like this one. My first impression is that it comes beautifully packaged in this matte frosted orange glass bottle. I always prefer products that come in a glass bottle anyway.This essence also smells citrusy, refreshing and light. I apply to my face right after I cleanse and tone by patting a few drops into my skin. My skin looked much brighter when I started incorporating this essence into my routine and I could actually tell the difference. I highly recommend this for brightening up dull skin. nan
