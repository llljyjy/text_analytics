I was able to try the Banana Bright Eye Cream from OLEHENRIKSEN recently and am truly so impressed by it. I love the texture - it’s thick enough so it’s great for overnight and feels rich on your eyes, but doesn’t clog up your pores. I noticed quickly that the Vitamin-C formula was really high quality, and I woke up with a brighter and plumper / moisturized under eye area. Definitely helped with any dark circles and made the area smoother. I would definitely recommend this product and will purchase it in the future. Brightening and smoothing
