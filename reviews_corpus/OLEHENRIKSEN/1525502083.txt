I love this stuff! I couldn’t believe how thick it was. As with many high quality products, a little goes a long way which makes it such a good value. It has been wonderful for my Midwest winter thirsty skin. I haven’t been using long enough to attest to the texture or strength of my skin, but it’s an excellent moisturizer. I should also mention that I’m quite sensitive and this didn’t cause any irritation or burning sensation. Great moisturizer!
