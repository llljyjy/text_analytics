I received this item free from influencer in exchange for honest review. This product was great for moisturizing and kept my under eyes looking smooth. Itâ€™s really hard to say for crows feet or eye brightening, I really just feel like that takes more time, I did not notice any drastic changes in the 2 months I used it aside from the moisturizing effects. nan
