* I received this product for free from Influenster and Ole Henriksen in exchange for my honest review.So I have been using this eye cream daily since receiving it exactly 4 weeks ago.• While I don’t have dark circles under my eyes, I can still say that it definitely brightens my under eye area.• I do have fine lines around my eyes, but I don’t think I’ve had the chance to use it long enough to see any results in that aspect. (It claims to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.)• As far as improving concealer application, wear, and being crease resistant, I can say that it does work well enough for that purpose. Is it my favorite under eye moisturizer to use as a primer for concealer? No. But, it does work. It is hydrating and it does provide a smooth base. I don’t know that it extends the wear time as it claims, not to say that it doesn’t, I just didn’t notice any outstanding difference from other moisturizers I’ve used as a base. I haven’t noticed any creasing whatsoever when using it under my concealer, so that’s definitely a plus.Overall, it has a nice consistency, it absorbs well (without leaving any greasy residue), it does hydrate the skin, and it does have a significant brightening effect. I like that it’s a clean product. Also, in my opinion, it comes with a fair amount of product for the price, .5oz for $42.In the future, if I were in the market for a lightweight under eye moisturizer or a brightening under eye moisturizer, I would definitely consider purchasing this one. In that same respect, if someone else were looking for such a product, I would definitely recommend this to them. I like it enough that I plan to continue using it, and for me that’s saying a lot, because I’m pretty particular with my beauty and skincare product choices. I like it!
