It’s a light weight milky essence. It’s orange based so there’s a definite  orangey scent. It blends into skin quickly and leaves a smooth, lightly hydrated surface. Because of the scent and super light hydration,  I would use during warmer months and as a first step in my morning routine. But it’s great product with powerful ingredients and I will purchase it again. Keeper
