I really wanted this product to work.I liked that it’s clean formula, but it didn’t really do anything for me. I have dry skin and dark circles lately, so I thought it came in the right time. It didn’t make any difference at all and I was using it for a long time. Probably a month.I don’t think I like the thick formula, kind of never absorbs into the skin. I didn’t see a difference
