I have been sleeping on Ole Henriksen!! I believe this is the first product I’ve tried from this brand but after this Dewtopia, it absolutely will not be the last! From the first application I knew I was going to love this night cream. It literally melts into my skin like butter and no matter how dry my skin is, it’s immediately super plumed and incredibly hydrated. Waking up my face was still hydrated and my fine lines and even deep wrinkles which drive me nuts, I could hardly see. My face feels firmer after every single use and I can see dark spots starting to lighten noticeably. This includes ahas and Edelweiss Cell Cultures extract which I have never seen in skincare before but with this giving such amazing and super fast results, I HIGHLY recommend this and will be repurchasing myself before I run out! Love love love! New nighttime obsession!!!
