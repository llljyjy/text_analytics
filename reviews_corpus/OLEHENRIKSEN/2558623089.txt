Once again Ole Henriksen never disappoints!! I really loved this peptide boost moisturizer. My everyday moisturizer is more lightweight due to my combination skin but even though this is more of a thicker consistency it has worked beautifully for me! My skin definitely feels less stressed,more firm, && overall healthier! Itâ€™s also been the perfect boost of  hydration for this winter skin! nan
