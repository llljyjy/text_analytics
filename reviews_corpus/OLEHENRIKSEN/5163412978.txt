I picked this up after reading a bunch of excellent reviews on this product and it did not disappoint.  I use this after double cleansing (Sulwhasoo). Two drops of this in my hands covers my entire face and neck nicely ( It smells sooo nice like freshly peeled oranges), I follow it up with the YSL Hydra Bounce Essence and Aveeno Calm and Restore Cream. My skin looks so glowing and clear. My sister in law figured I was pregnant and was telling my In-laws that my skin was absolutely glowing and beautiful and that I must be pregnant again....I am not pregnant its just this AMAZING product! I have even started my husband on it. Everyone should try this product. All about the Glow
