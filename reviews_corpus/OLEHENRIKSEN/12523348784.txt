This did absolutely nothing for me. First it didn’t lather up very well and when washing this off it left a film on my skin and I didn’t feel clean at all. Plus the smell is very strong! I didn’t mind it but if you are sensitive to fragrance this is not for you. I got halfway through this and had to use a different cleanser and that’s when I realized how bad this was doing for my skin! NOPE
