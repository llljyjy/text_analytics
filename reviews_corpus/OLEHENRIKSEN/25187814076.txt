I love a good exfoliating overnight treatment and the Ole Henriksen’s NEW Dewtopia 5% Acid Firming Night Crème combines ingredients that reveal healthier skin and also claim to visibly minimize dark spots, fine lines, and wrinkles. Shea butter is very nourishing and helps replenish the skin’s moisture. I have combination skin and I didn’t notice any dryness or redness in the morning. I highly recommend using sunscreen during the day, especially if you go outside because exfoliating agents increase sun sensitivity and possible irritation. I would definitely purchase it again because it is perfect for aging and dull skin that I have. Glowing skin
