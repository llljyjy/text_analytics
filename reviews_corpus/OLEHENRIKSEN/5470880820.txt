So I liked the texture and hydration, but to be perfectly frank I didn’t notice a huge difference between this and any of my other night creams. I think it’s perfectly nice but I don’t think I was given enough time to see a tremendous difference. I will continue to use it and if it becomes a staple I will update my review. I would give it a 3/5. It’s fine didn’t change my life. Meh
