This eye cream is so moisturizing but without oil or greasy feeling, and has no scent. It is a small jar but I only need to touch my finger to it and have more than enough for my eye. I have had no problems with makeup running after using this. For my first eye cream I am super happy with this and am hoping it helps me prevent wrinkles as I turn 30 in six months. No scent and no makeup running
