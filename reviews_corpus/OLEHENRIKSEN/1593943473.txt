What’s not to like about this essence? First, the smell is an AMAZING orange slap in the face, in a good way. The essence applies smoothly and absorbs rapidly, leaving my skin feeling soft and supple. I have combination skin that can often be dry, but this product is surprisingly hydrating (I pair it with a hydrating toner and moisturizer, but notice a difference even before the moisturizer). I’ve been using this for a little over a week and my skin seems a little brighter and more even. A little goes a long way, so this bottle will last quite a while. Definitely a nice addition to your skincare routine if you suffer from dryness and/or dullness. Yummy scent and results
