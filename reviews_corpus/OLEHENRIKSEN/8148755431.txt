This has completely transformed my 36 yr old skin. I was starting to get a lot of fine lines, dryness, dullness, clogged pores, etc. Over the years I have used probably a thousand different products for my face and nothing seemed to work on my skin. I have rosacea. I use the vitamin C serum in the morning followed by la mer cream and then dewtopia at night followed by la mer cream. Iâ€™ve had zero pilling issues bc I press my cream into my face instead of rubbing it in. My skin finally looks and feels good. So thankful for this product! Favorite!
