After reading all the amazing reviews I had to give a try to this product. I am glad I did as it does wonders for my skin! I am still using once a week as I am new to skincare acids but I can see the difference. I am thinking to start using 2 to 3 times a week though as I have been using for about 6 weeks. It does have a strong lemon scent and I feel an initial tingle that quicks disappears. The next morning I can tell my skin is glowing! There is no residual heat left! Amazing! I would give a try but make sure you are applying your sunscreen daily and taking baby steps when using this amazing product!!!! Must have!
