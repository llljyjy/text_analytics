I’ve been wanting to try this product for a while now, so I was super excited to get sent this product to review! I have heard really great things about this eye cream, and couldn’t wait to start using. It is stated that it takes about 8 weeks to start seeing results , so this review is coming in a little premature, but I have been using jt religiously for the past 2 weeks and thought I’d give an update. Although I haven’t noticed much of a huge difference, I do feel like my under eyes look more “alive”. Since t his area is very sensitive (for me) I noticed it gave me small pimples the first time I started using it - but that doesn’t happen anymore. The texture is creamy, light, and blends into the skin well. It’s a little oily after but nothing too bad. I cant wait to continue to use this product and start seeing more results! Nice!
