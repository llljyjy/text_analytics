As a skin care junkie, I’ve been looking for a new moisturizer. I love something enriching for the night time, but also a good active ingredient – and I think I’ve found my match!I love the way it feels on my skin, the smell is subtle and not overbearing, and not only does it keep me hydrated but it’s helping to correct my dark spots with the power of the AHA.Definitely a new fav, and I would recommend it to people with my similar skin concerns! I am a believer!
