The whole benefit of this product is To leave your face brighter, glowing, hydrated, and create a protective barrier throughout the day. I have noticed some brightening from the use of this product on my face along with hydration. It has my face glowing on a daily from the vitamin C. I use this product in the morning & evening before bed. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends especially since it speaks to the concerns of my dark spots, uneven tone, lack of hydration at time, and my combination skin type. Glowing skin
