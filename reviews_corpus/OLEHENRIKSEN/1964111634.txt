I got a 7 day sample and from the first use I was happy with this product. I used it in the AM and PM. The texture is rich and thick so a little goes a long way. It left my skin dewy and soft. I noticed the change of my skin the next day. I had no problems with this product and will definitely buy the full size. Side note….please excuse the expression in my pic …I just woke up from a nap and couldn’t resist taking a “golden hour” selfie. Lol Absolutely amazing!
