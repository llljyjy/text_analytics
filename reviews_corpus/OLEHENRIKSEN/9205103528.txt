I feel overall medium about this product. I do think it’s hydrating, but I don’t think it necessarily promotes barrier repair. Some of the ingredients are a little sensitizing, so if you have sensitive or compromised skin, I wouldn’t recommend this. I think for folks who’s skin is in a good state, this would help with maintenance and upkeep, but I don’t think it would be good for people with compromised skin. I did experience redness with this product. Not for compromised skin
