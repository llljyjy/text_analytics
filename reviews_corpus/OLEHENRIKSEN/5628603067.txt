I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Ole Henriksen in exchange for my honest review. I have never used an eye cream before, but I could definitely tell a difference between this cream and my usual drug store moisturizers. It is a heavy yet creamy and smooth texture. It immediately brings a brightness to the under eye area. I like to tap it on instead of rubbing it, that seems to keep the bright and fresh look from the cream a little bit longer. I have definitely noticed less crowâ€™s feet or at least softer lines than before. This is a great eye cream and one I will continue to purchase in the future. Finally Found An Eye Cream!
