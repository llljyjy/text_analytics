This is one of my favorite products. I went right to bed with it, I didnâ€™t need an extra moisturizer on my face. The texture is so soft and light, but it does exactly what you want from a cream - plumps and smooths your skin overnight. I love that this has a nice smell as well. Great for dark spot!!
