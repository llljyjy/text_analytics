I got a mini of this scrub to test it out and I love ittttt. The lemony scent is delightful, and in spite of having somewhat sensitive skin I’ve actually had really good luck with this; it wasn’t at all irritating on my skin, unlike Moon Juice which stings for at least 10 minutes after application. nan
