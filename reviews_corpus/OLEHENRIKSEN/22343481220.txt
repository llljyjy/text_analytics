I dont usually leave reviews for products but this product deserves one! I used it and saw a difference after a few days of using. I had bumps and pimples on my chin from constantly wearing masks at work. After using this I noticed a difference on my chin a few days later. The bumps on my chin had disappeared and my skin felt softer. The only downside is your skin does get sensitive to the sun and so apply sunscreen more frequently. Other than that this product is a must try. Must try
