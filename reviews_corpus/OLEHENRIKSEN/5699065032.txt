I have sensory and extremely dry skin - I was very skeptical about this product and can honestly say I was surprised by how well it worked! I really like the dewy-ness of my face in the morning after using this. It didnâ€™t cause any dryness and no redness or sensitivity (I started by using once a week and worked up to once every other day). I really enjoy using this product. Surprised by how much I liked this product
