I received this product for free from Influenster andOLEHENRIKSEN in exchange for my honest review. I have normal to dry skin and sometimes my makeup can sink into the creases below my eye, but I really enjoyed how this thick buttery cream made my under eyes feel very moisturized and makeup sits on top of this nicely with no creasing. It really does brighten the skin instantly since it has a yellow tint. I appreciate that it has a clean formula and mild scent. Brightens & Hydrates
