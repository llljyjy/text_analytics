This was a game changer to add to my daily skincare routine. The vitamin C essence helped clear up and smooth over my wrinkles and fine lines. It did not increase any redness nor did it clog my pores. I enjoyed the lightness of the serum and fragrance was light and airy. I highly recommend. Love it!
