Okay,so I use this after showering every night . Tonight I used Paula’s choice BHA salicylic acid and let dry and then used this over and the skin under my eyes looks so refreshed! I have the worst bags and dark circles and this really brightened up my under eye skin. So far so good. A little goes.a long way and it’s really smooth and creamy. I would recommend! #influenster #olehenriksen Brightens up under eyes ,look refreshed!
