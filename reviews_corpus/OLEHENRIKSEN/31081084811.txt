What can I say…normally I don’t like the smell of orange in products because it reminds me of a rotten orange but this product is not bad, it has a very pleasant orange smell.  I don’t know what I can expect from this product or how it will improve my skin, but if you are someone who uses a lot of products on your face and you don’t like the smell, this can help eliminate that smell.
