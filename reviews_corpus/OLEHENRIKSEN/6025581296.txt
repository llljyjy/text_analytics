This product was sent to my by INFLUENSTER in exchange for my honest review. I cannot speak to long term results as I only got to use this for about three weeks before the review was due. It’s hydrating and I appreciate the pigments to combat under eye darkness as I do not like any kind of concealer or foundation. I will continue to use this for a few more weeks and reevaluate long term claims. This is a nice product but it didn’t knock my socks off the way other Ole products have. Appreciate the banana pigments
