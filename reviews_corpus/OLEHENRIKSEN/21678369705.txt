I like the texture, it’s a thick gel, that doesn’t feel heavy. It is great in winter for my oily skin. The ingredients list looks impressive, a whole bunch of Peptides and different types of Ceramides are high on the list. This moisturizer has a herbal scent, which I’m not a fan of, I prefer unscented skincare, but thankfully it doesn’t linger. Solid moisturizer
