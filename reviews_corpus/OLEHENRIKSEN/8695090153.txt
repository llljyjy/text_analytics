(gifted in exchange for honest review) I’ve been on a major skin recovery journey, & part of that is letting my night time skincare routine work hard & my day time skincare protect that hard work. This cream is a night time Bestie for sure! My skin immediately feels hydrated once I apply this & looks dewy! (Rightfully named). I love the gentle yet effective exfoliating factory of this cream because I’ve come to realize less is more sometimes! I’ve genuinely noticed more plump, bright & even toned skin since I started using this. Would absolutely buy again & gift to anyone in my world that wants a gentle exfoliating & brightening secret weapon! I Dew Love!
