I received this product as a complimentary gift so I understand most will be hesitant to believe my review. That being said, I am a licensed esthetician and cosmetologist. So here it goes. The packaging is nice and stabilized. Cream is pretty balmy and rich. I used it for about 2 weeks and I did not see any improvement but did looked and felt moisturized. I did not see any fine lines fade nor did I felt like my skin looks any different, I tried it on my neck instead since I’m starting to form what we call a “text neck”. I still didn’t see anything major but again. I did also start to develop a few minor rashes. I read the ingredients and found out that it has fragrance in it, but at the very bottom, so it wasn’t as active. I didn’t think I would react to it since it was small but with my luck, it did. So all it technically did was just moisturize me, which I did quite enjoy a little. It was just too moisturizing for me since I am very oily skinned. But I would not reach for it again. :/ I don’t want others to be discouraged with my review. This product did not work for me but might work for others. Maybe someone who is dry skinned and have a more mature skin. I most likely didn’t see a difference because I don’t really have any fine lines yet and pretty much already moisturized. All in all, my skin is very different and I personally did not enjoy this product as much as I was hoping for but this might work for others! I gave it a 3/5 cause it did really good to moisturize! But see if you can try before you buy! It’s ok
