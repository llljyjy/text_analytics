When opening the product I thought it will have a strong citrus scent but to me it was more on the lighter side/zest part of the orange. I am happy it was light because I have product that had grapefruit scent and it was too strong for me. The first time I used the product it did make my face tingle for 5 to 10 minutes  but it didn’t turn my face and then the next time it didn’t. The only down side of the product is, it sometimes is hard to get the product out of the container. Ps: you just have to hit the container a little hard on your palm to get the essence out. nan
