I was able to try Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence and I’m highly satisfied with my results. I’m new to this brand and to a product that you apply before other products.  I noticed my skin has a beautiful glow and hydrated. My skin tends to allow other skincare products to stick to the skin nicely.  I recommend shaking it very well to mix it up because it’s also more pleasant to smell.  I like this formula it’s definitely a must have to prep the skin. I’m in love with the binding moisture & strengthen skin’s barrier function.  I was gifted from OleHenriksen in exchange for my honest opinion. Amazing Preparation
