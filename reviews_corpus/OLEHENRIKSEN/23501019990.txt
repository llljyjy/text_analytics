This is an amazing moisturizer! There is a slight scent to it but it’s not too overwhelming. It is a thick consistency but it melts into the skin and it helps it stay hydrated. I’m 30 with sensitive and dry skin. I use this daily I’m happy to have added it to my skincare routine. Absolutely love it!
