This is the step I never knew I needed in my skincare routine, but with the positive results I’ve experienced, I’m never giving it up!  I love that this product allows me to get an extra dose of vitamin C in the morning to aid with brightening and hyperpigmentation.  This essence has a refreshing, natural orange scent and a milky consistency that is thicker than a toner yet thinner than a serum.  My dry skin often feels tight and stripped after cleansing, but using this essence immediately after renews the hydration levels so my face is nourished and plump.  Afterwards, my serums and moisturizer apply more smoothly and absorb more deeply. Replenishes hydration, amplifies serum absorption
