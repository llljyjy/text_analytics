I’ve had dull skin for the past few months and using AHA/BHA has made it sensitive. I was gifted this barrier booster with Vitamin C, which made me a bit cautious (will it sting? Will it make it more sensitive?) but thankfully, it did neither. Let me first tell you what this isn’t. It isn’t a clear liquid that burns, and it isn’t really a serum. It’s a soft milk that smells of oranges, and it sinks in like a dream, without any sticky residue. I’m in love with it. I know it will take a while to see results, but it does give me a little glow. I’ve been using it day and night, just a couple of drops pressed into the skin. It feels soothing. You’d never think that something with Vitamin C in the name would be soothing, but it is. I put on my regular moisturizer over it. Looking forward to using up the bottle and seeing my ’after’ photo. Lovely!
