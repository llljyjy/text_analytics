This was my first time trying a product by Ole Henrickson. I have a somewhat dull skintone and am always looking for anything that helps give me a brighter complexion. This also works well with my normal to oily skin type. I just apply this after cleansing and before moisturizer. I noticed an instant healthier glow to my face. The scent is so authentic and refreshing to me. Overall I am keeping this in my daily skincare routine! Brightening
