I love this new Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence that I was gifted in exchange for my honest review. This product is really great. It smells like fresh squeezed orange juice in the morning and it’s so lightweight and crazy refreshing and rejuvenating. I tend to use it more in the am, simply because of how well it wakes up me AND my skin by cleansing, hydrating, and brightening... basically leaving prepped, primed, and ready skin.  I was not shocked at all to see Hyaluronic Acid listed as an ingredient here because I’ve begun to see my skin does so well with it, so definite plus there. And as if Ole’s Orange Ferment Essence didn’t prove worthy as it is, then let me tell you that it also claims to be age defying. Now, unfortunately I haven’t been using it quite long enough to see such drastic results, but I will say when a product such as this has any anti aging benefits and makes my skin look and feel this way, I’m sold.... As if I wasn’t already. I'm sold!
