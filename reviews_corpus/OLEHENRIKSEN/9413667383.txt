I loved it at first but it made my foundation peel, I was so sad about it because this cream really helped me out with my dullness and acne scars. I realized that I was using an silicone base primer with this gel cream so I switched to an water base one…That was the solution. There’s no other problem just pure happiness I really love this moisturizer, so refreshing! nan
