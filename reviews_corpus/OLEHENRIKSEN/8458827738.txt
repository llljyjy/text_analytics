I’m dealing with the fallout of wearing a mask for 18 months (read: maskne, scarring). This product smells amazing and a little goes a long way. My skin feels nicely hydrated, but it brings all the discolouration in my skin out and makes it way more noticeable. It’s definitely not doing anything to fade them. meh
