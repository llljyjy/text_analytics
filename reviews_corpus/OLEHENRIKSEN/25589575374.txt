What a great product! I’ve never tried essence before and I’m pretty impressed! Instead of using a toner and a serum - I can just use one product and get all the benefits! This essence was very easy to use and I saw results even after the first use : my skin was glowing and looked so much more bright, even though I had a long night and looked puffy before applying it.Vitamin C does wonders on my dull acne prone skin and gives just a perfect amount of moisture and glow without leaving my skin greasy.I’ve been using this product everyday AM and PM and I’lol definitely repurchase after I run out (a little goes a long way, so the bottle will last me for months!) nan
