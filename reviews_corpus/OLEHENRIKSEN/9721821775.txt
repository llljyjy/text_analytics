I received this product to try for free. I have very dry, somewhat sensitive skin, but this product felt very refreshing and didn’t bother my skin at all! It has a strong fragrance but it smells very nice. It also makes my skin a little sticky right after I put it on, but I follow it with moisturizer so it’s not a problem for me! Feels and smells great!
