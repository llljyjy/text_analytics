I found this serum through an influencer, champagne and Chanel, about two years ago and have been hooked ever since. I use it once a day in the morning before my moisturizer (itâ€™s the first thing on my face) and it really seems to help my pores look smaller and dark spots fade quicker from acne. I use the eye cream as well in the morning, great for dark under eye circles. Highly recommend! nan
