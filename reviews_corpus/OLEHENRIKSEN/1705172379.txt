This is the only Olehenriksen product I use and it’s also the only mask I genuinely love. It’s such a treat. Usually doing a mask feels like a chore, but I actually look forward to this because it’s so easy to apply, wash off and it feels like a drink of peppermint tea for your pores. It doesn’t dry out my face, but I always use a moisturizing serum and then finish with squalane oil from the ordinary afterwards. Next morning my face feels like a house organized by Marie Condo—only bringing me joy. Brings joy!
