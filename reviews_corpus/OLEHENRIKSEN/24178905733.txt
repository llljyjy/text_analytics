I am adoring this cream! I usually layer products before bed that do a few different things but this is like like an all you need product. It exfoliates gently but also hydrates and works on hyperpigmentation at the same time. It has this super plush texture that smells delicious. I like how it gives me hydration on the spot and that it comes in a beautiful glass jar. Now I want to purchase the 20% serum to go with it. I have oily, mature skin that has recently been getting inflamed more than usual but this didn’t give me any breakouts or irritation. It actually feels very soothing. I’d happily repurchase this. I also recommend barrier booster ferment essence from OH as well. So lush!
