I received this product for free in exchange for my review. However I keep all my reviews very honest. I couldn’t love this product more if I tried! I’ve never found an eye cream I’ve loved but this one I do. I’ve been using this for about a week now and have noticed such a huge improvement. It is also super moisturizing and I love that it’s fragrance free! I’ve used a few eye creams throughout my life but this one is considerably better. I’ve always struggled with dry, dark under eyes and this has really, really helped. The product isn’t too thick so it’s easy to apply which I really appreciate when applying something around my eyes. Obsessed!
