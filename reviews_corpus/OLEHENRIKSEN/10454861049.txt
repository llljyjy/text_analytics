I had high hopes for this product as I loved the original. Those one is even better! It is smooth and super hydrating. The texture is a bouncy, gel-cream kind of feel. It brightens just enough to not look like a highlighter, and smooths the undereye area. Every skincare and makeup product I have used with it has worked very well. I am so excited to have the improved version back in my routine. Somehow better than the original
