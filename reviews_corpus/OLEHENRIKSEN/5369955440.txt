I received this complimentary from ole henriksen in exchange for my honest review.  I live in texas so it’s sunny most of the year which means I’m prone to post acne marks. I have been wanting to incorporate a vitamin c to my routine but they always made me feel greasy or was too heavy feeling. This vitamin c is great as it’s light and sinks into my skin. I also smells wonderful. nan
