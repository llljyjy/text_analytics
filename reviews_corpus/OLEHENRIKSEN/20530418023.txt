I was gifted this Ole Henrikson essence in exchange for my honest review. This was the first time I’ve tried an essence and I love the subtle blend between a toner and serum. It’s the perfect consistency for a dewy glow without it stopping my other skincare products from absorbing or my makeup setting properly. I also love how soft and smooth my skin feels just a week into using it! Skin is soft and smooth!
