I have sensitive and acne prone skin so have tried a handful of moisturizers. This one tops the list! It is thicker without a greasy feeling and fully gives my face the moisture it needs after dried out tired skin each day. I apply this in the morning too as a skin prep and it completely eliminates small break outs for me and my skin has looked healthier than it has in years!! Obsessed is an understatement
