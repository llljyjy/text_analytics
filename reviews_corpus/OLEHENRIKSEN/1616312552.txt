I received a trial size of this from Sephora as a sample in one of my orders (but recently have purchased a full jar for myself!), and used it every day for about a week. Wasn’t sure if it would do anything, as there isn’t too much research out there about what peptides actually do for your skin. I noticed that my usually combo/dry skin seemed more hydrated and plump after using this, even after 12 hours. Kind of wild. Seems like it’s a gel/lotion mix, doesn’t pill, and no acne breakouts. I’ve also noticed that my little wrinkle between my brows almost disappears when I use this. I don’t think it’s just because of a humectant ingredient like hyaluronic acid that’s causing it, BC I’ve used that before without getting these results. I also put this under my eyes. Recommend for dry/combo skin, acne prone skin. Very hydrating, plumping & promising!
