I’m pretty strict about only using drugstore-priced moisturizers and spending more on serums and acids, but this moisturizer has completely changed my mind. The texture is just absolutely incredible. From getting it out of the jar to applying it, it just feels like such a unique texture. “Balm-to-gel” sounds about right but it’s not like a firm balm or anything. Just like the perfect mix between regular cream and gel. It does have a light scent, kind of citrusy, which is very nice too. This is one moisturizer where I can actually tell that I applied it at night and woke up with it still on my skin – it definitely doesn’t just rub off on your pillowcase. Maybe it’s the mango seed butter or something but when I wash my face in the morning I can actually feel it still there. My skin is normal to dry and this has certainly helped my skin through winter so far. I went on a trip to a super dry climate and didn’t bring this along since packing a glass jar is a bit of a pain and my skin sure paid the price (though quickly recovered on my return to this product). Not sure I’ve ever raved about a moisturizer more…… but this is so unique. The only moisturizer that has come close to impressing me this much is belif Moisture Bomb, and they do actually smell similar, but this one takes the cake. I received this product free from Influenster but all opinions are my own Outstanding
