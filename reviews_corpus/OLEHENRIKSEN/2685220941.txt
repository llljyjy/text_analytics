The first thing I noticed about this product is the packaging. The glass bottle is great and I appreciate them not using plastic. Second it smells amazing. It was a great wake up for my senses and my skin. It absorbs well and isnâ€™t greasy or oily. Made my skin feel hydrated and soft. Wakes up your senses and skin
