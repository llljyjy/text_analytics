I have super dry skin, that is showing early signs of age. I absolutely love essences , they hidrate the skin in a way that least it supple, more elastic and bouncy! This one by Ole is no different and it leaves my skin radiant due to the vitamin C , fermented ingredients are simply fantastic for skin barrier! I am in LOVE . Who needs an instragram filter when you can be this moisturized in real life ? Amazing Product
