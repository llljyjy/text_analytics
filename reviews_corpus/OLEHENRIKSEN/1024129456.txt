I didn’t expect this balm-like texture that melts into the skin - think solid coconut oil - it’s glorious! Thick and nourishing, a small amount goes a long way and my skin is instantly moisturizer glowy and bouncy. I got this as a free product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’m so happy to have this in my skincare routine! Fabulous
