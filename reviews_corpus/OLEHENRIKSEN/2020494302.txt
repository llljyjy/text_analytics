I really like how moisturizing this is. It doesn’t have a scent to it, which I also like. I don’t know that it’s actually making my under eye any less puffy or brighter but I do like the product so far. I’ve been using it for about a week at this point. I received this product for free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. Great moisturizer
