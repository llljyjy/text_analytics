I’ve always loved any peptide and ceramide type moisturizers as I find them to be more hydrating and repairing for the skin. This product lives up to the name and definitely is a strong hydrating product. The consistency is a little thick so a little goes a long way, but it melts into your face and doesn’t feel like it’s just sitting on top. It does provide a glow to the skin but you don’t feel or look oily. I don’t notice any firmness to the skin but it’s probably because I would need to use it for a longer period of time. There is a slight fragrance but it goes away quickly. nan
