This is my first time trying this brand and I really like this essence. Vitamin C is almost always a part of my daily skincare routine. It makes my skin feel hydrated and refreshed. Love the texture and the smell. Works great with the other products in my routine. Definitely need to try more from this range. Love this essence!
