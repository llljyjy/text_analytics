I love this stuff! I received a free sample a while back and I liked it so much it’s my go-to now. I use it three times a week and I’ve had no issues with irritation. It has almost completely cleared up my acne (I rarely get anything more than hormonal break outs during my period now) and it leaves my skin so soft, smooth, and bright. Really good for removing dead skin and grime. I wish I could use it every day! The Best
