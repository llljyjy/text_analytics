I have sensitive skin that tends to not like cream moisturizers therefore I like finding gel based products instead. My skin is extra dry and dull in the winter and I have found this product to be hydrating and brightening. I like the sleek packaging and how it applies. It absorbs into the skin easily and can be applied at night or day if feeling extra dry without issue. A Part of My Winter PM Routine
