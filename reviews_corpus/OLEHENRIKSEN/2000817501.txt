Now that I’m postpartum it’s been difficult to take care of my skin the way I normally do. I have uneven tone and texture all throughout. My skin lacks radiance and looks overalls dry. I tried this at night along with the rest of my skin care routine and I was hooked! It does not burn or leave any sticky residue behind. The next morning my skin looked healthy which is my number one goal and hope with this product! I love the clean ingredients that allow my skin to get the proper nourishment it needs! I can’t wait to see how my skin progresses. A must!
