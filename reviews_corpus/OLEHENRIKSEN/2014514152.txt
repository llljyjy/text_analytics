I actually like this eye cream a lot more than I thought I would. I have very sensitive, dehydrated skin. The texture is thick and rich, and moisturizes well without being too heavy for me. It did not sting my skin, which is a problem I run into frequently. It has a slight orange tint, which does give an instant brightening effect on top of the dewy finish. It wears beautifully under makeup. It does not come with a spatula, but I would recommend using one (I used one that came with another product of mine). I did take off a star because I don’t think eye cream is 100% necessary and the price is rather high for something that I don’t think has any significant long-term benefits compared to a cheaper/standard moisturizing eye product. That said, a little bit goes a long way so think this little jar will last quite a long time for the price. If you’re in the market specifically for an eye cream, I do recommend this. Even though it’s a bit of a luxury item, I will likely still purchase it with my own money just because the formula is lovely and I enjoy using it. Do keep in mind that vitamin c isn’t very shelf-stable, so even if the jar lasts a long time, the vitamin c in it won’t. nan
