The frosted glass bottle and thick white cap are heavy and excellent quality. There’s a very generous amount of essence since a little goes a long way. I only need to use a few drops.If you’re familiar with Ole Henriksen’s Truth (Vitamin C) collection, it smells like the rest of the products but the orange scent is slightly stronger. The fragrance dissipates after absorption.I use the essence after washing my face in the morning and evening, wait for it to dry, and before applying serums.  I shake 3-4 drops into my hand and pat-press the essence into my skin. It absorbs well without a sticky residue.Then, I continue with the rest of my Ole Henriksen Truth products (BB Vit C serum and moisturizer). My skin feels so hydrated, plump and soft. My skin is noticebly radiant much longer and faster after just twelve days/nights of use based on the before and after photos I took. For reference, my skin is combination-slightly dry, no acne, and hyperpigmented. Boosts the current collection very effectively!
