love love love this serum — i still use it a couple of times a week even though the rest of my skin care routine products are from another brand. this serum give such a nice brightening effect to your skin. and it smells like oranges! love to use this first thing in the AM, or when prepping for an event where i need to ‘look alive’!definitely recommend! goodmorning!
