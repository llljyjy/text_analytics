I really love this orange essence from OLEHENRIKSEN! The ingredients are very good for skin: fermented orange peel extract, orange stem cells, and vitamin C. Lately my skin has been dry and dull, but using this essence after my cleanser immediately hydrates it and gives me a glow. It works great along with any skincare routine and I would definitely purchase it again! nan
