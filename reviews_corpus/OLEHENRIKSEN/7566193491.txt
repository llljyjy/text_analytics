Before using this product, I had no skincare routine. I’m 24 years old. My acne was worse than it’s ever been, and I have combination skin, so I thought maybe I should try out a whole routine. I bought there whole skincare set and ever since, my entire face is FULL of acne now. Like in places I’ve never had it before. And I know that when you go from nothing to full skincare it can cause flare ups and that is why I gave this a chance. I’ve been using this for 3 months, and I could cry. My skin is ruined and now I don’t know what to do. Any tips? Maybe if acne has never been your concern
