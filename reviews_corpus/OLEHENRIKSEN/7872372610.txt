This scrub smells nice, but it hurts my skin even when applying no pressure to the face to use it. It did make my skin baby butt smooth, but I’m not sure that I can handle the feeling every time, even if it’s just once a week…. It feels like little stabbing needles. I just used it for the first time today and I didn’t break out from it and hopefully will not. I will keep using it to see if I get use to the texture. A little bit of ,”ouch!”
