I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review and I couldn’t have been more excited. I adore Ole’s products and have since being introduced to skincare; this moisturizer is no exception. It’s rich, yet light enough to wear both daytime AND nighttime (although I do work this into my nightly skincare diet of serums and oils). I will absolutely be purchasing this again. A must
