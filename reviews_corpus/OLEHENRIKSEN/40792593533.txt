I received this product from Influenster as a free promotion to try in exchange for my honest opinion. I was nervous before using it because I read a lot of reviews stating that they had skin problems after using it even if they didn’t have sensitive skin. However in my experience after using it I saw a great improvement in my skins moisture around the eyes and T-zone. The banana powder really helps even out my skin tone to allow even coverage with my concealer and foundation. I have combination skin with cool undertones. I found myself rubbing the lotion further and further around my eyes and into my cheeks and forehead. I’m by impressed by how quickly it absorbs as well. Quickly Becoming a New Staple!
