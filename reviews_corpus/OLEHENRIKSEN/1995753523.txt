Pro’s: It doesn’t pill. I noticed some people commented about the orange fragrence, it goes right away once you apply the serum. I have’t tried layering this under face moisturizer yet, but given that it doesn’t pill, I’m betting it will be fine. Con’s: I don’t notice any specific brightening. My skin is really nice at baseline, so perhaps there isn’t that major difference for me specifically. I just find with a vitiamin C, you expect that extra brightening factor from a product who’s main ingredient is vitamin C. I’d say, given that its so far, so good....its likely worth the shot. So far so good
