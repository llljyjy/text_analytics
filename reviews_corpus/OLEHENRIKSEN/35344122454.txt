I am very happy I found this product. It has made the skin around my eyes much more hydrated. I did not expect to see any dark circle results, because I have very sensitive  skin and nothing really works on dark circles for me. I am slightly seeing a brightening of the dark circles over time without makeup. And for a daily morning use, with its color, it also brightens up your eyes right away. If you may think that the price point is high for just the oz that it contains, I can tell you that a little goes a long way. I was seriously impressed Truly a bang for the buck!!
