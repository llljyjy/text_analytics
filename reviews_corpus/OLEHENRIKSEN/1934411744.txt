So far I am really liking this product (after 2 weeks of use).  It is hydrating enough during the colder months for my dry skin, and the acid within does not cause any adverse reactions to my sensitive skin.  Overall, I wake up with my skin looking smoother/plump, and refreshed.  This was gifted to me by Ole Henriksen. So far so good
