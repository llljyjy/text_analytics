Honestly this is my new favorite. It thick and creamy while feeling weightless on your skin. I immediately noticed a softness to my skin that I desperately need at 32. When they say it’s great under makeup, they aren’t lying! Seriously it was like using a multipurpose primer!! The smell is great too!! Don’t sleep on this Banana bright eye cream My new favorite and a must have!
