The OLEHENRIKSEN The Truth Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Vitamin C Essence works really well for my combination skin. I like to put a few drops in my hands and press the Essence into my skin, the scent is a light citrus scent that disappears once absorbed. My skin usually doesnâ€™t like Vitmain C products but this one has worked really well for me with no irritation or breakouts. My skin feels hydrated and I notice my skin looks brighter and hyperpigmentation is lighter. My skin loves the Barrier Booster! Hydrating & Brighter!
