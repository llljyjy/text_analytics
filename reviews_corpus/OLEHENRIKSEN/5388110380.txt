I love the lightweight spreadable texture, I have dehydrated skin in the wintertime from the gas heaters cranked on high all season so Iâ€™m always looking for products to effectively hydrate my skin- this vitamin C does a great job at it. It also makes a great source of vitamin c for the am routine to pair with your spf. nan
