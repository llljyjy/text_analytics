I brought this and used it for the first time on a weekend trip to Vegas and it definitely helped my undereye bags! Plus in the dry desert hear my skin Instantly was dehydrated but my undereyes were nice and plump! I don’t feel like I have used it long enough to give it the full 5 stars but so far I am very much enjoying it! I don’t wear makeup either (I just have eyelash extensions) and don’t feel the need for concealer the follow day after applying this. Sidenote - if you have sensitive skin this is a great option as it is scentless and never caused me any irritation! Survived Vegas!
