The Good: I have no idea how I initially got my hands on this product because our love story has lasted so long. This stuff is seriously a great toner, but it’s intense. Depending on your levels and severity of acne also is dependent on how often you’re going to want to use this. Personally, I use this stuff at least 3-4x a week and also as a “toner spot treatment“ in problem areas that appear on my face. You can genuinely feel this stuff working and the best way I can describe it is that it feels truly “medicinal“ almost. When I use a cotton ball and press this against a cluster of acne after a few seconds and the following minutes it’s almost as if I can feel this toner penetrating my pore/zit and actively “fighting“ the bacteria within the pore. It sounds weird, but if you use this product you know exactly what I’m talking about. The feeling to me is not painful although this product is intense and may be for some people. I personally find it refreshing on some level and enjoy the feeling of the product actively working. The only time this has “burned“ or hurt my skin is when I have a zit I may have tried to pop or some sort of scratch on my face. I also see really good results when using this, it certainly helps with inflammation and can really calm down the redness and trajectory of a zit. I am currently on my 7th or 8th bottle of this stuff (seriously, thats impressive) and I will continue to repurchase it. The Bad: As previously mentioned, this product can be very intense and some people may not find it as refreshing as I do.The Ugly/Honest: I know many people want to use tons of product of their face but this is a acid based, AHA product and should NOT be used with many other common skincare components such as Vit C or retinols. Double check your ingredients and try to use less intensive products in conjunction with this toner. I’m positive adverse reactions are linked to this mix/match cocktail.
