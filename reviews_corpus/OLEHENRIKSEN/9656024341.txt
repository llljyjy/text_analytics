I have an oily skin but despite that it looks sometimes dull and tired, I was reading about the effects of vitamin C to skin. So I was amazed to have to try Ole Henriksen orange essence, the clean and interesting ingredients made more willing to try. It is easy to apply as I cleanse my face I would put some and tap it on my face, it changed my routine I dont need much stuff as it leaves my skin dewy, fresh and healthy.It smells amazing and the packaging is cool, the orange peel has great benefits.I would share the results with my friends and family and itâ€™s a must have now A good add to my routine
