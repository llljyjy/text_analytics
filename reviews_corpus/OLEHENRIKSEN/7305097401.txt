I receive this product for free from Influenster and Sephora in exchange for my honest review.A very lovely eye cream. I have dark circles and my under eye area gets very dry, and this cream has helped improve my under eye area a lot. The texture is a happy middle between thick and thin, which makes it pleasant to apply. Overall for the price, Iâ€™d say this is a must have product for anyone looking for a good and nourishing eye cream. Lovely eye cream
