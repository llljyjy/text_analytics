This was my first opportunity to try a product from this line, so I can’t compare the old formulation. I have dark circles and deep set eyes, so I’m always looking to brighten things up there. I have combination skin and my eye area can get oily, so any eye creams need to be moisturizing but not heavy.There are a few  things I liked about this moisturizer. It’s a light beige-yellow from ingredients like the gold and is designed to be more of a “clean“ product. I like that it’s fragrance-free and more natural. You only need a bit, so a little goes a long way, so the price includes a lot of applications. It is very hydrating even with just a light application. Things do look a bit brighter post-application (and it’s good morning or night, depending when you need it). There is mica in it, so that may be principal or at least aids in the effect. I don’t have anything I disliked in particular. I think it’s a solid moisturizer, very hydrating, does offer a little brightness. My concealer is still my best friend for my undereye, but things are hydrated and the cream isn’t too rich for my combination-oily skin. Solid moisturizer, not too heavy
