I received this moisturizer in the mail from Influenster and could NOT wait to try it out. Right now it’s winter weather and this stuff has been a god send. It’s balmy texture slowly soaks in and really stays with you for a while, which feels great when dealing with cold windy weather. Overall it’s a great product. Perfect winter moisturizer.
