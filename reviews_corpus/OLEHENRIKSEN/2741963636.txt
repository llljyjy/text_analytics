I received this product for free to try and i was very excited about it! As an esthetician whos worked in med spas and dermatology offices, I’m very snobby about what i put on my face. I do love olehenriksens vitamin c eye cream so i did have high hopes for this product, and was not disappointed! This moisturizer has a great, light smell that’s super refreshing, has a creme gel feel and melts on the skin! What i love most? A little goes a long way and you’re face feels so hydrated and smooth! I’ve noticed improved fitness in my skin and i love it! I look forward to purchasing it myself soon Amazing moisturizer
