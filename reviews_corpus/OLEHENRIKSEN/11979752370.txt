I received this complimentary from Ole Henriksen.  This is very luxurious product.  I use it in the day time in-between my skincare routine.  It helps awake my skin and feel refresh.  It gives a boost to the skin. I have combination skin and it helped my skin when its dry .using it my skin feels more fresh and hydrated.  Love the smell citrus smell and its like a milky texture.  So overall I really like it nan
