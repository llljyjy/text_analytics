I like the glow that the cream gives me however...not good for morning routine when you planning on wearing make up. It is piling soo bad. I thought it might be my fault but I used it many times and tested with different creams and itâ€™s only with this one. It feels nice on the skin but makeup no make up it will still pill unfortunately. It is pilling very bad
