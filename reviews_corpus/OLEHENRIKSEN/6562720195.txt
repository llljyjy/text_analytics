This Ole Henriksen vitamin c essence has a nice milky consistency and is hydrating to my combo skin. It smells nice but I am personally not a fan of fragrance in my skincare, especially in products you leave on your face. I still like this product because of the hydration and brightening effect it gives my skin, I just wish they would make it fragrance free. Brightening Hydration
