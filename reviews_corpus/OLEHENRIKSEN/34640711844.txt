I didn’t see anything significant, I’ve been suing is nightly for a few months now (about 4) and it doesn’t do anything, it leaves my face shiny. Not a good shiny. My face just looks as if I haven’t showered in days and oily. That’s why I use it at night so no one sees me with a ugly shiny face. Slightly sticky even after dry. Move onto something else this ain’t it. it did literally nothing
