I did receive this product free in exchange for an honest review. To start off with, this is my first ole Henriksen product and I have to say that I am quite pleased. I would even use this product in the future. I really like how a little goes a long way and I really like how it smells. Itâ€™s not overpowering. However, I am not sure how it would react to those who are sensitive to fragrances. I would also point out that because it is rich that it may not be suitable for those with oily skin. pleased so far!
