It’s one of those moisturizers you can’t help but reach for! It has a slight lemon, citrus scent to it but definitely not overwhelming. It’s a thicker cream but it melts into this perfect consistency into your skin. Love that it has peptides, ceramides, and vegan collagen. Seems like the perfect moisturizer for someone who is trying to improve their skin barrier! Rich cream, but melts perfectly into skin!
