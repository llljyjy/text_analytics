For reference, I am in my mid 40s, have normal to combination skin in summer (normal to dry in winter), fine lines, wrinkles, enlarged pores, loss of firmness and hyperpigmentation (yes, I have it all!) PROS:- Great ingredient list: it is packed with amazing ingredients like peptides, ceramides, amino acids, collagen and hyaluronic acid.- It has a very thick consistency, which I prefer, but, surprisingly, it melts into the skin getting absorbed immediately and not leaving a greasy feeling. It is a gel/cream hybrid.- It plumps my skin and it looks fresh and rested.- It works perfectly with my other skincare regime and under my makeup.- I find it reasonably priced for the quality of the ingredients and how it works for my skin.- Clean at SephoraCONS:- It comes in a glass package which I like, but it is quite heavy so not very travel friendly.I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador Anti-aging powerhouse!
