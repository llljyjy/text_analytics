While we’re all learning that most people can tolerate oil in products just fine, I am sadly not one of those people, and finding a hydrating moisturizer without oil is getting harder and harder these days. However, I have been using this for two years and can tell you it’s one of the most effective, hydrating, LUSCIOUS oil-free moisturizers I have ever used! It feels gorgeous and non-irritating on my skin, and I love the glowy antioxidant boost of vitamin C (plus, I love killing two birds with one stone in the morning as my pocketbook is frankly over me buying separate--and expensive--vitamin C serums). I have combination skin, and find that this treats my dry skin incredibly well while also never feeling sticky or greasy, and without making me feel oily. I also love the soft orange creamsicle fragrance, and personally find this plays really well under a wide variety of makeup and sunscreen.You can pry this baby out of my cold, dead hands as I will never be without it! Oil Free Dream Come True!
