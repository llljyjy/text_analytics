As a chronically tired mom of 2 small kids, I was really excited to try this eye cream. For the last 4 years, I’ve developed rather prominent dark circles and have tried many eye creams trying to address the issue. The product itself has a pleasant texture, it’s thick but applies smoothly and isn’t sticky or tacky. It has zero scent, eye creams don’t need a scent imo so this is a good thing. I don’t wear makeup in the summer and so far, my under eye area is actually getting brighter, slow but surely! Banana Bright Eye Cream
