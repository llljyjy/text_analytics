Actually amazing. I have used it night with moisturizer or by it’s self. Always a noticeable difference. I wish it wasn’t so expensive because it’s a dream. A little goes a long way because it does seam to melt a little when you take it out. I live in an area with 1% humidity and when I wear this at night I wake up with hydrated skin. actually amazing
