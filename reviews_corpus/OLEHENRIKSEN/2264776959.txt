I don’t like to try too many product because I am someone who suffered with lots of breakouts in the past. There are so many different products on the market and many people use skin care products not knowing what it’s for, how to use, what it should and shouldn’t be combining together all while destroying their skin barrier. I am not one to put anything on my skin but I love a good moisturizer. This was my first time using this moisturizer and I was impressed. It’s very light weight and super moisturizing. It has great nourish ingredients. I may have to swap my current moisturizer to this!! Light weight & very moisturizing
