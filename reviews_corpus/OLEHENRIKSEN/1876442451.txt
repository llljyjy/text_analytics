I just ordered it but I used my sisters for a couple days while I was visiting her lol. I used the gel cream and eye cream that goes with it and my skin LOVED all of it. It brightened my skin more than any other Vitamin C product I’ve used, so much that I didn’t feel like I needed to put on foundation. It improved my texture and pore size as well. It does everything I need it to do. The only down side to this serum is that it pills a lot, so I’ll only use this on days when I don’t want to wear makeup. BUT it does it’s job well!
