Iâ€™ve been struggle with having my face skin tone much darker than the rest of my neck and body. So I decided to try out this serum to improve me skin tone as vitamin C is known for skin brightening. I have been using this consistently for the last 2 weeks and I love it feels on my face. The texture is not too thick and absorb quite quickly to my skin unlike other essence. I really recommend!! Highly recommend
