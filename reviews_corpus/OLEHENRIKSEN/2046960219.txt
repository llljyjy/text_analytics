I have dry skin-there is no oil production, ever- and I made two purchases and selected this as my sample. I really like the thick texture and that it has no silicones (I know these are not *bad* but I need a moisturizer that will sink in and truly moisturizer and hydrate my skin). I donâ€™t have issues with fragrance but after using fragrance free products for a while now, it did take some getting used to. I used this in the morning and after the 6 or 7 day I noticed that it was not hydrating enough. My skin needed some extra moisturizer. I took a break and went back to it and it happened again. I think with my super dry skin and the dry cold weather, this might not be the ideal moisturizer for this time of year. I really love it, and would consider purchasing it for late winter/early spring and autumn when I need a thicker moisturizer but not on the heavy duty side. This sits really well under makeup and when worn alone gives my skin a great dewy glow (almost as if my skin produced oil-in a good way!-)! Mixed Feelings-Overall Good
