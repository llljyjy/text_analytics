I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I used this product for about a week straight and saw no difference in the coloration under my eyes. I will say this cream was a good moisturizer but the name literally says eye brightening cream and I never saw that happen. I know that it’s not a magic cure all but I expected to see a slight change and was disappointed to see none at all. I feel this product should just advertise as a moisturizer and call it a day! A good moisturizer but that’s about it
