A burst of citrusy freshness every morning. Before I even get into the benefits of this essence, let’s talk about the scent. I legit get excited when I open this bottle, ready for the burst of energy from the scent alone - like a freshly squeezed cup of orange juice in the morning. OleHenriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence has been the addition to my morning skincare routine I didn’t even know I needed. This essence feels cool on the skin. I love how it made the rest of my serums apply on my skin. I was already using a Vitamin C serum to help brighten my complexion; using this essence prior made the application even more flawless. I am anxious to see how my skin will approve over the next few weeks of use. I really love this Essence. Citrusy Freshness
