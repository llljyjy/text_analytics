This product is really interesting! I’ve never used a barrier boosting essence before. Pros: smells absolutely devine, leaves skins feeling extra soft and smooth, soaks into skin quickly. Cons: because this essence has vitamin c and hyaluronic acid I’m having to figure out how to incorporate it into my routine since I already use a moisturizer with c and I don’t want to over do it, this isn’t a big deal but because I’m going to have do a bit of digging and research to make sure it doesn’t react negatively with the rest of my regimen I’m docking a star.  I received the product complimentary from Ole Henriksen in exchange for my honest opinion. Smells so good you'll want to drink it!
