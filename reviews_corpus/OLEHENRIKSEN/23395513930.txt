I recently started using this night time firming cream and have been so happy with my results. This creme is everything it promises and so much more. It has a thick, nongreasy texture and a little goes a long way. Itâ€™s very rich and hydrating.  My dry winter skin loves it and soaks it right in. My skin is looking so bright, hydrated, and firmer overall. Complimentary from Ole Henriksen Totally obsessed!
