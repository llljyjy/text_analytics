Iâ€™ve been using this moisturizer for about a month now and I love it. I have dry combination sensitive skin & it made me skin look healthy and smooth. It did not irritate my skin at all. It is thick so a little goes a long way. The packaging is glass and I love the purple. I apply a nickel sized amount on my face and it just melts on my skin. I definitely recommend & I will purchase this moisturizer again. Great Moisturizer
