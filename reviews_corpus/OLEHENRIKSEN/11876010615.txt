This product is lightweight, vegan, and unscented. I do find this eye cream to be hydrating which is nice. I started using this product on 7/22/22 and over a month later I don’t really see any changes. I do think it helps brighten up the under eye a bit. But to be fair I don’t really have wrinkles yet so maybe I’m looking for something that isn’t there. I do think it takes a few months for skin products to really show results so I will continue using. No complaints. Even after a month of use there is still a ton of product left. I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. nan
