I received this complimentary from Ole Henriksen in exchange for my honest review. First off let me say I freaking love this!!! Vitamin c of course is a staple in my routine so I was so excited to get to try this. The consistency is like a milky toner but my gosh does it sink into your skin. It also smells so good like citrus of course. It was also so hydrating that I feel like my normal oils have not come through as much as they regularly do. This is now a staple in my routine and will be a repurchase! nan
