I liked it the first couple weeks but started noticing such a funky smell. I’d compare it to my husband’s fish tank. It’s so off putting that I try hold my breath when I put it on. I feel obligated to keep using it because the price isn’t something I could just put aside. Can’t say there’s much of a difference with my oiliness so I often use it at night. Tried it because of the high reviews but will not purchase again. disappointed
