This essence has a milky consistency that feels lightweight, absorbs quickly, layers well, and adds a boost of hydration. For those who are sensitive to fragrances in their skincare, this has a noticeable scent from the orange oils and extracts. I personally don’t mind, as it doesn’t cause my skin any irritation and the refreshing citrus scent perks me right up in the morning. I still need to finish up this bottle to see how well it tackles my hyperpigmentation, but for now, I enjoy this hydrating essence that leaves me with an overall brighter complexion. Smells like heaven!
