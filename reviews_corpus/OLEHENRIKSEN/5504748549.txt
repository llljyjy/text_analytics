I have been using this for about a month now and have seen a great improvement to the texture of my skin. It has also helped minimize the acne I have and reduced redness and inflammation on my face. For reference, I have oily, sensitive skin, and struggle with hormonal acne and this product has worked wonders! Will definitely continue to purchase and keep as part of my night care routine. nan
