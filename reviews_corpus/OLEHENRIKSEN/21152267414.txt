This product feels like a shift from the typical Ole Henriksen products. It gives a much more luxury feel and the packaging is by far one of my favorites. Iâ€™ve been recently looking into more products to address uneven skin tone and dark spots, which this essence fits into perfectly with the addition of Vitamin C. I love the milky consistency and that it is a little thicker than the typical essence. My skins feels instantly bouncier and the orange smell is very refreshing. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend with similar skin concerns in hopes of brightening their skin! Great addition!
