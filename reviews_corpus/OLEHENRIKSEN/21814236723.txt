Gifted by Ole Henriksen. I love the texture of this night moisturizer. It’s so hydrating and sinks right into the skin. I notice my skin looking smoother and glossier the morning after I use it. It does contain lots of essential oils so I’m not sure I’ll use it consistently in my routine because I’m more on the sensitive side. nan
