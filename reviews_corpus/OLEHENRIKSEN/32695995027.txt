I love this night cream! It sinks in nicely and leaves the skin plump and hydrated. There’s a nice, natural scent to it, which I find soothing. I have noticed that my texture is less defined after a week of using each night. It’s also helped a little bit with redness. With it being wintertime, my skin has been especially dry recently, and this has helped immensely with that issue as well. I would highly recommend this night cream to anyone who has dry, dehydrated skin, texture issues, redness, or fine lines. Such a great night cream!
