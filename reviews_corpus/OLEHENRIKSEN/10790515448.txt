I really liked this moisturizer a lot! It’s great for winter time! It sinks in well and does not have a nasty finish. Doesn’t clog my pores. Can wear it under makeup. I love putting this stuff on at night also. The smell is nice and subtle - not overbearing. My husband uses this moisturizer as well and he has very dry skin in the winter - bad! He enjoys it. OLE did great with this product imo. Enjoy it
