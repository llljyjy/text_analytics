I am OBSESSED with Ole Henriksens vitamin c products and this didnâ€™t disappoint either! The packaging is luxurious and dispenses the product well. It smells delicious and has a lightweight texture that absorbs beautifully into my skin. I have combo skin and It gives it the perfect boost of hydration and leaves it glowing and with a youthful bounce. I am so happy to have this in my routine and will continue to keep it stocked and Ill recommend it to all my friends! Glowing and hydrated
