I received this Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence complimentary from Ole Henriksen, and I’m giving my honest opinion. It comes with a beautiful frost finish glass bottle, which is heavy and sturdy. It’s lightweight and got absorbed into the skin fast.  I love its orange scent, smells fresh and pleasant. nan
