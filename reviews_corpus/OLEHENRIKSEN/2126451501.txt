I received this product from Influenster for testing purposes. The cream comes in a nice purple jar. The cream smells really good. My only complaint is that it’s super thick. It was hard for me to scrape it out the jar but once I got a piece and put it on my face it spread easily. It doesn’t feel oily and it dries pretty quick. My face feels more moisturized. Thick but smells great
