I have used points to buy the mini size twice and finally pulled the trigger on the full size. I adore this scrub! It reminds me of the lemon peel from the facial kits that OH used to sell. I would recommend rubbing it into your skin very gently and then letting it sit for at least 3 minutes before rinsing. But if you have sensitive skin or are not used to acidic products, you should rinse it immediately. nan
