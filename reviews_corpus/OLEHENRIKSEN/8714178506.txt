I love this eye creme - the whole Vit C line from Ole is a huge favorite so I am familiar with and enjoy the ingredients. I like that this product has a slight radiance and glow, because it helps my eye bags look less, well, baggy. Eye creams are usually an indulgence for me because theyâ€™re an extra step but I love this creme! *gifted from Influenster, opinions are my own Another amazing Ole vitamin C product!
