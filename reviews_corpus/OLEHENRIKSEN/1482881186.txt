Let’s begin by saying that I have been thoroughly impressed by this incredible moisturizer. The thing that stood out the most to me is how immensely hydrated my skin felt during use. I kid you not this formula has such moisturizing longevity that even after 24 hours of single use, my skin has never felt more hydrated. When they named this incredible product they got it absolutely right. Strength Trainer definitely trains your moisture barrier to hold on to and lock in hydration like nothing else I’ve tried in the past. The texture is a unique balm like formula and a small amount goes quite far! The decadent balm begins to dissolve and sink into the skin like a gel like serum and you can instantly feel it working. The light but refreshing scent has a therapeutic effect. After several weeks of use, I have barely made a dent in this product but have noticed the benefits in my skin texture… noticeably plumper and slightly firmer as well. Without a doubt my expectations were blown out of the water and I will be purchasing this once I finish this tub. Thank you Influenster and Ole Henriksen! Incredible
