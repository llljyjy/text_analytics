I barely review any product but this product makes me do this. I have really sensitive, combination, oily, acne concern skin tone with easily breaking out or pimples if the product is too strong or too moist for me. But this is the perfect toner that I have ever used. I use after washing my face and it makes my skin smooth and reduce the redness of my acne. Normally some toners I used before with too much oil or too moist broke out my skin, but not this. I bought this when my skin was calm, and it worked excellent when my skin broke out because of make-up ingredient allergy with tons of acne on my jawline and it was doing really good job! However I dont think this good for dry skin because itâ€™s gonna dry out your skin and rash. For sensitive skin, you should try this couple time first because you will never know if your skin goes along with it or not, but the mint in the ingredient will calm your redness. highly recommend for oily combination (acne prone)
