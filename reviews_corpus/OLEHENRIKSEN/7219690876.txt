I bought this about 3 weeks ago and have only used it 3 times ( I do not wear makeup everyday) and I love it! it gives my skin a nice healthy glow. You only need a tiny bit only because it might be too strong for those with more sensitive skin. The smell is very pleasant, and smells like an orange smoothie! A must have for my morning routine
