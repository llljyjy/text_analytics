I received this product as a sample from Influenster in exchange of my honest review. I’m one who is very skeptical about any eye cream. I’ve used many different brands from different price points and my eyes always got irritated. Well, I’ve been using this for about a week and no irritation! I can see the change, my under eye is less puffy. The texture of the cream is thick but not sticky. A little goes a long way when you apply this. Last but not least, I would recommend this to everyone with sensitive eyes because so far my eyes are fine. Works with sensitive eyes
