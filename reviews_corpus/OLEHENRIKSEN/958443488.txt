So I love the brand and was really excited to try this. I like the packaging and the consistency - not too thick and still light. I mostly wanted this for the ingredients because I think vitamin C is one of the most important to use for anti-aging and helping keep spots away! I do think this product also helps with hydration, which is important to me because I have skin that gets super dry with things, including a lot of vitamin C products. Recommend this as a staple for skin health! nan
