I DON’T have sensitive skin and I have never had a problem with Vitamin C products or other face products until this one. The first time I had a reaction (terrible red bumpy rash and swelling all over my face and around my eyes) I wasn’t sure which of 2 products had caused the reaction. So I did not use either for a month. Then I used this again and had the same terrible reaction. I did a google search and saw that LOTS of people have had a similar reaction. BUYER BEWARE CAUSED A TERRIBLE RASH & SWELLING
