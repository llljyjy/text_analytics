I currently have acne on my skin after major hormonal changes during pregnancy.  I started using this essence and immediately loved the orange creamsicle scent as well as how soft the essence feels on my face.  I immediately noticed how hydrated my face feels even before using moisturizer.  I would totally recommend to a friend! I have replaced my serum with this right before moisturizer and love it. Smells like a creamsicle!!!!
