This Ole Henriksen resurfacing night cream smells like a sweet cream dessert. Itâ€™s a lovely scent but I wish it could be even lighter than this in consideration for those sensitive to fragrance. The cream is rich, occlusive and moisturizing. It spreads on the heavier side without being overly dense. Great for drier skins! nan
