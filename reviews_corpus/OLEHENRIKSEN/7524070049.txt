This is the best moisturizer I’ve found for my combination skin. It’s lightweight, non-greasy. Even towards the end of the day I find that I’m not oily. At the same time, I can have some dry, flaky patches of skin, and this has really made that problem go away. As for pore minimizing, I’ve not noticed a major difference, but I’ve never had a product really do much for that anyway. Great for combination/oily skin!
