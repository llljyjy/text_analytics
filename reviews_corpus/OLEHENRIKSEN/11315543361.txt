My skin in a nutshell: EXTREMELY sensitive, rosacea-prone, acne-prone, combination but more dry in the winter. I also often tend to break out if my routine changes too much. Anyone with rosacea or dry skin will often find themselves with skin barrier issues so products like this are definitely useful. I heard good reviews about this and figured i’d give it a try and..It’s been awesome!!! Not only does my skin tolerate it well but after a few consecutive uses, I could definitely see an improvement in my skin. It looked more clear, brighter and youthful. This product has a light lemon scent that’s reminiscent of the Bobbi Brown Vitamin Enriched Face Base. I don’t love the scent but it doesn’t linger so it’s not the biggest deal tho I hope future iterations of this product come without the scent, it’s an unnecessary ingredient in skincare that can cause sensitivities. This product has an almost wax-like texture at first (like a chapstick) but it conforms to the temperature of your hands/face so it easily ‘melts’ into a lotion/gel texture. If you’re layering skincare, I’d definitely save this for the last step as it is pretty occlusive. I’ll probably use this sparingly in the warmer months and stick to using this regularly in the colder months (Fall/Winter) when my skin barrier hates me the most. It’s important to keep in mind that your skin’s barrier being off can definitely cause A LOT of issues from dry/flaking/dull skin to rashes/breakouts so if you’re suffering from anything like that, it may be worth analyzing your skin barrier to determine if it’s comprised. Totally worth the try! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
