I’m happy with my purchase, I received this from my mom she didn’t like the moisturizer and I was part of her gift set. My first bottle from my mom lasted 2 months, hopefully this one will last 3 maybe 4 months. I’ve seen a difference in my complexion since using it, my scars have faded slowly and my skin is very soft. Happy with purchase.
