Nope. My skin Hated this. I got this per Katie Fawns recommendation and pure regret. I looked up comedogenic ingredients and this has EVERY SINGLE ONE. I wanted to love this, but absolutely not. Since I purchased this I have the worst clogged pores around my mouth. Ugh wish I could return but it’s too late! Do not get this if you’re acne prone. not. Immediately no.
