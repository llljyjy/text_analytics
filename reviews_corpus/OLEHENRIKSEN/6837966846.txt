Personally, I haven’t seen a huge difference with my pores and the texture on my face. It hasn’t made a huge difference with existing breakouts either. But it feels really nice, and my face feels so clean when I wash it off. Will be finishing the tube, but probably won’t repurchase. The scent also isn’t my fav. nan
