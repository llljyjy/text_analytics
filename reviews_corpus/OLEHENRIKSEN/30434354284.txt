decided to treat myself to an eye cream since 25 is creeping up on me lol and I was not disappointed with this product. literally one single application and I can already tell I’m going to be hooked. 1. I’ve recently been switching over my skincare to the “clean” side to rid myself specifically of harsh chemicals, fragrances and potential carcinogens. this eye cream was my last item to swap over!2. the thickness of the product is amazing. I dotted the end of a clean fingertip into the jar and had enough to apply to both undereyes liberally. I believe this can easily can last someone about 6 months to a year when applied correctly and twice daily. 3. No awful sting!!! Typically anything containing vitamin c or any citrus whatsoever really even just a scent will make my skin immediately feel like it is on fire but I’ll even go as far as to say that this product is sensitive skin friendly!I’m so excited to see how makeup applies over the top of this but so far I am majorly impressed! nan
