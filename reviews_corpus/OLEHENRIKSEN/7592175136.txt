Definitely would recommend this product to anyone needing a good under eye cream. I’ve tried so many products being that I have very dark under eyes, and nothing seems to help me at all. I’ve been using this before bed and in the morning’s and can totally see a bit of a difference already. The overall darkness of my under eyes is starting to become slightly lighter (which for my level of dark circles is an improvement.) Even though most creams/serums require time to build up in the skin to see results, this cream is still a win! The cream is so bright and reflects light so well that it brightens your eyes upon use. It also could be worn under concealer as a primer/base, so I tried that as well and it works! My concealer looked brighter and creased less with the crème underneath. Can’t wait to keep wearing is and seeing how much my under eyes will lighten. The formula feels amazing too, very creamy, smooth and moisturizing. Super brightening
