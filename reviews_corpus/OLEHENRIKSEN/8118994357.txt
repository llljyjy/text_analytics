I’ve been using this product religiously for about 2 weeks now and I love this stuff! The consistency is so creamy and not greasy like most night cremes. It glides on the skin smoothly and absorbs into the skin fast so I’m not getting all the product on my pillows. This creme makes my skin feel less textured, hydrated, and evens out my complexion. It’s truly a miracle worker! nan
