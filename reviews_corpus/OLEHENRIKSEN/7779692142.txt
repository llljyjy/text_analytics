I’ve tried Ole Henriksen products before and liked them, so I was definitely excited to try this out. I love the texture of this moisturizer; it’s on the thicker side, but absorbs into the skin easily and kind of melts in. It has a light scent to it that isn’t overpowering and doesn’t linger much past application. My skin feels great after using this and I would definitely recommend this! Great Moisturizer!
