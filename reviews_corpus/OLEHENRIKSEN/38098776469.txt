i used this for about two months and saw no difference in my under eyes. it actually made them super puffy and irritated, i think it’s an ingredient in the new formula that was really irritating. it pilled awfully under makeup, but was fine with nothing on top. didn’t hydrate my eyes like it said. i heard the old formula was a lot better and less common to irritate skin. the new formula supposedly has gold and mica in it which is very irritating. nonetheless i saw no results and didn’t like this under makeup or as a moisturizer for the eyes no results and very drying
