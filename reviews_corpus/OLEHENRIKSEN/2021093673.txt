I’ve been a fan of Ole Henriksen for years and I’ve used the original banana bright eye cream for just as long. The original is amazing and this is even better!! It really does brighten and moisturize instantly. The addition of gold I think really helps to intensify the brightening benefits. Even though this is now unscented I still find it has a pleasant light scent to it. So glad I received this to try out! I’ll definitely be keeping this in my skincare regimen. Better than the OG!
