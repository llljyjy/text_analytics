I must be in a major minority here because all the reviews are so positive. I’ve waited a couple months before leaving a review to really test it out. The only positive I noticed was my skin look more glowing in the mornings? But there wasn’t any change with skin texture, discoloration, or anything else.Also I’ve become especially alarmed because in the past couple weeks, the product is no longer a serum.. it has turned into a goopy gel. I’ve only had this for maybe 5 months and it has a year shelf life. It stays with all my other skincare products, out of extreme temps so I’m very confused by the sudden change in texture.This is an expensive serum and with half the bottle left, I can’t even continue to use it. If it try applying now, it immediately pills and crumbles up all over my face and does not soak in at all. I don’t know if I got a faulty product, but it’s done nothing for me and is useless now. Huge letdown
