Upon opening the lid to the product, I was already able to smell for delightful the cream is. It smells like a lemon cake, which made me more inclined to apply it on my face! My skin concerns in the winter are dehydrated and rough skin especially when I visit family in colder locations. After using this cream, my skin instantly felt more nourished as the texture is light but applies on with a thicker feeling. It really gave my skin the hydration and coverage that it needed. It is noticeably smoother as my boyfriend pointed out. I would definitely recommend to my friends and family as this will be my new go to at night!! Smells delicious and hydrates well!!
