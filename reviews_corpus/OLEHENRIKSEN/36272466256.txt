I like this moisturizer! The texture is nice, it smells lovely. It’s safe to use on my acne prone skin, and my skin so smooth after application. I won’t be repurchasing, but that’s because I live in a place with pretty harsh weather and it’s dry here even in the summer. I also often have to use exfoliators like BHA or retinoids that leave me feeling a bit dryer and this moisturizer doesn’t quite keep up. I need a heavy lifter moisturizer, even when I use a hydration serum. Overall, this moisturizer does what it says it will do, and does it nicely, but may not be the solution if you have dry skin, need harsher exfoliators, or live in a dry climate. Lovely-but not enough for dry parts of my skin
