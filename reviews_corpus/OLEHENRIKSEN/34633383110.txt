I like this eye cream a lot. I can’t say it really brightens (aside from the minor color correcting from the yellow tint), but the color is great, it doesn’t burn my eyes despite the vitamin C, and my makeup creases less when I wear this. I like the thick-ish consistency. The only downside is the price, so I’m not sure I’ll repurchase, but it do like it. nan
