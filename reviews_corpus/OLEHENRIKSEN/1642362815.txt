This eye cream is very rich and luxe. It has a lovely natural scent of citrus and absorbs nicely into the skin without any residue. Does a lovely job hydrating and brightening the eye area. Iâ€™ve never been disappointed in an Ole Henriksen product, always well made and effective. The eye cream may be more suited to my winter routine due to the formula. But it will definitely become a staple in my winter routine. Very nice!
