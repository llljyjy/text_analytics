I was gifted by OleHenriksen.I’m so impressed with their products as they never dissapoint. This is the best night cream I have tried up to date and I have tried many many night . The consistency is not thick but just right. Since this is a night cream you don’t have to worry about how it would act with makeup. It literally gives your skin the nutrients that it needs and helps your skin replenish overnight. It blends in skin beautifully. It has a beautiful scent that is very subtle and refreshing and it goes away after you apply the screen It absorbs fast and it doesn’t leave the skin sticky. It hydrates the skin and moisturizes absolutely beautifully. Even though I have a very sensitive skin, my skin was not irritated at all. I put this cream before going to bed, I wake up to this beautiful skin. Since I started using this product my final lines has reduced greatly. My skin is supple and glowy. My skin looks very smooth too. Overall this is a really good anti-aging product that I cannot wait to use it for years. I will definitely repurchase nan
