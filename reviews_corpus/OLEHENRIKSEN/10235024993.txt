Love this toner for everyday! I have used chemical exfoliants in the past so I had no adjustment period with my skin using this. I had dark spots, especially around my chin, And would get a few breakouts a month prior when I was just using witch hazel to tone. I have noticed since I started using this that my dark spots have significantly faded, my skin feels and looks much smoother and evenly toned, and I have only gotten one breakout in the last two months. Will continue to use! Addicted to this!
