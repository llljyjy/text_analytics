I am 38 yrs old & spent 10 years in the Army during which time I toured on 2 deployments to Iraq & Afghanistan as a combat engineer. I had to deal with C4 & chemical explosives regularly, and we did not have proper sunblock or skincare products to counteract the immense amount of damage that was being done to our skin daily from the sun, chemicals, or explosions that our skin was subjected to. Since then I have never gotten my skin’s PH back to completely balanced…and trust me I have tried A LOT of skincare products since coming home. I now own a YouTube review channel where I investigate ingredients on beauty products, & I test & try new skincare all the time from high end to drugstore, and I have never found a moisturizer quite like this, with these types of ingredients, that truly resets and heals damaged skin, and that wasn’t a clinical strength or prescribed product. The fact that this product is only $48 on top of that…y’all this is a STEAL.Plus this is perfect for my oily and combo gals too. This product actually completely sinks into your skin and there’s no residual feeling leftover whatsoever, but then you notice your skin looks incredible. Wrinkles have lessened, scars have lightened, your skin has more elasticity to it, and is more firm…RUN! Don’t walk. This is my 2nd jar already and I don’t repurchase very many products y’all. But this one you couldn’t pry from my fingers if you tried your hardest. BEST NON-CLINICAL MOISTURIZER ON THE MARKET
