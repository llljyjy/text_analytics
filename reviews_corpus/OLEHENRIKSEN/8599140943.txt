This is an innovative product.  It’s almost a hybrid of a toner, essence and vitamin C serum in one.  I found this product to be beneficial after adding it to my skincare routine because my skin appeared noticeably brighter.  It has a finish texture, light fragrance and isn’t drying to my combination skin.  I’m not surprised that this “essence“ agrees with my skin as I’ve tried more than a few products from the Olehenriksen brand before.  Overall, I will continue to use this product and I’d highly recommend it as it functions as a 3 in 1 product. A 3 in 1 product
