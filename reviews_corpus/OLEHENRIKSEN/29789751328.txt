It a pleasant product to put on soon after a face wash before applying other producsts. it absorbs fast and helps face stay fresh and luminious. How it feels: Its consistency is slightly thicker than water. It doesnt dry out as fast as water. So buys you enough time to get ready for the next product. I feel my skin very hydrated and glowy as its makes my face easily absorb the rest of the products in my routine. My dry dehydrated acne prone skin is enjoying this product. I absolutely love this!!! My new must have
