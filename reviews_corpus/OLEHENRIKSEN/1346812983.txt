Iâ€™ve tried so many peels/resurfacers that either burned or did nothing noticeable. Gave up on them for a while. Then I decided to try Dewtopia. WOW! After the first night, I felt a smoother feel to my face. I continued each night and things kept getting better! My 61yr old skin is brighter, smoother, plumper, pores and wrinkles getting smaller. My skin has never looked or felt better. No Retinol...And it Works!!!!
