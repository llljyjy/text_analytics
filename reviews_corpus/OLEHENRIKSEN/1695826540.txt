I love trying out Essence skin care products and this one is beautiful! It smells like freshly squeezed oranges, has a thicker, milky consistency than a typical watery essence. It absorbs into the skin beautifully and helps the rest of my skincare have an even better effect. This is my first product from the brand and I cannot wait to try more! nan
