I’ve used this scrub for couple of weeks and do not notice much difference. Though it smells nice, like lemon merengue. So I’d rather spend on dessert rather than this scrub. Will not buy again. At the same time, the scrub did not cause any issues for my skin, no breakouts, no sense of dryness after using it. So maybe this is the positives . I am sure I’ll be able to find similar product for fraction of the cost. nan
