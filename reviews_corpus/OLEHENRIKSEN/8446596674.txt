I like that this moisturizer is very moisturizing and a little goes a long way. Even though it’s thick in consistency, it applies very easily and feels lightweight on the skin. I have been using it day and night but I’m yet to see any visible results so far. I also like the light natural scent it has. I love that the formula and ingredients are clean. nan
