The Banana Bright eye cream has proven to be an effective addition in my skin care routine. I’m 31 and my eye area requires more moisture and vitamin c than it used to. After I pat it around my eye area, there’s a slight tingle and the skin around my eyes appears more plump and moisturized. This is a good product to wear on a makeup free face or under makeup.
