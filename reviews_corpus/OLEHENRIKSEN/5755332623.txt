The only cleanser I trusted was the Origins Zero Oil with Saw Palmetto and Mint. they discontinued it. this was recommended to me by a sephora employee and i can honestly say i love it. works just as well, really great at controlling “maskne” and makes my skin feel clean and smooth without drying it out (which is surprising since it’s oil controlling) a must have!
