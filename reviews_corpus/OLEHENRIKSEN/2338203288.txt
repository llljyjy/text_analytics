The new Ole Henriksen Essence is a burst of orange freshness. It has a strong candy orange scent that isn’t for everyone. The essence itself has a milky lightweight texture, similar to an emulsion but nowhere near as thick.It’s very easy to incorporate into any routine and layers really well. The essence doesn’t break me out and adds a lovely lightweight moisture to my combo skin.They use my favorite form of vitamin C in here (Ethyl Ascorbic Acid) which helps brighten the skin without the usual irritation of Ascorbic Acid and still has some great antioxidant protection.If they could dilute the fragrance a little that would be better for me, fortunately the scent doesn’t linger too long.
