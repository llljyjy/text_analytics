I have very dark under eye circles and am excited to see if this product brightens them.  The product has a slightly suntan scent to it.  It also has a slightly greasy feel until absorbed into the skin.  A few minutes after putting the cream on my circles appeared to be slightly lighter due to the coloring tint in the cream. nan
