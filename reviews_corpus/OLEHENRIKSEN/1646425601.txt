Ole Henriksen makes some phenomenal skincare products. This moisturizer is super rich and luscious and has a lovely fresh scent. I’ve been using it for the past week and my extra dry skin has been loving it. It’s made my skin really hydrated, soft, and smooth. I would definitely recommend this moisturizer! Ole Henriksen
