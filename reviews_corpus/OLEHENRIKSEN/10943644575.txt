This eye cream is AMAZING!!! In general, I adore this brand. This eye cream is effective and reasonably priced. This cream is thick and creamy, and it goes on smoothly. I’ve been using it on my under-eye area every night for about a week and I can definitely see and feel a difference. My eyes are brighter and much more hydrated. I really like the scent; it smells almost caramel-y. I’ve also noticed a significant difference when I use concealer under my eyes. I really like the coverage it provides. Glad this product is not greasy. I’d recommend buying this product. I'm IMPRESSED!!
