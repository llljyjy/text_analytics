This face cream has such a rich, amazing texture that melts into the skin. It also has a natural citrus fragrance to it that smells so good. I would recommend this for any one sensitive or with very dry - combination skin, but not oily skin types. I canâ€™t honestly say if I noticed a difference in firmness, but it is still a very nice cream. nan
