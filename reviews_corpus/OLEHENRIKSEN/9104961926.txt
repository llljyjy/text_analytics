I enjoy this cream but it isn’t life changing. It’s a thicker texture than normal hydrating cream, so it’s very hydrating. No intense smell. Sleek looking packaging and no adverse effects on my skin. But no major changes in my skins appearance after using. I’d buy again for the purposes of hydration. Good
