I used this for about 6 weeks without any issues. I love the way it smells and it absorbs well. I didn’t see much of a change in my skin during this time. I stopped using this for ~2 weeks and when I started using it again, I had an allergic reaction. My skin got really dry and red especially around my nose and mouth. I had tiny whiteheads in all the red patches & my skin felt textured. My eyelids were swollen and I felt like I had a bad sunburn all over my face. I stopped using everything, just a gentle cleanser and cerave moisturizer. I tried different products over the next 4 weeks to see what caused the reaction and this was the culprit. My face blew up again. I don’t have sensitive skin and I don’t have any allergies so I’m shocked that this irritated my skin so much. Up until the allergic reaction, I thought this was an okay product—there are better vitamin c serums out there but this was still good so I think it’ll still work for others. I recommend getting a sample to see how your skin reacts before buying the whole bottle. Okay until allergic reaction
