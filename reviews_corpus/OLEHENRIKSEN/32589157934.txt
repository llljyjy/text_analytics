I have tried so many products that claim to be pore minimizing and this is by far my favorite.

I use this around 2x a week for lasting results usually at night or before going out.  I love the cooling and the tightening sensations it gives without feeling like it is drying out my skin, which Iâ€™ve experienced from a lot of clay masks. Must have for large pores
