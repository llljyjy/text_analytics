I received this product for free with the Influenster program a couple weeks ago and waited a few weeks for an honest review. I FREAKING LOVE THIS STUFF! There’s a lot of mixed reviews for this one, a lot of people having burning and sensitivity issues which I am vulnerable to so I did a patch test on the side of my face and it was all good. I only use this in the mornings and the orange yellow tint truly brightens my sleepy eyes and opens them. The texture is divine, like butter, not oily. Will 100% buy this when I’m out. It’s my favorite morning skincare step. DIVINE
