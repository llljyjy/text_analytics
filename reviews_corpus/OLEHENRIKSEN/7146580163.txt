I received this product in an Influenster box and asked to leave an honest review. After close to 3 weeks, some spots under my eyes are brighter, but not the entire under eye. This product did sit well under my eye as an eye cream before makeup application. I like it as an under eye moisturizer more than a brightening product. nan
