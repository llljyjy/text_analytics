I received complimentary from Ole Henriksen. This new night firming cream is a joy to use. The formula goes to work removing dead skin cells and seems to erase sun damage and minimizing the look of lines and wrinkles. I have combination skin and I struggle a little with hyperpigmentation, this cream also works to minimize my dark spots, since this moisturizer contains a high percentage of AHAs, which can increase your risk of sun sensitivity and damage, it should only be used at night. I always apply sunscreen in the daytime to prevent further damage and darkening my darks spots Beautiful Clear Skin
