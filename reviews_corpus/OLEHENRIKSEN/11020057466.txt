I like the frosted glass bottle of this essence. Itâ€™s fragranced and smells like oranges. I used this daily, in the morning and at night. I lightly pat the essence onto my skin. I have oily acne-prone skin and have noticed that my skin appears brighter and hydrated in conjunction with my moisturizer. nan
