Ole Henriksen’s “Dewtopia 5% Acid Firming Night Crème’ is a very good, lightweight, night cream that deeply moisturizes skin. It contains potent ingredients like 5% AHAs, Edelweiss stem cells and red algae, & shea butter to help minimize dark spots, fine lines and wrinkles, while keeping skin hydrated all night! Remember to only use this at night though cause of it’s ingredients, it does make your skin sensitive (ALWAYS wear SPF in the morning). But overall, this moisturizer is a must for dehydrated, aging skin! I’m in love!! A MUST for dehydrated skin!
