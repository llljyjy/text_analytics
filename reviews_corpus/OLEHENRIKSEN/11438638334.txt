My thoughts ➾ the eye crème has a thick, creamy texture that feels luxurious on the under eye. I noticed an immediate improvement in hydration and brightness. I love the addition of the banana powder pigments, not only did my dark circles look less noticeable but my concealer looked amazing. I would highly recommend trying it out very impressed
