This is the second product from this brand I’ve tried and I’m impressed! The AHA component is great for helping with fine lines or light texture, but is not strong enough to help the turn over of cells related to acne blemishes. However I didn’t expect it to, and my non blemishes areas of my skin looked smooth and bright the next morning :) Felt the mild tingling — if you have sensitive skin I would buffer it with a soothing serum under and/or make sure you allow your skin to dry fully before applying to reduce speed of absorption Great for fine line, pores, texture, but not acne
