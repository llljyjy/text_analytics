I put this on at night to my dry, uneven skin and wake up to a plump, glowy skin! I was gifted by the brand so Iâ€™ve been using this before the launch. So far I am enjoying this.  If you have sensitive skin like me, I would recommend to use it every 2 to 3 days, as the 5% acid may be too strong to use it daily nan
