I wanted to give this some time to see it’s short term and long term effects. I have to say after using it for 4 week I will stick the OLEHENRIKSEN Banana Bright+ Vitamin C Eye Crème as long as they make it! I received it to test from Influenster and I couldn’t be happier.Upon receiving the crème the first thing I noticed is it lived up to its promise of being fragrance free. It does have the slightest scent but nothing like the strong perfume smells that’s I cannot stand during my pregnancy. In my opinion any product you use near your eyes should follow suit and lack the strong chemicals that make your eyes burn.I love that is has such a soft texture and seems to melt into your skin. I’m 35 and have 3 kids and 1 on the way so my dark circles are very apparent. When I applied the OLEHENRIKSEN Banana Bright+ Vitamin C Eye Crème it instantly lightened the darkness dramatically. It also softened the small lines on the corner of my eyes and provided such a nice healthy glow that I now couldn’t live without. Another favorite feature is the ability to use it as a makeup base. I have tired countless under eye primers and not one has stopped my makeup from creasing before this wonderful gem! This will be my go to crème for life and I am just about ready to hit pan and buy another. I highly recommend you give it a try. I am IN LOVE
