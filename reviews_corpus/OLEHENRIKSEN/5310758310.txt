I received this moisturizer early from Influenster in return for my honest review. So let’s get into it! I have combination skin. Super dry in the winter and oily on my forehead. I have been using the OLEHENRIKSEN Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer for about 3 weeks now. This moisturizer so far has been the GOAT. It’s nice and thick, perfect for the cold, winter months in the North East. There is a light smell. (non irritating). It keeps my face super hydrated without making it oily! I absolutely love it and will definitely recommend for anyone with combination skin. I’ve noticed a glow to my skin. It feels firmer and more elastic. I cannot say enough about it. Do yourself a favor and try it out. You won’t regret! You need this this winter
