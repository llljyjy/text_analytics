I actually really liked how this felt on my face. I have sensitive skin and no issues. The smell is light. I only used once a day at night because my face runs greasy and this was kinda heavy. I didn’t want to be over oily. Only 4 stars because I’m not sure it did anything besides keep my face hydrated trough the winter months Ole Henrikson strength peptide boost moisturizer
