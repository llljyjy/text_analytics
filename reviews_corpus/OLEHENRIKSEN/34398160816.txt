This product is SO invigorating. Perfect to really wake you up - it smells like pure, fresh oranges. I love the packaging as it’s in a glass bottle which feels like it preserves the good ingredients more. I put 3-4 drops on my hands and pat it into my skin in the morning and it feels soooooo good. It’s really light weight and absorbent. It doesn’t leave any kind of glow, just seeps right into the skin. Doesn’t break me out and my skin is nice and prepped for the next steps in my routine. Refreshing
