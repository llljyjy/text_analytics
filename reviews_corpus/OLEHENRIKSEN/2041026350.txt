I was gifted this by influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I tried the previous formula a few years ago and returned it because it was just not for me (I didn’t see any difference whatsoever). The new formulation has actually been amazing this time around.I have been struggling with my concealer in the last year, it either creases like crazy or looks dry or cakey or all three. I don’t particularly buy into the marketing promises of eye creams or serums, but I do use them because my eye skin is too sensitive for my regular moisturizer, it will burn if I use something it doesn’t like. I also have slight discoloration. This cream goes on like butter! It also color corrects slightly (maybe that is the brightening?), moisturizes without irritation, and provides a great base for my concealer.The biggest benefit for me is how healthy my eye skin looks by the end of day, with it without concealer/makeup. My concealer also lasts ALL DAY now. I’m so glad this found its way to me. Concealer Game Changer
