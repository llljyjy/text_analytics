One of the best masks I have ever used!! I see people writing that this mask is too sticky and that’s all they leave for comments. You MUST use this product properly, for it to work. The first time I used this mask, I didn’t use it properly. You must put a light layer all over your face and then proceed to rub it all over your face in circular motions for three minutes, until the whole mask turns white and then let it dry. I left the mask on for 45 minutes and didn’t notice any kind of tingling, it just felt nice! After, I removed it with a hot face cloth and then washed my face with a light face wash. My face had a pinky glow to it and has been soft for many days after using it. Noticeable texture, dry skin and blackheads gone! I’ve used many masks from Fresh, Tacha, Drunk Elephant, Murad, Glam Glow, Philosophy, Dr. Dennis Gross, Clinique and La Mer to name a few. I have actually tried them all and this is by far, in my top three! I bought one and then I went out immediately afterwards and bought a second bottle! AMAZING results. Incredible soft skin for a week and my skin looks brighter and more refined! I am in my late 40s, with combination skin, very acne prone and this truly is an awesome face mask! Love love LOVE!!! Will recommend to everyone! Went running to buy this!
