really do enjoy this product. My skin is sensitive and dry. I have been using this product after my facial/derma-rolling routine. I enjoy the consistency of this product it is not runny or too thick. Product has really natural smell that is not overwhelming. Product has really natural smell that is not overwhelming. The color is orange but blends right into skin. I wear this product over night and wake up with my face feeling much more moisturizer and brighter. Love it
