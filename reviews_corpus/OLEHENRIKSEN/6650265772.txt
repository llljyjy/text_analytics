I am loving this Olehenriksen strength peptide moisturizer. With the winter months here itâ€™s a lifesaver with hydrating my dry skin. The texture is gel like and heavy but melts so well into your skin. I use AM/PM and it does not make my face greasy when wearing throughout the day. This cream absorbs well into the skin. I am also loving the ingredients to keep my face hydrated and improve elasticity. loving this product!
