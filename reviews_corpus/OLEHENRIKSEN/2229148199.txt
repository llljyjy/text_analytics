I’ve tried a ton of moisturizers and this is one of the best! I have dry skin that is worse in the winter and this does a great job at keeping it hydrated. I like that it’s a thicker consistency yet it doesn’t take long to be absorbed. I’m not crazy about the super sweet lemon scent but I don’t notice it too much once it’s on. Perfect for dry skin
