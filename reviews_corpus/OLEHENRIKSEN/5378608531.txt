I received this from Influenster and Ole Henrikson in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this cream consistently for a few weeks now. It’s definitely thick and luxurious on the skin. However I don’t find it particularly brightening. It does add a little brightness but it’s just barely noticeable. If this I’d meant to be used as a base for makeup, it definitely should do more. It is hydrating but also heavy, so perfect for people that like rich textures with their lotion. I prefer a lighter cream. I also can’t say I noticed a difference with wrinkles and fine lines. All in all I’m so glad to have tried it but I’m not sure yet if I’ll be buying it again, but it’s not a bad product, just not for me Not very brightening
