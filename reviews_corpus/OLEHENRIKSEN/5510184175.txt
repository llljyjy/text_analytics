I am loving this eye cream. I appreciate how smooth it goes on, and the creamy texture. It melts into your skin so easily. No tacky residue left behind! I notice that my under eye feels much smoother and my makeup has been applying better in those areas. I do use this as a base prior to applying makeup as the company suggests. It is a great addition to my skincare routine. I am excited to see the long term results. Excellent eye cream!
