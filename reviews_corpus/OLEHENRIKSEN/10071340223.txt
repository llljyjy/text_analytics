Love love love!!! I recieved this moisturizer from Influenster for free in exchange for my honest review. I  absolutely love how this makes my skin feel. At first touch I was worried this would be a bit greasy- it feels sort of greasy when you rub it in, then it almost immediately absorbs into the skin without any sort of greasy feel or residue. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated all-day! I have officially decided to switch out my usual “go to“ moisturizer for this product! Love! Love! Love!
