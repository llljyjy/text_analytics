Love the citrus scent and the mildness of the product. Did not sting my face at all! Gentle enough to use twice a day! It has a whitish hint and medium-thickness on its texture. But easily absorbed by the skin. Tried this product for a week and definitely noticed my skin felt smoother and brighter! This means Vitamin C is absolutely working! Love the feel upon application!
