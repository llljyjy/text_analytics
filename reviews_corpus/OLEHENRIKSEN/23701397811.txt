I usually don’t use eye creme as often as I should but I been using OLEHENRIKSEN Banana Bright+ Vitamin C Eye Crème for about a month and I really like it. It goes on smooth, doesnt feel oily after it dries. Also didn’t take long to dry and is very lightweight. My skin felt very hydrated and softer. Works well under makeup and you don’t need much a little goes a long way. I would recommend. nan
