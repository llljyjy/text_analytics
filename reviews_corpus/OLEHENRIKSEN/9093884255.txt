I wanted to love this moisturizer because I really enjoyed the texture. Feels solid at first and then melts into your skin upon application, almost like a cleansing balm. I really enjoyed that! But unfortunately it just didn’t moisturize my skin. I have combo skin and usually don’t have any issue with moisturizers not moisturizing (some are obviously just better than others) but this one actually dried certain areas of my face and it got a little flaky which was very disappointing! A bit of a let down
