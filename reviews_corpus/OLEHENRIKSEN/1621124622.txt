Received this product from Influenster to test out and I’m hooked. Not only did I love this product, but I’ve been wanting to try this brand for forever so after falling in love with this, I ordered more from the OH line. I’ve been struggling with skin issues this year (hormonal & allergy related) and some of the medications I’m on make my skin dry but also oily if I put on the wrong products. This has helped with dryness without adding to my oil production. It’s thick and creamy but not suffocating on the skin. And it smells amazing. I’m hooked. Easily obsessed!
