I recently tested the new Ole Henriksen Dewtopia 5% Acid Firming Night Creme and I am extremely impressed with the results. This creme has a lightweight, creamy texture that spreads easily and absorbs quickly into the skin. It has a pleasant, subtle scent that is not overpowering.One of the things I love most about this creme is that it provides intense hydration without feeling heavy or greasy on my skin. It has left my skin feeling soft, smooth, and deeply moisturized. Overall, I am extremely happy with the Ole Henriksen Dewtopia 5% Acid Firming Night Creme and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality, effective moisturizer that delivers noticeable results. nan
