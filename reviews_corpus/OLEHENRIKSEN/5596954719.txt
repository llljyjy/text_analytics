I received the Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence complimentary from Ole Henriksen. The essence works well to help brighten up dull skin. The scent is amazing and reminds me of oranges. I use this essence right after toner and it helps prep my skin for skin cream and sun creams. I like that it does not leave my skin feeling sticky afterward, I can the difference before and after I use it because it helps plump up my skin and helps with dark spots and dull skin. nan
