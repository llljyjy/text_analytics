The serum itself was light in weight, moisturizing, that it made me feel hydrated. The formula absorbed really fast. I would have preferred a different design (pump?).  Itâ€™s lightweight so i would recommend it to my friends, especially for the summer.  I could see it benefiting both me (who has oily, sensitive & acne prone skin) but also my mom (who has combination skin & would benefit from the anti aging/ brighting effect). nan
