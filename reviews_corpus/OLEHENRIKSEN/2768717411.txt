I typically use the Fresh line of moisturizers but received this for testing and thought I would try it out. At first the texture made me a little uneasy, while I have dry skin, the very thick consistency threw me off. However, it rubs into a gel like texture that was really pleasant. Note: if you are wanting a texture similar to the tatcha water cream, this is not it but if you like a gel that is very hydrating, this may be perfect for you. I do not think I will use it in the morning but will be keeping this in my nighttime rotation. perfect nighttime hydration
