I have used this product for years and recently received this new formulation of it. I love the immediate sense of brightening and hydration i get once this is applied. I don’t suffer from really bad dark circles so i mainly incorporate this product more for preventative measures. That being the case i can’t truly give an opinion on whether this will contribute to lightening your dark circles with continued use. However, i do love that my under eyes feel awakened and bright during use. I recently saw an influencer on instagram recommend mixing this cream in with your concealer for an even further brightening effect and WOW! Best tip ever! My concealer goes on smoother and helps The longevity, which was easy to notice with this summer heat! If you’re looking for a new eye cream i would definitely recommend this one! nan
