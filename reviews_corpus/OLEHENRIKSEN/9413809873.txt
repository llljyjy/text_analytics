I was really impressed with this moisturizer! I have combination skin so I can’t get anything to thick for my oily parts, but I need hydration for my dry parts. This moisturizer was a perfect fit for my skin type. I do get acne around my chin and it didn’t break me out or anything. It really makes the skin feel plump, hydrated, and smooth. Great moisturizer
