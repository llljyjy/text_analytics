I was a little worried bc of all the incentivized reviews ( and the price) but I’m very happy! You only need a TINY amount to do your face & neck and it is incredibly hydrating but still sinks in nicely. There’s hardly any fragrance and the ingredients are very impressive, looking forward to long term results! NOT a paid review
