I received this product for free in return for a review. I do not have discoloration, bags, or many problems in my eye area so this was kind of hard to review. I felt like it did lighten it slightly and may have firmed it up some but it wasn’t so much that I felt this was a holy grail. I’m sure it works better for people with problems lol. It works
