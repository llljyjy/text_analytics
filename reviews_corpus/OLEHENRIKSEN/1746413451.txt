As someone who always forgets to use a vitamin c serum, I was glad to see an essence that incorporated vitamin c into the formula. This essence does have a citrus scent but I enjoy smelling it in the morning. It layers well and doesnâ€™t cause skin irritations. As with most skincare products, it will take time to see long term benefits but so far I am enjoying the hydration and antioxidant powers of vitamin C. nan
