I have been a huge fan of the banana eye cream for years so I was so excited to see that there was a new formula even though it was amazing to begin with. This cream has always been iconic and still is. It’s so prefect for me because my baby is still waking me up I’m throughout the night so I have dark circles from lack of sleep and this brightens my under eye area Iconic!
