This stuff is amazing!! My skin has been so dry/ irritated with the weather and starting tretinoin so I decided to give this a try. I noticed a difference immediately with my skin being more hydrated and has helped so much with the effects of retinol. Itâ€™s also calmed down my active pimples a lot. I was previously using the first aid beauty over night cream but this is way better! amazing!!
