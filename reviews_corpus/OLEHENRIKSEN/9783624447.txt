I have pretty bad hormonal acne now that my cycle is back for the first time in over 2 years (pregnancy + breastfeeding). I have never had acne this bad before. My usual skincare routine has been making a dent in it but I would still get new stuff popping up and my skin was visibly under distress from all my picking. NOT ANYMORE! My skin is so calmed, hydrated, and HAPPY now that I’m using this. I haven’t seen it this healthy in a loooong time. It’s plump, glowing, and clearing up so fast. I love this cream so much, I almost had a heart attack when I dropped it in the toilet last night! Thankfully it was sealed shut and there was no damage but... I could not breathe for a moment there. The consistency is very much like a Korean “chok chok“ cream. Like a hybrid between a gel and a cream. A little goes a long way, so this little tub will at least last a decent amount of time. As with other Ole Henriksen product, this is truly magnificent. Flat Out Amazing
