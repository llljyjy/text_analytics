I love this eye cream!  I have dark circles under my eyes that get more pronounced with lack of sleep.  Any cream I’ve tried up to now has just been a waste of my money and time.  The banana bright eye cream worked right away and reduces the dark circles and brightens my whole face.  It absorbs well into my skin and I can layer it with other face products without issues.  It’s so easy to apply and a little goes a long way.  Such a big impact from a little jar. Can’t live without it!
