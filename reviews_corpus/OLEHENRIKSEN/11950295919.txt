I’m really enjoying the serum and how glow it has been making my skin recently! It’s seeps into my skin nicely and makes my face feel really moisturized and supple. I noticed that my skin was really glowing from the first use and I am excited to keep using it to brighten the dark spots on my skin! Makes my skin glow!
