First off, the SMELL of this is amazing & so addictive!! It’s just the perfect orange smell - I cannot get enough! On to the performance: I’m a toner addict & I love all sorts; for me, this falls into the “hydrating & moisturizing“ combo category - the type of product you’d use after an exfoliating toner, before any serums or moisturizer. I use it just before my vitamin C serum, then apply moisturizer after, but honestly, it’s hydrating enough that you don’t really need a serum after it unless you’re treating something specific. You can layer this, & it gets more moisturizing with each layer. The ingredients are just fabulous - all the best skincare ingredients that you’d have to use multiple serums to get, so that makes this an excellent combo/all-in-one product as well. Perfect for busy days! It’s excellent for my dry-to-combination skin. I could see oily-skinned people liking it as well, because it brings the skin balance & has fermented ingredients that can help do that. It absorbs well & does not leave any residue. Smells AMAZING & feels great
