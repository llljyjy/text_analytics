I received this product from the company as a compliment for review. This product is really nice on the skin, gives refreshing feeling and make my skin so smooth. I usually use it right before moisturizer. The only downside is that you need it pour it right on your hand and sometime it gets a bit messy. I started using it with cotton to avoid  this issue and apply it as if I am applying toner. Great product
