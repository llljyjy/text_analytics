This is a great AHA night serum for resurfacing skin and renewing your glow! I love the way my skin feels and looks following use. This would be great for hyperpigmentation and i can’t wait to continue use and see how well this fades my dark spots. Anything that resurfaces and makes me glow, sign me up! I also really appreciate that this is a night serum, because it’s very hydrating!! Hydrating resurfacing serum
