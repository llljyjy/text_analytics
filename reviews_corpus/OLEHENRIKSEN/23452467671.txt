My skin type is dry, sensitive and I have light dark circles after having a baby. This eyes cream is light, smooth texture and the light orange of the cream made my dark circles more neutralized. I use it under makeup everyday and it doesnâ€™t burn my under eyes. I am so happy to add this OleHenriksen to my skincare routine. Highly recommend. Highly recommend
