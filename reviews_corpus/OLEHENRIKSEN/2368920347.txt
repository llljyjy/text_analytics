I am very pleased with this Orange Ferment Essence, it has a lightweight milky, watery consistency and literally smells like fresh oranges, citrus scent. I absolutely love using it in my am routine because it wakes me up and gives me that refreshing feeling to start the day. My skin looks brighter, and more hydrated with a nice glow after using it. If you are a big fan of citrus/ fresh tea scent , this is for you. so refreshing!!!
