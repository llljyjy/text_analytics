I love the Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence a lot! My skin has been dull and my cheeks have been like the Sahara desert. I saw immediate results in my first use, my skin felt more hydrated and had a glow. It is lightweight and melts right in to my skin and helps my skin absorb my serum and moisturizer with ease. Over time my skin kept the hydration. I love that it helps defend against environmental stressors while helping to bind moisture and strengthen my skinâ€™s barrier function.  It uses distilled active parts of an orange and hyaluronic acid. It also smells like a fresh orange. nan
