Gifted by Ole Henrikson: This is one of the best moisturizers I have tried this year! I have dry/sensitive skin and am looking for moisturizers to help combat aging. This formulation is so incredible; it gently exfoliates the skin while also adding that extra hydration! After a few uses, it has my skin looking so soft, dewy, and youthful! I highly recommend this for all skin types! Holy grail moisturizer!!!
