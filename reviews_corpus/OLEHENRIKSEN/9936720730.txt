I had redness and peeling around my nose and mouth, and they sting so much. I think it is because my old creams were very strong. I tried other products but nothing worked. And then I saw this in one of the famous reviewers in youtube. I am amaze how this one tapered down redness since they one. And after a week of using, my skin has healed. I can now put on make up (foundation/concealer) again without sting and exposure flaky skin. Skin Repair
