Bamboozled once again! I got a few uses out of the sample of this and it worked like a DREAM, visibly softer, healthier, clearer looking skin the mornings after. Was SOLD and bought the full size only to swear the potency is significantly less than the sample’s. No difference seen after multiple uses, the way I noticed when previously trying the product. Maybe it’s just too mild for my skin (I’ve endured a ton of facial treatments/acids). I loved the chocolately lemon scent which reminded me of past chemical peels I’ve had which made me assume it was actually useful. But, I’m disappointed. Maybe it’s just too gentle for me and would work better on sensitive, innocent skin. nan
