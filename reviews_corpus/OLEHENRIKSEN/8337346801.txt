This didn’t do much for my face BUT I didn’t want to waste it and started using it on my body and it worked great. I scar and get hyperpigmentation from anything and this has worked really well as an added layer to clear my skin up (even added it to my foot care routine and they look phenomenal). I get better use of this at night after a shower and of course using SPF the following morning. Better For The Body
