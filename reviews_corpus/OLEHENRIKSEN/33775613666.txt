I received this cream from influenster in a voxbox for my honest opinion. First off the packaging is great. Very clean and subtle. Easy to use directions, readable ingredient list. Upon opening the cream is slightly orange to fit with the campaign, very creamy texture. It is now fragrance free but to be honest was a little disappointed not to find a hint of citrus to tie the whole product together. I used it for a week before I could write my review. It is really a great eye cream. There is a notable difference in my undereye darkness and it seems like the skin around my eye is a bit firmer. I love the fact that this product is vegan as many eye  creams are not. I use this twice a day. Once in the morning as a base/ primer for my makeup and I have incorporated it into my nighttime routine. I can recommend this product as it does what it says it does. I am extremely satisfied and thankful to have received this product. Great new addition to my skincare routine!
