I really like this cream so far since I already use acids in my routine as well as moisturizers, this combines them into one hydrating product so I donâ€™t have to layer which sometimes causes me acne.  Recommended but not for sensitive skin, this did leave my skin a little bit tingly since it has 5% actives which is high for a moisturizer. nan
