I’m quite impressed with the benefits this essence booster laid upon my skin. First off it smells like oranges so it’s quite refreshing! The formula is a thick milky consistency that absorbs quickly without an ounce of sticky or tacky aftermath. I noticed instant hydration and glossy/glowy-ness. I also definitely noticed a considerable amount of absorption power when I applied this before the rest of my skincare routine. I’m definitely going to continue using this, even when I just need a pick me up because it’s that wonderful. Fresh Smooth Glowy Start
