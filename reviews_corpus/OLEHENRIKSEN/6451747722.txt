This was gifted by Ole Henrikson in exchange for my honest review. I was super excited to try this after hearing Tati talk so highly of it. I haven’t been using it long, but I do really enjoy this product. Much like everything I’ve tried from the brand. The packaging is nice and the application feels great on my skin! nan
