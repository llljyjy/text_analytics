I am a huge fan of the balm to gel texture/effect of this product. Very thick balm like consistency until you go to apply to the skin. It is such a refreshing feeling. It does seem to have a slight scent but it is very faint and is pretty pleasant. I like it. Since trying this product out, my skin has definitely been more moisturized, glowy, firm and my very minor crows feet wrinkles seem to be less visible to me. Definitely something I’m not mad about. I’ve really enjoyed working this moisturizer into my skin care routine. I really like the nice thick glass jar the product comes in too. It feels hefty and luxurious. I did receive this product for free to test out. Great moisturizer
