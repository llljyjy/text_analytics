I’ve been using this night cream as the final step in my nighttime skincare routine for the past two weeks and I have been loving how dewy and supple my skin is in the morning! My complexion is bouncy and bright, and it is doing wonders for my dry skin. With the temperature dropping, I’ve been worried about my skin getting even drier, but this is my new secret to keep it firm, soft and hydrated. Huge fan, will be getting another! nan
