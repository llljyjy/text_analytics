So I have received this eye cream as a sample product for free from Influenster and it has definitely been one of the best brightening eye cream that I have ever used. It’s lightweight in texture, creamy and of course nourishing, it’s also fragrant free which work perfectly for sensitive skin types. This product not only brightened my under eye but got rid of the darkness and fine lines. It’s work well as a concealer or primer. I’m so in love with this product and will definitely be getting it again. I 100% recommend this product to everyone, trust me you’re gonna love it :) Ole Henriksen Banana Bright + Eye crème
