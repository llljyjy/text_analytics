I’d rate Ole Henriksen’s Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Vitamin C Essence two thumbs up. The ombré frosted glass bottle is sleek & the applicator works great at dispensing the product a few drops at a time since a little goes a long way. The scent is delectable and smells like a refreshing, juicy orange. The essence applies nicely and dries down quickly - it leaves my skin looking brighter and feeling more moisturized and smoother within just a minute or two of application. nan
