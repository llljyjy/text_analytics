I was unsure if it would do anything for me, but boy was I wrong! Within a week the patches of dry skin I had were gone AND my acne/dark spots were clearing up!! I’ve been using it everyday day in the AM and PM as my first step after cleansing. I then follow it up with my everyday retinol serum. I’m 24 for reference and have combination skin. I LOVE this. Your face feels soft after using it, almost like a primer. It dries quickly and has a light orange scent. You only need a small amount and you can use your hands. It is a large bottle so it will last! I know the price isn’t great, but it’s worth it because it does what it promises!! nan
