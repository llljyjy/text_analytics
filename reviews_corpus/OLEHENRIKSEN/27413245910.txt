It’s not what it’s cracked up to be. I’ve tried MANY moisturizers across the board from the lowest end to med high range. For moisturization it’s not amazing, just okay. There may be benefits of long term use but if you have fairly dry skin this won’t be enough on it’s own. It does absorb very well and does not feel oily or heavy, it’s a great day cream in this regard. I used this over night as soon as I got it on one side of my face, noticed no difference at all in any way. A good moisturizer should do just that immediately & it did not. It fully absorbs without moisturizing enough. Plenty of my other products give immediate results & long term. This isn’t a trash product by any means but it’s one I will layer with-likely as a last step because of the dimethicone. I likely won’t repurchase. Over hyped
