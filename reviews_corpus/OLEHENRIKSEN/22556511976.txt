I have dark undereyes and I have been using this for about 3 weeks now every night before bed and I love it. Reasons why....it’s so hydrating! My skin just slumps it up and it feels light yet oily but not gross. It’s just such an amazing consistency. Also it actually works! My undereyes have lightened up and I’m shocked at the results. It’s subtle but still noticeable especially the fact that my mom and sister noticed when I wasn’t wearing makeup how brightened up my undereye got. They even thought it was an amazing concealer but really it’s just amazing skincare! I have come to really like the brand because they have such great products for everything...I totally recommend. Brighten it up
