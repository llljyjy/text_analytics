I received a tiny bottle of this as a sample from my last Sephora order and I think I’m hooked. I don’t use toners because every single one I’ve tried has broken me out. I tend to get my glycolic acid and the like in masks. Now that I’m pregnant I can’t use retinols and my acne scarring is starting to outpace so when I finally had no active outbreaks for a few days I used this. I am extremely sensitive to smells and they can trigger migraines, but I actually found this scent very soothing to fall asleep with. I am being careful to not cause a purge so I am only using 2x a week but so far it feels good when I apply, it isn’t irritating my dry acne-prone skin, and it hasn’t caused a breakout. That’s better than every toner I’ve found yet. Waiting to see dark spot lightening in a couple of weeks but so far so good. If it does I’ll be buying a bottle.
