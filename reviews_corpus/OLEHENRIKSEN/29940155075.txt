Ole Henriksen Workout Moisturizer really helped my skin stay more hydrated when Iâ€™m doing my workout tweet.  After using the cream my skin felt more elastic and less dry.  I really liked the packaging because it is easy to take anywhere and the ingredients help a lot for the purpose for which it is being used.  My skin is firmer and smoother after doing my exercise. nan
