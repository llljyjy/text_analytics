This eye cream is so thick and buttery, it feels so hydrating and luxurious. It leaves a slightly tacky finish that works great as a primer base for concealer and foundation. It wears amazing under makeup! My favorite part of all is that itâ€™s unscented so it works well with my sensitive skin. Time will tell if it improves my fine lines and dark circles, but I like it so far! Loving so far!
