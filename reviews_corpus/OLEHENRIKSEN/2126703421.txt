First I want to talk about how good this smells!!! Ahhh it smells so divine, so citrusy, so fresh! I love putting it on my face because it smells like natural orange scent. This works really good at adding some shine and bounce to your skin. My skin will look dead and once I add this moisture barrier essence it will just bring my skin back to life! A little goes a long way, just tap a few pumps and gently pay your face with it. It works instantly and makes your skin fresh again! Smells amazing!!!!
