Gifted by Ole Henriksen. I’ve been able to use this only a handful of times so I can not speak towards long-term benefits. However, I did notice that my skin felt hydrated upon using it starting the first couple of times- maybe due to the shea butter. I’ve only used it at night time and have enjoyed it so far. nan
