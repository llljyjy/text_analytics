A new favorite unlocked!! This cream is soooo good. I was worried about the acids but it’s surprisingly gentle on my sensitive skin. It smells divine. It’s very light but hydrating. I’ve had no negative reactions at all, and my skin is noticeably brighter and more even looking after I use this at night. Love love love! They did it again!
