I’m a very oily girl but at the moment since adding tretinoin to my life my skin is combo and this works great for my skin. I feel it might work for the summer too. It’s a balm/gel like texture that sinks into the skin easily. Skin feels soft. As far as hydration it’s enough for me, I use it at night after my tretinoin. Someone with dry skin might need something thicker and more hydrating. I haven’t used it long enough to know if it helps with the anti aging part that’s why I only gave 4 stars I enjoy it!
