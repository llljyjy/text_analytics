This firming night cream feels amazing!!!  It is so moisturizing to my skin.  I love wearing it at night because my skin feels so soft in the morning.   My only complaint is the fragrance is very strong.   It smells very sweet almost like a lemon pie.  The cream itself is so good, I just wish it was unscented.  Other than that, this night cream is a keeper and I do really enjoy using it. Wonderful Night Cream
