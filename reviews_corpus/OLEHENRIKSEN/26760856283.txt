I have been using this cream daily in the eye area before applying the concealer for dark circles.  The texture of the cream is pleasant and quickly dissolves the skin without leaving the skin sticky.  I have noticed in these 15 days using the product that my dark circles are less noticeable and clearer.  So far Iâ€™m having a great experience and this product will definitely continue to be part of my skin care routine. It works.
