This essence looks milky in color but the formula is on the super lightweight side. It is hydrating and absorbs nicely. It gives a slight glow to the face but doesn’t leave my combination skin feeling too dewy so it’s fine for me. My current skin concern is dullness overall and of course aging so this product is right up my alley. I use it in conjunction with other Vitamin C products and my skin has been looking less tired. The packaging is heavy and very sturdy but definitely not travel friendly. I have been using essences for about two years now and always get excited to start a new one. I do feel it helps all the products I put over to absorb better too. It does however have a strong citrusy/orange scent to it. If you are sensitive to fragrance keep this in mind. I do enjoy it and really love its benefits so I will be using it up to see if I notice results with continuous use. Refreshing for my dull skin
