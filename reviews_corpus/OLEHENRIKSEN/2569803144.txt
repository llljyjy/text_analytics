The Ole Henrikson Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence comes nicely packaged in a orange frosted glass bottle, which I really like.  Itâ€™s a milky liquid that smells like bright, fresh orange.  I put a few drops of the product into my palms then pat gently on my face after washing, before any other product.  It absorbs quickly without leaving any residue on my skin.  Afterwards my skin feels soft and ready for the rest of my skincare routine.  The scent of this product really wakes me up and gets me feeling ready to take the day on in the mornings!
