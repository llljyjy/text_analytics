I was skeptical before trying this product out because I have combination skin that is acne prone. Some areas of my face are very dry whereas other areas are oily. I wasn’t sure if this moisturizer would be too heavy and cause me to break out. I applied this product to cleansed skin and blended it out. The product blended and absorbed like a dream. The scent was very pleasing as well, it smelled sweet and slightly familiar. The next morning, my skin looked a lot more smooth and radiant. It didn’t break me out at all and was the perfect base for my makeup. Glass skin
