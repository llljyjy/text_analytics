Loving the Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence. I believe vitamin C is good for the skin. Itâ€™s a large bottle that lasts a long time. I apply it in the morning after washing my face and before my moisturizer.  The citrus scent is invigorating. And I appreciate it comes in recyclable packaging. I will keep using it. Great Vitaminc C essence
