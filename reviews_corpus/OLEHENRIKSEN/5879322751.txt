Really great moisturizer for dry skin. I have very dry, acne prone skin and usually takes a couple weeks to see if a product such as moisturizer is working or causes breakouts. I have struggled to find a moisturizer that is hydrating enough without being heavy or leaving my skin greasy. This product does exactly that without causing breakouts. There was a noticeable difference after the second day of use. The texture is great: it’s like a mix between a gel and a cream so it’s quite light but not messy or runny. A bonus is that there is no smell or fragrance. I have never found a holy grail or go to moisturizer until this one. Definitely a staple in my routine. light weight, hydrating, and no fragrance!
