I love this product! I workout a lot and can get breakouts due to excess sweat, this cleanser has kept my skin clean and fresh without over drying. It heats up when you first apply it and has the perfect amount of beads for exfoliation. The cleanser you can feel working deep into your skin and it is an absolute win. I use it about three times a week and have had no issues of dry skin (as mentioned) or breakout from the scrub. Great Scrub That Doesn't Dry Out The Skin
