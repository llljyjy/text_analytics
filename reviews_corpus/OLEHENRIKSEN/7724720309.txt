Been enjoying using this essence in my skincare routine. First it smells so fresh and perfect for your morning skincare routine. My skin gets so dry during cold weather and using this essence helped a lot with hydration. I am a big fan of vitamin C and, this essence has a milky texture and  get absorbed fast without leaving a tacky finish. Highly recommended if you are looking for a new essence to try. OLEHENRIKSEN never disappoint. Love it!
