Already used this for more than 2 weeks and so far it does a good job in moisturizing my under-eyes throughout the whole night. The consistency is also perfect since it’s not too light that you feel like it’s being absorbed too fast and not too thick that it’s not blendable. The only con for now for me is that I don’t really notice the brightening effect as of today but maybe I have to keep using it for a longer period of time. Good eyecream
