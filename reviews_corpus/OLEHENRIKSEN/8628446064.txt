I received this product complimentary, courtesy of Influenster and Ole Henriksen in exchange for my honest review. Ole Henriksen upgraded their Banana Bright Eye Crème to the new and improved Banana Bright+ Vitamin C Eye Crème! I’m in love with this because the formula is now fragrance free, which is amazing for those of us that have sensitive skin. I did not experience any irritations or breakouts while using the eye crème. I’ve been using this product for about a month. HOWEVER, I am a silly goose and forgot to take a photo of my eyes before I began to incorporate the crème into my skincare routine. The eye crème is very lightweight and rich, you only need to use a little bit for total coverage! The Banana Bright+ Vitamin C Eye Crème feels super refreshing, hydrating , and leaves the skin feeling super smooth. It instantly slightly lightened my eye bags when I applied it, and overtime, I feel as though they got a little less poofy. I wouldn’t consider it a drastic change, however, I feel like with continued use, it can make a major difference. nan
