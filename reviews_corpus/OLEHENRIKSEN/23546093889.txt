My one gripe with moisturizer, is leaving behind a tacky residue that sits and collects dirt. I can feel this melting into my skin. You can use a generous amount and still layer makeup without any pilling. Even if I donâ€™t wash my face for 1-2 days my skin never feels as tight & dry like it used to in the mornings. 100% hydration Zero residue
