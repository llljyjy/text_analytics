I replaced my usual eye cream for two weeks to give this a try morning and night. It was comparable to other top notch eye creams that I have been using. It truly gave a brighter appearance to my eyes and had my undereyes looking more youthful. I also like that it is a clean and cruelty-free product. The product is very absorbent and non-greasy.  I would purchase this product and recommend to others. Truly a brightening eye cream
