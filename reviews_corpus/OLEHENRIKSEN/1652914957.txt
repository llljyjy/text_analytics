I am really happy with this moisturizer.  I was looking for something a little heavier for the cooler months to keep hydrated.  This fits the bill.  Has a nice rich texture but does not make my face oily.  A little goes a long way as well.  Just need a tiny plait to cover my face and neck.  It has a really pleasant and light sugared lemon scent.  It wears very well under makeup.  My skin feels more hydrated and plump and I will be repurchasing this product. Great hydration!
