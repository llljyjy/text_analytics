I love this moisturizer. It’s definitely a new staple in my skincare especially for this winter. My skin always gets really dry but I can’t use anything too oily. This moisturizer leaves my skin super soft and hydrated all day long. It isn’t too thick and it spreads very easily. I’ve used it under makeup with no primer and my makeup stays, doesn’t seperate or anything. nan
