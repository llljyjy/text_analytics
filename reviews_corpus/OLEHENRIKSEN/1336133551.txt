This Ole Henrikson Orange Ferment Essence I received free for my review is incredible. Not only does It smell great, but it is super moisturizing and  has started brightening my skin. I truly look forward to using this every day before the rest of my skin care products because it smells so good and even looks good on my dresser because the bottle is pretty . A little bit goes a LONG way as I learned the first time I used it. This will continue to be a staple in my skincare routine. smells great works great
