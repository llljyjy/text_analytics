Physical exfoliation is not for everyone, but I just find this one does the job so much better than the chemical exfoliators I’ve tried. It is pretty gentle for a scrub (similar to the Kate Somerville Exfolikate in terms of texture) and the smell is so lovely too. I use it 1-2 times a week at night and follow it with a hydrating oil. I wake up with the most soft, glowy skin in the morning. I’ll definitely continue purchasing this and unless you struggle with really sensitive skin, I’d recommend it! nan
