If you enjoy night creams that do a little extra, then you’ll like Dewtopia. It has a creamy texture and smells like a lemon dessert. I’ve used it for about two weeks and but I’ve noticed that my skin is hydrated in the morning and it’s soft. The AHAs in the formula didn’t sting my face and it plays well with the other products in my night routine. It’s too early to see any firming benefits, but the shea butter in the ingredients is definitely keeping my skin moisturized. Looking forward to using it long term to see what it can do over time. Glad this was gifted by Ole Henriksen because I haven’t tried their products before and it was a nice experience. Creamy & dreamy
