Been using this moisturizer everyday for the last month and I love it so far! I use this moisturizer in my morning and nighttime routine. It’s the perfect consistency for a moisturizer and applies smoothly. It doesn’t leave my skin oily or sticky. It hydrates my skin and stays all day and all night. My skin looks amazing after one month of use. My skin looks healthier and softer. I’m loving the results. A good moisturizer
