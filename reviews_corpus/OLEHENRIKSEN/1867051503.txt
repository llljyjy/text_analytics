As an avid user of OH and their Dewtopia serum, I was at first a bit hesitant to use this product- however, I learned that not only was it compatible with their serum, I found that this was amazing to use on the daily. Living in an area now with constant sunshine and UV rays attacking me. I have come to the conclusion this helps maintain my skin’s even tone and texture and helps keeping me look like I’m in my late 20ms (mid 30’s here). I definitely recommend this if you want gentle exfoliation on the daily that will help you achieve a healthy skin glow! Overnight Glow!
