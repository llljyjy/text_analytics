I took my time before posting a review to make sure I liked this product and I am officially obsessed!!!!!!! It’s the best cleanser I have ever used and my skin has never felt better. Don’t let the other reviews about the smell scare you off from this product I don’t think it has a strong smell, just a fresh and clean scent. Will never switch from using this cleanser!!! best cleanser out there
