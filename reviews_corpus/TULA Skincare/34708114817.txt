I received this product as part of a VoxBox from Influenster and had my wife try it for about 3 weeks. She usually uses an Aveeno Day cream and an Aveeno night cream and that was her current point of comparison. She found the cream light, effective and easily absorbed. It helped keep her skin feel hydrated and supple through out the day and night. Going out in the cold brisk wind also wasn’t a problem as the wind could be drying. The only comment she had was that she missed the SPF that the Aveeno cream had however for the winter months it wasn’t going to be as big of a concern. With regards to value for the product it is a bit pricey but this one product is doing the work of a few other products. Great light weight effective cream
