I received this product to try it, it was very necessary for this product in my life, since I have a lot of dark circles under my eyes, I have to say that the product leaves a cold, refreshing sensation, I have noticed that the skin around my eyes is more hydrated, the color I still feel the same about the dark circles, but Iâ€™ve only used the product for a week, I hope that in addition to moisturizing and refreshing, over time I managed to lighten my dark circles. Easy to use
