I have dry skin with a few dark sun spots. I really liked the citrusy scent of this product, it reminded me of orange creamy ice cream. The dispenser of the packaging made it easy choose how much product to put on my face. It did go well on my skin without being sticky or overwhelming, nicely absorbed. As for my dark spots, after using this moisturizer night and day, I did notice my spots become lighter after a couple of weeks. I do like the Tula skincare line as I also currently use their serum and eye balm. Consistently it’s a nice balance of natural ingredients with luxe packaging and quality.I would recommend this to those looking to add a clean beauty moisturizer to their skincare routine. Though I personally like this yuzu citrus scent, if you’re into clean beauty products with no to neutral scents, this won’t be for you. If you’re able to, it would be a good idea to head into a Sephora location to test the scent and product out in person. Citrusy fun
