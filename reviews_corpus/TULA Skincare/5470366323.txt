I’ve been using this eye cream for about 3 weeks, and I really like it. My under eyes are dry and this has worked very well for me. I wake up without puffiness, and well moisturized. I’ve even started seeing a slight decrease in darkness. Fingers crossed it keeps working. So far, I’m loving it and will most likely repurchase. Oh! And I love the packaging. It dispenses a small amount at a time. Great for dry under eyes
