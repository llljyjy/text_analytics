This moisturizer works well and smells great. My dry, fair skin feels nourished for sure!  The smell is light and citrusy! My only complaints are that it goes on feeling very thick. I would apply it well before any other products, it takes a while to absorb. The pump on the bottle also makes it hard to regulate the amount of product you get. Good, but not an everyday product for me
