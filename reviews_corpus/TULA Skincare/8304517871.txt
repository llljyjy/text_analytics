The scrub did a nice job of cleansing my face. The sugar in it makes you feel like you are scrubbing out any impurities. I did find that it dissolved quickly once I started to rub it around. It would have been nice if wasnâ€™t so quick to dissolve. Overall it left my skin feeling clean and fresh. Clean and fresh
