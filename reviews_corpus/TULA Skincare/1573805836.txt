I have been using this sunscreen off and on for awhile now. My favorite things about this is that for me it is lightweight and non greasy, which is great because I am very oily. It also doesnâ€™t irritate my eyes like most others do. The texture is gel-like and the scent has a pineapple smell that to me is not overpowering. It also gives a hint of glow. Sometimes I notice slight pilling when I use it but nothing too crazy. Overall I like this product and recommend trying it. nan
