Really excited to receive this product to test out ! Not enough thickness to be used in canadien winters but I think this would be great in the summer months ! The smell is a little off but it’s not that bad, the colouring of the product I wish It was white but it’s a yellowish tone which is not something I’m used to ! However the thing I like the most is the dispenser! Makes it so easy to just pump out the amount you want. nan
