I was given this product in exchange for an honest review.  To be blunt, I found the product to be fantastic.  It was marketed as non greasy but hydrating and that’s exactly what I got.  I felt like I noticed a difference the first time I applied it.   There’s no sunscreen in it so be prepared for that when you apply it in the morning.   There’s also a subtle scent of watermelon.  I personally loved the scent but if you aren’t a fan of scents, this may not be the product for you. All in all, I highly recommend this product. Deeply Hydrating Without The Heavy Grease
