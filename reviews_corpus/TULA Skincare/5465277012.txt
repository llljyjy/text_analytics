I was really looking forward to receiving this product. I liked the wrinkle treatment drops as it did not irritate my skin. I wanted to like the eye serum however, it did irritate my eye making it dry and red. The face moisturizer was decent but I would rather stick with my other products. Lastly, the overnight treatment worked well for my skin. I used up the product fast because I like to slug products on my face during bedtime. nan
