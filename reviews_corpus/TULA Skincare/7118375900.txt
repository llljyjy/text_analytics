I personally love how easy this product is to use! I have combination skin and it doesn’t feel sticky or greasy at all during application. It’s silky smooth and glides on- plus it makes for the perfect base when applying under-eye concealer. The twist up packaging is perfect and it’s great for travel. All around, great product! A must-have skincare product!
