I’ve never used an eye balm or cream before so I wasn’t sure what to expect. It went on so smoothly and I definitely could feel the cooling effect. I love the packaging and how easily it rolls up like a chap stick. It had a nice light shimmer and after a while it was less shimmery and  definitely brightened  my under eye. I’m not sure how often I will use this but I think it will be a new favourite in my collection. nan
