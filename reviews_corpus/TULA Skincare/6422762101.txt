I really enjoy this sunscreen and I’m actually motivated to use it: it has a pleasant texture that blends very nicely and gives a beautiful glow. It’s pretty lightweight however enough for me to use it instead of moisturizer in the morning. My skin didn’t break out from it and wasn’t congested (which is a huge win for me) and I love the good ingredients this sunscreen has❤️Be mindful that it can pill a bit if you rub it too hard and/or apply something on top too soon, so it’s best to leave it to dry and then go over if you want to use makeup. Overall, I’d recommend it if you’re looking for good simple sunscreen!I’ve received this product complementary for testing purposes. Great sunscreen for everyday use
