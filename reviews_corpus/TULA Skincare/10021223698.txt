I received this product free to review from Influenster. This is the perfect little to-go pamper kit. I use this while camping & I feel so glam! The cleanser is silky, the scrub smells SO good and definitely helps my dull skin, the vitamin C serum does sting a little but really brightens, and the moisturizer is the cherry on top. I’m not huge on the smell of it though, it’s a little like roses maybe? But the performance is well worth it. Perfect To-go kit!
