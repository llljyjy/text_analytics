This product has no scent and is super gentle. It glides on easily with zero tugging and does not bother my eyes. It really does have a cooling feeling, and I notice the hydration. Feels good under  foundation or concealer . The only thing I don’t like  is it has a pretty stubby, chunky tip. I think application might be a touch easier with something just a bit thinner. But overall it’s a decent product #tula #influenster
