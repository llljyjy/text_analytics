The only reason this girly is getting a four star review is because I wish she was a little smaller! Like the amount of product is fabulous and I love that its in stick formâ€¦ BUT- it is a little large/wide to get under the inner corners of my eye (by my nose bridge) annnd its not really something you can rub onto your finger to transfer. Otherwise this girl is MAGIC!! I stopped wearing foundation every day so a concealer feels a bit odd, but this? Brightens the perfect amount! Would and have already recommended! Love this product!
