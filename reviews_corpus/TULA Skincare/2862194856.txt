I’d been wanting to try TULA products for a while, and finally got to try this tinted sunscreen. At first I was surprised how orange it looked, but it looked natural once applied. It’s nice and lightweight, and most importantly, didn’t break me out! The size is also great for traveling, and I took it with me on a little beachside weekend trip recently. I definitely recommend this product! Lightweight and portable
