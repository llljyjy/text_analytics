This night cream has a great consistency and is very hydrating which I love. I I usually use it to lock in my other products at the end of my night routine. I haven’t noticed anything life changing with it yet but I appreciate it’s moisture capacity. I think I need more time with it to really see a difference. I’m not sure I agree with the smell others have described. I appreciate that it has no added fragrance! Moisture locking
