So as far as serums go, this wasn’t my favourite. I’d consider it more of a moisturizer. It absorbed fairly quickly but still gave me that “upper sweaty lip” like it was blocking my skin from breathing a bit. It has a light floral scent. I did like the pearlescent effect it gave, if was definitely Illumnating like the name implied. I haven’t noticed a big different on dark spots or evening out pigmentation. My skin is definitely more hydrated, but not exactly what I’m looking for in a serum. Sorry for the goofy picture but I took it and really noticed the pearlescent effect! Just ok- more of a moisturizer
