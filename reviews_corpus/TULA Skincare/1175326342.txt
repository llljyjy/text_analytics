Iâ€™ve been using the sensitive skin drops for 3 months now and really love it. I use it twice a day- under my makeup and again at night- and my skin has never felt better. With long-term usage, my skin tone has evened and the redness in my cheeks has decreased. The serum itself feels a little like I imagine a snail would feel, but it dries down to a soft, smooth consistency. Great purchase. New twice a day routine
