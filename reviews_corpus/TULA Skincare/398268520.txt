I was interested in this moisturizer because of the probiotics. After using it for a little over a month, my skin hates it.  I broke out a couple of times, my face also felt tight and super dehydrated.  The fragrance was overwhelming and after using it for 3 weeks, I felt a slightly burning sensation whenever I put it on.  At the end my skin did not feel hydrated or soft when I was using it.  Definitely not worth it. nan
