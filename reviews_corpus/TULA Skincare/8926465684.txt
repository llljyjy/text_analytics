*I received this free from Influenster for my honest review *This cream is supposed to be plumping and hydrating,  formulated without fragrance and quick absorbing. The first thing I noticed about this product is a bubble gum like smell. I’m not sure why it strongly smells like this because it’s to be fragrance free. I honestly don’t find this to be fast absorbing. If I put on a bit too much it leaves a white cast from the excess cream, whereas my experience with other creams was better as far as absorption. I don’t quite find this to be too moisturizing for my dry skin type, nor do I feel that the moisture lasts throughout the day like other creams. The packaging is great as it’s a pump dispenser and you don’t have to touch the rest of the cream. The ingredients in this sound good, it just didn’t work for my skin type. I will finish up this bottle but won’t be purchasing this Tula product in particular. It's okay
