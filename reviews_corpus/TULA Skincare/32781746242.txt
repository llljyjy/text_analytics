I got to try this hydrating eye balm for free in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks and yes it definitely hydrates the eye area, and has no scent that I noticed so should be good for those with sensitive skin. 4 stars because it for sure hydrated which in turn should translate to some fine line help but took a star off as I didn’t think it did anything for the bags under my eyes. Puffiness and darkness only seemed to change based on actual sleep. I am a mom of 3 little ones so I think that is part of the issue. If I had just a  rough night here and there instead of nightly bed sharing with what might as well be a wild octopus or 3 I might have different results. I would say for daytime wear it’s best to wear under make up maybe not nude skin. It has a shine to it when you put it on. So easy to apply. Overall I am happy with it and recommend. nan
