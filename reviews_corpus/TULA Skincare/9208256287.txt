It felt nice going on and I liked the subtle shimmer and the cooling effect. Unfortunately after several hours I had a reaction to one of the ingredients and broke out around my eyes :( I don’t have a lot of allergies or very sensitive skin so I’m not sure what happened with that. Fun cooling effect
