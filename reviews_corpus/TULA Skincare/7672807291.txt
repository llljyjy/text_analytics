Love the smell of the mask and the packaging. I use this product about once a week to help create smooth and clear skin. I have found that the first few times using this mask I couldnâ€™t leave it on for the full 10 minutes as recommended as the tingling was a bit irritating. After the first few times the sensation has subsided. A great mask
