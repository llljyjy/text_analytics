This product is great for de-puffing the undereye in the morning or in hot climates. It feels nice and cooling, glides right on and I can even use it as an eye cream on hot humid days. The ingredients are good, and it is cruelty-free, which is very important to me!!! :) My boyfriend enjoys it too. Very nice !
