Got this to try from Influenster.  The texture of the cream is nice and smooth, non-greasy, and not suffocating. The scent isn’t overwhelming and I got used to it after about a week.  After 3 weeks of am and pm use, I didn’t find that my fine lines were any lighter.  Dark circles didn’t seem to have some improvement.  Firmness and texture around my eyes remained the same.  I  did start getting a white head under my left eye after about the 2nd week.  Overall, I would say this is a good everyday cream but the Revive + Rewind slogan is a bit overselling it. Good day and night eye cream overall
