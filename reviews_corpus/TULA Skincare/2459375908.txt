This vitamin C moisturizer helps give a nice glow in the morning, I’ve really come to see a difference in my complexion. I have combination skin, with this product i didn’t notice more oily spots it did a good job of oil control. I never use probiotic in skincare before… the ingredient list is pretty long not sure what to make of it…My skin is more vibrant and more awake. I use it on the morning under my makeup and also on days where im makeup free to give my a nice glow.  I like the packaging the bottle is a pump system so just a little push for the moisturizer to come out. The bottle is a bit bulky i hope they have a smaller travel version. I will be continuing to use this product in my routine gladIy. i would recommend this product! #gotitforfree nan
