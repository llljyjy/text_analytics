So I’m the kind of person that thinks everyone looks better with a tan, but I still protect my face and chest from the sun everyday. And I’m a tennis junkie. So I’m always out soaking in the vitamin D. I tried Tula protect and glow sunscreen on my chest for the very first time today and I absolutely adore it!  The gel formula absorbed easily into my skin and it left behind that “glow” look without being over the top or unnatural. And most importantly it protected me from getting sun on my chest while playing tennis today. I didn’t pay for all those IPL treatments for nothing! Get Your Gel on
