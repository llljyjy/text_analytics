I’ve been using the brightening moisturizer for a couple of weeks and so far I’ve been enjoying it. It had a light yuzu/ mandarin smell that is refreshing without being overpowering.I use it after I apply my serum and it leaves a nice layer on top of my skin. It doesn’t feel sticky or heavy on my face. It has made my skin moisturizer throughout the day. I appreciate that there are antioxidants to protect my skin from pollutants! I love that this brand is a woman owned company. Girl power! Light weight moisturizer that doesn’t feel sticky
