I have sensitive, dry skin and this has really helped with the dullness on my face and neck. No reaction to it at all and it has a nice light sent. The pump on this product really shoots out a lot of product and a little goes a long way so Iâ€™d really push lightly on the pump to get less product. My skin feels rejuvenated and hydrated all day when I wear this and I will definitely keep it in my skincare routine to really take advantage of the vitamin C long term effects. I would recommend this to others but Tula is a little pricey. this stuff rocks
