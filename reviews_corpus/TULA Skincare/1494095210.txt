I enjoyed this mask! I can sometimes be pretty sensitive to glycolic acid, so I was a little bit hesitant. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I didn’t experience any irritation. My skin was glowy and smooth and I didn’t feel any tightness. That being said, it wasn’t mind-blowing. The effect wasn’t particularly long-term. Happy to keep using it though! nan
