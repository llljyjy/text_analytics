I enjoyed using the Tula protect and glow sunscreen. The sunscreen has a sparkle/ highlighter added to give your skin a shining glow. The 30 spf seemed to work well when I was out for about 2 hours in the midday sun here in Texas…. Which considering I have fair skin is pretty good. The only thing I would change is that it definitely had a “sunscreen smell” Good sunscreen for midday sun
