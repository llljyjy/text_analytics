The cooling effect with this product is the best! Love how it feels but I agree with other reviews that it has a shimmer which I was unaware of when I bought it. I use it in the mornings because I work from home and it’s nice to wake up a little but I probably wouldn’t wear it over makeup because of the shimmer. Also looks kinda blue on your skin if you use it multiple times during the day. Love the cooling effect but shimmery
