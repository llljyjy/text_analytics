I really love this exfoliator! It has a fresh fruity raspberry smell and it’s pretty gentle on my skin. I’m currently using the vino pure line from caudalie and this was a perfect addition to my skin care routine. I use it every 2-3 days. I noticed that my skin feels super soft after using it and it doesn’t dry out my skin like others that I’ve tried. It’s a super light texture but it still gets the job done without being harsh on my skin. I think it it a great addition to what I’m already using and I would buy it in the future gentle on skin and smells amazing
