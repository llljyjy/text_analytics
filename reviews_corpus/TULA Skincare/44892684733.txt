I received this as a free product to sample.  I was pleasantly surprised at how it kept my skin hydrated throughout the day.  I have sensitive skin and the winter is the worst for dryness.  Tula 24-7 did not disappoint.  My skin stayed hydrated and glowing all day.  I didnâ€™t experience any drying out even with the negative temperatures in my area. A must have for sensitive dry skin
