I like this product and the ingredients that it has. It is easy to apply and non-greasy it also soaks in very quickly. I did not notice any major changes to my skin but I already use products like this and retinol so that may be the reason why. I did not cause any kind of reaction and I think that it helped keep my skin more moisturized in combination with the Tula moisturizer: I would recommend this product as a beginning product for this type of skin care before moving on to more concentrated ones or ones with retinol. Good for sensitive skin
