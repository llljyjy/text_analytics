I don’t love this eye cream. When I first started using it, I got zits around my eyes, which has never happened to me. That stopped after a few weeks of use. This cream also feels like it just sits on your skin. You have to wait at least an hour to put makeup on or it pills (sometimes that’s not even long enough). I found that my dark circles came back when I felt like I had them under control prior to starting this eye cream. Sad but true, Olay collagen peptide eye cream is much better. This cream is probably more suitable for a young person simply looking for moisture and nothing else (for reference I’m 30 and don’t really have wrinkles around my eyes). meh
