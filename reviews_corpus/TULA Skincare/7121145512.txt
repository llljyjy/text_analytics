I received these products for free from Influenster and brand(s) in exchange for my honest review. It was so refreshing. The applicator is pretty cool too - silver metal tip, nice and cool under eyes without having to refrigerate. Unlike other eye serums, it isn’t heavy or thick, feels better. Love it so far! Waiting to see if I’ll see a huge difference in dark eye circles, been using it for a week and so far it’s a  bit lighter! They say difference will show after using a month consistently 2x a day. There’s no scent to the cream, good for sensitive skin! Nice cooling applicator
