This was a pretty nice scrub. I enjoyed how gentle the exfoliation felt while still doing it’s job, although sometimes I had to use a little more product because the sugar seemed to dissolve really quickly. I really love the scent of this scrub too since it’s not anything too crazy. Another complaint I have is the price point for it. It’s a nice scrub but if I hadn’t gotten this to test, I probably wouldn’t have bought it. nan
