I’m loving this. I wouldn’t say it does much for dark circles but it’s tightening and hydrating and does give a glowy look. If you’re planning to wear it under makeup you need to give it a lot of time to dry down, and expect the tingly/cooling feeling to stick around, it doesn’t really die off. new obsession for morning
