I tried the Tula purifying and pH balancing toner pads and found them to work pretty good for my skin plus there is a small scent which is not overpowering. I found after using the pads that was skin was noticably brighter and less greasy looking. I feel like my skin felt better and tighter. I like the pads better than a liquid toner because it was so simple and easy to apply. I liked the container and how easy it was to open. Easy to Apply
