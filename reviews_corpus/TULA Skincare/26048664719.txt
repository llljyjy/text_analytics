I received this product for free from Influenster for my honest review. I have a combination skin, which always feels dry. This moisturizer has thick oily texture and a very handy dispenser for hygienic use of the product. One or two pumps are enough for my whole face, this is a very economical expense. Iâ€™ve been testing this moisturizer for 1 week and did not have any allergy reaction (sometimes I have it). I was scared about the texture, as I prefer light gel texture. When I apply the moisturizer, I can really feel it on my face and it seems sticky. But after few minutes it absorbes and gives a light moisturized finish. I often feel this effect only for 1-2 hours, but this TULA moisturizer keeps my skin hydrated for 5-7 hours. The citrus smell is very light. Overall, I really enjoy using this product! Feels sticky at first
