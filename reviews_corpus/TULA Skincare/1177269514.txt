I wasn’t sure how I would feel about this product but I was beyond pleasantly surprised! I am a mom of 2 - one being 10 months old so I get very little asleep! This balm helps me to feel rejuvenated after a rough night. I love using it after my skin care routine on a fresh face but love even more using it under my makeup. I can’t believe how smooth my concealer is and sets even after using this balm! Pleasantly Surprised!
