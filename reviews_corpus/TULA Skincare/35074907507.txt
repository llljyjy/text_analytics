I received this product as a free sample from influenster and Tula in exchange for my honest review. I literally need this product as my under eye skin area is so dry and my eyes look tired due to lack of sleep sometimes so I feel I need more moisture and a good care of my eyes.I started using this Tula day & night eye balm and am really loving it. I see a huge difference in my under eye puffiness. I have never seen such quick results in a product. I am amazed by this product. Over the years I have tried to many eye cream treatments always with no to little results. I can’t believe I finally found a product that really works. This is a must have!I use the product every day & night and the skin around my eyes just looks generally healthier and happier.This Tula 24-7 Power Swipe Hydrating Day & Night Treatment Eye Balm is everything you want for eye care, with all of the ingredients such as squalane, caffeine, apple & watermelon to hydrate, firm & improve the look of eye puffiness—& cocoa seed extracts to provide antioxidant protection. It’s clinically proven to lock in moisture, this dermatologist tested, creamy formula helps deeply hydrate and improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around the delicate eye area and offers bluelight, pollution, and antioxidant protection.Hence, I highly recommend this Eye Balm. It keeps my under eye skin youthful! Influenster introduced Tula skincare to my routine and I am so grateful to have it. Best Eye Balm
