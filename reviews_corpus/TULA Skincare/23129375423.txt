I love all the products in here! I have never used Tula before, but tried it out this week and have not been disappointed! I am 8 months pregnant and have experienced some hormonal acne and dull skin. The cleanser is gentle, the brightening treatment is fantastic, and the moisturizer hydrated my skin without being oily or greasy! Love this kit and highly recommend! nan
