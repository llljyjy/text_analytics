An employee recommended this to me as a good hydrating, priming eye balm and I love it! It’s so easy to apply as a balm, it feels great on the skin, and I’m already seeing results after a few days of use. I rub my eyes a lot so I had small dry patches in the outer corners and some under eye lines, but the patches are completely gone and the lines look so much better after using this. nan
