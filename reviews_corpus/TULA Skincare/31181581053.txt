After using this product just after a few days it help relieve my dry skin. It is a nice rich but not too thick lotion. It goes on very nicely and soaks in pretty good, you have to rub it in for sure. I use it in my morning and night routine because it helps my face from getting dry and it makes it feel so refreshed! I love the small scent of it also. And it works great for applying make up afterwards. A must have in my routine!
