I have been using Tula for quite a while as a brand and love everything I have tried and this serum is no exception, it has a light feel on the skin and doesnâ€™t feel heavy or sticky once applied. This serum has a very faint scent which I find refreshing, I love the way my skin feels after applying and I would highly recommend to everyone! It has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine for sure! New favourite serum!
