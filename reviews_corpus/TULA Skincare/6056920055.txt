I received this as trial for a fair review from influenster. I can’t say this serum really did much for me. I didn’t notice brighter looking skin, even skin tone or reduction in dark spots. I did however like that it wasn’t oily and there was a very potent sent. I would say it isn’t worth the money. Not worth it
