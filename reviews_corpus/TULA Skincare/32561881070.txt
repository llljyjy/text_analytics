I really enjoyed this product. I’ve had it for a couple weeks now and I’ve noticed my eyes a bit less puffy. It feels so nice to put in right before I go to bed and it’s still hydrated in the morning. It’s very light weight with no smell. I wouldn’t wear it before applying makeup. Best product to be apart of your bedtime routine. Love this product
