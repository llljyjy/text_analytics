I received this product for free for my honest opinion. I’ve used it nightly a few weeks now. The packaging is pretty, the product is easy to use. However sometimes when I first apply it I did feel a little tugging on the skin. If I pat it in with my finger, the balm glides smoothly. The balm is hydrating around my eyes. It looked a little greasy, hence why I preferred it at night. It’s non irritating and It did not have a scent. I did not notice any change with winkles. This product is great if you’re looking for something to hydrate around your eyes.#freeproduct #influenster Hydrating
