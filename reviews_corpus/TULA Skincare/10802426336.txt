I was gifted this by influenster for an honest review. My mom loves Tula, so when I found out I was receiving one of their products, I was so excited! It’s extremely hydrating, especially during these cold wintery dry months! It’s so thick and creamy, a little bit goes a long way! I didn’t really ever notice a scent to it, so that’s nice that’s it’s not very perfumey! Love this, definitely recommend and may need to buy myself more when I run out! nan
