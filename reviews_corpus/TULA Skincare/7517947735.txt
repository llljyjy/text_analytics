First of all it does its job protecting your skin from sun damage, this sunscreen does not leave a white cast and absorbs really quickly even from my oily skin! Smell is very subtle, doesnâ€™t bother me at all. It gives beautiful glow and works well under makeup and just by itself! great for everyday use
