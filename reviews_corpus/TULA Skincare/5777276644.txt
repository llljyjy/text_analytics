Let’s start with the pros:Love the pump, you can easily control how much product you use and it stays nice and clean. The product has a nice light scent that is not bothersome at all and goes away quickly. It feels nice and rich on the skin. Probably my favourite thing about the product is the finish. So many times when you see “illuminating“ on the product you end up looking like a 4 year old trying to be a unicorn with a face full of sparkles. Personally not a fan of that look. But this leaves a nice healthy looking glow with no sparkles! My guy even used it and didn’t notice the “illumination“.Here are the cons:It does not play well with others. It would make my makeup go on chunky, kinda little rolls while I was smoothing it out. Gross. I also felt like it was making me feel greasy by the end of the day. I have fairly normal skin that is not usually greasy. It’s pretty pricy for something I can only wear when I’m not wearing makeup.Overall I would not purchase this with my own money even thought I liked the look of the finish. I love other Tula products, this one was just not for me. Does not play nice
