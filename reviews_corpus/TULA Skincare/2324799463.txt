I received this moisturizer from Influenster. I’ve been loving it. I love the pump, I love the creaminess, and I love the smell. A few other reviews said the smell was overpowering, but I don’t agree. I’m sensitive to smells and this was lovely. I found my skin feeling softer, but I would Agree that I did find myself reapplying it. Unless I layered it with my serums. Delicious smell
