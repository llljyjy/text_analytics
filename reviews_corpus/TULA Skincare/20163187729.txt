Product is okay, did not wow me, not worth the price tag in my opinion. It has a nice cooling effect which I liked and you feel instantly once applied. It leaves a shimmer on the skin which I wasn’t a huge fan of when applying under the eye. My under eyes are very dry in the winter so if you’re looking for hydration this is not the product for that. I think I will enjoy this more in the summer time as a cooling pick me up. nan
