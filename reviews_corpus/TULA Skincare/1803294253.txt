This cleanser does do a great job at gently cleaning my face, and it didn’t make my skin dry out at all! I found it very refreshing, and it removes all of my makeup with no issue. If you’re sensitive to scents this does have a very strong scent. I love that the ingredients include probiotics and prebiotics, it’s great for your skin! nan
