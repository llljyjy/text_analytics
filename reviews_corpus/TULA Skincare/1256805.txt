I liked that this product absorbed quickly into my skin and had a nice feel and wasn’t greasy. The texture however was off putting and clumpy out of the tube even after squeezing it as directed. There was barely any scent and it wasn’t a typical sunscreen scent which I despise so I really appreciated. However the glow was too much for me. It’s not a glow to me it’s just straight up shimmer and even with foundation on over it it’s too much and not flattering on my oily skin. If this product came without the shimmer I would buy it but I wouldn’t repurchase this as it’s way over the top and makes you look like a shimmery glazed donut. nan
