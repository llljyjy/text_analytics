I did really enjoy this product. It smells good. Spreads well. Leaves my skin feeling hydrated. I did receive this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I do think that it is probably overpriced for what youâ€™re getting. And that would be my only real negative. I definitely would not have expected it to be a $70 cream. Maybe $30. I have dry skin, no issues. Over priced but good product
