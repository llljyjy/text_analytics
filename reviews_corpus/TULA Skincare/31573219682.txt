I received this product from #Influenster and #TULA in exchange for my honest review. Well, the product seems very practical to me to take them anywhere, what I really like is that they remove all the dirt from the face and at the same time it helps with the ph, I notice that because my skin is oily in some areas and I suffer from a little acne and blackheads in the nose area and these purifying towels have helped me to significantly reduce the problem, when using the purifying towel I feel my skin is truly clean and purified, the only thing that I donâ€™t like very much is that the toner is a bit greasy but minute my skin absorbed it. Honestly it is a good product although the price is high but it helps a lot for sensitive skin and it is worth the investment. Good
