I recieved this Tula Skincare 24/7 Moisture Intense Ultra Hydrating Day & Night Cream, complimentary from Influenster & Tula Skincare in exchange for my honest review. I have been applying it both, morning and night. When first applying it, I noticed the texture is unique compared to other day & night facial creams I have used prior. The texture is thick and rich, but not greasy or sticky. It glides smoothly across my skin and my skin drinks it up, while it absorbs nicely and evenly. It’s lightweight, a small amount goes a long ways, and my skin feels velvety soft, smooth, and moisturizing after each use! It smells pleasant with a subtle fuity scent that’s not overpowering. However, if you’re sensitive to scents, it might not be the right product for you. I haven’t had any problems with irritation to my slightly sensitive skin. I have noticed a positive difference in my skin since using this product! I really appreciate that it is cruelty-free, has healthy ingredients such as, hyaluronic acid, squalane, and collagen, and free of harsh chemicals. It also contains peptides for anti aging to help smooth the look of fine lines & wrinkles. It has been highly effective for my dry, flaky skin and I would recommend it to others. Perfect Cream For Healthy & Hydrated Skin!
