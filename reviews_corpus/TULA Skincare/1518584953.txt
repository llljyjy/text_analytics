This eyebalm is lightweight, nicely hydrates my eyes and glides on so easily. It doesn’t pull or leave any excess residue on my eyes. I love the cooling effect, especially in the morning when my eyes get puffy. The fact that it is a stick, it saved the mess from dipping your fingers into a pot. It’s perfect on the go or if you need a quick refresh in the middle of the day. I wish it was a little more hydrating so I will keep my regular eye cream at night but this is perfect in then morning under makeup. Would definitely recommend this for folks that are busy or even makeup artists Great for on the go
