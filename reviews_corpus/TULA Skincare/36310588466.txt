While getting ready for work in the morning, I always use a deep cleaning face wash for a complete clean-up. Even though after applying a hydrating moisturiser after the clean-up, my face usually turn dry after 2-3 hours. So I decided to add probiotics in my face cleaning morning routine. I started using Tula pro-biotic exfoliating sugar scrub to enrich my skin and retain the nourishment. Itâ€™s been 2 weeks and the natural sheer effect is just unbelievable. This sugar scrub melts on your skin within seconds and the enzymes from Papaya and Pineapple, makes your skin refreshing and soft. I let my face air-dry after the wash and use my same hydrating moisturiser. My face stays moist, soft and lovely until my next wash the next day. Another best part about this product is the cool and fruity aroma. The fragrance works better than my coffee and drains out the last minute sleepy drowsiness after the morning face wash. I love this product and definitely buying it again! Best Morning Face Scrub for Normal skin!
