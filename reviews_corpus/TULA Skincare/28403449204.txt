If you like using vitamin C serum, then you will probably be impressed by this one. It is a potent formula with 10 percent triple vitamin C complex so I would recommend to start by using it alternate days and slowly build up to daily usage. I have pretty resilient skin and I have been using Vitamin C in the morning daily for a few years now so I was able to use it without any irritation. I do wait to put this on dry face though otherwise I can feel a bit of sting so I know it is definitely strong.It has a lightweight slightly jelly like texture and it absorbs quickly without any sticky feeling. It doesn’t have any added fragrance or color. I love the pump dropper and the aesthetics of this bottle as well. I haven’t seen any dramatic results because I already use quite a few actives daily and my skin is in a fairly healthy state but I can say that it does provide hydration and helps with dullness overall.My only concern is that it is a bit pricey but since I only use 2-3 drops in the morning, i am sure it will last me more than a couple months at least. Beautiful and effective
