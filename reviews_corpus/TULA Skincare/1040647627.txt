I received this product free in exchange for a review.I was very pleasantly surprised by this face cream. I have dry, sensitive skin, especially in the winter months. This cream did not look very thick when I first opened it, and I did not have high hopes. On application, I realized it was actually quite moisturizing and creamy feeling. I wore it alone and under make up several times with no issues.The reason I took off one star is the scent. I usually completely avoid scents in moisturizers, and this one smelled a little old-ladyish? I didnâ€™t enjoy the scent and I feel it would be a better product if it were completely unscented. Very moisturizing
