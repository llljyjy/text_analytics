This consistency is definitely different than your usual sunscreen! It has all the good moisturizing ingredients that leaves you with a healthy glow. I have combo skin so I like to finish it off with setting powder so I don’t look greasy. It does have a sunscreen scent but it goes away quickly! There’s no white cast at all. Super moisturizing!
