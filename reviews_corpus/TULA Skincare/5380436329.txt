I received this in my monthly Allure Beauty Box and I used it last night for the first time. First thing I noticed was the amazing smell. The polish does dissolve quickly, and because of that is the reason I gave it 4 stars. It does work good but you need more than recommended to be able to polish face. Personally I polish face, neck, and chest, therefore needing even more. Depending on how long this bottle lasts, considering the cost, not sure if Iâ€™ll purchase this myself in the future. Works great, smells even better!
