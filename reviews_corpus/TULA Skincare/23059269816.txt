I’ve been using this product for a little over a month now. I have two children six and under and the cold months have created many a sleepless nights. Add on to the norm that I’ve been super emotional lately and had a few tear filled nights as well. Before having this product I was hot water with wash clothing my eyes and rubbing ice on em-both of which I no longer need thanks to this balm. I’ve used it both in my makeup fridge and outside of it and I love it both ways. It has the slightest minty feel without pain. It’s like you feel it waking your tired or sad eyes up. It does have a pretty obvious shimmer to it which some days were nice and others I felt like Rudolph but under my eyes. Nevertheless I love using this product for it doing what it promises. Only downfall to me is the smell-there isn’t one but at the same time smells sort of medicinal? Easy to get past if you layer under your makeup and or moisturizer. It could feel pricy for the small tube you get but!It lasts soo long! I’ve been using is over a month and haven’t made it anywhere near the middle. Lovely addition
