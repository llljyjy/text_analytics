This was sent to me for free from Influenster but this is my honest opinion. This is a very lightweight serum that gives you a subtle glow! I like to use as a primer because it’s absorbed quickly into the skin.I didn’t like the smell and I don’t feel that it’s very hydrating for super dry skin! I recommend it for oily/normal and combination skin! nan
