A little bit about my skin, I have combination skin, and not sensitive at all. I received this product for free to try and I really enjoyed it! Iâ€™m someone who loves a nice fragrance in my products and I found this one to be pleasant and not overpowering for me. I love the idea of probiotics and skin care and the ingredients really excited me. I found it to be overall a nice moisturizer and one that I will definitely reach for again! Lovely scent!
