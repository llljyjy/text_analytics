I received this product for free with the intent to write an honest review.. I have had it for a couple weeks now and have been applying it morning and night before my moisturizer and my face hasn’t never felt so smooth! Any texture I did have is seemingly gone and my overall complexion seems brighter.. I’ll have to wait longer to see how it works on brightening up dark spots or acne marks on my face but so far I absolutely love this product. It also doesn’t leave any sticky residue like many vitamin c products do.. three drops for the whole face and it soaks in very nicely. New must have in my routine!
