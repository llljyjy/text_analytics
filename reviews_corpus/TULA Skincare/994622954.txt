For a few nights, I noticed my hands were covered in shimmer, and could not figure out why. Perhaps a makeup spill? Why would there be shimmer on my hands after cleaning up and doing nighttime skincare? Because there is A TON of shimmer bits (mica) in this night cream. This is a common ingredient to all makeup products, the stuff you wash OFF your face before going to bed. I canâ€™t say for sure that this caused irritation or breakouts, but I would assume these fine bits could be pore clogging. The formulation itself is plenty glowy and rich, there is no need to include shimmer in a night cream. It is moisturizing, but I am not comfortable using for my breakout-prone skin. Why shimmer???
