I can’t tell you how grateful I am to have received this product for my honest opinion. This product has graced my family and i with hope to have some of our sanity given back to our home. We have had a skin issue for over a year now and have tried numerous cleansers, serums and creams with not much of an outcome. This product has cleansed our skin in a way I never thought we’d feel again and I am here to tell others that this product leaves the skin silky smooth and rids it free of dirt, makeup, and/or God only knows. The fragrance of this cleanser is light and reminds me of a mild soap. Gentle enough for a child and the most sensitive of skin. This is my miracle product. Thank you Tula My Miracle Product
