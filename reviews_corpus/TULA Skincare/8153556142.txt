I’ve received this eye cream for free from influenster and Tula in exchange for my honest review.This eye cream is thick but absorbs well, when you apply it in your eyes area, it feels very moisturized. I like the packaging but dispenser dispenses a lot of product so it should be pressed softly to get just a little amount of product and don’t waste. I use it at night just as they recommend, in the morning skin still feels soft and moisturized.It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, and It’s not fragranced. Thick consistency
