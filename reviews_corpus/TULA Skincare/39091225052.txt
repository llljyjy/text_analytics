Iâ€™ve used and tried many skin care products over years, trying to find the best products to complete my routine. This serum is a necessity. It is truly a miracle. I have sensitive, dry skin. If I even touch my face, I break out: squeeze a white head, or even lightly itch my nose.. I get dark spots/hyperpigmentation/redness that would take forever Read more about review stating Definitely a game changer!to go away. Since using this serum, any spot or mark on my face goes away fast.Love how it makes my face feel fresh as soon as I put it on. I love the fresh smell as well. It makes me feel so ready for the day when I put it on! Definitely a game changer!
