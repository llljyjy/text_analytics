This Glow + Brightening Eye stick is an OK product, not my go to eye product in my cabinet. I can appreciate that it is formulated without parabens, sulfates, and other synthetic properties however I do not see any real changes after using it for 2 weeks. I did however see instant results, like added moisture, a brightening appearance (mostly due to the silvery frosty balm it leaves behind) and skin does appear smoother. I apply this on after I’ve cleansed and toned before applying moisturizer. I probably won’t repurchase this. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes nan
