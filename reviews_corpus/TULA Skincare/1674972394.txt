I’m not typically a fan of physical exfoliating as I tend to opt for chemical exfoliation instead, but I recently tried this and am in love. I’m dry skinned and often deal with flakey dry skin, especially in the winter months. Chemical exfoliation definitely helps but sometimes I need the gentle abrasion that comes with a scrub like this one and I’m so glad I tried this. It’s really gentle as far as scrubs go, and I really love the scent. It’s subtle but smells like pineapples. I don’t mind scents in my cleansers since I wash it all away. I really enjoy how the scrub turns into a lightweight oil cleanser type consistency as I work it into the skin, and it leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and hydrated after rinsing. I don’t feel like this strips my skin at all. My boyfriend has tried it and loves it as well. Definitely recommend! obsessed
