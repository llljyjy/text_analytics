Honestly, the price point is the only reason I took a star off, it is a very pricey product. BUT that being said, as someone with rosacea, and sensitive and extremely dry skin, this product is amazing. Finding cruelty free products that work this well is next to impossible, let alone products that are this kind to sensitive skin. Worth the $, but I do still wish it was cheaper. Amazing moisturizer
