I was recently introduced to Tula skincare products, so I was super excited to receive this full sized Tula Glow + Get it Cooling & Brightening Eye Balm from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. First of all, I love that this product has good for you ingredients, like probiotics and aloe. I have never used a skincare product with caffeine before and I am loving how awake it makes me feel on those early mornings! I simply run it back and forth a couple of times in my under eye area each morning before makeup. It has a nice cooling sensation and an illuminating quality to it. I found it to be super hydrating so have actually been using it in place of my eye moisturizer. I canâ€™t say I notice any difference in my fine lines or wrinkles, but it definitely brightens up the under eye area. I also like to use it as a highlighter under my eyebrow to give my eye look that extra lift. I will definitely be purchasing this product again the in the future and would highly recommend to friends and family! Amazing!
