A great travel set if you are going away for a few days. Love all the products in it. The so polished exfoliating sugar scrub was my favorite part of the set. Only downfall was it was so small, sample size, and only had maybe 3 times of use it in. It left my face feeling so soft and perfect for the vitamin c drops and finished up with the hydrating face lotion. As a set my skin felt smooth, soft and hydrated all day long but not greasy at all. Perfect to go under my makeup. Perfect travel set for a weekend away
