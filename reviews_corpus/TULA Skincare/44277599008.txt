I’ve been using for about a week, consistently is pretty nice… not a strong smell. While using it I’ve been taking a makeup break… and it’s been pretty good so far, it makes my skin look healthier and radiant, not heavy on the skin. I have never hear about this brand but I am definitely adding this to my skin routine. Also trying this during fall/winter. Surprised
