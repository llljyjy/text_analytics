This is the perfect kit for on the go. The products are all great and make your skin feel fresh and clean afterwards. The cleanser and scrub doesn’t strip your skin, and are both very gentle on the skin. The vitamin C only lasts a couple days, but I loved it and it didn’t make my skin feel sticky, and the moisturizer made my skin feel very soft and was very light weight. All in all, this is a great on the go travel kit at an affordable price. Great and affordable travel kit for on the go.
