This eye cream is super creamy and rich.   It was very moisturizing to my eye area which tends to be dry but it doesnâ€™t absorb well or easily.  A little definitely goes a long way.  I like the idea of the dispenser however I feel like it releases too much product at one time.   Also there were no instructions included on the packaging in how much to use and when to use it in your normal skincare routine A Little Goes A Long Way
