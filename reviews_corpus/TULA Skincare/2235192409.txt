I have combination skin and I really enjoy using this moisturizer. It absorbs well into the skin and does not feel greasy. I have not noticed much of a brightening effect but the Vit C does leave my skin feeling fresh. I also really like that it doesnâ€™t have an overpowering scent. Would recommend this moisturizer for sure! Love it
