I received this product for free to test it out and I have to say, I really enjoy it. The packaging/tubing is super cute and shiny. I find it to be sort of like a vaseline base but less heavy. Goes on super smooth and makes my skin feel moisturized around my eyes. I would definitely recommend. It’s also awesome that it’s in a small tube and it’s easy to take with me wherever, whenever. Compact, fabulous and lightweight.
