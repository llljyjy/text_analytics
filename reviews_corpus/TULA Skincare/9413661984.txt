Received this free product from Influenster for my honest review. My skin is usually combination but sometimes more on the oily side with few acne scars. This product is more lighter in consistency than I imagined for the better. I was worried it would be too oily but it hardly has any smell and is very light on the skin. My skin feels amazing after with a glow from within look with or without makeup. I noticed it covers some discolouration and the sheen shimmer also distracts the eyes from it. Iâ€™ve never tried probiotic skincare but look forward to seeking them in future products I buy. I will definitely keep using this serum and will recommend them to my friends! nan
