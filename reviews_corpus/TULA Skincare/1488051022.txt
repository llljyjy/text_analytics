I really wanted to love this eye balm and it definitely cools and works with and without makeup but I didn’t see a difference. I think the faint cooling sensation is really pleasant for the most part and it’s good for a little self-care but one time while using it alone it started irritating one of my eyes too. So, idk, I don’t think I’ll be getting this again once I use this stick up. On a plus side I do think it will last a long time and be rather nice in the summer. Gentle cooling sensation but no real difference
