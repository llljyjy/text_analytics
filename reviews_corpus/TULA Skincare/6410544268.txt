I received this product for free from INFLUENSTER and Tula for my honest review. I was very excited to use this product when I heard about the clean ingredients it contained. The application was very easy to put on and I have used it for 3 weeks religiously. Although I love the product line, I just didn’t see any difference on my skin and made it very greasy with makeup on. It’s good for days where you wear no makeup and you want your skin to feel very hydrated. Tula review
