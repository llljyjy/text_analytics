This is a Lightweight product that absorbs well, and doesn’t leave you feeling oily like some other products I’ve used in the past. Had a bit of trouble with the pump to suck up the oil, but overall good clean design. The application process is simple. In conglomeration with other Tula products this worked well and my face felt smooth and hydrated without the residue. nan
