I received this free to try from Influenster. This is a great moisturizer. It feels good on the skin and does not feel greasy. I love the smell and reminds me of a tropical gummy bear kind of smell. However, while this is a great moisturizer, I do not think I would consider this an intense moisturizer and why I rated it lower. It is a good one to have for the colder months, though but wouldn’t be my first choice. I have oily skin which dries out during the winter, but I didn’t feel like this one did as great of a job keeping my skin hydrated as other intense moisturizers do. Wouldn’t consider it ultra hydrating
