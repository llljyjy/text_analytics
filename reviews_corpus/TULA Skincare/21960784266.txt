This Tula skincare was one of the nicest sunscreens that I have tried. This sunscreen not obly protects from harsh UV rays, it also protects from Blue light too! It kept my face soft, smooth and protected! I really liked the gel consistency and that there wasn’t an overpowering smell. The only con was it made a small patch of skin unser my eyes on either side of nose burn slightly for a few seconds. I do have sensitive skin and am surprised how nicely it got along with my skin (aside from the above burning). I can’t say i noticed any glow but I do like how my skin looks! Happy
