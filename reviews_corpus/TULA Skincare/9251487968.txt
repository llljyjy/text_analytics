Received this product complimentary from Influenster and TULA in exchange for my honest review. Holy hydration!!! Love this, would purchase on my own! Normally I would not pay this as the price point is kinda high for a eye cream but it is divine! Left my eyes hydrated the next day after sleeping. My skin runs dry normal and this is a godsend. Love the dispensing mechanism as it’s easy to get the product and not your typical pump or squeeze…innovative if you ask me and it leaves zero waste and it’s the perfect amount for me at least. The consistency of the cream is amazing, not greasy or heavy and not too liquidy either. I would def recommend. Holy hydration
