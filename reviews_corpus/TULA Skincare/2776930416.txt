I received a trial size that lasted about 2 weeks and I really liked it, I have combo oily skin that needs hydration at night and have found this sinks in without a greasy look or feel and have used during the day as well and is good under makeup! I have tried better but I honestly enjoyed this, just probably wouldnâ€™t purchase full size because of the price but it is nice and great for day and night as it claims which is hard to find in a moisturizer ! nan
