All I can say is wow! First off the product actually works o can see a notice shortly after use. I have been using this for about a month now and I love it. It’s a great way to stay hydrated with fine lines and wrinkles all day long. I actually used this a lot quicker than I wanted to but it’s so addicting to just swipe throughout the day. My most favourite part besides that it works is that it’s a balm. You don’t have to worry about using your fingers or getting it in your nails. It’s a good size and fits easily in your pocket and purse for travel. Definitely would recommend this prospect and would like to buy it myself! I did get this as a a free Product from Influenster. Another great program to try if you are not yet a member. #influenstercanada #igotitfree Best under eye balm!!
