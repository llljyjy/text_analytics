I have used Tula products in my Skincare routine for over 2 years now and love them!  When I got these to try I was so excited, the older I get the more I am realizing that a good skincare routine makes such a difference in how my skin looks and feels. The products in this kit did not let me down! They are everything I hoped they would be. They have a very light fragrance, which is perfect for my sensitive skin. I have loved adding these into my routine and will continue using them with my other Tula products regularly! A little goes a long way for any Tula product. So even though they are kind of expensive, it lasts a long time! Amazing kit!!
