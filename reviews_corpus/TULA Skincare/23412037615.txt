I received this product to try from Influenster and I wanted to wait a few weeks to see how my skin responded before I left a review. This stuff is pretty great! It feels hydrating and “wet” to begin with, but the skin absorbs it quickly and if left overnight, my skin feels amazing, plump and supple the next morning. I love the smell and the fact that it is plant superfoods. Love this!
