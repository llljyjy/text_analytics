Unfortunately, these products were not suited for my skin type. I have combination of dry and oily. Typically, I avoid products with strong fragrance like Tula. Personally, I couldn’t continue using these products due to my skin sensitivity. I wasn’t a fan of the strong scent and some of the ingredients. nan
