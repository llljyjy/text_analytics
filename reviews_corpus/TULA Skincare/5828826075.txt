I’m not a huge user of moisturizer but I do actually like this one. It’s not greasy or heavy when you put it on. Light smelling. Does take a little bit of blending and pretty to control how much product you get with the pump. I have noticed my skin is very soft and the texture is looking better. Received this product from Influenster. Soft skin ahead
