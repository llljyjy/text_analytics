I have been using Tula’s eye balm for a few weeks now and I am loving it! I’m aways skeptical of an eye cream performing. But this one actually does, it has a cooling effect which not only feels great but it helps to de-puff my undereye skin. The application is so fast and easy and layers over makeup easily. I have made this a staple in my daily routine. So refreshed!
