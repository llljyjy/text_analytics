It’s scent-free hydrating balm. It feels sticky and I can’t put makeup over it. I don’t think it helps with the puffy eyes of eyebags but it did help with moisturizing. It is easy to use though sometimes it tugs when you swipe it under the eyes. My eyes also don’t feel irritated when even if I apply it close, so it has a gentle formula. Doesn’t make my skin red and really helps with my dry skin. nan
