It is really hydrating but it takes a while to soak in. It almost feels like a thick oil or cleansing balm type consistency but in a stick so it doesn’t immediately absorb. Other than that, I haven’t noticed a hide difference but I also don’t usually have puffy eyes or many wrinkles (yet). I do really like some of the ingredients, but it is a bit pricey for my needs. Plus, the stick pulls a bit at the skin which I don’t love either. It’s okay.
