Before having this product, I could not find a face cream that moisturized my face without making it feel oily after applying it. But THIS cream is buttery smooth and makes me skin feel soft as velvet after it soaks in! And it doesnâ€™t take much product at all! Maybe a dime size amount for the entire face! It is now a must have in my daily routine! Skin routine savior!
