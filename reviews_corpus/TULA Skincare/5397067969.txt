I liked this moisturizer enough to finish out the container, but I will not repurchase. As someone with dry skin, it was not hydrating enough for me. My skin even sometimes felt tight in the mornings after applying it and I would have to use one of my other face creams on top. I think this would be a product better suited for those with oily/combo skin. Not Made For Dry Skin
