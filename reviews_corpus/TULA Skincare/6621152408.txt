I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes. I love the size of the jar, it’s a generous size that will last a long time. It’s also super hygienic because of the pump. The product itself is thick and creamy and absorbs into the skin nicely. It kind of stings if I get it in my eyes so be careful. I haven’t noticed any results in terms of dark circles and wrinkle reducing but it moisturizes the under eyes. I’ve only been using it for a month so I’m hoping with time I’ll see more benefits. nan
