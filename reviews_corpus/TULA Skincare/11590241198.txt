I received this product asa free sample. I’m really loving this eye serum, I love how light weight it is specially since I have propensity to milia so I avoid heavy eye creams/serums as much as possible. Love the applicator and the cooling sensation of it, also the shape of it makes it easy to massage the under eye. I included it in my morning skin care routine and on days where my face is puffy. I would purchase it again once I run out of it I feel like it’s worth it if your face is puffy often. A little goes a long way Tula never disappoints. Loving the eye serum
