I received this from Influenster and have been trying it out for a month now. It has a nice consistency and nice smell, but I have not noticed a big difference in my skin. I suffer from dry skin and it took 3 weeks before I noticed a difference- and it was just a small one, my forehead was less dry, but the rest of my face there was no difference. For the amount it costs, I expected more. 5/10
