I received this product free through #Influenster for testing purposes. I really enjoy using this product. The pads do go a long way. The scent is nice, it does leave a bit of a sticky after feeling for a little bit but nothing too offensive. My face feels clean and it has reduced some blackheads in my nose area. The packaging is convenient. This is the first time I have tried this name brand but I will definitely be exploring other products by #Tula nan
