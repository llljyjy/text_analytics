I have only been using this product for about a week, so it is still a little early. However, I can personally already see a difference in my skin! Itâ€™s brighter and continues throughout the day after my morning application. It does not hurt my sensitive skin, and does not have a harsh fragrance. I also love the applicator! So far so good!
