I received this product for free by influenster to give my honest review . I have oily pro acne skin but dry in some places. I have been using this product for 2 weeks more less . I love very much the consintency and how my skin feels after using it . One pump is more than enough for my face and i can used it before my foundation without problem. I donâ€™t know if it is really this cream but my skin is much better lately and if it is really this product for sure im going to still used it and i will buy it when it runs out . Im really impress!!! I will recomend it 100%. Thank you Tula and influenster. nan
