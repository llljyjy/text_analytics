I love this eye balm! I love that its a stick and its easy to just swipe on, pat in a little bit and you are good to go. It feels refreshing and cooling and its the first under eye product I’ve used where I really believe its made a difference in the feel and appearance. I’m lucky if I get 4 hours of sleep so I have a lot of darkness and puffiness under my eyes but this truly does make a difference. My holy grail
