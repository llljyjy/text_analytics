Tula Skincare protect + glow daily sunscreen with probiotics and superfoods is a fabulous addition to my toiletry bag and daily regimen. I am a very fair skinned person who burns easily. I have used several skin care sunscreen brands in the past. Most of them I have issues with, from stickiness to smearing or uneven and burning skin. I have used Tula Skincare Sunscreen for several weeks now and find it very refreshing. The bottle is well designed and easy to use. You get a controlled amount upon usage and applying it is simple and not wasteful. The fragrance is light but reminds me of summer fruit markets and fresh pineapple. I had no issues with uneven coverage or smearing. I feel using natural products on our skin with healthy ingredients is safe and better for all people. I will continue to use Tula Skincare and recommend it to anyone who wants a great balanced skincare sunscreen. love love it
