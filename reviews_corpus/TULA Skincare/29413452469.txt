I am very picky about feeling product on my skin and this really just melts onto the skin leaving it soft and feeling moisturized. I donâ€™t have dark spots and I have a lot of redness so I feel like brightening isnt beneficial so I just use it at nigh. Overall a great product to add to my routine. Thank you! Truly no sticky residue!
