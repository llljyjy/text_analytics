I really wanted to love this one, and I *sort of* do but not as a moisturizer. Initially I was really impressed by the way that my skin texture improved noticeably by the morning after my very first PM application! I love the dispenser and not having to dip my fingers into a jar. A little goes a long way and this product will last quite a while which is nice considering what the price is. However I’m sad to say that after repeated uses, this formula is really not doing anything for my dry skin. Since switching from my usual moisturizer I’ve had some skin tightness & dry spots and some fine lines in my forehead appear more visible from being more dehydrated. I will still continue to use this product because it is doing some nice things for my skin texture but only when following up with additional moisturizing products. If you don’t have dry skin, this may be a great product for you! nan
