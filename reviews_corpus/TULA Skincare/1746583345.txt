I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I received this moisturizer a few weeks ago and gave lots of time to try it out. It was a perfect time of year because the air is very dry. My skin has been suffering this winter and this did a great job of providing a lot of hydration without being too oily. It took me some time to get use to the dispenser but I like this method as youâ€™ll get more product out of the bottle. It also eliminates air and germs getting into the product which deteriorates the quality. Overall I loved this moisturizer and it has a great smell. It worked wonders on my skin and I think with more time I will see some firming benefits as well. Highly Recommend
