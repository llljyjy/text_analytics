I LOVE this sunscreen. I had to start using mineral sunscreen because of my rosacea and this one has been my favorite. It feels amazing, doesn’t take forever to blend if you apply it in two layers, and the tint gives me a slightly more even tone and balances the redness out perfectly without even looking like I’m wearing makeup (I have very pale skin with redness so I can only say that it works for that skin tone). The only thing is I’m not sure if I can justify almost $40 for a small bottle of sunscreen because I used it in about a month. I love it though and definitely would love to repurchase it in the future Top 3 Mineral Sunscreens
