I love this moisturizer, my first time I used a moisturizer that it has a probiotic, Im glad I tried it, this moisturizer is so refreshing smells amazing citrusy, but not too strong, I use it twice a day, I have an oily combination skin, it doesn’t leave my skin greasy, absorb easily, I have some dark spot on my cheeks, after a month of use I noticed some brightness and smoothness, I’ll definitely continue using it, and I love the packaging the pump is so cute, I’ll highly recommend this moisturizer. so refreshing
