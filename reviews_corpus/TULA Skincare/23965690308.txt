I received this product through Influenster and have been using it for a little over two weeks. The first thing I noticed was the scent--a pleasant, creamy lemon scent that reminds me of the limoncello La Croix. It’s a little strong but dissipates quickly.The product itself is emollient and sinks in quickly. I layer it under the Super Goop clear matte sunscreen. In the time I’ve used it, I’ve noticed brighter skin and discoloration from previous breakouts has lightened. The product itself is great but I have some issues with the packaging. The pump cracked after a few uses and it also clogs between uses. I only use this in the morning and have to pull a clog of dried cream out of the tip of the pump every day. Overall, it’s a good product and I’ve noticed improved skin texture and appearance. I just wish the packaging was a little sturdier. nan
