I enjoy this product a lot! I put it on before bed. It does burn a bit when I put it on sometimes. But I feel like it has given my skin a nice glow after use and my skin looks bright and healthy! It’s so nice to have an alternative to retinol. I’ve been using it for about a month now. I don’t know if it’s related but I have had less zits than usual when using it. No complaints. Good stuff
