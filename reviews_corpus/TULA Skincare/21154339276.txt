I have pretty tough combo skin, so the scents of these products didn’t negatively affect me, but I can’t imagine they wouldn’t for some people with sensitive, acne prone skin.The sugar scrub definitely needs to be shaken and squeezed with the cap on before use or else a nice pile of oil will be the first thing to hit those hands of yours. The sugar dissolves too quickly to give a good exfoliation of the whole face. I like that it’s clearly gentle in that way, but I just need at least a little longer with the sugar. I can also see the oil in this product being an issue for some sensitive skinned people. One thing is for sure, it smells good.I used the vitamin c serum on targeted dark spots since the package is so small. I didn’t notice any improvement, which was a bummer.The moisturizer at first has a plain ole cream scent, but then it hits you with “bar of soap” smell. Irish spring type, maybe - not sure. (I do still have smell issues, so I could be way off) That’s really not an insult - I don’t mind the scent, but it’s there and it does last. This left a nice glow on me and left my skin feeling very soft. If I accidentally overdid it, it took so long to fully absorb and I’m not down for that, but that’s also my doing for using too much.The face wash has the same scent as the moisturizer, in my opinion, just stronger. My felt didn’t feel stripped after use and it did feel clean.The sizes of these products are great for the on the go. You may only get a few uses out of some, but still decent. Overall, the products are pretty average and, again, not really for many people with sensitive or acne prone skin, in my opinion. Average
