I have combo/oily skin and it took some trial and error to figure out how much to apply for spreadable coverage without being too shiny feeling when mixed with eventual sweat and oil. Thereâ€™s a shimmery glow to it that I can see myself wearing by itself (after usual skincare routine of course) without makeup for a dewy look, though not my preferred finish. I would have liked if the SPF was higher, but otherwise would introduce it to my sunscreen rotation for not too sweaty days! nan
