Tula Vitamin C moisturizer is a must try! Iâ€™ve received it for free and have been using it for a month, and wow - I love what I see. It has a matte finish, very lightweight and not irritating to the sensitive skin at all! But the best part is that it brightens the skin, my acne scars faded away and some dark spots starting to go away too. 5/5, definitely recommend! Awesome brightening moisturizer
