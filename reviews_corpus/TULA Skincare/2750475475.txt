I received this complimentary from Influenster and I looooove it! I was a bit iffy at first because I usually don’t like to look glowy since I get a little oily through out the day but this just leaves my skin with a healthy glow. It melts right into my skin and right to the touch it feels so hydrating. It’s my new favorite sunscreen and I know I will re purchase. It is a little on the high end price but I believe it’s worth it. I even take it to work now and put some on before I know that I will head outside. This sunscreen is great in my opinion! Obsessed!
