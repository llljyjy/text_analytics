This eye cream is thick! If you’re looking for something to lather on at night, knowing you’re getting maximum moisture, this is it. I usually get dry skin around my eyes in the earlier months and this helped replenish. I also love that it’s mild and not really scented. My favorite part is the applicator, which dispenses the perfect amount each time. It’s a yes from me.
