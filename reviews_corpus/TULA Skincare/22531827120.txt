Love the packaging! Super easy to swipe on and also take on the go if you wanted to. It’s soft enough where it doesn’t tug on your delicate eye skin when applying! Super moisturizing and feels great on. I’ve been using for the past two weeks and haven’t noticed a huge difference in dark circles/puffiness. But it always makes my under eyes feel great. Haven’t gotten any milia yet either! :) Super moisturizing
