Ok I am actually loving this face cream right now- with all the cold dry weather, my skin NEEDED this! Directions say this can be used day or night but I find it more effective at night, as it is a very thick cream. It has a pleasant sweet smell which I usually like but sometimes has a bubble-gum-like scent which might bother some. Overall I donâ€™t think you can go wrong with this one. nan
