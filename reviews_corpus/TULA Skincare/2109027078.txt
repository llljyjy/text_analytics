I was provided this product free of charge by Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really enjoyed the cooling nature of this balm and it did slightly brighten my under eye area (the product has a bit of shimmer). I used this after my regular eye cream and that worked well. I donâ€™t think it has enough moisture to use alone, but great to use in combination or even on top of makeup! nan
