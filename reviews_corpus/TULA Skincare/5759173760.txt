I’ve really been throughly enjoying this sunscreen, it’s lightweight and I love that it has a bit of a tint to help color correct. I live in Texas and it’s pretty sunny all the time, this under makeup has been fantastic! I’m so pleased with this product honestly, I don’t notice anything with the scent but I do not have sensitive skin either, more combo oily. Loveeee
