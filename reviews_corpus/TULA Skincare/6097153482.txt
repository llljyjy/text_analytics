I was SO excited to finally try this cleanser after seeing so many positive reviews on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, but I have to say that it is a major disappointment and a total fail for me. Pros: The large bottle is very big and since a little goes a long way, it will last a long time. The packaging is convenient. I like gel cleansers (though sees the Cons section for more details…)Cons: Firstly, the scent of this product is absolutely HORRIBLE. It smells exactly like a floral hand soap that my grandmother had in her bathroom in the 80’s, but about 100% stronger. The smell is SO overwhelming and really “sticks around” even after washing it off. I am not someone who is bothered either way about fragrance in skincare products; I enjoy both scented and fragrance free products, but the smell of this cleanser is nauseating and so off putting that I don’t think I can continue to use the cleanser. It’s odd because “fragrance” is listed in the ingredients, so it’s clearly a scent which has been added on purpose. (I can’t comment on how the added fragrance would affect someone with sensitive skin or a fragrance allergy but I would AVOID it for this reason if I did experience those conditions) As stated above, I love gel cleansers, and this is one, though I do find it to be slightly chunky and difficult to break down evenly. It’s difficult to explain but it doesn’t seem to be very elegantly formulated for a gel product. Finally, I have found that this cleanser leaves my cheeks feeling uncomfortably dry, which is a problem I have NEVER encountered with a cleanser as I have oily skin. I would prefer a cleanser that leaves my skin feeling better balanced, and this is clearly not it. I’m genuinely stumped as to why so many influencers and reviewers have raved so much about this product, as it seems like such an obvious fail to me… Sephora stocks tons of great cleansers, I would suggest shoppers skip this one and try a different one. Nope. Just nope.
