The first time I used this sunscreen I found the texture/consistency to be different, and reading other reviews I realized that it is normal for this product. It leaves a glow and a good hydration on the skin, but I prefer dry touch because I have oily skin.  I haven’t tested it under makeup.  It’s a good product overall and I will continue to use it. Good sunscreen overall
