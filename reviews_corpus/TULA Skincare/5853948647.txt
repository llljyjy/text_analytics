I recieved this item free from Inluenster in exchange for my honest review  . First impression was how cool the dropper bottle is . And I wished my first impression was similar for the rest of this product . When I opened this product,  I smelled it. And I think it smells horrible . It smells like plastic . . Or something,  I don’t even know.  Then I thought ok, I’ll give it a shot . I spot tested on my hand and was immediately met with burning .. but ok. But that smell .. and now its on my hand . Yuk . So I went ahead and put some on my face .. it was sticky, and again. the flippin smell ..  it didn’t burn my face,  but I can’t get past the stickiness or the smell . I tried for 1 week and just noticed that my hair sticks to my face more and its annoying.. Not for me . An absolute let down
