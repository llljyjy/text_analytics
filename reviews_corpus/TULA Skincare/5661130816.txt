I love that the consistency of this ice cream is totally different from anything I’ve ever tried. Most of the time it’s more of a gel base, this cream is really beautiful and not too thick but absolutely perfect to cling to your skin overnight. I’ve been using this consistently for a week now and I can already see plumping and smoothing of my skin in the entire orbital area. I also love the really hygienic dispenser and that a little of this product was a very long way. A Welcome Change
