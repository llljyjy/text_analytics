I have used this face wash for two years and absolutely love it. I have unpredictable, sensitive skin and this has given me so much improvement over time. I can always count on it! I recently switched to the green Farmacy cleanser for fun but will be switching back immediately as that one broke me out. Love soso much for sensitive skin
