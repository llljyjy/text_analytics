Was very excited to receive this product in my VoxBox. It’s a really generous size. Pretty packaging, clean, promising results, however I haven’t really seen a big difference in my skin. Need to keep at it, but don’t love the application process. Pump isn’t great and doesn’t work well. A lot also doesn’t come out onto the cotton pad too. Probably wouldn’t purchase this again. nan
