Had the opportunity to try this product for free. Heard a lot about Tula products and was intrigued. Packaging was super cute but the smell of the product is kinda weird. I personally don’t mind it but if you’re sensitive to smells, you probably will. It’s pretty thick so I’ve been using it at night. You really don’t need to use a lot, half a pump is plenty for me! I feel like my skin is more nourished looking so I do think it’s a good moisturizer but is it worth $76? I’m not so sure Stick with it
