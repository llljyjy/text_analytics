Remember to wear sunscreen! It does compromise the skin as it is AHA. I didn’t see any visible results, so I can’t say it’s anything special, but it didn’t cause any issues or cause pilling. I’m not sure how much it cost because I got it for free to test, but I don’t know if I’d pay a high price point for it. I will say that I did have issues with the pump not always working though. nan
