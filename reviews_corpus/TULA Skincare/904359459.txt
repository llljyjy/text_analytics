I love the way this moisturizer is dispensed. It’s the perfect amount. It’s creamy with a light texture that sinks in nicely to my dry skin. The scent isn’t my favourite, too bubble gummy for me but it disappears quickly. I haven’t tried it enough to know if it makes a difference in the long run but it makes my skin feel great and wore well under my SPF. nan
