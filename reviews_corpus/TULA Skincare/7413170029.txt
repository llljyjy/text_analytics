I initially did a test with this product by using it as a very thin layer of spot treatment for a pimple that cropped and BOY am I glad I did bc this works something fierce. It dried out my pimple overnight and I knew my sensitive skin couldnâ€™t handle that. I started using the rest of it on my underarms and it kills the bacteria without mercy. nan
