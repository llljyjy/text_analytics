This review has been long time coming, I really enjoy it. The size is perfect for those who travels, and the texture although a lil too slippery for my taste, is being compensated by how well it absorbs to your skin. Thinking into incorporating this for my daily use, but nothing set in stone yet. All in all I highly recommend this product. Give it a go and let me know how it is for you. Worth the price tag
