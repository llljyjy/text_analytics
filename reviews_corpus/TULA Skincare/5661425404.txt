Disclaimer: I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve used this product for a couple weeks now so I could get a good feel of it. The first thing I will say is it does not smell the best. I guess that has to do with the fact that it is a clean product and does not contain fragrances that could be harsh on the skin. If that doesn’t bother you, then you may love this. It is thick in consistency and will kind of sit on your skin for a while which I don’t usually prefer. I like my moisturizer to soak into my skin almost immediately. Nonetheless, it is extremely moisturizing. If you have very dry skin this would be perfect for you. Good product
