I received this product for free in exchange for my review. I’ve tried a few different Vitamin C serums and none of them really fit well into my routine. They were too sticky to sit well under my makeup, oxidized quickly, etc. this packaging does expose the product to air more than I would prefer, but the button dropper is cute and the bottle looks nice on my vanity. The serum glides on smoothly and doesn’t interfere with my sunscreen or foundation at all. After it soaks in, it is almost undetectable except for feeling lightly plumped and moisturized. I definitely felt a slight sensitivity from everyday use, which to me means it has an effective concentration. But I switched to every other day to build back up and have not had any issues. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a cosmetically-elegant vitamin C serum to add to their routine. nan
