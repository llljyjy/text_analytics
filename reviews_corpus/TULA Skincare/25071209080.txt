I was very excited to receive free this sample product to test. I have enjoyed using it. It’s really smooth application to put on and does not take long either. I’m slightly sensitive to smells so it was a little bit of an adjustment. I did not and still don’t use a lot at once. My face looks so much better after a period of time. I think maybe a week or so. My skins usually pretty dull but this actually brought some glow to it. I am really happy with the product. It did feel like at first it was not soaking up, like it took time to soak into my skin so I could feel it if I was touching my face after applying it. That and the scent is why I gave it 4 stars. The product works and I love the packaging just could use some minor improvements. Made a difference for me
