My review is based on a sample I received from Sephora. I absolutely ADORE this product. Feels great on application; I used up the sample over a few nights as a final step in my evening routine, and it definitely left my eyes feeling and looking refreshed each morning. I wish the product was a little less expensive, as I’d love to buy the full size and use it nightly. For now, I’m keeping my fingers crossed that it goes on sale over the holidays. Wish I could add it to my nightly routine
