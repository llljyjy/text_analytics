This was my first time trying Tula and I am impressed. The packaging is so nice! It’s probably my favorite thing about this. the product itself is Nice.. The consistency is quite thick and sticky.. I would recommend this more for drier skin types. As any oily skinned gal, I could only use this some nights as it can be quite heavy and I am not a fan of that feeling.  Also not a fan of the smell but nothing major. Worth trying out! I think it’s great, just not the best match for my skin type. Pleasantly surprised
