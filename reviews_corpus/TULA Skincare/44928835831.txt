I think this is a great moisturizer! So far Iâ€™ve been using it 2x a day for 2 weeks. No breakouts, keeps skin exceptionally soft, and it only lightly scented. My only negative is that there is so little product for the price. I wish it came in a big bottle because I go through moisturizer so quickly. And the scent is a bit weird, but not bad. Good moisturizer! Wish it was bigger.
