I received this product from influenster for my honest opinion and am happy I did! I enjoy the mild citrus scent and the feel of it on my skin. It is evening out my skin tone, I’ve been using it for about a week day and night. I feel good about what’s inside it. It doesn’t completely hydrate my nose area but otherwise I enjoy it! Nice light moisturizer
