Good Toner- but feels more like a milky serum than a typical toner. It felt drying after the first time, but wait about 3 min after using for your skin to absorb it, then apply a good moisturizer and it feels so luxurious. My skin feels tighter- while it’s only been two weeks- I think I may just like this more than the Clinique toner I’ve been using for 15+ years! 10000% need the moisturizer after though, so don’t skip it! nan
