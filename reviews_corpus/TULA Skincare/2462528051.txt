Nice packaging. I received this from influenster for testing purposes. I didn’t expect it to do much. It’s like a milky light liquid and spreads easily. The next morning my skin actually looked better.  Slightly plumped.  I can feel it softer as well. It has probiotics extracts and bakuchiol that will help with the wrinkles. The best way to describe it is refreshed. It is a great way to incorporate retinol in my routine. I recommend this product. Great Serum
