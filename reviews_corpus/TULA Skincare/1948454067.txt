This has been a BO miracle for me. For whatever reason, this summer, my armpits have decided they hate me. I’ve never really had this problem and regular soap and deodorant have always been effective. It’s gotten so bad though that literally every new product I get in beauty boxes goes straight to my armpits. I have been using this to scrub my armpits every day for the last week and it’s been keeping my stank at bay. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I still smell like a regular person at the end of the day. Bodies produce odor and there’s nothing you can do to completely stop that. But before this scrub, I couldn’t even get the smell off at all no matter what I did. It keeps me feeling cleaner throughout the day. I think it may have to do with the enzymes breaking down the bacteria and odors. It’s gentle enough that it doesn’t cause any irritation either from the enzymes or the sugar (the sugar dissolves rather quickly). They feel smooth and healthy afterwards. I will 100% be buying this again. Do it for the pits
