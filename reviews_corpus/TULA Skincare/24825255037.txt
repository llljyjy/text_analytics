I received this product as a free sample from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. For someone that suffers from puffy dark circles this is an amazing product. I love the applicator as it is like a stainless steel material which immediately cools the under eye area de-puffing almost instantly. The formula is light and hydrating perfect to put on before concealing darkness. I will say it doesnâ€™t really do much for my dark circles as those are more hereditary but does help with the de-puffing and stays moisturized. I would definitely recommend and continue to use. Say goodbye to puffy eyes.
