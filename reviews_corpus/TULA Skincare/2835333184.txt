I received the Tula moisturizer free from Influenster a few weeks ago.  I have been using it on my face and neck since.   I personally love the fresh scent of crisp apple & watermelon.  It makes for a nice Spring Blend and I plan to add this moisturizer to my travel bag to keep the fresh vibes while I am on vacation.   It offers good hydration, but not as thick and moisturizing as others,  which I need during the winter months. I am going to take a break with this until Spring when I think that I will get the most benefits from it. Tu-La-La
