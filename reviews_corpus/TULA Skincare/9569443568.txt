I’ve been really enjoying this sunscreen. It is sparsely so be warned, however I find it to be a nice level of shine. It gives my skin a healthy glow and in these winter months I need it. Dries down well and has a scent that makes me long for the summertime. I did receive this product free from Influenster for me honest review and I’m happy to say I’ll be keeping this in my regular routine. nan
