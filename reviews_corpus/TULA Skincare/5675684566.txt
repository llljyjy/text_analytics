I received this product for free from Influenster and Tula in exchange for my honest review. I think this eye balm is okay, it doesn’t cause any milia under my eyes which is good because I’m prone to milia whenever I try different eye creams. I find it very convenient to just pop off the cap and apply the eye balm, though I’m scared that I may be going to agressive since you can’t really feel if the eye balm is on your under eye. I’ve been using this everyday but can’t tell a big difference. You can’t apply makeup on top of this because your concealer will just not go on top of it since it’s a balm. With the price point though, not sure if I will repurchase but I would recommend this product. It's pretty good
