I received this product for free from Influencer and Tula for exchange for my honest review and I can honestly say I love this face cleanser! I’ve been using it for a few days and I can see a difference of how refreshing my face feels. It makes my face feel rejuvenized and light. It’s a gel cleanser and has no fragrance.It doesn’t cause any breakouts which is great for my sensitive skin. I highly recommend getting this!! What a great Product!!!
