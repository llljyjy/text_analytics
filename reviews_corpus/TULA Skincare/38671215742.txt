Really nice and handy for on the go! I appreciate that it is not overly scented and my favorite product out of them all is the sugar scrub! My least favorite was the vitamin c. Just for me it felt a little tingly and it got warm and irritating at one point but went away. It might just be too strong for my face or doesnâ€™t mix well with the my other products. Still testing but I think it is on the strong side. Convenient travel kit
