I have combo skin with a more oily t zone. Because of that I tend to lean more toward gel moisturizers and this isn’t something I’d normally go for. I am however enjoying it as my nighttime moisturizer in the winter, when my cheeks can get a touch dry. It leaves my skin nicely moisturized, but never heavy or greasy feeling. I think dry skin people will love this. It is heavily fragranced, so if you don’t enjoy fragrance in skincare you won’t like this. I personally think it’s too much fragrance so I knocked off a star. I do however, find it to be a pleasant smell and it goes away eventually after putting it on. Good winter moisturizer
