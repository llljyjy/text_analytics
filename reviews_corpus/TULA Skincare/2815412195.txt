I received this product for free from Influenster for my honest review. I’ve heard of the brand Tula but had never tried it before. So I was super excited to get this. I love face masks! I really enjoyed the mess free application it was easy to apply and easy to easy off. The smell is not overbearing it’s a light scent. I’m so excited to add this to my skincare routine and would defined recommend this to a friend. Mess free mask
