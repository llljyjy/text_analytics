I received 𝐓𝐮𝐥𝐚 - 𝐛𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐬 - 𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐧 𝐜 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐮𝐦 from @influenster and @tula in exchange for my honest review.I’ve used this serum for about 2 weeks, and I love the fresh and pleasant scent. Vitamin C serum tends to leave a bit of stickiness but this one does not. It does not cause any irritation, and I feel my skin look radiant and plump. Good!
