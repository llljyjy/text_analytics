I got this moisturizer for free to try from Influenster - I’ve been using it every night for about a week and I really like it! It has a nice scent with a great consistency. Not too thick and greasy but gives the skin hydration. If you’re super oily though I wouldn’t recommend this during the day - I tried and my skin  was a little more dewy than I’d like after applying my spf. It makes for a fantastic night cream though, I wake up to brighter skin! Great Night Cream for Oily/acne prone skin!
