I’m highly allergic to most products but this one my skin didn’t break out and even had a glow to it! I used it underneath my makeup and on its own! I will say if you use too much it does become oily so use about a dime size. Great for your skin and a long lasting product! I did receive this in a TULA skincare VoxBox from Influenster, I would buy again! Long lasting product
