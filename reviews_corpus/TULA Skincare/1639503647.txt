I got this for free from Influenster. It’s a decent eye cream, I love the packaging & pump dispenser. It’s a little thick and I find I have to warm it between my fingers before applying under my eyes. Haven’t used it long enough to tell if it’s made a noticeable difference or not, but seems like quality ingredients. Decent eye cream
