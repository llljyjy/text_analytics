I’ve been using the moisturizer day and night for the last month or two and have been really loving it. It’s hydrating without being heavy and works well under both sunscreen in the day, and my facial oil at night. I can’t say that the probiotics have done anything amazing to my skin, but the moisturizer hasn’t irritated or broken me out. I’ve seen a lot of complaints about the smell but I find it very subtle and not at all bothersome. 10/10 would buy again nan
