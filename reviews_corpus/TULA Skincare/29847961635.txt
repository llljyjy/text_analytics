To start off, the packaging of this product was absolutely gorgeous! The pump, which I assume was to prevent the vit c from oxidizing, was not only super beautiful but easy to use. The ingredient list is insanely impressive but I’m unsure of how they will truly play out in the long-term. When using, it dispenses a very nice amount, which had a light orange scent. I wasn’t too happy about this, just because fragrance tends to irritate my skin if I get it too close to my eye area, which was the case for this product but thankfully, only for the first day? I still would have preferred it without the fragrances, however. As for the product itself, the consistency was slightly greasy, which I presume is due to the vit c of this moisturizer. It doesn’t offer much of a glass skin glow, which I tend to enjoy in a product, but the greasy look does dull down in an hour to give a smooth, matte texture. I haven’t seen any immediate results with fading my hyperpigmentation with this moisturizer, though I didn’t have my hopes up to begin with. I do find that my face looks brighter, but it’s hard to contribute it directly to the product itself It certainly does it’s job of moisturizing, that is to be sure, and none of the ingredients are comedogenic (I’m quite prone to comedogenic products and can often see immediately if a product will break me out) so I didn’t have issues with new comedones. Overall, it is certainly a good moisturizer, but not good enough to maintain a five-star holy grail status. This product would be a great gift to anyone who enjoys using vit c. I’m not sure if I would repurchase (this product was sent to me) but if I see more-long-term results, I will definitely consider it but for now, I would rather try the serums/toners to achieve my skincare goals. Amazing product but not a HG (for now)
