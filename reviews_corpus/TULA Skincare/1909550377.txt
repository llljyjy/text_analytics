I have received this product from #influenster for free. This is my first time trying probiotic skincare and I took my time to test it for a whole week ( before writing this review). In general, I the skin underneath my eyes tend to be sensitive and slightly puffy (eye bags and dark circles).This product is scent free. A bit embarrassed to say, I did not know how to use this product at first because the product itself did not specify that I need to press on the white applicator to release the serum (it only said on the box - which I did not read until later). After application of the serum, I felt my eyes were less tired (due to the cooling sensation from the metal tip and serum). However, I did not notice any difference (no depuffing on the eye bags and no effect on dark circles). Thus, I do not think I would be recommending it to others who are looking to get rid of their eye bags / dark circles. No effect on depuffing
