This definitely protects me from the sun and has the added feel and benefit of being skincare too. I do feel like it makes me a little shiny and greasy (though I have oily skin and most sunscreens tend to do this). Classic sunscreen smell and feel. I received this to try from influenster and I will definitely be reaching for it this summer but Iâ€™m not sure I would rebuy. nan
