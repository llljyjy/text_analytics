Honestly I was skeptical when I first received this product, but I think it really works! I think it’s pretty strong because I didn’t put on sunscreen one day (just my regular moisturizer from The Ordinary) and I definitely noticed pigmentation in my skin - USE SUNSCREEN!! You need very small amounts of product to cover your face - the 2-3 droplet recommendation is definitely accurate. The droplet applicator is amazing, it really holds the product and dispensing a certain number of droplets is easy without leakage. I love this packaging too! Tula is also cruelty free, which is really important to me so I’m very happy with this product. High quality, cruelty free, great packaging
