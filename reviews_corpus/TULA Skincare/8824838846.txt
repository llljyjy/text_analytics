The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer? The pump! Super convenient, and much cleaner than having to stick your fingers in the jar. Easily my favourite part about it.The moisturizer itself has a very faint, citrusy scent. It didn’t make me break out or anything, but wasn’t quite moisturizing enough for my needs, so if your skin isn’t all that dry, it should do the job. It might be better suited for summer because of that.I’m in my 40s and have combination skin that gets very dry in places, for reference. Good moisturizer, just not for me
