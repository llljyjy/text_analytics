I was given a complimentary product for my honest review. This serum is rich and absorbs nicely into the skin. There is no overt fragrance, and I haven’t had any negative reactions to the product. I have been using it daily for over a week, but I haven’t noticed any obvious results (but that’s no different than any serum I have tried). It does  give a glowy / dewy finish after absorbed,  but so far nothing I haven’t gotten from cheaper serums I’m sorry to say! I’m hoping after longer use I will notice more noticeable results.
