Definitely my favourite vitamin c moisturizer that I have used! I love the pump, limits contact with oxygen that can make many vitamin c products go bad quickly! My only issue was a bit of sensitivity but my skin is very sensitive and it didnâ€™t lead to any actual issues and did not last long either so will continue using! Love it!
