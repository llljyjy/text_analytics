Used it for the first time tonight. Burned slightly when I put it on and made my skin feel dry and tight. The scent was so incredibly overwhelming that after 10 minutes I had to wash it off and redo my evening skincare routine. I have oily, sensitive skin and even after washing it off my skin still feels off. nan
