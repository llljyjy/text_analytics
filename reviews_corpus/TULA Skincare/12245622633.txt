I received this tula beauty sleep overnight treatment complimentary from #influencer and #tula in exchange for my honest review. First of what I didn’t like about this product would definitely be the smell. It had a strong smell to it and it’s very unpleasant. If I had to describe it I’d probably say it smells spoiled. Other than the smell I love the product. I love how it feels on my face and I love how my face feels so refreshed and hydrated when I wake up in the morning. If you can get over the smell this is a wonderful product. Ive been using this product for about 2 weeks now and my face is looking so glowy and beautiful.I would recommend this product if your looking for something to make your face feel absolutely amazing. This product has some really impressive ingredients as well. nan
