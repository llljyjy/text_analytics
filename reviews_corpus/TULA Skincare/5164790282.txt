I liked the texture of this scrub, itâ€™s gritty but dissolves away because of the sugar without leaving any sandy residue behind. However I did find that scent was stronger than I would have preferred, not displeasing but strong. I also found that while my skin felt softer it also appeared significantly more oily than normal as the day progressed. nan
