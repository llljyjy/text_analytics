The description boasts that this has what I love about retinol, but without the irritation. True, it’s totally non-irritating (so I can use it on my neck too - bonus!) but I don’t think it works as hard as my trusty retinol. That said, my skin feels smooth, I like how easily this absorbs in to my skin, and it’s totally unscented. All good things in my book! nan
