I have tried a lot of eye creams and none have worked as well as this one! It has caused me no irritation and feels very moisturizing. I have noticed my significant dark circles have reduced moderately while using this cream! The only thing I dislike about it is that the cream doesn’t absorb well if you don’t pat/blend it in well, but that can be fixed easily. A little goes a long way with it so it definitely is worth the price. If you struggle with dark undereye circles this might be worth trying! I received this free to sample and I will be buying more when I run out. Reduced my dark circles!
