This moisturizer is great for brightening. After a few uses I noticed my dark spots were lighter and my skin had also appeared to be glowing and smoother. However, this product is not the most moisturizing for my dry skin and the pump does not always administer the product consistently. It is on the pricier size but there is a lot of product in the container so it lasts a while. nan
