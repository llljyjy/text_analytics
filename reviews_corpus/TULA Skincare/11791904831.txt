I was already a Tula fanatic before receiving this eye cream. This cream just solidified my love for Tula! The consistency is perfect for an eye cream, not much of a smell, it’s affordable and I love the push down application. You dont need a lot of product so it will last a long time. I do notice a more firm appearance under my eyes but I’m really excited that it doesn’t burn when it gets in my eyes lol. Tula is IT!!
