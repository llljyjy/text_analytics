This toner did exactly what I expected it to do. It refreshed my skin and left my face feeling clean. I didnâ€™t notice any difference in texture or clarity or any real skin benefits from use. But it did exactly what I expect from a toner before skin care application. It dried down great with no sticky or residue feeling. I love the Tula exfoliating cleanser and this product did not disappoint either. Great toner
