i was never someone that uses a toner with my skincare routine but after trying this i think i will be. i typically have really sensitive skin so i was hesitant to try this but it didn’t irritate me at all! i love the gel consistency- mess free. i’ve only been using it for a month but my skin does feel/look a little bit better. can’t wait to see how it looks after continuing to use it nan
