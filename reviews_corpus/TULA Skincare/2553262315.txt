This is a convenient travel set that comes with everything you need for a getaway! Individually I wasn’t blown away by any product other than the exfoliator, but when I used everything together my skin felt very smooth and soft! The exfoliator is really unique, the sugar dissolves quickly which I found prevented me from over exfoliating. It also smells nice and fruity! The vitamin c drops did sting my face, so I probably won’t continue using them. I found the cleanser and moisturizer to both be pretty average. The cleanser has a strong perfumey soap smell which wasn’t my favorite. Overall I think this is great if you love tula and need small products on the go! Personally the only product I would purchase alone is the exfoliator. Nice for traveling
