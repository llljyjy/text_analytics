This product is really interesting - at first I wasn’t sure I would like it, but it’s grown on me! The gel consistency is a bit weird and chunky, but it blends in pretty nicely. I was also surprised by how shimmery it is, you definitely notice it a bit in the sun, but who doesn’t like a good glow? It seems to do what it says and leaves my skin feeling soft and not greasy :) A nice sunscreen, consistency is odd
