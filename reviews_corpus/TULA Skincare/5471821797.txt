Overall, this sunscreen is awesome! It’s pretty lightweight and doesn’t leave a white sheen on your face, but leaves a little dewy glow. The only downside is that it still smells strongly like a sunscreen, so I would say it isn’t for everyday use, but works well under makeup on days you know you will be in the sun for a long period! nan
