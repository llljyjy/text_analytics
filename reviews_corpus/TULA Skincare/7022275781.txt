I use moisturizers every morning and night time on my face and have been doing so for the past 20 years, I’m . 38 now. With all the moisturizers that I have used, this definitely ranks in my top five. I was using it every morning and night for the past 10 days and by day three I started to notice that my skin didnt ppear to be oily when I had it on, and it felt so waitlist. Also, I really love the scent. The only thing I don’t like about it is that it doesn’t come with a pump. It comes when you have to put your fingers inside. I just feel like it’s more sanitary when it comes the other way. I’ll definitely be buying this again once this is done, but they do give you a ton of product. I highly recommend this to either sex. Great, all around face moisturizer
