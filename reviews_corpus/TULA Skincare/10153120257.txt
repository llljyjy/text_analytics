I received this serum to try as a part of Influenster. I’ve been using this product and unfortunately it’s just not a winner for me. The scent - while strong cucumber smell - does not bother me. It does reduce redness, but I also found with my skin, while it soothes upon application, it also tends to pull after some time and my skin was drying out after use. I am sensitive to random products so I test and try until I find something that works.  I had hopes this would be an addition to my regime. I don’t think it’s a bad product - it’s just not a match for me. nan
