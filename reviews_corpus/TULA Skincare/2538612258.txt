When I first used this I was quite shocked at much it brightened my eye area. I literally purposely kept walking by my mirror to see my face glow! With a toddler and infant at home I have very little sleep, so with a quick swipe of this stick, I actually looked like a normal person. I did not however feel any feeling of cooling, but I am ok with that! I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quick pick me up/ no makeup look. I plan to buy this again and am so happy to discover this brand! Instant brightening!
