The packaging is interesting- the push button gives you the perfect amount but I was confused on how to use it at first. The smell of this mask is a little medicinal? I don’t mind it but I could see others not liking it. The ingredients in this are great, of course. It’s thick in consistency and leaves a bit of a tacky finish on the skin. My face looked bright and fresh in the morning. I like it, but with the price point, I’m not sure I’d add it permanently to my routine. nan
