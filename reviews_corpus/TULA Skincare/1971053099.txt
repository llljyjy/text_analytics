Truly is cooling, brightening and “mess free” (easy to use). It brightens the eye area immediately, similar to how Origins’ Ginseng eye cream does. It’s a very light hydration, so I layer it on top of my usual Algenist eye cream to ensure all day hydration (layers with no pilling or weight). No scent or irritation on my sensitive skin or eyes - Will continue to repurchase does what is says!
