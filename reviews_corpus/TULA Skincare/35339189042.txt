Glad I was able to try this in exchange for a review because I’m cheap when it comes to products and never wanna take the plunge to pay full price for anything haha I have sensitive skin and surprisingly didn’t get any breakouts from any of the 4 products. (Most new skincare products will make me break out at first before getting to see any results.) so the products are definitely very gentle. The only Product Of the four that I would pay full price for, would be the serum. I absolutely loved it. Gentle skincare set perfect for travel.
