I loved this set! The packaging is perfect for travel and you get a decent amount for travel sized. The So polished exfoliating scrub was my absolute favorite product. I will be purchasing a full size immediately. I have a bit of texture on my nose and when I use this twice a week it smoothes my skin out so nicely! Iâ€™ve noticed an improvement in my foundation because of this. The cleanser was also amazing. I get PCOS hormonal acne sometimes on my jaw and chin and it cleared up most of the breakouts within a few days. Definitely recommend this set to a fellow traveler :) Perfect little travel set
