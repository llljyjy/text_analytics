I’ve been using this moisturizer for a few weeks and find that unfortunately it isn’t moisturizing enough for my dry skin. I love the subtle brightening effect that the moisturizer has and also enjoy the consistency of the product. I think this will work better for me in the summer months but unfortunately doesn’t solve my dryness throughout the winter. Good Not Great
