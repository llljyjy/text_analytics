This isn’t my favorite moisturizer but it’s not a terrible option. One thing I liked about this product was it does not leave your skin feeling greasy. The scent isn’t overpowering - it’s actually very light. I don’t know if I would purchase again simply because there are other comparable products that cost less. nan
