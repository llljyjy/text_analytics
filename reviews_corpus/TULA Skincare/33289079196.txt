I can say I was definitely lucky to receive this product in the mail from Influenster & TULA. This has made such an improvement in my skin, even after only a week of use so far. My face can get pretty oily, but since I started using these, the oil level is very well managed. My pores look and feel a lot smaller, everytime I use the pads, I can feel my pores tighten, it feels nice. My skin overall looks much brighter, revitalized. It feels purified and refreshed after every use, I love the smell of the mint, it is super relaxing. Before writing my review I was looking at the price of it, and I am so happy that there are refill containers! Can keep your container and get a refill for $11 cheaper. So in the end $36 a month (provided you are using it both in the morning and at night) is seriously an awesome deal for an amazing product! I really love the look and feel of my skin, like my blackheads aren’t as noticeable anymore! It has me curious about other TULA skincare products, I can’t wait to try out some other ones! I know I will be keeping this one in my skincare routine! New Favorite! Skin feels & looks amazing
