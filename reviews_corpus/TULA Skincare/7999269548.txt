I have combo/oily skin, it is sometimes sensitive. This serum has a liquidy texture, no smell whatsoever. Good absorption. It has been so good on my skin, doesn’t cause irritation, no rash. I’ve noticed that after application, the following morning my skin looks less texture. I can feel it softer as well. It has probiotics extracts and bakuchiol that will help with the wrinkles. I’ve never used probiotic on my skincare before and after this product I;m totally willing to try more. I’ve been using this product for the last 2-3 weeks and I will continue to use it. It is a great way to incorporate retinol in my routine. I recommend this product and even more if you want to initiate using retinol. Great Retinol alternative for sensitive skin!!
