I received this product for my honest review. I haven’t heard of Tula before and love that it’s a vegan brand. Loved the stick - keeps your hands clean, however I found it tricky to get in small creases. I was surprised at how moisturizing and long lasting it was. It held up really well under make up as well. I would buy this product! nan
