My first impression of this eye balm was that it looked and felt like a high-quality product. It came in a sleek, compact container that was easy to apply, and the formula itself was smooth and silky. I didn’t notice a strong scent, which was a plus for me since I’m sensitive to fragrances.After applying the eye balm, I immediately noticed that my under-eye area looked more hydrated and refreshed. The probiotics and hyaluronic acid seemed to work together to plump up the skin and reduce the appearance of fine lines and puffiness. After using the product for a week or so, I also noticed that the skin around my eyes looked smoother and more youthful overall.I have combination skin, and this eye balm worked well for my skin type. It wasn’t too heavy or greasy, and it didn’t cause any irritation or breakouts. Overall, I would definitely recommend this eye balm to anyone looking for a product that will help to nourish and hydrate the delicate skin around the eyes. Great deal!
