First of the batch I think the packaging of this product is very simple and sleek, no excessive packaging, which I always appreciate. Once I start trying this, the first thing I noticed is that fact that it does not irrate my eyes, which a lot of other eye creams do. It also seems to hydrate my undereye area especially well, comparing to the corner/crowsfeet part of my eyes which I think can leave up to anti-aging eye creams. Over all I would recommend this product. Some of the most refreshing eye balms I've used
