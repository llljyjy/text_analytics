I am in love with my new Tula eye replenish pro-firm overnight complex!! It’s really no surprise to me as I have been using the face wash for years and nothing can compare to how amazing it is!  They did it again with this product. It glides on your skin and soaks in so smoothly.  It makes my skin fill amazing. My skin looks healthier and plumper after use.  It doesn’t leave my skin with any break outs either. I love that it has probiotics in it like the face wash. Over all I’m very pleased with this product and highly recommend this and Tula brand skincare in general. It’s love for me!!
