I received this product for free from influencer. Overall, I would say it is a great product. I tend to have redness in my t zone and around my cheeks as this product does a good job of reducing it. I tend to break out when using new products and it did not break me out at all thankfully. Feels great on my skin and doesnâ€™t pill when using it in combination with other skincare products. After using it for 3 weeks I have noticed it has reduced a bit of the redness as well. Definitely give it a try if you have acne prone / sensitive skin! Great product
