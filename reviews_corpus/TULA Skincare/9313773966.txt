I really like this cream and how it comes out of jar. It feels so soothing when applied. I did notice that the area is more prone to sunburn as I’ve gotten burns and peeling skin twice since I’ve started using this. Since I’m at the beach and playing volleyball a lot I’m using it less then i used to in the hopes that it helps. nan
