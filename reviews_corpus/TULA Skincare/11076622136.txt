I received this for free from Influenster but this does not affect my review of this product. I have used this product for three weeks so I have had time to play with this serum. A good amount of product comes out with one pump. This is a thicker serum that feels like a light weight moisturizer and thick in consistency. It has a light clean scent but nothing off putting and disappears as soon you put it on. I have noticed very little brightening effect but other than that I haven’t noticed any of the effects the serum has claimed to be. It’s not sticky once you put it on and dries into a slightly dewy skin finish. Is it illuminating as soon as you put it on? No. Overall a nice product, but I don’t think it is worth the price for what it claims. It is nice but did not see any noticeable effect
