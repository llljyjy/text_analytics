**I received this product free, courtesy of Influenster, for review**After an eternity, my Tula product was awaiting me in my mailbox today! After I showered, cleansed, and dried off, I applied this product. It’s a weird color, haha, but don’t let that put you off! Goes on transparent and my skin feels rejuvenated after using it just once! Can’t wait to continue using it, honestly. I have other Tula products in my personal care items, and they are worth every cent. nan
