Been using this for a few weeks now and it’s definitely a better everyday/every other day mask. It leaves my skin feeling glowy and fresh. I noticed a bit of irritation so I just stopped applying it in the areas I got irritation.Here are some things I wish Tula incorporated on the bottle:- the AHA percentage! Although I felt tingling when applying it I had no idea what my skin was in for and how it compared to other AHA masks that have the percentage on it. Would be helpful for others with sensitive skin.- more thorough application instructions. Didn’t know if I should apply 1 pump or 5. good for weekly use, packaging could be better
