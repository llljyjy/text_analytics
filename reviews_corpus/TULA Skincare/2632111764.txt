One of the major perks to this moisturizer is having my vitamin C and moisturizer combined into one product. Some mornings are so busy that I tend to neglect my routine a little but this product is nice for saving time! I have combo and acne prone skin and this doesn’t irritate or currently feel too heavy on my skin. It absorbs nicely and leaves my skin looking a little more glowy and healthier. It has an orange scent, I like it but some people may find it too strong if they’re sensitive to scents. I think this is a nice moisturizer and I am happy I was given the opportunity to try it out free. I do think it will be a bit too heavy on my skin during summer though. If you have oily skin - you may not like the texture & find it too heavy for your skin. Overall, I really enjoy this but the price point makes me hesitant to say I would repurchase. nan
