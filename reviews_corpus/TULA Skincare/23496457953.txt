I’ve used this product nightly for about two weeks now. I am not quite sure if I like it just yet or not. It is different from a typical toner, as it is thicker, almost gel-like in texture. But I do find that it absorbs into the cotton pad so I have to use more than usual. My face feels very clean after use, but I found after starting to integrate this into my skincare routine, I began to experience breakouts. I don’t know if my skin is purging but they were deep and painful pimples. I am hoping to continue use as I believe in the benefits of glycolic acid, but will likely discontinue if the breakouts continue. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. nan
