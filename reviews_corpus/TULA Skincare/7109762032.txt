I received this serum from a campaign through Influenster, and I am so happy that I did. I have never tried TULA skincare before, or probiotic skincare, so I was really excited to try this stuff. I have been applying this serum every morning for the past two weeks as a part of my AM routine and I have notice visible differences to my skin. I have combination skin and immediately, after use, my skin feels more firm and looks nice and glowy. After using this product for the past two weeks the texture of my skin has also drastically improved. At first, I was not a huge fan of the scent, but the more I use it, it does not bother me at all anymore, and I truly love it is a non-comedogenic product. I am excited to explore other TULA products in the future. Great Morning Serum
