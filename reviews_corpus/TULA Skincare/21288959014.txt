I was very excited to try this product, I love that it comes in a tube and is very easy to apply. I have problems with puffy eyes in the morning and after a week of using the tula product , the puffy eyes are gone. I have been using the tula eye balm morning and night and have already seen amazing results , I can’t wait to try other products in the tula line. I also love the natural ingredients and this is my first time using a probiotic in my skin routine and I’m very impressed so far. No more puffy eyes
