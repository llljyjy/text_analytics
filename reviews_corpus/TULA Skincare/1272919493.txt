SOO good!!! So I am definitely a sunscreen addict. I do tend towards a higher SPF than this- I look for SPF40+, usually. But that said, this Tula one is so amazing, I will deal with the SPF 30 because the glow it gives is insane. It’s kinda a weird texture on your fingers- like a gel with little balls in it, idk hard to describe. But as soon as it touches your face it literally melts in. Feels weightless. I have oily skin, & while this is glowy AF, it’s not at all greasy & didn’t increased my oil production. No scent to it. Absolutely no white cast at all. Works flawlessly under makeup. Is now my go-to for days when I want a more luminous look. Which is most days lately. Pic is just after a.m. skin care routine and Tula Protect & Glow. Truly Amazing.
