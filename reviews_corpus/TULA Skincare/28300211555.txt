I got this product from Influence for free to exchange my honest review. I never heard or know anything about this brand Tula until now. I didnâ€™t have much expectations for this moisture but it change mind mine it keeps my skin moisture for almost a whole day. The scent is a very light with orange vanilla scent. The package is cute too easy to bring with me everywhere I go nan
