I loved the smell, the feel, the over all look! My skin feels so soft after a shower or washing my face when I apply Tula. I have combo skin but it usually feels dry after a shower, this makes my skin feel awesome. The smell is a definite plus! And itâ€™s not oily, which a lot of face creams are. I would definitely recommend! Definitely Keeping This In My Routine!
