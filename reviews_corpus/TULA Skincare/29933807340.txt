This exfoliator has a sweet smell, with a powerful scrubbing power. I have combination skin that leans more oily in the summer with extreme dryness in the winter and with the season changing it has been very flip floppy. I tried this product for a month and had no issues and it left my skin feeling very clean. I have super sensitive skin so I did end up with some redness immediately after using but that went away quick. As a firefighter I am always looking for the best way to scrub potentially dangerous substances off of my face and skin and this does the trick without being too damaging, nor does it have the strong scent that most products do. nan
