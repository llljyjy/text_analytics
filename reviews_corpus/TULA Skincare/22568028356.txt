I received this product free in exchange for my review from Influenster. I LOVE this product. Normally I wouldnâ€™t splurge on something quite so expensive but this may have changed my perspective on the value of a quality product. The smell is lovely and the packaging is so aesthetically pleasing. It is very smooth and in between light and thick making it easy to apply. I was very excited to try a Tula product and will be happy to continue using it as part of my daily routine! Perfect product
