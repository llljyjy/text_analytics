I’m very impressed by this sunscreen! I didn’t think I’d like it more than the one I currently use but I think I honestly like this one more. There’s no white cast which is one of the best aspects of this product. I have sensitive skin and it didn’t cause any irritation or break me out, it actually evened out my skin a bit. It also was very moisturizing and left my skin with a nice healthy glow while also being lightweight. There’s no smell that I can detect which I love! It’s a nice compact bottle that I think would be great for traveling or just having with you on the go. I also love that it protects against both UVA and UVB rays. I would definitely recommend giving this sunscreen a shot! New favorite!
