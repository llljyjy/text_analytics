I tried this moisturizer with high expectations and it didn’t deliver that to me personally. I found this cream so light weight that after applying it I didn’t feel very hydrated for the remainder of the day. I also feel the cream head a funny smell to me and didn’t find that very pleasant upon application. I did however enjoy the packing as it was very easy to dispense. I feel at such a high price the product inside should of been a lot more impactful. nan
