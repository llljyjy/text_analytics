The applicator is like a glue stick that is applied under your eye. I like it, however it is hard to get it close enough to the eye because of the size. The product itself feels a little sticky but goes on easily and isnâ€™t too greasy. Hard to know if it will produce long term benefits but I like what this brand stands for and their selection of ingredients they avoid. Interesting new way to apply moisturizer
