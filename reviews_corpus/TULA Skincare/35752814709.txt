At first the consistency of this sunscreen kindof scared me, but after using it for about a week I honestly fell in love, it makes my skin glow and not in an oily way, the smell is not too strong, and my face has not got sunburnt at all! It is now one of my must haves for morning skin care! Don't worry about the consistency!
