I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and have really noticed a difference in my problem areas, specifically my nose and chin. I would consistently get black heads that I couldn’t get rid of in the past. Over the last 2 weeks however I have noticed a change in those areas, with less and less black heads showing up after the past 6 uses. Now that i am seeing the results I will likely be bring it down to 2 times a week just to maintain these results.I haven’t used much of the bottle either as I use about a dime size amount and just focus on my chin and nose when I’m using it, so I feel I will get many uses out of the product as well.Oh also if you are someone who likes smells this smells absolutely amazing, I can’t quite place the smell but it is fruity and delicious smelling. Even my boyfriend has made the comment of how nice it smells when he has come in during my skincare routine.Highly recommend buying if you are in need of a product that will actually eliminate trouble blackheads. nan
