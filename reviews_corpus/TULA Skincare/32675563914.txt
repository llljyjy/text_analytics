Underwhelming. I normally don’t like physical exfoliators anyway because they’re way too harsh on your skin!! I don’t have a single blackhead either though lol so I feel like I am not the best judge of this. But it doesn’t do anything it feels like I’m rubbing on a product and washing it off and nothing happens. Meh. Skippable
