I’ve been using this product for almost a month now.  My face is super sensitive and My face didn’t react to it which is a plus! There is a small scent to this face cream, but it’s like fresh bubble gum scent, so I didn’t bother me much as I can’t handle with strong scented products.At first I feel like this face cream didn’t do much, but after 3 weeks of using it day and night, I notice the difference to my face.  I feel that my face is firmer than before. This cream is super moisturize, a full pump might seem a bit too heavy for the face.  I do use it morning and night, right now it’s still winter/spring and it seems good. But  I think this might be a bit much to use  in the morning in the summer. Even though the price is a bit expensive, but I think it’s totally worth it! nan
