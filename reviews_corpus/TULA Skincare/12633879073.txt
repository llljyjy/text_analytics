I never used an overnight repair treatment before but I really liked using this. I tried to use it everyday for 2 weeks and I did notice a difference. My skin felt a little bit smoother and I feel like my skin brightened up too. I also really enjoy the smell of the product too, wasnâ€™t too heavy in fragrance but enough for me to enjoy it. Pretty great
