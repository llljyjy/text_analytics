The colour and scent and the packaging of this product is beautiful. I used this product for the past 2 weeks every morning and love how it goes on my skin after serums and before my sunscreen. I am not sure if I see any huge changes with my skin but as a moisturizer it does its job of keeping my skin hydrated throughout the day. Lovely scent and packaging.
