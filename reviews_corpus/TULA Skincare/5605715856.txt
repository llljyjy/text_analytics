Very cooling and refreshing for the eyes. It does leave some shimmer/luminosity behind in an area that doesn’t always benefit from that, so use concealer afterwards if that’s a concern for you. I would prefer a more gel-like consistency to make this a holy grail for me. Overall it’s a great product to have in your bag for when your eyes need a pick me up at the end of a long day. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. nan
