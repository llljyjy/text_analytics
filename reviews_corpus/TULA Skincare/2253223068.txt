The first time I tried it I loved it so much!  It was cooling instantly and felt very refreshing. After using it for about a month I noticed the cooking sensation no longer effects me. I still love the glow I receive and the instant moisturizing from it. I don’t think it hid a my dark circles, but I’m not expecting it to. The shimmer on it is really nice and not over powering. Love it!
