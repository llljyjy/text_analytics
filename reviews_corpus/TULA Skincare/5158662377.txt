I was nervous about burning or breaking out after reading reviews, but I LOVE these drops. My post-acne dark marks have faded a ton since I have been using this daily (~2 months) and I love the glow right after application. For context, my skin-type is combo and acne-prone (especially hormonal acne on my cheeks/jawline) and I have medium-tan skin (South Asian descent).Current AM routine after cleansing (which also proves I have no brand allegiance and am not being paid for this review lol):1) 4 drops of this product, which provides enough product to cover my face and neck. Wait ~5 min before next step to ensure this is fully absorbed2) Sometimes (if feeling dry that morning): The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA moisturizer3) Always: 3 pumps of the Live Tinted Hueguard sunscreen with 1-2 drops of the Drunk Elephant D-Bronzi drops mixed in the palm of my hand. This is *such* a great combo and gives such a fantastic glow. D-Bronzi might seem pricey for the volume/unnecessary, but it lasts forever when only using 1-2 drops/day4) If wearing make-up and want to ensure it stays on all day, I’ll follow this with the NYX Plump Right Back Electrolytes Plumping Primer Serum (after waiting for a few minutes post-sunscreen application). This product has some fragrance in it, which in general I hate, but I haven’t had any breakout issues with it and it provides great grip for my makeup.Combo above has never resulted in pilling for me! Fades post-acne dark marks!!!
