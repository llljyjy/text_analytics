Wow! I have tried a few eye creams ranging from $100, to $12, but this is by far the most hydrating. I started using this about 3 weeks ago and I definitely notice a difference, my under eyes look brighter and when applying my concealer, it seems to crease less. The packaging is also great, itâ€™s a pump and helps keep bacteria out and keep the ingredients fresh. I will definitely repurchase this eye cream. So good
