Other reviews mention that this product is not something that actually provides much of a positive cosmetic effect when you’re talking about mixing it with makeup. I certainly would not put this over foundation to brighten the under-eyes, as recommended on the packaging. It is *very* shiny, and it dries down to leave a bit of a residue.That said, I didn’t buy it for that. I just wanted something that would feel nice on my hot/puffy eye area in the morning (allergy issue). The serum is very nice and it does feel very cooling. It doesn’t have much of a scent. It is *very* shiny. If I want to wear it out of the house, I put a tinted moisturizer over top (Laura Mercier Light Revealer).I put this on underneath some of my physical undereye patches that do not have much of a cooling effect (Grace & Stella, Amazon) that I keep in the fridge, and it made them feel much better on my skin. One of the benefits to a stick based eye cooling balm is that you can put it anywhere. I place it under my brow bone or on my neck, as I also get puffiness there. Cooling, but doesn't play well with others
