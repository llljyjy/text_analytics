I have very dry skin, especially in the winter time, so I was so excited to try this moisturizer!First off, I love the smell of this moisturizer. It is very lightly scented, which is perfect to me. It’s got a slight floral, slight fruity scent that is great. Next, the texture. It’s slightly thicker than what I usually expect with a moisturizer. I expected it to be thick and greasy, but it wasn’t at all. It went on thick but was very easy to smooth all over your face. It left a slight tack behind but only for a minute or two until it dried. It was not greasy or slick feeling on your face at all. I’ve been using this day and night for a week, and I love it. I like it more as a night cream than a day cream due to the thickness of it, but it can definitely be used for both. The perpetual dry spot on my face has cleared up as well, which is really hard to do (I’ve used other “intense” moisturizers that didn’t even touch it). And again, I love the light smell! It makes me happy to use it every night. I give it 4 stars because it is just a little too thick to be perfect IMO. Great night time moisturizer
