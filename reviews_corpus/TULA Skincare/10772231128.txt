Received as part of the #TulaVoxbox from Influenster campaign. I was skeptic at first on how this eye balm would work as I’m pretty low maintenance, but I honestly love how easy it is to use before bed or if I need an early morning pick me up to look refreshed.I have pretty sensitive skin so I like how Tula uses products free from formaldehyde and sulfates.It’s dairy, gluten and cruelty free so I will definitely be checking out more of this brands products. Made a believer out a skeptic
