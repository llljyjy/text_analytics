This eye brightening balm is a really fun and cool (literally) way to perk up tired and puffy eyes. It leaves a reflective and highlighted finish that really reduces the look of fine lines in pictures. I found that it did settle into lines a bit and after time made them look more obvious though. The cooling effect felt kind of neat but it also felt a bit odd and wet if I used too much. I think it helped a little with superficial depuffing first thing in the AM. I found that it needed to be used on bare, dry skin only or else it would pill badly. I liked the idea of reapplying over makeup during the day but it didnâ€™t work for me. Fun way to brighten up the under eye area
