I LOVE THE PRODUCT but hear me out for the one-star missing. it’s a great product to swipe on I’m always on the go so I find it’s quick and easy to apply and it does help with the bag. the only thing is it can make your under-eye bag appear greasy until they get puffier. so if you need to apply it and go you might not like the effect it has under your eye and I found myself having to wipe it off before heading out sometimes because it was drawing too much attention to the flaws I was trying to get rid of! otherwise amazing product great before bed I wake up and have such a glow I love it! Amazing!
