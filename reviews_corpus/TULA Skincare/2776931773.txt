This was first time using Tula and they were nice products but did not blow me away. My main issue with this travel set is the sizes of the products!!! The cleanser is huge and the scrub is so tiny (I understand scrubs are used less). But Iâ€™m talking like realllyyyy tiny. Overall I liked the products but I would not recommend this set for the price due to only 2 decent travel size products and other 2 (scrub and vitamin c serum) felt more like sample sizes. Think 100 point rewards. nan
