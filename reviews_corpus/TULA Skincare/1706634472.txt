I love this travel set! I received this at the perfect time as we were going to a 3-day trip and it came with everything I need for traveling. The cleanser smelled really good like a baby product. Hehe! And the scrub had a fruity scent to it! The moisturizer does a great job at hydrating my face and the serum is an extra bonus for my pampering needs. Definitely recommend this for traveling. Wished it came with a small bag. But all in all, love it!! Perfect for your travel needs
