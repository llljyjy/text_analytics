I received this from Influencer to test in exchange for my honest opinions. I typically have dry skin with dark under eye circles thanks to motherhood and genetics. This was my first time trying an eye product from Tula and I’m beyond impressed. I love the container/dispenser. It allows you to dispense the exact amount you need without the waste or making a mess. I have been using this every night faithfully before bed and my skin just loves it. This is a smooth and thicker eye cream. Doesn’t have much of a scent. It absorbs very well and doesn’t leave a greasy feeling.  When I wake in the morning, my skin is so soft and plump looking. I love that this eye cream has probiotics and peptides. I definitely recommend this product. If you’re looking for a new night time eye cream, check this out. You won’t be disappointed.
