Very rich, thick, creamy yet light cream for your eyes. If it wasnâ€™t for this review I would not have seen the video of how to apply it properly. It does not have much instruction on the actual bottle or box. I had been applying to my under eye corner and top little realize it should only be the under eye and may be a little on the top. The applicator does give you way too much product so only squish down just a little bit on the top. A very little goes a long way! I think it is great and I do see a difference in my eyes in the morning. I am definitely less puffy and less  tired looking. Great product for new eyes!
