So- i love this balm but if you’re expecting miracles book at the Botox place for the under eye injections. Nothing you put on your skin will fix your issues to perfection. I have evil pits under my eyes. They are dark. They are scary. And now I’m aging so they get wrinkly and crease the concealer I have depended on my entire life to avoid the ‘are you tired’ question. I like this because it feels nice. It’s got a coolness. It’s instantly a little drink for my skin which can get dry- and it seems to help my skin then crease less. If I am not wearing makeup, the little sheen helps reflect light, my dark under eye looks less ridiculous. I have put it over makeup a bit, and one of my cake-ier concealers seemed to get a bit worse but I think that’s something I just need to know. It goes over make up and under well. I haven’t gotten through the whole tube, but I like it enough that I may buy this again- it’s also a nice solid stick that moisturizers so I may also have used it on some dry spots on my flight, because I didn’t have hand lotion. I received these products for free from Influenster and brand(s) in exchange for my honest review.- I use the Influenster app and you are asked to be honest about things. I have 0 problem with that! I’m not blue for you!
