This eye balm/stick highlighter is a really cool product (pun intended)! If you get dry skin around your eyes or like the feeling of something cool on your face when youâ€™re tired, then this is a great option to throw in your purse and use throughout the day. I also like that it doubles as a stick highlighter with a luminous and slightly frosty sheen. It did not do much for me in terms of fine lines but it felt nice. I have not tried it over makeup but it does well on bare skin. I do find it a bit pricey for the size. nan
