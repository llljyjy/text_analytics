I was gifted this product by Tula & Influenster to try out and give an honest review. I tried it for a couple of night and it was ok. The scent is very odd, not my favorite. The texture is light, will glide on your skin and rapidly absorb leaving no sticky feeling. I haven’t noticed any difference in my fine lines but I haven’t really incorporated it into my skincare routine. Then again, my skin feels plump and tight whenever I use it. It’s alright!
