Great product. I have this moisturizer in my beauty weekly rotation or product lines. I use the Tula line if my skin needs some extra hydration after having used acids. Absorbs into skin like a charm. Gives a nice natural, non sticky glow. Does not congest skin, but rather helps heal skin. Great moisturizer for combo skin
