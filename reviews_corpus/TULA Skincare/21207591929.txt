I received this product like many other on a VoxBox campaign. I always wait as Ling as possible to post a review because I want to actually try to product, not just post. I was very impressed with this stuff. It brightened my complexion, is a soft non harsh formula and isnâ€™t overwhelming in scent. It did help my dark spots over time and was amazing under foundations and other serums. Would definitely recommend and buy myself when this one is done! Great formula!
