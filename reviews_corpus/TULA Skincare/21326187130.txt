This eye balm is pretty unique! I found that it is very good to use during the day because it is very lightweight and does not leave a greasy residue. It is also very easy to apply with a single swipe under each eye. I wouldnâ€™t say that I noticed a difference in brightness, but I did notice hydration in my skin. Great to use during the day!
