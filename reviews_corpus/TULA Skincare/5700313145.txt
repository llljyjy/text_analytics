I received this product for free to review. This eye cream is creamy and very hydrating. Has a cool effect on the skin which is so nice. Don’t care for the smell but didn’t stay long. The smell is from the natural ingredients. I will continued to use this product to see if there is a difference. So far I like how my under eye skin feels. Looks very hydrated even after first use. I would recommend this product if people are looking for very hydrated creams for under the eyes. Creamy and hydration
