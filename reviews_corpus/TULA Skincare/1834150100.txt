I thoroughly enjoyed using this product. It didn’t cause any reaction to my skin, was very soothing and was great under moisturizer. It calmed any parts on my skin that were irritated and didn’t cause any breakouts. It is absorbed super quickly into the skin. It has a slight scent although a little too artificial for my liking (cucumber scented). I would have preferred no scent. Overall, a great product and would highly recommend for someone looking for an easy go-to serum. Great for sensitive skin
