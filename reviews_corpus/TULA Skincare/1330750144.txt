I have searched high and low for that perfect face sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white cast, doesn’t feel too thick, doesn’t break me out, doesn’t look weird under make up, doesn’t ball up, isn’t too matte yet doesn’t make me look like an oil slick. I’ve tried so many and this is the perfect one. It truly is invisible yet still feels comfortable. I really wish it didn’t have orange peel (I don’t like any fragrance on my face, natural or synthetic) but since it is so incredibly hard to find a sunscreen that feels and looks like this, I’ll bite the bullet. It really is *that* good. nan
