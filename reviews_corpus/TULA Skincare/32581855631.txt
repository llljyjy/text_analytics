This is my first time using an under eye balm (I’ve always used roll-on’s) I like it! The cooling sensation lasts for quite a while. Others go away in a minute or two. The TULA feels like it’s working for atleast 30 minutes. Definitely recommend for anyone who enjoys waking up with an eye refresher!! First eye balm, like it better than the roll on’s!
