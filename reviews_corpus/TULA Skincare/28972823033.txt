Super excited to get to try out this eye balm! I love a good eye product! Packaging is cute and the stick format makes it easy and mess free to apply. I tried it as part of my skin care routine as well as overtop of makeup. All in all it’s a good shimmery, silver based (brightening) highlight. I wish there was more of a cooling effect and would say that it had nothing to offer me with regards to skin care. Worked well as a highlight and blended nicely into makeup although it’s definitely a finishing touch kind of product as the effect is very subtle. Good for a midday pick me up. nan
