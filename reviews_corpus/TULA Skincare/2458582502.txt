I had high hopes after receiving this from Influenster to review. The price point is much steeper than my usual skincare budget, so I was excited to see some great results.This moisturizer is good, but not a must-have by any means. I like the hygienic pump dispenser. It has a really delightful citrusy scent that isnâ€™t overwhelming. The consistency is smooth and buttery without feeling too heavy on the skin. I did see some slight brightening results after about a month of consistent use.However, I feel that there are similar products that perform just as well, for half the price. But if you have the budget to splurge on this, by all means go for it! Good, Not Great
