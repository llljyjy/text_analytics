I’m enjoying this moisturizer so far. I have very dry, very sensitive skin and it seems to be pretty good for me. It absorbs well and dries down a bit more satin-matte than some of my other most-hydrating moisturizers. I think this will be fine for me during the day in the summer months, but isn’t quite rich enough for my incredibly dry skin during our Canadian winters. I really like the sanitary, pump dispenser. Be warned that this product does have a bit of a scent that I can’t quite place though - perhaps almost like candy? Nice moisturizer!
