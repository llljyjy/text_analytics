I received this to try from Influenster. Loving this so far. It makes my skin feel refreshed and brighter immediately. I will be incorporating it into my routine once a week and can’t wait to see even better results. It tingles at first once you put it on but then is very comfortable as it dries down. This is my first time trying Tula and skincare with probiotics, can’t wait to check out the rest of the line. Skin feels so good!!
