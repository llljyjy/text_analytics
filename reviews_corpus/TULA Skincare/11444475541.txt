Received this product for testing ! Using it for over a month it works like a charm ! Recommending this to everyone . One of the best products I have tried recently . . The formula is light dries down quick and leaves the skin very soft! I love using this product especially after a long night for obvious reasons of having puffy eyes but also because of the caffeine used in this product (coming from tea!) and the cooling sensation.I would recommend though try it on a small patch of your skin before you apply under eyes as you might be allergic to it as my friend was ! Giving 4 stars as my friend got rashes using this cream. recommended
