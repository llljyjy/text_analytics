So glad I ordered this. I saw a TikTok recommending it and the price wasn’t bad so I thought why not. It makes my skin feel soooo smooth like I just had a facial or light peel. I feel like the only negative reviews are about the scent. The scent isn’t that bad, it does smell like fancy hotel soap but that doesn’t bother me. I’ll trade crazy smooth skin for a light scent. I’ve been using it just at night since some of the reviews said it dried them out using it twice a day, and I look forward to washing my face every night with this. obsessed
