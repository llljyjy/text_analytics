I never knew I needed an eye cream in my skincare routine before trying this product - it is just amazing! I love the slick packaging, and the application is so smooth. The product is scentless which is perfect for someone like me who has sensitive skin. I like to apply it after my serum before moisturizer twice a day.I didn’t see much difference first week but now I never skip it because it makes my eyes feel more hydrated and look less tired. The only thing is try avoiding makeup application right after using the eye balm because it makes it more difficult, but other than that - I definitely recommend the product, especially if it’s your first eye product. Easy to use and effective!
