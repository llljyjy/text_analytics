I recieved the this product from Influenster to test and review. This moisturizer is a medium thickness - not too thick or too light. The temps haven’t been high enough to know whether this will stand the hot and humid weather we get here in the summer, but so far so good. It seems to sit under light makeup just fine and my skin isn’t parched after wearing it to bed at night. I love the packaging colour and pump (but will possibly take that back when I’m nearing the end of the product). It has a light orange creamsicle smell that I personally like but be aware if you don’t like scent. I really only smell it while I’m putting it on and it doesn’t seem to linger. nan
