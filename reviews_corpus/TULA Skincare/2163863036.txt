When I first opened it the thickness of the cream did putme off a bit, but that being said, I can layer it with a serumand it doesn’t feel heavy or take long for it to sink into yourskin. I have a few dry spots and texture on my cheeks but Ihaven’t noticed any face cream that’s fixed this, includingthis one.I really like the smell, it’s citrus-y and fresh, but notoverwhelming, once it’s absorbed the smell doesn’t linger.My biggest annoyance with this packaging is that the littlenozzle it comes out of clogs between uses.I like the moisturizer itself, a big plus is that I can use itmultiple times throughout the day and it doesn’t do thatnasty thing where it leaves a film so if you touch your faceor put makeup on top it clumps up and pills. I wouldrecommend it for any skin type since it is a thicker gelformula, I think it would work just as well for dry v. oily skin,but I don’t think I’ve been using it enough to see asignificant difference in my skin’s texture/ dullness.Overall I would buy this, when I first saw the retail price Ididn’t think it was worth it- but after using it for a fewweeks you only need one pump and it’s enough for theface and neck land the bottle is pretty big) whereas otherless expensive moisturizers I own, you’d need 4-5 pumps. nan
