I really  love this under eye cream it was creamy not to thick not to thin it I noticed that in the morning all the product was gone and my under eyes felt very crisp and refreshed and I also noticed my eyes had been de puffed up it had chamomile and this  helps with fine line ,wrinkles and crows  feet I love the way the bottle is designed and how the dispenser items supe easy and fast it’s good for oily skin ,combo,dry and aged skin I’ve only been using it for 2 weeks and personally dont have any wrinkles as of yet but I think it will be a good protect for the future  but I do have puffiness under my eyes so it definitely saw results on that I definitely recommend you to try it out and maybe this could be a product for you Love it
