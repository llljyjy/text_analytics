I received this free from Influenster to test. I am really liking it so far! It is moisturizing and absorbs quickly. I havenâ€™t used it long enough to test out the effects of the vitamin c but so far it is nice. It smells really good too! Like orange creamsicles! It might not be the right choice for oily skin though. Delightful!
