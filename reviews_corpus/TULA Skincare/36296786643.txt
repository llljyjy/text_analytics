Finally found a moisturizer that works for my combination skin. I apply it before bed and before applying my makeup and have found a noticeable difference to my skins overall hydration and appearance.

The only reason I can’t give this a full five star rating is because as nice the packaging is, I feel there will be wasted product and it’s a lot of plastic. Quenched my thirsty skin
