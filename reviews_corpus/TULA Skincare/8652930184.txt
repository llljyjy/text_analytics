I received this product from the Influenster app in exchange for an honest review. I loved this under eye serum!The formula feels lightweight, non greasy and is scent-free. It immediately soaked into my skin without leaving a residue behind. I usually cannot use anything close to my eyes as they get easily irritated but this serum didnâ€™t irritate anything! I noticed my under eyes feeling hydrated, soft and less puffy so I definitely saw a change in the few weeks I have started using it. I really liked the cool, unique metal applicator of this serum too! It added to the cooling feeling of the product and easily glided on my skin. I loved this product and it made a great addition to my skincare routine. The fact that Tula Skincare is clean and cruelty free is also amazing so awesome product overall!
