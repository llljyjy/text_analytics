I received this free from Influencer and TULA to try for my honest review and honestly I LOVE it. It does have a bit of an orange scent to it but it doesn’t bother me. It’s orange in color and is creamy. I find it makes my face a little red when I first apply it but it’s never made me break out and it has definitely brightening my complexion. I have used it every day since I recieved it and I don’t find it to be greasy it’s perfect! My new favorite!
