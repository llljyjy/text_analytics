I recieved this product for free from Influenster to review. I was excited to give this a try, the size is fantastic 1.7oz, you get more product than most serums (1.0oz)! The packaging looks great and it’s easy to use and easy to layer with other products. There’s a mild smell but I don’t find it over powering at all. One thing to be aware of is that there are some essential oils in the product that may be irritating to some. I have more sensitive skin, this serum sometimes caused some irritation on my face, possibke when used with active ingredients. But I’m able to use it everyday on my neck and chest. Overall it’s a great product and I would recommend it! nan
