I’m in love with this sunscreen! I am already a big fan of tula products and this one is no different from all the other amazing ones! It is super lightweight and doesn’t leave any white cast. It it lightly tinted in a way that I believe it works for all skin tones and a huge pro for me is that it doesn’t irritate my eyes at all. I like to apply a little bit of sunscreen on my eyelids and that is usually a problem with most sunscreens but not this one. So I’m super happy Doesn’t irritate eyes
