The Tula on-the-go best sellers kit is great for travel, as expected! I was a fan of this little set. However, I don’t think the love wasn’t mutual for the purifying face cleanser, as I was already aware that the cleanser breaks me out. I was a big fan of the exfoliating sugar scrub! It exfoliates without being too abrasive or irritating my skin. My face was nice and smooth afterwards! The brightening treatment drops helped to lighten my blemishes and acne scars - score! I quite liked the 24/7 day and night cream as well, as it added just the right amount of moisture to my skin without any residue or irritation. Over all, this little set is awesome and I would definitely recommend it! Great for travel!
