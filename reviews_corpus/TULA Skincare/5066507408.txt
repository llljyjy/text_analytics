Received this product to sample from Influenster. Had limited knowledge on the product or brand, but was interested to try. I am always willing to try new skincare products - and could certainly use a good daily spf. I really didn’t enjoy the texture or application. It had kind of a weird sparkle to the product, and it just didn’t feel or apply smoothly. I found it really interacted with my other standards ( a serum and moisturizing gel). I would not recommend this to anyone, as I would not use it. However, it may very well be a perfectly fine spf of used alone & didn’t have any adverse reaction to my skin. Nothing to Glow About
