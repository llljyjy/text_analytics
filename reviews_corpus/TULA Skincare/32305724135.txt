i received this free to try and review from influenster. i had already tried the face cream and sugar scrub when i attended a sephora call in 2021 and have since purchased the sugar scrub because it smelt amazing so i was happy to try this full size moisturizer. There is a scent but its pretty minimal which is important to me because i’m not a fan of scented face products, the cream is light not heavy so it doesn’t clog my pores and keep my skin from breathing thru the day. i use all over my face, neck and chest and have been using for a few weeks now and it feels nice and light when i put on after cleaning my face/showering. definetely a fan of this brand now that i’ve tried a few of their products nan
