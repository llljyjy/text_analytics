I received this product for free from Influenster and TULA in exchange for my honest review.It comes in a tall container it was a great size for the amount of product! The serum is quite soft & fluffy, like a moisturizing cream. It smells like rice. I like how itâ€™s cruelty free and free of many harmful preservatives. Overall a pretty nice serum! Light, clean, and soft to the skin. TULA Serum - good for dry skin!
