I was very interged by this product when I received it. I used it every morning for about a week and started to notice a different in the tone of my skin. I wasn’t as red as I normally was and the overall appearance of my skin was smoother. I love the packaging because it’s a pump so you are not digging your fingers into a jar. The pump took a little to get use to but over a couple days it was good. Overall I would reccomend this product. nan
