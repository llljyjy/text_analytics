Received this as a free sample from influenster. So far I do like it, it applies easily. Haven’t been using it for to long, but I have some dark spots from a car accident I was in and it does seem to be lightening them a little. I am not 100% sure I would but again not because it’s not a good product, but so far I feel like I prefer my other serums more. Applies nicely, dark spots do seem to be less
