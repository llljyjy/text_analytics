I’ve been wanting to try this brand for so long and I’m glad I got it to try from Influenster. My skin has been hectic since pregnancy and after trying EVERYTHING to help balance it out this was the only thing that worked. The probiotics and superfoods are the ingredient healing my skin. My skin feels soft, hydrated, smooth and is brighter. I am definitely adding the full size to my cart to continue to use them. Skin saver
