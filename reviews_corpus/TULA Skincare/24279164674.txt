absolutely love and love the brand tula. i have been looking for a perfect face sunscreen for so long. i deal with dermatitis and just my skin will sometimes get irritated by other products but i did not have a single problem with this. this product has the perfect glow to it and so light weight. i recommend this to everybody. another plus is there is no bad smell. so happy with this. will be repurchasing. nan
