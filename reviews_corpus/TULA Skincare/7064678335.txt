This is my first time using any Tula products and I’m surprised to know how well they worked with my skin. I have sensitive and comedogenic skin. This system is a perfect introduction to Tula for me. the cleanser is very gentle and light. works well in the Am and also as a second cleanse in the night. I also felt that there are no harsh ingredients or perfume in this line. I’ll recommend this for anyone with dry skin to use in summers than in winters. It’s a good kit to travel with too. Great for sensitive dry skin
