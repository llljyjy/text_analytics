Wow! It is super cooling. I took it with me on my weekend getaway and it definitely helped cool me down. I’m not sure about wearing it with makeup on but that’s ok since I didn’t use any while I was away. The sparkle is cute but I could do with or without it. The main factor I like about it is how instant it gets cold and how long it says cooling.The packaging is adorable, I love the pink and how it’s a twist tube. All in all I would definitely recommend this product. Super cooling!
