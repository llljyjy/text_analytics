I’m not sure if I received a bad sample of this but the minute I put it on my face I noticed a ..human urine smell…mixed with perfume. It is not a nice smell. I gave it two stars because it does hydrate well and my skin texture looks smooth and calm. Despite this,  I won’t be using this product again as the smell is overwhelming. terrible scent
