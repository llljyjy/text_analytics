I received this product for free as part of the box a few weeks ago, before I realized I had been selected to get it! Without knowing why I received it I started to incorporate it into my morning skincare routine. I’m not going to say it has given me any drastic results, but I will say I have enjoyed this product. It has a very light scent which I enjoy, it goes on easily, layers nicely with other skincare products and has worked well under my makeup without causing any piling. I do believe it leaves my skin feeling softer and does give me a slight overall brightness to my skin. The price would likely be the only reason I wouldn’t repurchase, however, you get a pretty decent size bottle and one pump covers my entire face/neck. Nice product…but pricey!
