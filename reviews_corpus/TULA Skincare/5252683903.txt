I’m always on the hunt for a new under eye product that will hydrate and brighten, this product, although lightly hydrating doesn’t seem to be brightening my under eye area as of yet.

I do greatly appreciate that there is no heavy scent, as I do try my best to avoid perfumed skincare.I received this product complimentary from Influenster, Sephora, and TULA to test and review. lovely & light
