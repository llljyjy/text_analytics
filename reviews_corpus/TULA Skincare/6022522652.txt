This is the worst packaging as the pump never works when I buy it, BUT. I love this toner so much that I just take the lid off and pour it straight on to the cotton pad I’m using. It’s super gentle and not drying. Leaves my skin felt fresh too. It’s the only toner I use! I think it helps give a nice dewy look too best toner, worst package but worth it!
