This eye cream is HYDRATING! I hadn’t had any prior experience with the Tula brand before, but I have to say that this Eye Recharge + Replenish Pro-Ferm Overnight Eye Cream with Bakuchiol and Peptides is pretty amazing! First of all, I absolutely adore this type of hygienic packaging! It really makes dispensing the product convenient and keeps everything mess free and sanitary. You can also really control how much you dispense and I don’t even feel you need a full pump to cover both eye areas. The cream itself is thick and rich, yet doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. It really feels luxurious when applied and you can notice the hydration it leaves behind on your skin. There also isn’t any fragrance or scent and I haven’t had any issues with irritation. I think this would possibly be a wonderful product for those with sensitive skin. The next morning, my eye area always looks moisturized and refreshed! Would definitely get this eye cream again! If you love moisture, get this!
