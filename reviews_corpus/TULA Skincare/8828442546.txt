I love the fact that this is in a solid, stick form. I am such a fan of this format, and it will be so easy to not break my skincare routine as this is carry-on approved for flights! I did have to take some time to learn the proper way to apply the eye balm, as I didn’t want to drag the stick along my eye contour area and contribute to lines. It’s a smooth application once you get the hang of it! Travel-ready eye cream!
