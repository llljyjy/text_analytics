I liked the dispensing pump. This toner being a gel made it mess free and easy to use. I used this toner once a day, so I didn’t see much results. It is recommended to use twice daily. Also be sure to stay out of the sun when using this product. Overall, it’s a great toner and I plan on using it twice a day once the weather isn’t so sunny. Great toner
