I have pretty sensitive and dry skin so it is pretty hard to find a good skincare routine that works and won’t make my skin react.I add this serum to my skincare routine a month ago and I am impressed.The application is amazing, the product is super lightweight and fresh, I use a roller or my finger and massage to help the product penetrate. Overall, my skin looks healthier.It does firm up your skin and just looks hydrated and plumb.Def recommend it if you are looking for this result although I didn’t see a big difference in wrinkles.
