I received this serum for free in the exchange of my honest opinion! I have extremely sensitive skin and usually react badly towards any products containing alcohol and retinol but I didnâ€™t have any negative reaction towards this serum! I think the fact that it contains BOTANICAL retinol instead of chemical makes it different! Big thumbs up to Tula! @tula #voxbox #serum @influenster nan
