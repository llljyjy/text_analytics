I have been using this balm both in the mornings before I apply my makeup for work, and in the evenings as part of my skincare routine. I think this is a lovely product which is not only very easy to use but is also very hydrating. It doesnâ€™t cause any issues with my primer and foundation which I absolutely love. I definitely recommend this especially for individuals who just want a quick touch up for undereye care. nan
