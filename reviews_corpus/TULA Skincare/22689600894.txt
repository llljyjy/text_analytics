I have really dry, flaky and sensitive skin and I wanted to give Bright Start a good long try before making a decision on whether I liked it or not. So, I tried it for just over a month and at first, while I found it to be a little thick and slightly sticky feeling, my skin quickly absorbed it and that all went away. While I’m not the hugest fan of the texture or the smell while I’m applying it, I’m willing to forego those things if the product works. And this does. I still have some small patches of dry skin but nowhere near as much as when I first started using it and I imagine with continued use, they’ll continue to lessen. With my sensitive skin, I did notice a tiny amount of discomfort the first couple of times using this, but it was very minor and also went away quickly. While I haven’t seen any miraculous brightening to my skin, I definitely have noticed a more dewy, hydrated look Iike I’ve been drinking my water (and I haven’t... lol) and this is the only product I’ve added to my routine this last month. I would definitely recommend this moisturizer to anyone who asked! Definitely recommend!
