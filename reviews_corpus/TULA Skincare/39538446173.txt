This product is fairly good, but not for that price. I like how pretty it looks and how how it feels when you first put it on, but it’s not a product I can see myself using all the time. My skin is usually pretty oily and really dry in some spots, but I’d be more worried about it making me break out more. I never noticed a smell so that’s not a big problem for me. Not going out of my way to buy †his product again
