I received this product from Influenster for review so I’ve been using it for a little over a week prior to reviewing. I really like it! It’s a great midweight moisturizer that I think would work well for most skin types. It feels somewhat lightweight when applying because it sinks in quickly but my skin feels moisturized all day. I was also impressed that it works just as well as a night cream. It has a very light scent and is non irritating. I think it would work well for fairly sensitive and reactive skin. I have combo acne prone skin that tends to get dehydrated in the winter time and it’s been great for me. No breakouts, and moisturized skin that doesn’t feel greasy. Very nice, midweight moisturizer
