I immediately fell in love with this moisturizer! Recently I’ve been trying to find a way to shorten my skincare routine a few steps and use less product and wanted a moisturizer that is going to penetrate and moisturize but still be lightweight. I have very dry skin so normally I feel like I have to double moisturize but this is magic. The formula in this is unique- looks like a water gel formula, applies like a moisturizer and blends in like a serum. Not only did it give my skin the most beautiful glow and hydration both before makeup and at night, but it works so well with my other products and my sunscreen. To people concerned about the smell I see complaints on, it’s a FRESH scent and smells very spa like so I think those with sensitive noses (like me) and skin will be just fine. I never even noticed it and actually went to grab the product to smell it. I highly recommend trying this! New Holy Grail
