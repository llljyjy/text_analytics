I received the TULA Skincare Revive + Rewind Revitalizing Eye Cream in exchange for my honest review from Influenster. After using this product for several weeks, as someone with dry skin I noticed a difference in having a more hydrated undereye area. This made my foundation and concealer easier to apply and also prevented creasing throughout the day. My skin just felt more nourished, plump and even made my undereye look a little brighter. It did not take long to absorb at all and did not leave any greasy or sticky residue. It is a very gentle product as well; it is very easy to massage into the eye area because of the texture and there is no perfume or heavy scent. In terms of this product’s promise to “minimize” or “diminish” fine lines and wrinkles, even after several weeks I did not see any difference in my fine lines unfortunately. I also have some minimal dark circles and did not see improvement there either. So this was not a “do-it-all” eye cream for me personally but I still loved the hydrating and nourishing properties it offered.In terms of cost, you receive a LOT of product. This product is 14g and even if I used this every single day it would likely last me a year because you obviously do not need a lot for the eye area. I also love that it is clean and cruelty free, very big pluses in my opinion. Well worth it!
