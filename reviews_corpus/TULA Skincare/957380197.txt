I’ve being testing out this night cream for a few weeks and so far I really like it. First off the packaging is a 10/10. It’s cute and hygienic, you press on the pump and it distributes the perfect amount. No dipping fingers into the jar. The cream itself is a nice consistency, it’s not too thick or heavy. When I wake up my skin is very hydrated and glowy. I have sensitive skin and I haven’t had any negative reactions to this. The only negative about this cream is that it smells pretty bad, like kombucha! But, you only smell it while applying it, and the scent doesn’t linger. Stinks but works
