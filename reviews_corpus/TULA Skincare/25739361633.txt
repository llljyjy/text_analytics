First impressions: no scent and glides on super smooth onto the skin. The cooling effect wasnâ€™t instant for me (took a few minutes vs seconds), but feels really nice and refreshing without tingling. This leaves a nice subtle glow. I love applying this under my makeup and throughout the day for a quick refresh and to brighten under my eyes. Must try!
