It’s interesting. The stick itself feels cooling and has some shimmer to it, so I suspect that it reflects light to help “lighten” dark circles. It’s not meant as an eye cream by any means, so that’s why it will not mix or blend well with skincare or makeup. On its own, it works well to create the appearance of a brightened under eye area. But in conjunction with makeup, it doesn’t work that well for me. nan
