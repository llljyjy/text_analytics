I really enjoyed this product. It has such a faint smell. It applies super smooth and easy. I love the pre portion pump. The directions are super easy to follow. I especially enjoy that it is cruelty free. Price point is on point with the reflection of the product. I have no complaints about this serum. Job well done, tula ! The probiotics and milk like texture has absorbed into my skin so fast! I am in awe with how fast that formula went right into my skin. Such a soft silky texture. More please !!!! Great product.
