I’ve tried a couple retinol serums by other brands and this one is the most gentle one for my dry skin. It does not dry me out, and I can see myself building up to everyday use. It’s definitely gentle. My first thought when I first tried this product was the smell. I wouldn’t say this product is scented, it’s more of a gentle and light botanical scent. As for the anti-wrinkle properties, I have noticed the fine lines around my under eyes more plumped and less defined, which is good. Pretty good!
