I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really love this moisturizer. The texture is great and a little pump goes a long way. I do feel my skin is brighter after using this product. I dont love the packaging and find that moisturizer that come in this type of pump make it difficult to get to all the product, it’s hard to travel with because it takes up so much space and makes it feel like there’s a large amount of product when really there isn’t. Great product, terrible bottle
