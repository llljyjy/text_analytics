I received this product from Influenster to provide my honest review. To start I am not a huge serum user as I have found countless ones have caused me break outs, however, this one has not. I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly this serum absorbed, that it did not leave a film, and had no interactions with any of the products I use. The 3 stars however is because I did not notice a change in my complexion or skin that would make this product worth it. nan
