i am a fan of this kit! the face wash is gentle on my skin and smells very clean. the serum isnâ€™t greasy and feels good on my face. the moisturizer is gentle on my face and makes it feel good. my favorite product in this kit is the sugar scrub. it feels good and smells like coconut! i will definitely bring this with me on vacation! travel necessity!
