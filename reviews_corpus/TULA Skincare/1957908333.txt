I absolutely am loving this eye balm! It’s super hydrating, glides on easily with the small swipe motion and makes my under eye makeup glide on nicely. The balm application is something I’ve never personally used before but I like not having to use my fingers to apply it. I haven’t used it enough to share results on diminishing fine lines and wrinkles just yet… but definitely hydrates and brightens the eye! I also love the fact that the ingredients are formulated without harsh chemicals, parabens, silicone etc and are cruelty free! It has little to no scent if you like unscented products this may be your jam! Hydrating and clean!
