Itâ€™s good for its price point. Probiotics, Prebiotics, triple vit c complex, turmeric, lactic acid. Good for you ingredients. Settles in the skin nicely and does not leave a sticky feeling. I also like the dropper of this bottle. Gold as an ingredient is gimicky to me. I received this free from Sephora and Influenser in exchange for my honest review. It is a good product, but I am not about to trade in my Eminence Vit C serum for it. Good for it's price.
