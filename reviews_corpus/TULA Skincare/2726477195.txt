I’m loving this product, I have been using it for a few weeks now and first of all the packaging is so cute! The product doesn’t really have a smell. It glides on smoothly and and I tap it into my eye area. I love how moisturizing it is and the cooling effect, it brightens up my under eye. I use this product about twice daily under or without makeup. It has worked well with my combination skin. Be careful not to apply it too close I made that mistake and the cooling effect made my eyes burn. This product is now apart of my skincare routine. Love
