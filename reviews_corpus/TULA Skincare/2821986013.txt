I received these for free in exchange for my honest review. I wanted to love these right away, however after a week of use I have decided I fall around the middle. The container of 60 presoaked and biodegradable pads is lovely and so convenient, plus the smell is very fresh and natural. However I did find that after a week of use these caused my skin so much purging I had to slow down on them. They also left a filmy feeling on my skin. The pads are an excellent size and thickness, and have a perfect amount of product on them however if this formula is perfect for you. I do love the convenience of them too. Overall did enjoy these, but I think there are many other toners out there I enjoyed more, which would last much longer. Tula pads
