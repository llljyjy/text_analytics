I received this from influenster for my honest review. I really like the cleanser and the moisturizer! The vitamin c serum stings a little when I put it on and the exfoliate doesnâ€™t seem to do a very good job. A little goes a long way on the cleanser and moisturizer but not so much for the exfoliate.  Id buy the cleanser and moisturizer again! nan
