I have sensitive acne prone skin and this product really does seem to calm my skin. I use this after exfoliating treatments/masks and this soothes redness and irritation. Helps reduce some redness on active breakouts too. Feels nice on the skin and doesn’t pill with other products. It’s not a life changing product tho nan
