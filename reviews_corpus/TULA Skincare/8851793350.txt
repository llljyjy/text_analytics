I have combo acne prone skin and I felt like this mask did a really good job of short term exfoliation and resurfacing of my skin. The gel texture is nice and it did sting a little on application, but the sensation went away and after washing it off, my skin felt super smooth. I haven’t noticed any long term effects such as brightening or overall skin texture change, but I’ve also only used it a handful of times. But for a first impression, I think this is a good entry level exfoliant for somebody with skin that is less sensitive. I did receive this product for free but I genuinely tested it (albeit only a couple times) before writing this review! A Decent Resurfacing Mask!
