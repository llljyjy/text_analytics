I received the TULA Skincare Revive + Rewind Revitalizing Eye Cream in exchange for my honest review from Influenster. I have been using it the past 2 weeks and it is keeps my eyes refreshed and nicely hydrated. It has amazing ingredients I including probiotics/probiotics (calm & nourish) olive squalene (hydrates), peptides (anti-wrinkle), & grape seed oil (vit E). I have not noticed any improvement of my fine lines yet, but it may be too soon. I honestly like it just for the hydration and I definitely recommend it. Refreshing & Hydrating
