This is my 1st time using the Tula travel kit.I received this kit in return for an honest review.The Cleanser - has a ntural smelling fragrance which is not irritating but after washing my face it has a bit of reaction.I think it’s just because I have a very sensitive skin.Scrub - very gentle scrub, the sugar would dissolve very quickly.Moisturizer -similar to the cleanser it has a gentle smell and not compatible with my skin but it moisturize well.Vit.C serum-i can really smell natural vit.c smell and I did not get any skin reaction.Overall, wouldn’t recommend these products if you have sensitive skin. BUT if you dont have sensitive skin I think this is a very nice to go kit when your traveling. Perfect for traveling
