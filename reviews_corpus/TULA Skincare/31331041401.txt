I received this product as a free sample. I have to say on packaging alone I was in love. After trying this I feel like my eyes were brighter and I felt rejuvenated. This has been my go to on mornings and just gives me that feeling of being bright eyed and ready to take on the day. I really like this product and have made it part of my daily routine. I highly recommend this for anyone who has tired eyes and is looking to hydrate and reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles in their under eye area. Must Have!!
