Seems like a decent mask so far. Have used it a couple of times only so haven’t seen too much of a change yet. Definitely stings on application but doesn’t last long. No overpowering scent which is nice. Leaves the skin feeling soft and not dry/stripped. Packaging is great with the little pump. Have to use it more to see if it’s worth repurchasing. nan
