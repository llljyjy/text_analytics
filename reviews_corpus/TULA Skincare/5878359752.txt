I really like this product. It’s thicker than their 24-7 moisture cream (I love both). I do use it at night because it’s a bit thicker but even if I use it in the day it’s not too heavy. One pump is more than enough. I don’t think I’ve used it enough to say that my skin is brighter but it does feel very hydrated throughout the day. I really like it and would recommend it especially for normal to dry skin. Very nice!
