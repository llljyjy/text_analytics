Really was iffy at first because most “gel” spf leave me looking like I put highlighter all over my face..just that super oily look. This is perfect for those who like to wear a bare face. This does what concealer does, fresh rejuvenated healthy touch up. I put it on top of my regular face cream.No sticky residue or strong scent. There will always be that smell  every spf has that but it’s not over powering. 10/10 recommend
