She thicc! This eye cream is so thick and moisturizing. It leaves my dry under eye area moisturized and actually does seem to soften the fine lines. The packaging is a big drawback for me though because one pump is way too much product for both eyes! 1/3-1/2 pump is plenty for both eyes. So far this is the best eye cream I have found and would repurchase. Love it!
