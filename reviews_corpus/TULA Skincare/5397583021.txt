I received this product from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I have sensitive skin and tons of redness on my cheeks and nose area. The redness has reduced slightly and I like the feel of this serum on my skin. I layer it on top of an essence and underneath a moisturizer. The product is is thin and goes on the skin nice. It’s sort of cooling in a weird way, I think the cucumber helps with that.I just personally can’t get over the scent, it screams “Bath and Body Works” cucumber melon vibes. The cucumber is very over powering, if it was more reduced in scent I’d gladly buy this again. The scent lingers on your face and lasts until it’s dry but it’s very strong and “in your face” cucumber! I wish it smelt more like oatmeal or had a more neutral scent.It’s quite pricey for a serum and I’m intrigued to see if it’ll reduce the redness more. Overall it’s a good serum, just a tad pricey and heavily scented. nan
