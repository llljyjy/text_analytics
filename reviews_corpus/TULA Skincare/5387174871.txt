Upon the first time of trying Tula’s Overnight Repair Treatment, it felt lightweight and provided great moisture to my face immediately.  With the change of weather, my face had a few dry spots and after applying Tula’s overnight cream the dry spots were immediately moisturized. My skin looked refreshed upon waking up and was not oily. Con: the fragrance is very strong and can seem intense when applying, especially for those who are highly sensitive. Also, my face would have some minor breakouts if I used everyday. I had to adjust for my face and use every couple of days for my combo skin.  Overall I was happy with the product and is a part of my facial routine. Great Overnight Moisturizer
