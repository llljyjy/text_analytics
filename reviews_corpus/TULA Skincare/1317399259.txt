I received this from Influenster for review purposes. I have been using this for a little over two weeks now, I built it into my morning routine. I wasn’t sure what to expect but I like the formula, it seems more like a gel sometimes but it’s that probably has a lot to do with the temperature in my bathroom. I feel like my skin does look brighter, and I feel like I have a slight highlight without the actually highlighter. It’s definitely a staple for me now Light and brightening
