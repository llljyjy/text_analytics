I’ve been using this moisturizer primarily at night and I am liking it so far. I enjoy both the texture and the scent, which reminds me a bit of lemon meringue. It’s not too heavily fragranced and it’s not too heavy on my skin. I also like the packaging and easy use of the pump applicator, although I don’t know if it would get gummed up over time.
