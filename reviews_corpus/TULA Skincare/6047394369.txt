I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I have combination skin, with the skin in my t zone being dry and flaky. First off, this product smells amazing! A small amount goes a long way and does a great job exfoliating. The only downside is that it does cause my skin in the t zone to become a bit more oily. Overall, this is a great product for when your skin needs exfoliation for the dry areas and it is something I will continue to purchase in the future. Goodbye dryness
