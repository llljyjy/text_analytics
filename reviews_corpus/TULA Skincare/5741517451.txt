I was very excited to try this few product from Influenster as I’ve never used an eye balm before. The balm is scentless so has no lingering smell. I found it very portable and easy to apply. I use it nightly and found that it didn’t pill, unless some other eye creams I’ve tried before. I haven’t noticed a significant difference in puffiness but it does make me look a little more awake the next morning. I’m liking this product so far and looking forward to using it every night! The only downside is that I found the tube quite slippery, so it’s a little difficult to uncap every time. Easy to apply!
