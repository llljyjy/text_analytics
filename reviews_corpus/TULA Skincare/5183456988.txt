This is a great lightweight serum that makes your skin glow!! It has a beautiful soft smell that makes you feel fresh. But, since it is slightly scented, it might irritate sensitive skin. So I suggest doing a patch test first to make sure it doesn’t cause a reaction. I love that it has probiotics and superfoods that hydrate and rejuvenate your skin without feeling heavy or sticky. I have combination skin and didn’t find it clogged my pores. I would definitely recommend! nan
