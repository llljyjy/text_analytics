LOVE LOVE LOVE. I have super oily/shiny skin, with some dry spots, and my skin is acne/blackhead prone. This keeps my breakouts/blackheads at bay. I have so much less acne/blackheads than I have previously. This stuff WORKS!! And since my skin can be sensitive, I was worried as it is incentivized but it does not bother me at all ! its very lightly scented and you really only need a pea sized amount, as it lathers so much when it touches water. Large bottle lasts like 6 months if you use it once a day. LOVE LOVE LOVE
