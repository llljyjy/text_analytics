I didn’t notice any good or bad changes with this product. It’s VERY thick which I am worried about for under the eye. I did get a small clogged pore. Also the dispenser when you push it down dispenses way too much for one use under your eyes so be careful of that. For the price I don’t know if I would recommend this since I didn’t notice any difference. nan
