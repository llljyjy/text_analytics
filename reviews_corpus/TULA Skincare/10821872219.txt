Gel like consistency, but absolutely not sticky or greasy. Plus there is zero white cast. It’s easy to rub in and absorbs very well into the skin. Provides a great shimmery glow. If I’m not looking for a glow that day this product tones down easily with some powder. I thought this product would have a gritty consistency when I squeezed it out of the bottle, but when rubbed I rub it in my hands it proved to be very smooth. Has a light scent of a typical sunscreen that I did not find bothersome. The skincare first formula truly elevates this product, it provides extra hydration. This is not your run of the mill sunscreen, it’s skincare too! Must Have Sunscreen!
