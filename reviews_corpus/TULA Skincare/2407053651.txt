I have normal skin. After using this mask, i noticed a slight difference in brightness. I didn’t notice a difference in texture though. I also used this mask on my mom and she did not notice any difference! This mask also stung her skin a little but there was no redness after. It did not sting my skin nor did I have redness after using it. It was my first time using something with probiotic so I was really excited for this mask. I think that if i use it more frequently, I would notice a bigger difference on my skin.I would only repurchase this product if I notice a drastic difference after using it, but so far , it was only a slight difference. I would recommend it to friends who have very dull skin because I think they would notice a bigger difference than me. It’s okay!
