I was lucky enough to receive a complimentary full-sized container of this to review for Influenster!Ok to start, I absolutely love the consistency. It’s not too watery, not too thick. It’s freaking perfect. leaves me feeling moisturized, but not greasy. Smell wasn’t great, but not awful, so I can live with that. Noticed an overall improvement in brightness with my skin. Walked by a Tula display in Sephora last week, and saw this. It’s PRICEY, but if you’re willing to shell out $72, I’d say it’s worth it. If you’re on a budget, maybe pass. I think the container design is pretty neat, too! Love the consistency
