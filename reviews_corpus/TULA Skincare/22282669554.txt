I used this Tula deep wrinkle serum for about a month following the instructions on the bottle exactly. In my opinion it is really just an expensive glorified moisturizer. It may have faded some of my fine lines but didn’t seem to have an effect on my deeper forehead wrinkles. I am only 23 so my deeper forehead wrinkles are hardly “set in” but definitely visible. Unfortunately this product didn’t seem to deliver. That being said this serum has a nice water-like consistency and does feel very nice on my skin and I didn’t experience any negative side effects from it. My biggest issue is that it’s a $100 dollar serum and even after a month of use I’m just not seeing the results I expected to get out of a product this expensive.
