This a a great product! The first thing I noticed was the jar. You take off the cap and press down to pump out the cream. It smells like oranges and has a smooth texture.  I love that itâ€™s a night cream so I just apply it and go to bed! My skin feels softer and hydrated. The ingredients are wonderful. I highly recommend it!! I received this from influenster and Tula skincare for free in exchange for my opinion! Wonderful product!!
