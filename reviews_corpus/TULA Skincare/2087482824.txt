A pretty good moisturizer. I have combo skin so I enjoyed the light, gel consistency of the product but I didn’t find it to be as hydrating as I thought. I did get this complimentary but looking at the price…to me it’s not worth it for that price. But for the right skin type..maybe if you have more texture or dullness, this could be great. nan
