First off, I received this for free from Influester for testing purposes. This retinol alternative is very gentle. It is not harsh at all, and it didn’t seem to dry my skin out either. There is no scent and absorbs really well into the skin. It didn’t pill under my other face products which is sometimes an issue I have with other serums. I haven’t been using it long enough to see a change in the slight forehead wrinkles I’m starting to get, but my skin feels nicely hydrated and I’ve noticed in some areas it does look smoother. The price is a little expensive, but I believe if it does minimize what wrinkles I have that are starting, I wouldn’t hesitate to purchase it, especially during a sale. It’s so gentle! Gentle, smoothing
