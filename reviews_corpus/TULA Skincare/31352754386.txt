I am giving this skin product 3 stars. Looking at the ingredients it can surely be a great product for many skin types. One first use it felt well and left my skin with a nice shine. Upon the the second use I woke up the next morning with irritated skin and itchy. I believe it can help others but also remember to wear sunscreen after using this product. As much as I would have loved to use this full product unfortunately I was not able to and will be gifting to someone with much less sensitive skin. Not for dry skin types or easily irritated
