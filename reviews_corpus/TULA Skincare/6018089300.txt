This is amazing stuff. It’s exactly what you’d expect from a sugar scrub. It has that grainy texture that you can feel roughing up your skin, in a good way though. I do have combo skin and I could feel that it was way softer after using it. The package does say to use it 2-3x a week but I personally will only use it 1x so I can give my skin a break from constantly using products. It smells amazing and it does remind me of a day at the beach. I’ve used 2-3 different Tula products and this is one I will use again. It’s one of my favourites from their line. This review was incentivized for my honest review. I would continue using this. I would also recommend the Tula brand to family and friends, especially the ones that are into sugar scrubs So far so good
