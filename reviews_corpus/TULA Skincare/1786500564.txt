The absolute best. My acne prone skin did not like ANY moisturizers before. Now, my skin absolutely loves this stuff and in conjunction with the Tula cleanser, my acne is gone. This stuff is magic. Worth the price point, worth the “hype” (even though I find this brand gets a lot of hate, not sure why). I’ll never stop using this brand because I’ve finally found what works for me! Also, the scent is amazing… super light yet spa-like. cleared my acne - holy grail
