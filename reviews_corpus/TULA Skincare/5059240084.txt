I’ve been using this product for weeks and I’m still not 100% sure how I feel about it. Tula has certainly been hyped up as a brand on social media by “influencers“, leaving many of us wondering if it is actually as good as it’s made out to be. I’d describe this product as 50% skin care and 50% make up. Its stick formulation is meant to be swiped across the undereye area to moisturize and brighten, and can also be applied to other areas of the face to act as a highlighter. It states on the label that you can apply this product under or over makeup - I have not tried applying it on top of makeup so I can’t speak to how well that works. I like this as a highlighter and to brighten my undereye area as I have significant dark circles. I would not equate this to be similar to an eye cream in terms of what its able to do for hydration or moisture. The cooling feeling upon application isn’t something I really look for or care for in my skincare, but it’s okay. To sum up my honest review: this is more of a highlighter than anything. If you want a bright, glowy no make up look, it might be for you. If you’re looking for an actual eye cream or skincare product, keep looking. nan
