I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Tula in exchange for my honest review. I never tried Vitamin C serums, and I am happy I got a chance to introduce this new product from Tula to my skin. It is a lightweight magic serum enriched with clean ingredients that glide and absorb quickly into the skin with no sighs of tackiness. I enjoy using it a lot! The scent is very gentle and lovely. Also, I am in love with the smart applicator and adorable packaging! After two weeks of usage, I noticed that my skin became slightly brighter and plumper. This Vitamin C serum is a must-try product. nan
