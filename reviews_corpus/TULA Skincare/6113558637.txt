This product is amazing! It makes my skin hydrated especially during the winter time. I tend to have combination skin and this stuff keeps my skin soft and hydrated. Look, I know it says it has a fragrance to it and ppl are complaining about it and I honestly wasn’t sure how I would feel about this product because I am sensitive to smells especially if it’s a product that goes on my face. Well, let me tell you I didn’t smell anything strong, hardly any smell tbh. I was surprised and was expecting this strong perfume floral smell but again to my surprise nothing! The cream feels so luxurious and expansive it’s not greasy and melts right onto the skin leaving it soft to the touch. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs some hydration maybe not so much for someone who has really dry skin as I said this cream isn’t heavy and I think if you have dry skin you will need something thicker or at least another product like a serum or oil to go with this if you do intend to use it. I mean you don’t have anything to lose right? Give it try. 24/7 Moisturize
