Really liked this product! I don’t usually use toners as they irritate my skin but I tested this one out and to my surprise, my skin did not react to it! I liked the smell, kind of like a fresh scent to it. I also really appreciate the fact that the pads are thin. I was able to easily use shape them to cover all of the hard to reach spots in my face. The pads were also perfect for the amount of liquid on it. They weren’t soaking wet, but weren’t almost dry either. nan
