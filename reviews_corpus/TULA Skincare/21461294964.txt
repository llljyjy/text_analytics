Received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. First time ever using TULA products! The smell got me as soon as I opened the bottle, itâ€™s lovely. The formula itself is very light for a sugar scrub, not on the thicker side, so not as harsh with texture on the skin. Glad I was able to give TULA products a try, will look into their other facial products! TULA So Polished Exfoliating Sugar Scrub
