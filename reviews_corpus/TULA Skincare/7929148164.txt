I was sent this product for free to try. To be honest my first impressions of this product were not great. I have used quite a few products from Tula that I’ve loved so my expectations from this brand are quite high. Right off the bat, I hate the packaging. The pump type applicator is more suited to an eye cream. As this is a face moisturizer, I like to apply it with my hands so I find this style of pump more awkward then anything. It also puts out way more product then you actually need if you were to do a full pump. I do not enjoy the fragrance. I am not someone who minds a fragrance but this one has like a berry scent I guess? It does dissipate quickly so that’s good. Now, into the actual product! The first few times I used it, it felt heavy like it was mostly just sitting on my skin, not absorbing into it. It is a thick moisturizer but it goes a long way for what it is. If I had never used Tula products before, I likely wouldn’t have continued to test it out as I just wasn’t a fan at first. Because I have had good experience with this brand I continued to use it to see. I have now been using it for 2 full weeks. I use less than half a pump at a time and it sets much nicer. I have combination skin. Super oily t zone but my chin and cheeks get quite dry. I have felt a noticeable improvement in my dry areas and my skin definitely appears more nourished. It’s not blowing my socks off by any means but it is definitely a GOOD moisturizer and I will continue to use it. Nice product - mixed first impression
