I really like this face wash but the smell is quite strong. I don’t notice it lingering on my face after washing it off, but it’s quite artificially “clean” and “fresh” smelling. Will use it up but likely won’t bug again. And it’s a massive size so I’ll have it for a while. great face wash but smells like laundry detergent
