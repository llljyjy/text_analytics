I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my review and I felt it was a great opportunity to try this product. I’ve tried several Tula products, so receiving this one was a pleasant surprise. The texture of this sunscreen is irregular, like if it was expired. However, when you look closer it appears to be pieces of crushed pineapple peel. The smell is subtle. The finish on the skin is amazing, my face feels healthy, with a natural glow. This is not just sunscreen, it’s skin care! A must have in my morning routine!
