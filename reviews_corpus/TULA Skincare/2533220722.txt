I received this complimentary from Influenster to test out and review. The first thing I have to say is it is extremely effective. Over a short period of time I have seen a dramatic reduction in the visibility of my eye and forehead wrinkles. On the other hand my skin is trying to recover from a cold/dry Canadian winter. This product does not help dry skin. I have noticed that after applying I get the sensation of my face being dry and tight. However, this will be great in the warmer months or if you have normal/oily skin. The serum is very fluid but that helps with being able to spread two pumps all over the face. Within minutes it quickly sinks into skin and there is absolutely no residue left. I haven’t tried under make up yet but where as it completely absorbs I can’t imagine there being any problems as long as you let it completely sink in first. Overall, very impressed with this product, I might just have to wait a few more months before continuing! Very effective!
