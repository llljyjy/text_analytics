The first few uses it was cooling, but since I haven’t felt that. It leaves a very noticeable and shiny sparkle, almost like a highlight, don’t love that. I truly haven’t noticed a big difference while using, I wanted a brightening balm for the early morningsI feel like there are bette products out there, especially for the price. Not amazing
