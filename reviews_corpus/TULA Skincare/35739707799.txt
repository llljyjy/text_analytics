I am super picky about face sunscreen and this stuff is the best I have ever tried. It isn’t smelly and it doesn’t feel all yucky (it just feels like a moisturizer) and it doesn’t break me out (everything breaks me out). Yes, it’s pricey, but honestly I can say it’s worth it. Don’t get weirded out by the texture, those little lumps dissolve completely on the skin! Best Sunscreen Ever
