I received this product free from Influenster and Tula in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this product both alone and under foundation to see what happens. It does have a slight cooling sensation when you put it on, which is very nice. It brightens your under eye area, but it will not cover the darkness. For that reason and the price I didn’t give it the 5th star. I like it and would repurchase if it were cheaper. It’s nice, but I didn’t notice anything game-changing. Nice Splurge!
