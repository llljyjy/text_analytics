I received this product at no cost in exchange for my honest review. I love the packaging of this moisturizer. Super cute colours. While at first I didn’t love the dispenser, I realized I could open the lid so there’s no water at the end. It’s a really nice cream. Goes on light and feels great. I just don’t love the scent. It’s a bit strong for me. I also don’t love the price. I would probably but it if it was a bit cheaper. nan
