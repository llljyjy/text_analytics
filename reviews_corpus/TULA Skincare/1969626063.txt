I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. All I can say is that I’m glad to be done testing this. Directions indicate to use morning and night. It left my skin so greasy and gross looking that I couldn’t use it in the morning if I planned to go out. The only time I felt a tingle sensation like it was doing anything at all was the first time I put it on, which might be because I put too much on due to the poorly designed dropper. The only bonus, if you don’t like fragrance was that it has no smell. Don't waste your money
