I received this complimentary from Influenster for my honest review. First of all, having received this product, I noticed an attractive, beautiful bottle with a dispenser, ease of use (only 2-3 drops per face). The serum has an excellent composition, does not contain harmful substances, contains probiotics and natural ingredients that improve the condition of the skin and every day the serum works, and I see the result - wrinkles are smoothed out and the skin is perfect. When first received, the serum turned out to be oily, but after a while it is quickly absorbed and the skin becomes incredibly smooth and fresh! Serum perfectly nourishes and restores the skin of the face. I have combination skin and use this serum before bed. I really like that this serum is associated with results. I recommend this product to everyone! An effective anti-aging serum
