I have oily skin and I find these really helped keep that under control. You get a good quantity of pads, the pads are on the thinner side but still durable and effective. Each one held enough product to do my entire face. Left my skin feeling extra clean and refreshed without that tight feeling. The only thing I wasn’t crazy about is that it left my skin feeling tacky but that’s a minor thing. I would definitely purchase in the future and look forward to trying some more products from this brand. I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. nan
