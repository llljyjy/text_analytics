I get really dry under eyes and this balm is so nice, I have been liking to swipe it on before putting on my concealer and have noticed a big improvement! The balm texture is good because it doesnâ€™t slip around like heavier creams. I can see myself carrying this around all summer for during the day too. The only downside is I feel like you need to apply quite a bit! nan
