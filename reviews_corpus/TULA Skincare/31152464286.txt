I have Received this product as a free sample from Influenster and It is not just a sample, it is a full bottle of serum. I was always disappointed from my skin due to pores, fine lines and pores and Sometime too much dryness. I am using this serum from almost a month and it is a magical towards my skin and it is a part of my skin care routine. Texture of serum is very much smooth and light.It keep my skin hydrated and refreshing all day. I smoothens my fines lines and almost no pores left on my face. Sometimes my face is too much oily and sometimes too much oily but this serum is not greasy at all which balanced my combination skin. I would definitely recommend this to make it as a part of your skincare routine as it is worth the money you are spending. I am definitely going to buy this again. Magical Serum
