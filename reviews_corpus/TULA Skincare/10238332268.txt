I received this complementary product in exchange for my honest review. The package that it came in was aesthetically pleasing to look at. The applicator itself was cool and I liked how once I apply it on at the end of the day it felt nice on my skin. I also like how it doesn’t have any scent to it and how it doesn’t feel tooo oily for a serum. The directions on the box were also easy to follow and after using it for a while I can definitely start to tell a difference. The only downfall for me personally is that the price is a little too expensive for the quantity but that might be reasonable considering it’s a serum. Nonetheless I recommend this to anyone looking to buy a good depuff serum. Amazing cooking product
