I love this serum. I have been using this every morning and night for 7 days and it works wonderfully. It has a bit of an oily feel but that is PERFECT for me as I have super dry skin. I really think this serum has helped with my skins overall hydration. I haven’t been wearing makeup as often lately so it has been great as it gives a sheen to my face that lasts a few hours. It’s an amazing serum and I would totally repurchase this. Great new serum!
