I’ve used this six times since getting it sent to me. I am weird about under eye care and particular. I will say that I have troubles sleeping so I have puffier under eyes and I have found this to have a soothing, cooling effect that feels good. I don’t have to apply much pressure to get the balm under my eyes and I have enjoyed using this. I just wish it came in a bigger product size because I could see myself using this up quickly. I was worried it would feel sticky and it does not. The package says you can put it over makeup which I don’t know that I would do, but I have not tried that application. Soothing and cooling under eye relief
