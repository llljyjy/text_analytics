I got this product in exchange for my honest review. first of all I gotta talk about the scent. it’s STRONG. it’s has a strong citrus smell reminds me of the bath and body orange body butter.The amount of fragrant ingredients can be a irritating for some.The texture however is nice! It absorbs in the skin after about  30 seconds of application and sunscreen sits perfectly on my combination leaning a little dry in winters skin. I’ve been using this in the place of my vitamin C serum in the morning. THE PACKAGING I absolutely LOVE. it’s a jar with a pump!So it’s airtight, no fingers dipping it! you gotta use it once or twice to learn the perfect pump for the sound your face needs. it's nice but has a strong smell.
