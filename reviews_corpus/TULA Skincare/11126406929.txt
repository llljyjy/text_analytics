I took the time to review this product because at first I thought that it cause me some pimples and I stopped using it, but I wanted to give it another chance so after a few weeks I tried again and I loved it. The morning after you apply it you can notice your skin glowing, and it feels so soft! The smell isnâ€™t the best but the results are awesome!! Glowing skin
