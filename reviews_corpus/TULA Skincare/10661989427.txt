I received a sample of 24-7 Moisture Hydrating Day & Night cream from Influenster and Tula for free in exchange of my honest opinion.This facial cream is my new favorite facial treatment, for the colder months. The colder months make my skin flaky, mostly on my T zone, so I have to make sure I use something hydrating, somewhat to the oily side. This Tula cream can be used anytime of the day, it has no fragrance, itâ€™s quickly absorbed by the skin and leaves a pretty glow! Perfect for combination skin
