Tula is a female founded brand and Cruelty Free which I love to see and support.This is a Retinol free anti aging serum, perfect if Retinol is too irritating for you or if you are pregnant.So instead of Retinol this serum is packed with peptide like Retinol alternatives such as Bakuchiol, Alfalfa Sprouts & Stevia. This serum is quite thick which I enjoyed to massage into my skin, I found after my month of using this product my skin looked visibility hydrated and more firmI really liked this as a Retinol alternative because I could use it twice a day every day without worry of over irritation, and this would of been a perfect addition during my recent pregnancy.While this won’t be replacing my favorite Retinol I think this is a great addition to work alongside my Retinol and I’ll be interested to see how they pair, and if you are sensitive to Retinol this hands down is a excellent serum to consider! Great for sensitive skin and expecting moms
