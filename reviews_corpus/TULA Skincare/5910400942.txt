This sugar scrub smells absolutely delicious and fruity and is very gentle due to the fine sugar crystals. Although because the sugar is so fine, it dissolves very quickly into a bit of an oily feel so more product might be required compared to other similar scrubs. However skin feels very soft after using. Very gentle exfoliator
