I have been using this every morning for about 2 months now and it has held up!  My skin is usually combo but I’m winter its gets more dry. Thai moisturizer does a great job keeping the skin plumped but not overly heavy where you feel like ifs heavy on the skin. I don’t use it at night however as I need a bit more of a heavier moisturizer for overnight. This moisturizer though would be ideal for day and night use  come summertime. The amount you get is a lot so value is amazing I find. I received this product for free from Influenster for testing. All day moisture
