I bought this with my own money first off! The reason I was drawn to this is because Ive been looking for a tinted sunscreen and this one is a yellow undertone. Usually companies go for neutral or borderline orange so I was so happy to see this. This brand seems to be a competitor of Peach and Lily which I love and have been using for 3+ years. The price for the amount you get is pricy but on point with most clean skincare companies. This is a very light coverage. It doesn’t disappear into nothing like some but it leaves a light color which is best for days where you are running errands and dont feel like applying makeup. Its a runnier consistency and does not feel heavy on the skin, it sinks and blends right in. Its not super matte and its not glowy. I would say with glowy skincare this would have some glow. It will be good for a lot of skin types but it is more on the matte side because it does sink and blend well into the skin. There isnt a strong smell but its not odorless. This will be my every day sunscreen, throw into my bag and also use for reapplication which is possible with this. Some sunscreens are hard to reapply because the thickness or shine but this one works. If you are going to be in extreme sun or even water you may need a more intense sunscreen just in case. I will continue to use this and if it doesn’t break me out after a month of using then it will be my for sure go to. Ive seen a lot of complaints over the packaging, yes it could be better, you barely need to squeeze this and dont let it drip down the side and it will be fine. Could potentially leak on an airplane though. Finally a light yellow toned clean sunscreen!
