This makes my skin feel soft and smooth, and the product has wonderful, barrier-restoring ingredients. I also love the hygienic packaging. I would just consider your sensitivity to fragrance when purchasing. It is formulated without phthalates, but it does have quite a strong fragrance. It doesnâ€™t bother me but I would want to know if I were considering purchasing it! Soft, smooth skin but does have a scent!
