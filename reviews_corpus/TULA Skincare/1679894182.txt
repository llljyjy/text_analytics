I was quite nervous to try this as it was talked about so much by influencers. I was pleasantly surprised when I actually enjoyed this moisturizer. I have combo skin and it hydrates my face so well and looks incredible under makeup. The one thing I donâ€™t love is the scent but it goes away after a few minutes. Highly recommend. New Staple
