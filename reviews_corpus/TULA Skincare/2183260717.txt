I was so excited to be able to test out this product! I love the blue bottle and the pump is so easy to use. The mask is a thin gel texture that glides across your skin easily. It is very spreadable. I usually use 5-6 pumps for my whole face to make sure there is a thin, even layer across my face and under my chin. It is a brownish orange colour, but appears clear when it is on. It is difficult to describe the smell, but I don’t love it or hate it. The product leaves your skin feeling soft immediately after washing it off. I will have to continue to use it long-term to see more benefits, but so far it hasn’t caused any harm. I am prone to breakouts and it has not caused any. I am absolutely enjoying it so far! So soft!
