Thank you TULA/Influenster for letting me try this product. This is very hydrating and a little goes a long way. Don’t make the mistake I did and use too much or you will end up a greasy mess. I have only used it for about 3 nights so far and I haven’t seen a noticeable difference yet, but I will keep using it. I really love the design of the container - you push down to dispense the product so you don’t have to stick your fingers in a tub of product. Can’t wait to see results!
