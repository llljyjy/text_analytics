It is totally a holy grail. It is much needed on my skincare routine. I like all Tula products but this wrinkle drop is such a charm. It leaves my skin moisturised the right amount especially when you have combination skin like mine then you know the struggle. This product feels very light on my skin that I can layer it with my other daily routines. I use this especially in my night skin care and daily morning it leaves my skin very fresh. It has all the necessary ingredients retinal plus it’s cruelty free. I highly recommend it. It’s a holy grail
