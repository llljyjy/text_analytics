Unfortunately this product was a no from me and I didnt enjoy it because:-the scent is overwhelming (like an old school dove bar of soap)- made my dry skin feel really tight after useI will say, this does beautifully lather up, and a little goes a long way! I think this product would be great for someone with oily skin who does not mind fragrance in their skincare! It did do a good job as a second cleanse, but as someone who has  sensitive, dry skin- this was just not it :(- nan
