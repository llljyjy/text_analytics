I received this product from Influenster and TULA in exchange for an honest review. I’ve been using this product for at least two weeks along with two other TULA products. I’ve been applying it every other day in the mornings. The product is very light weight and absorbs nicely into my skin. It does not leave a greasy feel on your face or hands. The applicator is great and easy to use, it will be interesting to see how it fairs when the product gets down to its last few drops. I have used other vitamin C serums over the last few months and this one is at par with those. nan
