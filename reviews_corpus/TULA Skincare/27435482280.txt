I love that it says not just a sunscreen it’s skincare, even though I’m not exposed to the sun on a daily basis, this product claims to protect your face against blue light and pollution, so I’ve started to wear it under my makeup on a daily basis, it does not have strong smell like regular sunscreens, and for me it works like a glow primer. Wearing it solo is also great for a nice glowing look. No strong smell great glow
