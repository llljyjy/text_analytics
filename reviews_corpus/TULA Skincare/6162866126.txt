I love how it feels in the skin and it has immediate effect of hydration and plump looking skin. I did not find it greasy or heavy like some of other reviewers but rather felt it is very well absorbed by the skin. It leaves it moisturized in a good way in Canadian winter month. Will need to see how it feels in summer but for now it is just right for my combination skin. Definitely recommend it Protect and plump everyday moisturizer
