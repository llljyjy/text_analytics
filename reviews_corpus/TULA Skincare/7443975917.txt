The Brightening Treatment Drops with Vitamin C packaging was something I have never seen before. I was very impressed with the quality of the Tula Skincare products and how well they work! The serum applied nicely, absorbed quickly and was lightweight. So far I feel like this serum has started to lighten scars on my face in just a few weeks and am excited to see how my skin will look and feel over the course of a few months! nan
