I am always on the quest to try new Vitamin C serums and this one was great! The texture is thicker and not runny like most serums which made it easy to apply and not waste product. I also like the dropper with the bottle, 3 drops is perfect for my face. It also doesn’t smell like typical Vitamin C serums which could be a pro or con for some. I’ve been using it for 3 weeks and my skintone has definitely evened out and lightened some of my acne scars. I think for long term use it will be even better for my acne scars. Would definitely repurchase.I received this complimentary product from Influenster for testing and review purposes. Would repurchase!
