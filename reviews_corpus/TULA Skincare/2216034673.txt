There’s something to be said about simple skincare. I dont want to overcomplicate my routine….i want something that works, smells pleasant and feels good to use! Im here for the packaging too so this checks all of the boxes! If you’re wearing a full face of makeup, i recommend using a balm to pre-cleanse as this is not an all in one makeup remover. Love it though! Soft & Gentle
