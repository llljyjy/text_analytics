Amazing product. Didn’t sleep so well? Swipe some of this on after washing your face in the morning and immediately start looking more human. You can feel it on your skin if you rub your fingers over it, but it doesn’t feel heavy or clog up your pores in any way. I have very sensitive skin and was able to use this without any issues, as did my 12 year old daughter. We’re prone to bruising under our eyes so to find something that actually works to fix it and not just cover it up was amazing! nan
