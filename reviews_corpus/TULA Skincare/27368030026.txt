I’ve been using this for 2 weeks now and I’m waking up to smoother more even skin than when I started so im excited to keep using this. The texture is nice and feels great while applying, it’s lightweight enough to quickly absorb without feeling heavy or greasy but still leaves my dry skin feeling very hydrated. The first night I woke up and my face felt so soft even my husband noticed when he kissed my cheek. I think this might be my new holy grail!! **I received this product in exchange for my honest review** So Far I’m Impressed
