I am in love with this serum. I have used quite a few and this one just blows the others out of the water. You only need 2 or 3 drops and itâ€™s spreads so easily and dries down so quickly. It wears GREAT under makeup which is a huge pro for me. I use it in the AM and the PM as the first step in my skincare routine. My skin feels soft and healthy which is new for me in the winter time! This is definitely  the best my skin has ever been in the cold season. I love everything about this product. I for sure will be purchasing this! Adore
