I was super excited to this new moisturizer. I am at an age where signs of aging are starting to creep in, so anything I can do to combat that is a win!  I do have acne prone skin but I have been using this for a month now and can confidently say it has not caused any kind of break outs or irritation.The moisturizer does have an odd/sour scent - like old fruit or yogurt maybe?  Not my favorite but not a big deal as the scent immediately fades once applied.  That is honestly the only negative I could come up with.  The formula is moisturizing without being heavy or greasy - I have work at as a daytime moisturizer without it affecting my makeup at all.  I donâ€™t think any product is going to work miracles, but my skin looks noticeably more glowing/hydrated and overall healthier.  I am excited to keep using this and see if results continue to improve.  Added bonus - I really like the pump jar style of this product - helps maintain freshness of the product and prevent contamination. New daily staple
