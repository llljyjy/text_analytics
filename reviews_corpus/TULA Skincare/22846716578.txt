I’ve been using this eye balm for 2 weeksstraight (am and pm) to give my honestreliable review. I have a dry skin and this isthe first time I ever try an eye balm and I wasimpressed! It’s silky, hydrating, moisturizing,with good amount of product, has no scent, and contains great ingredients .Just a side note: I do not recommendapplying it before makeup. It doesn’t work asa primer. Your under eyes will definitelysmudge with foundation even after applying primer.I also recommend using it after applying thetoner, serum, and moisturizer to applysmoothly and evenly under your eyes for your pm routine for best results.Overall it’s a great eye balm and keeps yourunder eyes enriched and hydrated for a longtime! (Even when I wake up from my 8 hrsleep it’s still hydrated!) 24-7 Hydration indeed!
