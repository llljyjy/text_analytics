I never heard of this brand before I got this Universal face oil and I’m impressed. I love all the ingredients, all these oils that is not that heavy on the skin. I have very Very dry skin and it left my skin super hydrated (I’m not exaggerating) and silky smooth. It has light herbal scent, but it disappears in couple minutes. I am definitely purchasing another when this one is done. 10/10 - recommending to anyone with dry skin Super hydrating
