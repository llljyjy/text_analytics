Oh my goodness, I am in love. First, I typically use cleansing oils or balmâ€™s because I have dry skin. I have done some leg work. I have never used an oil that melts away makeup and leaves me with a beautiful glow like this does. I was and am amazed. My skin feels smooth and hydrated. I love this and will continue to buy it. You definitely need this! Melts away makeup!
