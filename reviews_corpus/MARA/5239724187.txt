I’ve just started using this retinol face oil so I can’t comment on its long term efficacy, but I can say that I do see a “glow” the next morning! The scent is mild and pleasant. I feel that this retinol would be beneficial for those that have sworn off retinol because of the flaking and dryness. I will continue to use it and report more details when they become clearer. So far so good!
