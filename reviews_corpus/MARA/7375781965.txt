Mara is another new brand in my vanity that i start to love (so happy new brands coming with great products like this). I do wear makeup everyday and its very important to me have good cleanser which is gently removing makeup. What I love about it that itâ€™s one step cleanser that removes makeup and cleanses my skin. Also I can use it in the morning to wash my face. It feels so hydrating! This cleanser is the one among best - gently removes makeup and not leaving any oily residue. pleasant aroma and texture. Very hydrating
