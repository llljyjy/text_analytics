This is such a beautiful product. The packaging is gorgeous, the bottle with a little dropper to apply just the right amount of oil. A little goes a long way, and that justifies the price. Just a drop or two covered my face easily. With any oil, it will leave a sheen on the skin, nothing terrible especially with night use, but I can’t see why it couldn’t be used under makeup if you fancy that. No harsh scent, either. My skin looked better almost instantly, and with prolonged use I can see this having lasting results. Highly recommend! Beautiful!
