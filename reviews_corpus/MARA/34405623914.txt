I don’t normally use cleansing oils because I have combination skin that is prone to breakouts when I use oils. This cleanser actually made my skin feel clean and hydrated. I noticed it removed all traces of makeup and I didn’t feel like I had to use alot of product to achieve desired results. I would recommend. One of the best cleansing oils I have tried. nan
