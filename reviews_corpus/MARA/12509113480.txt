I have used this for a while.  It is very good for keeping the skin young. It makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. Retinol can irritate your skin, at first you start using it 3 times a week and then increase to every day.  Itâ€™s really good for your skin, you just have to be willing to stick with it. nan
