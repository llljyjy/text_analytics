I’m very iffy on this SPF. I think if you are completely aware of what it is, it’s not as jarring, though. This is a serum—a very oily serum. I believe it is referenced as an oil, and it’s important to take that into account. This is not like a normal lotion-y sunscreen, it is an oil/serum. Being this way, the consistency is that of an oil. It is super runny and spreads and sits like an oil. It’s very messy if you’re not prepared. You’re meant to shake the bottle before use—well, it’s so liquidy that it gets everywhere, even if you close the nozzle. You’ll have to put your finger over the opening otherwise it’ll get everywhere. It’s very runny, so if you apply it directly to your face, it will be down your neck by the time you’re ready to rub in. If you’re putting in in your hands, you’ll just have to be careful as it can easily spill. On the face, it’s clear you just put oil on your face. It is right on the border of a hydrated glow and an oily face. I will say, I am a full face matte makeup person and it sits just fine under all my makeup. I was expecting it to fight back since it was so oily, but it behaved well and mattified just fine. I do think it added a subtle sheen under my matte look, which isn’t bad. The smell is also very kelpy/algae-esque. Not bad if you don’t mind. I don’t know, I think I would recommend if you know what you’re getting into and read reviews. If you’re looking for something low maintenance, perhaps not this. Worth noting absolutely no pilling and no white cast (am a WOC). nan
