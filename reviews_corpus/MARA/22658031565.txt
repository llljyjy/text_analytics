This Sea Vitamin C serum is a miracle in a bottle for me! I love how easy it is to apply and how quickly my skin absorbs it like it’s drinking the product. It left my skin glowing, nourished, and exceptionally hydrated without feeling slick or sticky. It was very gentle on my sensitive skin and felt completely weightless. The bottle and packaging are beautiful; the ingredients are pure and clean, and I know I’ll pick up many more bottles of this product in the future! Esssential Element of My Clean Skincare Routine!
