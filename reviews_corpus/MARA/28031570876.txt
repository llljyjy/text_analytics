This has to be my absolute favorite serum sunscreen I have ever tried! This Mara Sea Kale Sunscreen Serum is so hydrating and feels so rich but absorbs so quickly. In my experience, I use this in the place of my primer because my makeup sits on top of it perfectly all day. I love the protection it gives but also love the skincare element so much. Best of both worlds. Very highly recommend! Sun protection with amazing skincare!!
