This detox mask is a beautiful green soft clay. It doesn’t get extremely tight upon drying. It’s easy to wash off since the clay is soft.  It truly feels like a spa experience. I love the added ingredients of ashwagandha, honey, and green tea to soothe skin. My face feels soft, smooth and refreshed after washing this off. nan
