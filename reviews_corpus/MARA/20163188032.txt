This oil cleanser is the most effective way to remove makeup that I’ve tried and it leaves my skin so hydrated and balanced feeling! I have dry skin and micellar waters and soaps have such a stripping effect for me, but this cleanser was exactly what my routine needed. It removes even the most stubborn make up quickly and doesn’t feel heavy on the skin, or leave a residue when I’m using it like some other oil cleansers. I wish I’d found this years ago, my skin has never felt more clean or balanced—this one is staying a part of my skincare routine! The best cleansing oil!!!
