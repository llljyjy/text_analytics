Tiny but mighty! The bottle I have is pretty small, only 15 ml, but a little goes a long way. I love adding just a few drops into my moisturizer and eye cream to add extra nourishment to the skin. It’s not super greasy and doesn’t take forever to absorb like some other oils, but it definitely makes my skin look dewy and feel well-moisturized. nan
