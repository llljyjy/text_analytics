Removing makeup is difficult sometimes, which is why I love using an oil based cleanser. Not only did this remove my water proof mascara it left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. The makeup melts away this product. I like to double cleanse and do still see a difference in my skin post wash. Great!!!
