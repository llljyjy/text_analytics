performance | full star | *chef’s kiss*!!! I have been waiting YEARS to try this face oil, ever since II heard Mara’s interview on the boss babe podcast! I knew it would be a hit, and she DID NOT disappoint. Super lovely to use morning and night, wears well under makeup and thicc night creams. Also works amazingly by itself. Super nourishing for dry, winter skin, but also lightweight enough to use during the warmer months!texture | full star | looove when an oil doesn’t feel greasy/heavy, yet still moisturizes well. this doesn’t pill under spf either!scent | full star | omg this smells sooo good, not too overpowering/ doesn’t linger, and I know when my bf (who HATES scented things) gives me a compliment on the smell of something it’s a winner  packaging | full star | the mara’s packaging & overall branding is a WHOLE VIBE! Luxurious with sustainability taken into account, and totally gives off beach-y elegance ingredients | full star | I personally could go without the industrial terpenes, but the ingredients in this are top tier!value | .8 star | a bit on the pricier side for most, but soooo worth it IMOTotal 5.8 out of 6 stars A bit on the pricier side, but SOOOO worth it!
