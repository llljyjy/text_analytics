This cleansing oil is incredible!! It comes in a gorgeous bottle with an easy to use pump. Only a little is needed , about two pumps to do the job. The oil is lightweight, and feels so refreshing and soothing on my face. It immediately took off every bit of makeup I had on with ease, and left my skin feeling squeaky clean. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy, instead my face feels super soft and smooth. It gives me a beautiful, dewy glow and even helps hydrate my skin. Works really well with my combo skin. I’m in love with this cleansing oil from Mara. Can’t wait to try more of their products. I'm in love with this cleansing oil!!
