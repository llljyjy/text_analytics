I read about Mara Universal Face Oil, and I knew that I had to have it! My ultimate goal at 41 is to stop wearing foundation.  My skin is sensitive and I have fine lines around my eyes that this oil is pampering without any irritations! The ingredients which include Kalahari Watermelon,  Plankton, Moringa and Algae really are intriguing and let your skin GLOW like no other! There are so many ways to incorporate this product into your routine such as using it to highlight, mix in with your foundation or using it alone for an amazing skin plump and hydration. The packaging is so luxe, and it really feels Spa-Worthy! I will be repurchasing when I run out! GLOW-WORTHY!
