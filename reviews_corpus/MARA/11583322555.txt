The best facial oil I have tried so far. Using it for a few weeks already I have noticed that my fine wrinkles began to smooth. Somehow it hydrates my skin like no other oils and retinol formulas. Moreover, it brings a very healthy glow.  And the formula is pretty thick, so only few drops are needed to cover all face. nan
