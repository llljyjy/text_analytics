My winter skin is so dry! In this cold dry air, I was looking for something more occlusive than just my moisturizer. Mara has done just that! It locks in moisture and though it’s an oil, it doesn’t feel heavy. It smells sort of earthy herbal sweet, and I’m loving how hydrated my face looks in the morning. Complimentary. lock in that moisture!
