LOVE!!! Im traveling at the moment so I don’t have any makeup with me to see how it works with makeup removal but I do wear SPF. I used this before cleansing and I love how it feels. It’s exfoliating but does not irritate my skin at all, rather it felt really hydrating. It definitely removed my sunscreen really easily. This is a great addition to a double cleansing routine. nan
