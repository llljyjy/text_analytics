First of all I was impressed with how beautiful the packaging of this product is. Second, the texture is no lightweight and the smell is pleasant. I started using it just 1-2 times a week but will quickly go to 3-4 times. Definitely seeing results after using it consistently for more than a month. So gentle and beautiful
