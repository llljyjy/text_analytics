First of all, the bottle of this algae retinol face oil is gorgeous. It is so beautiful to look at. I really like the ingredients because it is mostly all natural ingredients, including soybean oil, sunflower seed oil, and almond oil. All are very nourishing. Retinol usually causes a little bit of irritation, but this algae retinol face oil doesn’t give me any irritation. It’s very gentle and hydrating. I use about 4-5 drops and it’s enough to pat all over my face and neck. It gives me a healthy glow without being too greasy and oily. Very enjoyable to use. gentle and hydrating
