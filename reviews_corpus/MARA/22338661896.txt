This Algae Enzyme Cleansing Oil is by far the best cleanser out there. My dry skin is no longer a thing. I feel hydrated and the best part of it I feel like I already have my serum and moisturizer on when I don’t. It sure is special and cleans my face and neck really well. It rinses off really good and makes my skin feel soft. I only needed a small amount twice a day and when I add some water to my face it makes a milky wash. Totally awesome! The bottle is absolutely beautiful, and I leave it out for everyone to see. I am new to Mara, and I’m obsessed! Love it! Definitely something special.
