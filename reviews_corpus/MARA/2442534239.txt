Love this! Iâ€™ve always been a fan of cleansing balm more than cleansing oil for first cleanse but this is slowly pulling me back towards oil cleansers. It removes makeup, sunscreen and mascara so easily without irritating nor drying out my skin. Leaves my skin more hydrated, clean and soft! Love this!
