This oil is so good for my dry aging skin especially in the winter. It does clean all my makeup even better than cleansing gel. I do like leave this oil on my skin for 5 minutes and then wash it off, I feel that my skin is much more hydrated this way. It’s smell very nice and not strong, and it doesn’t clog my pores. The only way I will ever remove my makeup
