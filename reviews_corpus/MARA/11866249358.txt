This serum feels so nice and luxurious on my sensitive skin! It absorbs well and really nourishes my skin from within. I haven’t had any breakouts with this serum (shocking because I have sensitive skin) and my skin looks more bright and smooth. It’s also lightweight which I love! The only con is the steep price but I think it’s worth it So good
