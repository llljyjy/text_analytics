This is hands down the best cleanser I’ve ever tried! After years of cleansers leaving my skin dull, dry and tight, or being too gentle to thoroughly clean my acne-prone skin, I’ve found the HG cleanser. This is the lightest oil cleanser i’ve tried and it does lather up a bit for that satisfying clean feeling, it also lightly exfoliates and my skin feels plump and clean after rinsing. I will never stop using this. It is pricey, but I find I can get away with one pump for my whole face which helps it last longer. Trust me, you need this
