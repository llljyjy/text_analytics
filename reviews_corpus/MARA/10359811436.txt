When I tell you I am obsessed with all things MARA, I mean it. This cleanser is the best skincare product I have ever tried. EVER. It is super hydrating, smells and feels beyond luxurious and somehow makes my skin feel *fresh from the spa* even after a full day in the Arizona sun. Don’t sleep on anything in this line. But If you don’t know where to start, this cleanser is it!  I love this product line so much I actually look forward to keeping up my daily routine. Do I always have a backup bottle in my drawer? Yes. Do I travel with full size products to share with my friends and family? Also yes. Did I remodel my bathroom based on the gorgeous packaging? Absolutely yes! Do yourself a favor and buy two bottles of this cleanser because you WILL start to panic as you work your way through the first (and you’ll treat yourself to an extra pump every few nights because, darn it, you deserve to feel like royalty). Pro tip: save the box and pump clamp so you can safely bring this on your girls trip, leave it on the bathroom counter of your questionable Airbnb and pretend you are in a 5 star resort on the Amalfi coast. You won’t be disappointed. And if you’re feeling generous, let your friends steal a pump so they, too, can feel like a French model. Get ready to feel like royalty!
