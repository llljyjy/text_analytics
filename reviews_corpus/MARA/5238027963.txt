This vitamin c serum feels very luxurious. It does feel light weight upon application but it doesnâ€™t work well with other skincare such as moisturizers or sunscreen if applying during the day. I did start using this prior to moisturizer and it worked better. This serum did keep my skin feeling hydrated throughout the day due to the moisturizing ingredients which is a big deal for someone like me who suffers from skin dryness/dehydration. Nice vitamin c serum! Perfect for dry skin.
