I LOVE this oil. I’ve never tried an oil cleanser before, I’ve used micellar water but I hate using so many cotton rounds, this is the perfect solution! I love being able to get all my makeup off with this oil! It takes off all my face makeup and even really stubborn mascaras! Also while other solutions strip my skin, this one leaves my skin feeling so hydrated! And the packaging sis such high quality! Hydrating and effective!
