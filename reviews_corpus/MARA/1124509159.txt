First things first, the packaging and bottle are beautiful! I love the marble with gold used on the box… and the bottle is a beautiful shade of blue! But that’s not the reason why you should buy this product… you should use it because not only does it provide protection from the sun, but it also hydrates and leaves skin looking beautiful and glowing. Plus, bonus, it fights against fine lines too! I’m pretty low maintenance, so having all these features in one product, makes this an easy addition to my daily routine. New favorite SPF!
