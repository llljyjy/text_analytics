I’m in love with this cleansing oil!!! It’s absolutely amazing!!! First thing is the packaging, it has a pump not a squeeze tube…why didn’t anyone think of this before? It’s so much easier to get the product out while removing my makeup. If you’ve ever used cleansing oils/balms in a tube you know what I mean. It gets really messy. Next, the formula is so perfect. It’s not solidified and ready to apply. There’s no heavy fragrance and it’s an overall pleasure to use! I wear makeup everyday for work so this is my new holy grail!!! My new holy grail!!!
