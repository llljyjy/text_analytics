I received this product complimentary of Influenster and Ilia in exchange for my honest review. This product unfortunately was not very hydrating for my dry sensitive skin so I had to use separate products for moisturizer. I found that it almost defeats the purpose of this being a serum and sunscreen since it barely covered much. Yes this is extremely light and not meant to have actual coverage just a minimal tint with SPF but I also didnâ€™t notice any significant skin improvements either. My skin stayed dry unless I used my regular creams and my minimal acne almost stayed the same. The Vitamin C can be irritating at least it was for me at first it tingles on the skin and might even itch. not very moisturizing
