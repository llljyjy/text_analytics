Let me start off with I have combination skin weather dependent winter it’s dry and summer it’s oily. I am trying out this product in trade for my honest review. It’s been fairly warm here and occasionally humid. I really wanted to love this product. I do love that it has sunscreen and it’s pretty lightweight you don’t need to use much. It did not make me greasy, however I dislike the packaging I would prefer a dropper style or squeeze style. I didn’t notice much coverage at all pretty much non existent. Hope someone find this review helpful. Wasn’t a fan
