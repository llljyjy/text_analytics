I received this product as a free sample for my honest review from Pinchme. I was very excited to try this product because of the SPF and the light tint combined. However my skin did not like it. It went on fine but as the time passed I became extremely oily, I had to use a couple of blot sheets throughout the day. Also after about a week of using it daily my face started to break out. I really wanted to love this product but unfortunately itâ€™s not for me. No for me
