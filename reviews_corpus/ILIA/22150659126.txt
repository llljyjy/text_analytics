The C Beyond Triple Serum was awesome for me! I wanted something I could wear to ball games and practices that wasnâ€™t makeup and would still make my face feel great. I loved the Ilia serum. Not only does it have SPF 40 sunscreen to protect my skin when sitting in the sun but it has vitamin C Zane Niacinamide so it made my skin feel so clean and smooth. I knew I was getting the protection from the sun and all the awesome benefits from Vitamin C all in one. It was lightweight on the skin and still gave a little color. I will say FOLLOW directions and make sure you shake before use! I used a blending bud to tap it into my skin Great product especially for on the go mamas
