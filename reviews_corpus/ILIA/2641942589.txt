I received this as a free sample from PINCHme.  The applicator is not user friendly.  Like other reviews, it is awkward to dispense.  The product itself is greasy.  I have dry skin and it was still too oily.  I did get some pilling even with patting and with and without other products added prior.  I did like the color.  It was sheer but gave enough coverage to even out my skin tone. Not so great
