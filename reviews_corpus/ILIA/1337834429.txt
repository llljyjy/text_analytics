I wanted to love this product but the formulation went on sticky and gloppy. The shade was almost red/orange even though it was the lightest. Also it has a very strong almost cinnamon smell. 2 stars because I love the concept and I love that it’s clean, but sadly this didn’t work for me at all. Great concept poor execution.
