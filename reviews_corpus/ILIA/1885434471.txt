Regardless of the method of application, vigorous shaking, different skin prep, the product pills something horrible. The only way it doesn’t is if you dab it in with one finger. At this rate the bottle will last less than one week as I can’t spread it without pilling and have to use excessive amount. Great idea, poor execution
