I love trying new things, so when I was presented with the opportunity of using this triple serum I was super excited. I love the smell, I love the texture and I love how it goes on the skin. I’ve gotten so many compliments about my skin since I started using it. I like to wear it by itself as I feel it evens out my complexion. People keep asking me about my foundation and I don’t wear anything but ILIA. I’m a fan. Like a big fan. nan
