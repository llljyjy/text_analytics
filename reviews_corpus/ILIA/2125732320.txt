I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review and I chose to try out ILIA’s new C Beyond Triple Serum. I’ve been a huge fan of their Super Serum Skin Tint and prefer wearing lighter makeup around the summer time. I have oily combination skin and this lightweight serum does the job at giving me that perfectly glowy minimal coverage. I love that it has SPF 40 and Niacinamide too! It does tend to run very watery but make sure to shake it really well before applying. I prefer using my fingers to apply this product since it’s so lightweight and sheer.
