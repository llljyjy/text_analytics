I was so excited to try Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen with Vitamin C 10% + Niacinamide, a free sample that I received from Pinchme.  I like that is a sunscreen so I can protect my face when I’m out.  It was easy to apply and it blended great on my skin tone. By the way I got the Tone #2.  The only downside is the smell. I was expecting to have a pleasant odor but for the contrary,  it doesn’t smell good.  It does its job though,  protecting from uv ray and  nourish my skin Not that bad!
