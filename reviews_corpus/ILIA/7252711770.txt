I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I chose ILIA’s new C Beyond Triple Serum because I already use their Super Serum Skin Tint for my daily look and I wanted something simple for summer vacation days at the lake. This was great for that no-make-up look. It’s lightweight and doesn’t feel like you’re wearing anything and I really appreciate the SPF. Because it’s light coverage, it’s also easy to apply using just my fingers. I referenced the image that shows what tone to choose based on my Skin Tint shade and it was a good match. Happy to add this to my ILIA collection. nan
