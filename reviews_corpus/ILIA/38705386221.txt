I received this through Influenster and originally wasn’t going to review due to the issues I was having utilizing this product but have been able to try it with the proper instructions and like it much more. It does hold true to what it says it will do but the application is very particular and you have to utilize it just as it says in the new directions. I also typically do little makeup and probably would only recommend this if you don’t wear alot of makeup that you’re trying to layer because layering seemed impossible unless you applied much much later. Still love the brand and just think there’s a learning curve with this one. Must follow the application directions
