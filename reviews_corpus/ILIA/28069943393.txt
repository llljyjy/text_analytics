I like that this has 40 spf and goes on smoothly. It didn’t leave any sticky feeling on my skin and seemed to stay on all day. It is very light so it doesn’t cover like I would like but it is nice to put on and then put a little powder on top to cover any issues. It works for me so far. I hope that over time it will make my skin brighter since it has vitamin c and niacinamide. Its too soon to tell if it will so we’ll see. nan
