I really love this product as it cuts down on time and steps in my morning routine. Normally, I go in with niacinamide or vitamin C and then succinic acid on acne spots, then moisturizer, then wait for that to dry, and then spf. Nothing in my routine is tinted as that’s not something I’m super interested in. This product is tinted but it really doesn’t provide a ton of coverage which I personally like. It makes my skin a little glowy and a little more even toned but it definitely doesn’t provide coverage like a tinted moisturizer. It’s also turned my morning routine into a one step process which I absolutely love. I generally have super oily skin but this didn’t make me shiny, just a little glowy. I also saw others complain about pilling and I didn’t have an issue with that at all. I only used this product though without moisturizer or anything underneath. I did add a little moisturizer on top in specific areas where I needed extra hydration and I didn’t have any issues. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the price is just insane. It’s basically $70. I don’t know that I can justify that...maybe if I only buy this and nothing else in my morning routine then it balances out but it’s also such a small size for that price. Great product that shortens my morning routine
