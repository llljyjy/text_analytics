I was excited to try a sunscreen from Ilia, but it’s too oily for my skin. The overall feel of was fine but I felt like it made my skin oiler as the day went on. I followed all the instructions on the packaging, shook it well, applying a very thin layer each time I used, and allowing time to soak in it still made me oilier and broke up the little bit of foundation I had on a couple of times. I think for dry skin it would be fantastic, it’s a very runny thin consistency but it felt  really hydrating. It doesn’t have any real coverage but I felt like it evened out my skin tone, for me it was better to wear without any make up. I will keep using it when I don’t want to wear any face make up and just powder a little thorough out the day. Good but not perfect
