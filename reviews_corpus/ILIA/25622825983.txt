I received my sample of Ilia C Beyond triple serum SPF 40 from Pinchme. The first thing that I really like about it is the fact that it’s available in a shade that matches my skin tone. You must shake it well before use, otherwise it feels gritty on your face. It takes a minute to absorb into the skin but once it does, it’s weightless. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and it actually does make my skin appear brighter and moisturized. nan
