I hated this product! I received this to try for free and I was excited to get a product that has sunscreen, close to my shade, and has skin care qualities. However, I didn’t like it from the first try on. The pump that it comes with is hard to use and messy as the serum is runny. I end up pumping about 4 times to cover my whole face. It’s not hard to blend in on my face and does not look oily either. The thing that I hated the most about this serum is the smell. It smells really bad and the scent lasts forever. Even when I wore this under makeup, I still smelled the product. After using it for a week, I never grew to love it. After seeing how much it would cost to buy, I would never recommend this product as that is too high a price for it; especially if you want to reapply the pro it throughout the day. Honestly, my skin did not show a difference after consistent use at all. Not a great product and overpriced. nan
