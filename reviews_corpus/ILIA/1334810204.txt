I received Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum Broad Spectrum SPF 40 Sunscreen free from Ilia and Pinchme in exchange for my honest review.  This is unlike any product I’ve used before.  It is a tinted serum that contains Vitamin C, Mineral Sunscreen with SPF 40 and Niacinamide.  It brightens, smooths and protects skin.  It is water-free, made up of weightless oils and Allantoin to smooth and nourish the skin.  It comes in 3 translucent tones to neutralize white cast with a sheer glowy finish.  The tint I used was extra-light to medium as my skin is very fair.  It must be shaken vigorously to distribute the product uniformly for an even application.. It is made of powders suspended in oils. You can hear a ball inside helping to mix up the product kind of like that in a nail polish.  The bottle has a pump to apply the serum.  I found out the hard way to pat and not rub in the product. If you rub it causes pilling which is highly undesirable.  You should wait a full minute for the product to absorb before applying any other makeup.  It sort of reminds me of a tinted moisturizer but with the texture of a serum and you have to be delicate in the application.  I like the SPF and that it is tinted to prevent white cast.  My skin felt good when I applied the product correctly.  It was a little bit tacky feeling at first, but it did eventually absorb all the way.  When I use a product with SPF that is tinted I am unsure where to stop applying to avoid lines or lack of sunscreen.  I guess I need a separate product for my ears for example.  I don’t typically apply tinted products to my ears but I always apply sunscreen there. Overall this product is not for me.  I find it causes pilling too easily and is hard to blend into my skin.  It also is more tacky than I like and takes far too long to absorb. Not for Me
