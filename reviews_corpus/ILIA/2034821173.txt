This is a great product to use for reviving your skin and protecting it at the same time. Vitamin C has proven time and time again that it is great for the skins tone and balance. ILIA has paired it with a broad spectrum SPF to keep sun rays from damaging your skin. This is a natural way to protect your skin but it also brightens it for a beautifully clean look. They use dry oils and Allantoin for instant hydration and to soothe skin. The serum will leave your skin with a fresh and pumped up glow. Once it absorbs in, you can apply make up as usual. Isnâ€™t that fantastic?! Unique!
