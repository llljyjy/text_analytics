C beyond is my new routine staple. I’ve been using tone 2 for two weeks and I already notice a difference in my skin. It’s the perfect product for no-makeup days, or paired with concealer and blush for a super natural look. I love the lightweight, serum-y/dry oil texture. Also, no scent so great for us sensitive skin people! Thank you ILIA for creating my new favorite product! Incredible SPF, hydration + glow
