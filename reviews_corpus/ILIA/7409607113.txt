Wow, I’m very impressed with this serum and how it combines everything I use on a daily basis into one. Making it fast and convenient and easy to use on my combination mature skin. I’m between medium and light and tone one matched perfectly and flawlessly. I’m big on sun protection and this has a higher spf than I usually apply and I love how it wasn’t greasy or interfered with the products performance. A few pumps is all you need and myself personally I will be using this more as my daily foundation since it provides me with the protection and coverage I need. At 41 taking care of my skin is a must and it’s a transition that makes it hard finding a product that works but I recommend this for any age and my daughter actually complimented me on my makeup and when I told her it’s serum she wanted to try it for herself and she’s 18 so I’m definitely glad I got to try this for free as a sample and I’m so thankful because I would definitely purchase a serum like this but wouldn’t of ever thought to try it out. I absolutely recommend it and it’s become my new favorite product! Start young as it works!
