I’ve been relying on this pretty heavily this summer, as it’s hot and I just can’t be bothered to do my usual multi-step skincare routine in the morning. Most days I just use this, but it works well under Ilia’s Super Serum Skin Tint if I need coverage. Makeup sits well on top of it, too, and sweating with it on is okay. I’m not sure if I’ll keep relying on it so much when the weather cools off, but I’m definitely a fan for now! Hot Weather Lifesaver
