I enjoy the ILIA brand. I appreciate this product as part of my prep before my heavier makeup. It is more skincare than anything and it has no coverage. I believe the pigment in this helps prevent the white cast that a majority of sunscreens give. I have no issues with breakouts and as long as you follow the instructions then there isn’t issues with it pilling. I’ve worn it on its own, under foundation, and reapplied it throughout the day with minimal issues. Just be aware of the ingredients of your other skin products. nan
