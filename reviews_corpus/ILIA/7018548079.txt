I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review ! Personally , I really liked this but not by itself . If you use it just by itself, it feels like you need more than one pump for it to apply well enough to the face . However , I mix it with my moisturizer and that makes the product work perfectly ! Doing it this way has made applying it flawless . I do sometimes feel like there is a minimal white cast but it seems to blend seamlessly into my skin quickly after that . I experienced breakouts with this as well but they went away fairly quickly . I did forget to take the necessary photos as well for this but I can honestly say my skin has looked better since using it . Now , it is just because of the product itself or a mix of my other skincare ? I have no clue . However , the breakouts have stopped and I am still using this . A small issue I did have with the product was the bottle and pump - I did not like the design ! I wish it was in an easier to pump bottle . Pumping the product felt really hard to do with the way the head of the bottle is shaped . Maybe you guys could go back in and do a redesign that is more friendly to those with issues ? Just something to think about .I would repurchase this again ! I DIDNâ€™T EXPECT TO LIKE THIS . . .
