I have super sensitive, very fair combination skin that turns red with any heat or exertion. I LOVE this serum! Even though it has no coverage, the glow somehow gives the illusion of slightly evening out my skin tone. I’ve been adding a few dots of concealer on my more red areas, and it evens out nicely without the need of another product with more coverage. I shake it very well, tilt it down to pump, swipe it across the broad areas of my face and then press it in all over, and I haven’t had any pilling issues. The moisture level is enough to leave my drier areas feeling moisturized without need of a separate moisturizer. It understandably doesn’t cover my skin texture issues, which also happen to be my oilier areas, so I dust finishing powder over those problem areas, and I feel confident enough to go out without more coverage. Skin cancer runs in my family and now entering my 4th decade of life and living said life under the endless California sun, I am religious about SPF. I love that this serum has so many skincare benefits in one easy step. It may be a little more finicky to figure out how to apply, but the overall time it takes is more than saved by having all this great skincare in one product. Very happy with it! Also, on a final note, I am extremely scent sensitive, and, at least the bottle I received, there is barely any smell. It just smells like mineral makeup to me. I greatly appreciate that Ilia doesn’t add fragrances and keeps the ingredients as good as they are--finding products that don’t cause a reaction on my super sensitive skin are rare, and this is one of them!!
