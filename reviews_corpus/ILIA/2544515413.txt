I would like to preface this review by letting you know that I have very sensitive skin and normally have a reaction to any change in my normal skincare routine.  I started using the Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 and loved it immediately!  It started out leaving my skin feeling moisturized and smooth.  I felt like it looked great alone or under make up.  This is the type of product I like to wear on a daily basis, it’s got good skincare, SPF, and a little coverage.  I did make the mistake one day of rubbing it in and it did get a little pilly, so make sure you follow the directions.  I really thought this was going to be me every day serum and was so excited.  However, about day 4 or 5 my face started burning after I put the serum on.  I tested it against my other skincare products I was using to make sure the burning was really truly coming from the Ilia and not another product.  After several attempts I was able to positively say it was the Ilia.  Unfortunately, I won’t be able to use it any longer.  I did pass it on to my daughter who uses it every single day and loves it!!  I would highly recommend this product, just be aware if you have super sensitive skin, like I do, it may not end up working out for you. I loved this product!
