This is the perfect product for those days when you don’t want to apply a full face of makeup. It’s been great for hot summer days when I want SPF and light coverage, but I don’t want to deal with a ton of makeup in the dismal heat. I like that the coverage is very light, but if you want more coverage, you will need to use other products on top of this. Even with the light coverage, it’s pretty good at hiding some of my skin’s redness. My only complaint is with the packaging. The product doesn’t dispense very well with the current design.
