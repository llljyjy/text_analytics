I have 2 reviews, as my mother (early 60s) and I (late 20s) both tried this. My mother gives it 5 stars, I give it 3 stars.First, I’d like to mention that there are specific instructions for applying this product: shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds, then pat lightly to smooth over your skin and do NOT rub. I always forgot to do this, which for me made it more annoying to use. Second, neither my mother nor I used this under makeup, we used it as a sunscreen/tinted look.My review: I have normal skin, dry in the winter. I used this in summer and didn’t notice any additional dryness. However, I dislike the smell and how it lingers. As this goes on my face, it was huge to me. So I took off one star. I took off another star because after I let it sink in, when I’d rub my face a bit it still pilled.My mother’s review: She really likes that it’s a high SPF that provided a bit of coverage. She didn’t mind the smell, and it did not sting her eyes like a lot of regular sunscreens have. We did receive a free sample to test. I did notice the price when I went to write this review, and it’s likely a bit high for just a sunscreen, like how we used it. Ignoring price, we’d likely recommend it. Decent tinted sunscreen option - pat, don't rub
