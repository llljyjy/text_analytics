The tone 2 was so smooth and absorbed into my skin immediately. I like the invisible spf the most and how it quickly absorbed into my skin . I though I may have gotten the wrong shade, but it blended so well into my skin. The only downside was the smell and I was shocked how much it costs for 1 oz . nan
