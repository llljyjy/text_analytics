I received this product as a free sample for my honest opinion from PinchMe. I like the product of how it feels on my skin. It does not feel oily but just be sure that you shake C Beyond vigorously for 10-15 seconds before using. If you don’t it will not combine the ingredients correctly. The product is a little runny for my liking. It’s like a sunscreen lotion but with no white residue. I like that it has vitamin c, niacinamide and SPF 40. I have not really seen brighten in my skin but I have only been using it for a week. Maybe if I use it for a month I will see something happen. I also like how it comes in a pump container so you don’t contaminated the product by putting your finger into it. I don’t think I will buy it because it’s little to pricey for me. If it was a little less pricey I would buy it. nan
