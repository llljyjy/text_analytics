Ilia C beyond triple serum is a great neutral base layer with a nice glow and built in sunscreen. I love having an easy sunscreen to apply first think, to know im not going unprotected. It is easy to use and goes on easily. I was a little worried about the tint at first, but it is super subtle. It doesnâ€™t make my skin feel dry or greasy and it is so light on my skin.  I would definitely recommend! Light layer
