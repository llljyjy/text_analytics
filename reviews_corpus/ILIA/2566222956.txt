Not impressed with this. First it leaves a grainy texture in my skin. It’s like very fine sand. It also is awkward to squirt out and I have to use 5-6 pumps to cover my face. I don’t mind the “oilyness” that other people mention because it it a nice dewy glow. But I’ll be sticking to my supergoop for sun protection. It’s so much smoother! Pass on this
