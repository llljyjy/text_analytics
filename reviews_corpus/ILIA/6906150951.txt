I got tone 2 which works when tan but should have got tone 1. Do wish there was more color variety. Tip to put on with hands and not a brush or sponge. It was nice and I would buy again if price we a little lower. I use this for a no makeup day and put on clean skin and put nothing on top and it wears so well. Good everyday tinted serum
