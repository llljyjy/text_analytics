This serum is oil based so the finish is dewy and radiant, itâ€™s absolutely perfect for me. Someone who had an oily skin might not like this. The serum is lightweight and does not clog my skin at all. I have been enjoying it so far. It provides a small tint which i like for those days i do not need or want to wear any makeup or powder on my face. It feels so luxurious and pampered. Be sure to follow the instructions for better results. nan
