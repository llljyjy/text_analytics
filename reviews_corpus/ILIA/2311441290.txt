I received a full sized bottle of the Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum in SPF 40 from PINCHme in exchange for my review. I was excited to try this as this was a new brand for me. The serum itself is very fluid and thin so it must be shaken well or there will be some separation. There is a caution of pilling and the first time I tried it, I rubbed it in like how I apply regular sunscreen and was surprised at how much of the product became flaky. I later read that this product should be patted into the skin and that seems to have helped the pilling issue. I also think depending on the moisturizer or product used in conjunction with this can affect the outcome as well. The design of the pump is best used holding it upside down to dispense the product. I also like that it includes added ingredients like vitamin c and niacinamide, as well as doesn’t leave a white cast. The color I received was Tone 1, and it matches pretty close to my skin but it doesn’t conceal any imperfections. It also has a slight fragrance, which isn’t my favorite but it’s a matter of preference. I think it’s an overall good product once you know how to avoid the pilling. Great multipurpose sunscreen
