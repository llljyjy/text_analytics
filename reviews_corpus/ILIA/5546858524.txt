Definitely read the instructions before using this. You MUST shake it well. It makes all the difference. It’s a great product. I’m extremely oily and this product surprising sits well on my skin alone. It is glowy but not anything crazy and definitely not a greasy glow. Haven’t seen any significant skin benefits with it yet but it’s only been a few weeks since I’ve been using it. nan
