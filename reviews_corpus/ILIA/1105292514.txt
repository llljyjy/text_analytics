I love the idea of the serum and SPF 40.  I applied the product daily after my moisturizer. The product sank right into my skin and wasn’t oily.  I applied my make up after with no issues.  I really didn’t notice anything different about my skin.  I could see the glow on my hand after application.  The only thing I didn’t like about this serum was the metallic scent on my skin after a few hours. C Beyond Triple Serum
