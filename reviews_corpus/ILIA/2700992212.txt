I like this serum combo especially for it’s skin care benefits. There are a couple of things, for me, that work better than others. On it’s own, it’s great. I’m oily and it sank in to my skin well, felt fine and looked beautiful. If you move it around too much, it pills and is kind of frustrating. Under foundation, too, it can pill and be frustrating. I would wear this on it’s own. Glowy
