I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now and am happy with the results. You absolutely must follow the directions for use. I did not the first time and it did not go well. But if you follow the directions for how to apply, it works great. It feels really silky on the skin and I love that the tint helps avoid that awful white tone these types of products have when not tinted. If you’re looking for a good serum, look no further! nan
