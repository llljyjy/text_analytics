Not for me at all, I got this as a sample to try from what I can gather the size I received is pretty close to a normal size. For starters the smell it smelled like expired beauty products I can’t put my finger on it but it was like it’s been sitting out and someone gave it to me to get rid of it. I couldn’t have it on my face for a full minute. The color was way off and I haven’t gotten that tan this summer so it was pretty bad. I am all for a multitude skin product with some tint but this was not good at all The smell
