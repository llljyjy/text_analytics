I recently received the Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen with Vitamin C 10% + Niacinamide from Pinchme to try. It goes on really well.as long as you make sure to shake it up enough and dont mess with it once you apply. It stays on really well underneath my makeup. It went on fairly smooth and stayed smooth as long as you dont mess with it too much. Good product
