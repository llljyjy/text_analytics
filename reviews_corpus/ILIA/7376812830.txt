have used Ilia products before and loved them so when I received Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 I was excited. I have a love and hate relationship with this product. Although I didn’t see much of a difference on my face I did feel it. This goes on almost translucent but gives you a glow. My makeup application goes on smoother and I sometimes even wear it by itself. It will feel greasy but then dries completely. Make sure you shake the product really well. I use my fingers to apply. Also when applying to your face make sure that you pat it on, otherwise if you rub it in it will feel like it’s peeling. It’s as if the product is breaking apart. nan
