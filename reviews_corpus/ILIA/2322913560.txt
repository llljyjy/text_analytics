I am slightly indifferent as this product differs based on other products you use with it. When I used it alone it went on smooth and quickly absorbed into my skin. I liked how it blended well and somewhat evened out my tone. I didn’t have any breakouts and it felt lightweight. On the other hand when I used it with makeup it left a weird texture on my face as if it didn’t interact well with my foundation. Decent Alone
