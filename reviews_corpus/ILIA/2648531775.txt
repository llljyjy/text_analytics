This is the best facial SPF I’ve ever used. I have combo skin, dry with a somewhat oily t zone. Most face SPF’s make my skin so greasy but this one dries down nicely, especially if I go light on my am skincare. It performs well under makeup and I enjoy the tingly sensation of the vitamin C. If you don’t like that feeling you probably won’t like this product. It’s a very sheer tint but no white cast at all. I really like that it has skin care and SPF all in one. It’s spendy but worth the price. Some tips would be to go light or skip moisturizer before application if you’re on the more oily side, and pump drops onto different areas of your skin and pat the product in to avoid pilling. Overall amazing product and would recommend to everyone! Best facial SPF I've ever tried
