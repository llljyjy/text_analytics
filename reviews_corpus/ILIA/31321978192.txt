I got this serum sunscreen complimentary from pinch me for my honest review. I like this product overall. I am a makeup minimalist so it is sufficient for me for every day wear without needing foundation, concealer etc. Feel is good and gives good glow to the skin. Seems to be effective as a sunscreen. Packaging is good and pump has good functionality. Not a huge fan of smell though it goes away pretty fast after applying. nan
