Was super excited to try this. Always looking for a good sunscreen. Overall I wasn’t really impressed by this product. The packaging makes dispensing a little weird. It’s really watery so you have to shake really well. I liked that it’s a mineral sunscreen and has pretty good ingredients. Didn’t like how it felt on my skin. Felt greasy and it didn’t absorb into the skin. Couldn’t wear under makeup for that reason. It would make my foundation all slippery. Used it for a whole month and didn’t notice any positive changes in my skin. Pass
