I love the ILIA C BEYOND TRIPLE SERUM SPF 40. To apply shake, pour into the palm and apply in a padding motion on the face. It took 3 pumps for my entire face. It has a sheer coverage. Waited a minute before applying foundation. Foundation looked great on top of the SPF 40. It smells great, the scent is not overpowering. Easy to use and apply. Looks great under makeup. Leave a glowing/dewy do we finish. leaves my skin very soft!
