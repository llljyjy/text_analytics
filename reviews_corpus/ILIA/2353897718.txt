Wasn’t exactly sure how to use this originally. The shade is a hair too deep for me but hardly noticeable since there isn’t much coverage. I wore it alone on beach day and only reapplied 1x and had no problem with burning. I have also worn it under my everyday foundation and it wasn’t noticeable at all Forget coverage & think of this as skin care
