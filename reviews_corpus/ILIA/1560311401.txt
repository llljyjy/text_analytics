So I was going to return this.  Bought it. Used it. Made my face tingle. Chatted with someone on the Ilia site and then started the return process. But something said to give it another try. Read reviews and saw that people had success with it on damp skin. So applied it directly after using Klairs unscented toner. And it was amazing!!  Went on smooth. No pilling. No burning.   Wore the next day to it the beach. Sun blocked.  Did not burn!  Did not tan. After washing my face at night my skin was bright and clear.  No new acne or red spots.  Just good skin. Wore it again the next day, this time with a primer and light makeup balm over it. Looked great. Not greasy just dewy goodness. I am hooked.  I gave 4 because I am not sure of the long-term effects (brightening hyperpigmentation, etc.) I am hooked!
