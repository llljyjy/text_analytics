I thought it would be more hydrating. I have combo skin and the dry patches ended up getting stuck to it. The dispenser doesnt dispense much which is good however the bottle leaks. I put it in my drawer on its side and a few hours later it was a mess to clean up. I will not be using this product again. Leaky bottle
