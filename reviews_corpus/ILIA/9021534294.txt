I haven’t  100% decided how I feel about this in the sense that the packaging kind of bothers me and the pump itself is very annoying and I feel like I’m using so much of it for how little there is which is interesting since it’s the same amount as a skin tint and I don’t feel that way  but I guess it’s just how it comes out that it feels like you’re using so much more and wasting it. For example to cover my whole face I use about 2 to 3 pumps so to me I feel like I’m gonna finish it next week but we’ll have to see. As far as the product itself inside it’s absolutely amazing I use  it alone and then just put a little bit of their concealer and their powder and it leaves your skin beautiful and glowing! I’ve also use the skin tint over this with also a little bit of concealer and then powder and again it’s amazing the actual formula the product is just beyond unbelievable!! nan
