This product has everything a girl could ask for: broas spectrum spf 40, niacinamide, vitamin c and no white cast. I was sent the shade: Tone 3. Getting the product to dispense was a pain. The pump felt very loose and air pumps are annoying because you have to pump plenty of times before anything comes out. Also, you have to hold it upside down to dispense which is a small annoyance. They should change packaging. The product itself was quite nice. There is no white cast at all and it blended super well into my skin and I didn’t see any evidence of me applying anything at all. The tint is purely for blendability and not coverage. It left a glow on my skin which I didn’t mind even though I have oily skin. It didnt have that sunscreen smell to it which is a plus. Super blendable
