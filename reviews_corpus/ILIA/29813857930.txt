I received this C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 for free from PINCHme. I was so excited to try this serum since it has sunscreen protection on it and Vitamin C. And most important it doesn’t contain hyaluronic acid. So hard to find these days. But I turned sad because it smells bad. This is the only thing I don’t like about it. Besides having 2 ingredients that are very important when it comes to skincare, Vitamin C and SPF, I like other things about it. For example, it matches my skin tone so well, I was little worried about that since the color looks dark on the picture and bottle. Another thing is that it feels lightweight and leaves the skin smooth. The skin absorbs the product fast too. So I don’t need to worry about feeling sticky. Didn't like the fragrance of it!!!
