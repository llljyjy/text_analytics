I didnâ€™t like this product as much as I thought I would. It does give me a lot of glow but not in a cute way it actually makes me look really oily. Not for sensitive skin I had a few break outs after using it. The only thing I like about it is that my skin felt soft after taking it off. I will probably give it another try. Not the best
