I was excited to try this sheet spf serum as I love the original serum with coverage but this serum is more of an oil spf and can’t be used with anything else on your skin unless you wait over 15 minutes and it still rolls off. I tried multiple times and this formula is not right for me. The tone is fine as they are sheer colors and I also bought the tone 3 to use for a darker blend with tone  2, but it’s the formula. I am still a fan of ilia, but for me this is not the spf protection I can use. not a fan
