I was pretty impressed with this! I don’t like super heavy face makeup, but wanted to wear SPF more since I’m pretty bad at keeping up with it, and this gave me some nice light color and protection at the same time. There is a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it it’s a really nice everyday product! Nice light coverage
