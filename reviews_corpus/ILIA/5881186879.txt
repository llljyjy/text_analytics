I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I’ve used this product every morning for 4 weeks and love it! It has a thin consistency and applies like a dry oil. I found that 4 pumps seemed to be the best amount for full face coverage, I applied to my T zone and then would pat in on the rest of my face. Gave my skin a dewy finish and has a very pleasant scent that doesn’t linger. Absorbed into my skin well. Worked great has a sunscreen and was fine replacing my morning serum. I found on days that were a tad more humid I didn’t need to apply a moisturizer on top. Was wonderful on its own and under my makeup. After 4 weeks I still have at least a half bottle left. With it working as a serum and sunscreen, and lasting power I think this is worth it! I would purchase in the future! Works well- time saver!
