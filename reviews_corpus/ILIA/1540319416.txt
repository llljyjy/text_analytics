I’m always on the lookout for good sunscreen, so I was excited to try this. I have dry skin, so I didn’t mind the dewy finish. I can certainly see why someone with oily skin might have a different opinion, though. While not my favorite of those I’ve tried, I don’t hate it. I also think the price point is a bit high for what it is. I prefer something with a lightweight coverage and this has a more translucent finish. nan
