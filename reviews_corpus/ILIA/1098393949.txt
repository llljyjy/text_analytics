I like the consistency of the product as it doesn’t feel too greasy and absorbs into the skin. My skin feels more hydrated and the sunscreen does not leave a white cast. I have light medium skin and tone 1 wasn’t too light or dark for my skin tone. The product is very translucent so do not expect any coverage if you have dark spots or acne spots. I received this product for free from PINCHme in return for my honest opinion. nan
