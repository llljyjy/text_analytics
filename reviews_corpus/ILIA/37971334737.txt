I received this product as a free sample from Pinchme. At first I was really excited because I really need serum for my face with mineral suncreen with Vitamin C. This serumhas vegan ingredients which is what I amlooking for. However, I was disappointed when I received the product because It is not my skin tone. I received tone 3 which is too dark and  I could not blend it with my face tone. My skin is light to medium so I dont think tone 3 is suitable for me. However, I applied directly into my skin, it made my skin glow and really good! nan
