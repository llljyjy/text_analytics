Another great Ilia Beauty product added to my arsenal! I was a little apprehensive when I saw the lack of shades- but I do think the product blends out well to my skin tone. My actual skin tone would appear to be between tones 2 and 3. I did notice the serum changes over time, which happens a lot with a lot of clean beauty products. It seem to get darker over time and is less hydrating over time. It is still a good choice for a nice, tinted moisturizer with SPF and the addition of Vitamin C- there are not any better, cleaner, and affordable options out there. nan
