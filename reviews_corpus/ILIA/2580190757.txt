Pills like crazy unless you apply very gently with a blender. Does not come out of the bottle easily. Really have to pump it. Has the potential to be amazing as the coverage is so soft and beautiful but applying it was so annoying I gave up and returned it. So many other good replacements for this that go on easily and donâ€™t pill. hard to apply
