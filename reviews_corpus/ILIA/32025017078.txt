I got this Ilia Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen W Vitamin C 10% + Niacinamide from pinch me for free in exchange for my honest review. I followed the directions of how to use the product. The texture of the product kinda feels oily.. other than that it’s okay. After applying the product I can see that it leaves a lite tint on my face, nothing too heavy so like a lite shear look. I do like that it has niacinamide and us a spf 40! It felt good on my skin and basically gave me a little sheer coverage.. so I mostly use it when im.in a hurry and on the go. It’s a good product and i.like it so far. Great ILIA product!
