This SPF serum is great for when you only want to even out your skin tone and you want to run errands but not put on a ton of makeup, it looks very natural and it blends super easy. It does have a weird powdery texture when it’s almost absorbed into the skin but it goes away, the scent it’s pretty standard.I use 3 pumps for my entire face and since I’m combo oily I do set it with powder around my t zone but just with the powder leftover on my powder puff, if I don’t do that I’ll be an oily mess in 3 hours, so take that into consideration if your skin is like mine. nan
