I wanted to love ILIA C BEYOND TRIPLE SERUM SPF 40. First time I tried it, I rubbed it in and it was a gritty oil feel on my face. I realized you’re not supposed to rub in so I patted it on like directions said and I liked how it gave me some color to my face. I have an oily t-zone so I don’t need more oil. It settled in my pores right away and enlarged them. The smell is horrible. And it says to apply makeup on top so I applied my powder, it makes your skin soft, but it totally looks cakey. Do not recommend! Too greasy like oil
