I love the idea of a product that combine the best of the worlds - vitamin c serum, foundation, sunscreen. I’m in love. You can use on its own or under everything else as a serum. It’s just a slight tint that will help your complexion looks brighter, not a full face foundation. And the SPF 40 is a great bonus for days you’re on the run and only have time for one product after cleansing and before heading out of the door. Multitasker product
