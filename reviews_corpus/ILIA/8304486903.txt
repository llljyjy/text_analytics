I really wanted to love this product. I love everything Ilia puts out, but this product was terrible. I hated everything about it. First, you have to use a ton of pumps to get it to spread all over the face. It dries very quickly and you have to work fast to then keep applying which then creates pilling and this chunky-like texture. Second, once you’ve gotten it on your face its VERY matte looking which is so not what i expected from a serum. Thirdly, don’t leave it on all day because the breakouts are REAL. I experienced a lot of congestion and clogged pores. Fourthly, the price point. Its such an extreme cost for a product that really isn’t that great.If you like their other True Skin Serum, just stick with that! Hated :(
