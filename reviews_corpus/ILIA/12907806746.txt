What I love about this serum is the face that it acts as a primer for your skin yet it protect and helps give your skin the protection it needs and leave the skin with a glow yet it’s natural and doesn’t leave the white cast that more spf/serum sometimes leaves which is a plus for me as I can spread and added makeup without any issues on my skin! Also I love the smell of this serum!! nan
