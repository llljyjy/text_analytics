The Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 product claims to be a sunscreen serum with tint.  Some of the highlighted ingredients in this serum include Niacinamide, Vitamin C, and SPF.  Niacinamide offers to visibly smooth and refine uneven texture, and Vitamin C is known to provide sun protection, prevent premature aging, and creating an even skin tone.  I received Tone 3.  While there are only 3 shades, I believe that it’s okay if the serum doesn’t match the skin perfectly as this product is so lightweight and provides a light tint.  When looking for a face product, I normally go for products that are lightweight and provides minimal coverage.  I don’t like the feel of foundation, so a skin tint and/or tinted moisturizer is what I go for in the end.  I have normal to dry skin, and I don’t have any acne scars.  To me, the texture of this serum is similar to a sunscreen and skin tint.  It is not thick, but does have a slight watery texture.  This is not an issue for me as I stated that I love skin tints and tinted moisturizer.  Upon first use, the best way to dispense the product out of the container is shake the container, and then, hold the container at a downward angle and press the top.  When I applied this product to my skin, I felt like the coverage was sheer.  I was able to see my skin poking through the serum.  Also, I noticed that this serum had a very slight scent.  The scent wasn’t an issue for me nor was it overbearing.  I was able to get a full day of wear with this product, and I felt like this product was beautiful underneath my powders and other face products.  The finish of this serum left a natural, glowy look to my face. All in all, I really enjoyed this serum, and I would recommend this product to my family and friends.
