I was given a complimentary sample of Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 from PinchMe & Ilia in exchange for my honest opinion of what I thought about the serum. My first thought was what holy grail - everything what I need in one bottle! I love Ilia’s products but unfortunately I’m a little bit disappointed with this serum. Between the weird dispenser and oily product it’s a no for me. I have oily skin and this product leaves my skin even more oily. I tried different ways of applying it into my face but still.. my skin is so shiny.. Little disappointment
