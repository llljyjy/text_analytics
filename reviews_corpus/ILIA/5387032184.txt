I wanted to love this, but it’s not good. Here’s the gist:Pills as soon as you start trying to blend into your skin. Oily feeling. You need a LOT of product to cover your face. It doesn’t provide any coverage at all, not sure why they even bothered tinting it. Turns completely sheer as soon as I touch it. The applicator is really cute but really difficult to use and get a good amount of product out. It’ll be a return, sadly! not what i was hoping for
