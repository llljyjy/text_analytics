I received C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen with Vitamin C 10% + Niacinamide free in exchange for my honest review. Unfortunately, this product was a major let down for my already oily skin. It blended quite nicely but the shine (not the dewy and complimenting kind) was too much to handle. Felt very sticky. Wouldnâ€™t recommend for oily skin. This could work very well on a drier skin than mine. Too oily for my liking
