I love this serum compared to Ilia’s original SPF serum, which smells terrible as you apply it and always left a white cast on my skin. This one absorbs instantly, the color is a good match, and it leaves a dewy, healthy finish - I gently rub it in and then pat down with my finger tips to press it in. The tint gives sheer coverage, but can feel greasy if you use a heavy moisturizer underneath. I use a vitamin c serum, a hyaluronic acid serum and then this and it provides ample moisture for summer days without heaviness or pilling. As for the pump, it’s pretty straight forward - you just have to turn the bottle upside down and pump (I use three). As for longterm, skin care benefits, I can’t tell a change in my skin, but it hasn’t broken me out and it improves my skin when I’m wearing it, so that’s good enough for me. I should say I have normal to dry skin with a bit of rosacea, but I’m not overly sensitive. Much better than Ilia’s original SPF serum
