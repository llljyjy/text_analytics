I received this from Influenster for my honest receive. I have combination skin with discoloration so I was very excited to see if this would work. The serum goes on smoothly. It moisturized the dry areas on my face without leaving it greasy. My skin felt smooth and after two weeks I did notice a bit of a difference in the discoloration on my face. I’m hoping with continued use I’ll see more of a difference. It’s also a great sunscreen without the heavy feel that you get from a lot of sunscreens. Impressive
