I really enjoyed this product. I have oily skin and was worried at first because it feels very greasy. However it absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn’t leave me oily. I can’t really see it on the skin, but it does even out some of the redness. The best thing is it does not break out my acne prone skin and contains sunscreen! The only downside is that it has a very strong fragrance that reminds me of Frankincense. That fades over time Worth a try!
