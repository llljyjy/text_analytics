I received ILIA serum as a free sample courtesy of Sephora and Pinchme. I love that this serum has SPF 40 to protect my skin. It is different from any other serum I have used. You really need to read and follow the application instructions - shaking the product up, tipping the bottle down to dispense and patting the serum onto your skin, not rubbing it in. After doing this, I really like ILIA. Love the SPF
