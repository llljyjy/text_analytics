I received this product free to try and review. I wanted to love this product but my skin was not a fan. I followed the instructions posted on the site to make sure I got the application correctly but the product just sat on my skin no matter how long I let it dry for. It wouldnâ€™t full dry making my foundation break up horribly. I am also not a big fan of the smell. Not for me
