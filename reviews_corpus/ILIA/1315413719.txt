I received a free, full-sized bottle of this and was thrilled to get it. I was prepared to love it but that just didn’t happen. I found it hard to apply without it pilling (even after I followed the directions to the letter) and it left my skin with a strange look and feel. And I saw no results. I’ll keep with it. Maybe it just takes time? So many people seem to love it! Not a Fan
