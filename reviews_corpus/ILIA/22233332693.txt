Really love the idea of having everything in my morning skincare in one step, but I was worried it was going to pill after reading the reviews but went ahead and tried it anyways.. And I love it! I think the trick is that I use a light moisturizer before putting this on and it never pills that way, but it does without it. It also gives a dewy finish, goes great under the trueskin foundation. The coverage is more like a minimal tint, but I use it under makeup anyways. Will repurchase! Use with a moisturizer to avoid pilling
