I think there is a lot of confusion around this product. It’s skincare, not a tint or foundation. It comes in different shades only to take away the mineral sunscreen white cast and make it accessible for all skin tones. But it has ZERO coverage once applied and it’s not supposed to. If you’re looking for  a sunscreen serum this is a great option. It’s hydrating but not sticky and the niacinamide is great for controlling oil. It also works great as a primer for their skin tint. Definitely one of my favorite products for summer. It's not makeup
