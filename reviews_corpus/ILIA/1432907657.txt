Ilia brand make up is quickly moving its way into one of my favorite brands. I love this SPF serum. It applies smooth and evenly and has a tint to it to give you a little bit of color. My face doesn’t feel greasy at all which is important to me. The serum absorbs into your face evenly and you are ready to apply the rest of your wake up. I did not have any trouble with breakthrough blemishes using this product either. I really just can’t say enough good about it. Thank you to PINCHme for allowing me to test this product for my honest review. Ilia serum spf
