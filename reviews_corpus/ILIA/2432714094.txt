I love the idea of a serum with so many good skin care ingredients in it. It is slightly tinted, which I enjoy, and love the SPF. It does tell you NOT to rub this product in, but to pay it in, to avoid pilling. If you rub it in, it does pill horribly. It says wait 60 seconds before applying makeup, but no matter how long I waited, it still pilled under my makeup. This has to be a one and done for me. I would recommend it though. nan
