I wanted to love it, thought it would be great for my busy outdoor summer mornings.  Its so hard to apply without pilling, I found that my face and hands had to be bone dry or it was grit city.  I gave it 2 stars because I can apply it over make up successfully to re-up sunscreen but that’s a limited use for the expense.  Don’t attempt toner or essence or serum underneath and don’t wash with an oil based cleaner prior.  I tried putting it on my face without washing one morning and it pilled, I assume because I applied a face oil the night before.  Ugh, a great idea but its a nope for me. Pills big time
