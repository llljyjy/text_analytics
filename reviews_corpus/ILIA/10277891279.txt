I wanted to love this product as I will be 50 next month and no longer want full coverage foundation- I was hoping this would be the answer to my prayers. Unfortunately it was way to shiny for my liking and had horrible pilling! This is a no go for me! I was sent this product to review for an Influenster campaign. nan
