This didn’t pill like so many others have experienced, but it dries my face out like crazy. I have normal to combo skin for reference. It started out very oily… so oily it was uncomfortable but I wanted to truly test it out so I didn’t layer loads of powder on top. It felt heavy on my face for a few hours and then it started to dry out so much that my skin was uncomfortably tight. I loved the concept of this product, but it was honestly terrible. The pump was ridiculous as well. You get the smallest drop off product with each pump and you need several pumps to get the proper amount of SPF coverage. Sorry, Ilia. I love almost everything else the brand has come out with but this is just awful. Returned it. nan
