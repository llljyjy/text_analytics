Truly amazed at this product. it looks so plain but whats inside , BABY! i use it as a primer and to add a pop of color to my foundation . adds the most velvety and dewy warmth without actually greasing up my face . just thrilled . will definitely buy. the price is up there but the ingredients and how long it lasts make it worth it. wow this is skin care. Holy Grail Serum with top ingredients WOW!
