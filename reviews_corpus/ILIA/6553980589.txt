If you’re looking for something with good skin benefits and SPF this is great!! It’s not at all something that will cover imperfections but for a base or a “no make up” look it’s really nice! I find it works best with a damp beauty blender rather than fingers or a brush! It pilled a bit when I used my fingers personally. good skincare and sun protection!
