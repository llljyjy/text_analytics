I bought this for myself and one for my Mom because of TikTok reviews making it look so good!  I thought for sure i would LOVE this. And even the price I thought was super steep but was willing to splurge. Let me say this is AWFUL. It is just so greasy, like grease sitting on your face (And I like to look dewy and hydrated) and it pills so badly anything sitting under it. Impossible to spread evenly and just feels like grease sitting on your skin. I’m going to keep it to use on my chest area but that’s it. Would not recommend, to my worst enemy! So bad I had to leave a review
