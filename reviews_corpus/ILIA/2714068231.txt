I received a free sample of the ILIA C BEYOND TRIPLE SERUM SPF 40 in exchange for my honest review. At first it didn’t not work well for me since I rubbed in the product and experienced some pilling. But then realized you should be patting in the product to avoid pilling. It does feel a bit oily on the skin but it gives a very nice glow and tint which is perfect for no makeup days. I like that this includes spf, niacinamide, and vitamin C. A lot of bang for your buck. Although I do not like the scent, it kind of has a hint of cinnamon scent and I’m not sure what else. It lingers for some time but eventually goes away. Overall, a decent product that I would continue using but I’m not sure that I would repurchase. So so
