Wanted to love this product so bad because of all the great ingredients and ease of applying just one product in the summer. Unfortunately, no matter how long I shook the bottle beforehand, and the different combinations of applying this before/after moisturized or prepped skin, I couldn’t stop it from pilling on my skin. It also felt very grainy while applying it. It looked nice on some areas of my skin where it didn’t pill but ended up returning it because it didn’t work for me Wanted to love but just couldn’t do it
