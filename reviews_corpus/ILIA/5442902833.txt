I love that ilia is a clean brand. This has light coverage, so it works to slightly even out my skin tone. I can have dry skin at times, so it helps with giving me a dewy look, but if you have oily skin this may make you feel greasy. It’s great for my everyday routine, especially with the added spf protection. The only downside is the smell can be off-putting, but it’s better than having a strong perfume smell. nan
