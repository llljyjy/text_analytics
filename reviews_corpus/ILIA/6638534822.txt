I’ve been using Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen with Vitamin C for the past month. I have mixed feelings about this product.  I found that the serum was way too watery, which made it hard to use. The serum blends well, but dries sticky. I have pets so sticky face products are a no no. I didn’t feel that the serum moisturized well. I had to use a separate moisturizer under this. Not much of a moisturizer
