I was given a complimentary sample of Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 from PinchMe & Ilia in exchange for my honest opinion of what I thought about the serum. I used this exactly as directed to get the best results. I blended this with my usual foundation, applying this first. It glided on just like silk. I was surprised how thin it was though so I dabbed a little at a time using just my fingertips then in certain trouble spots I lightly blotted with a sponge in a circular motion. All I noticed, before my foundation was that it made my fine lines alot more prominent and noticeable and it was worse after my light foundation. It ended up with that caked look and made my darker spots not hidden but darker. Needless to say I’m not a big fan and I did try several different ways to apply and still got the same results and I didn’ t like them. . Smooth and Silky
