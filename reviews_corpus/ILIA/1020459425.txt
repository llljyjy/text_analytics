I received this product free from PinchMe and was super excited to try it.  Unfortunately, the product did not perform as I hoped it would.  The consistency of the formula was so thin and watery - even after shaking the bottle for better than 30 seconds as directed.  With the product being so watery I never imagined it would feel so oily on my face.  The color was excellent for my skin tone but I couldn’t use it more than a few days because it made my skin feel so yucky.  This may be a great product for those with dry skin but it won’t do for my combination skin.  I appreciate the opportunity to try the product prior to purchasing. Not for me.
