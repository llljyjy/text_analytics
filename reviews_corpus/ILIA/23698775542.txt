After reading the reviews, I began to realize that the rating would be higher if the directions were followed more closely. It states on the directions that this serum must be shaken vigorously before each use. I received Tone 1, which is perfect for my fair to medium skin tone. This product works best on a freshly washed face. When applying, pat it on gently, do not rub into skin because this can cause pilling. I love the shimmering glow this product leaves on my face. Containing Vitamin C, Niacinamide, and an SPF 40, everything your skin needs for it to look and feel healthy and glowing. My face looks better and better after each use. I absolutely love this serum! Beautiful glowing skin!
