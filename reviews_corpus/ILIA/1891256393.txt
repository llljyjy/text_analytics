I’ve had this product for a little over a month and I am unfortunately not a fan. It was surprising given how much I love Ilia’s other complexion products. But no matter what I do — how much I shake this up or how I prep my skin or start with bare skin — it pills up! There’s really nothing I hate more! So definitely do not recommend this product for combination-oily skin types like min. Such a bummer because this really could have been an all-in-one sunscreen serum! Won’t stop PILLING!
