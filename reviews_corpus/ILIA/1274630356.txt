This was ok for me. It’s lightweight and goes on pretty smooth. I didn’t have any issues with pilling. The color match was close but a little orange for me. Especially with the amount needed to provide protection. The initial finish semi-matte, but it got somewhat oily. Can’t say I noticed any of the skin benefits. I also had issue with the dispenser cap-it was always almost coming off when I removed the top. Lastly, it’s got a somewhat odd scent, but I kinda like it. nan
