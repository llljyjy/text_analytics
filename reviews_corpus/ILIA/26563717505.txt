Tinted serum with SPF - yes please. I actually love this product. It’s a bunch of products in one for me - serum, moisturizer, SPF and foundation. I love products that are multitaskers.It’s light with the texture of serum and looks like a very liquid foundation. It absorbs well and matches my tan complexion perfectly. It leaves my skin hydrated and glowing without any greasiness. It gives me a natural look. I like I can use it alone but it does layer well with my Ilia foundation and I can still see the glow on top of my foundation.I am happy with this product and I love the Ilia brand. I have tried a few of there products and there wasn’t a bad one at all for me. tinted serum with spf
