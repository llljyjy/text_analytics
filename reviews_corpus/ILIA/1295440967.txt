I recently tried this sunscreen and put it to the test on a recent trip, for context the weather was fairly high around 80°-95°F. I wanted to love this but I just like it, I really like the feel of it on my skin when applying it’s a very lightweight formula which gives the impression you’re not applying anything while still giving you a somewhat even tone. Now the reason why I don’t love it is because my face would get really shiny after a few minutes when wearing this, It might work better on cooler months for me as my face tends to be more on the normal side, but during the warmer months I don’t think it’ll work. I just liked it
