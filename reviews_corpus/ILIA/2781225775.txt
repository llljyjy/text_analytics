I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. ILIA C Beyond Triple Serum Broad Spectrum SPF 40 Sunscreen (Tone 3) is one of my favorites.  This serum is very smooth on my skin, and not only does it brighten my skin with Vitamin C, but it also protects my skin from this hot sizzling heat that we have been having. It has a water-free base and is very weightless. The tones are translucent with a sheer glowy finish that blends in with my skin tone.  I did make sure to shake C Beyond for 10-15 seconds before I used it. I dispensed the product onto my fingertips and patted it lightly on my face. If I was going to apply makeup to my face, I waited 60 seconds before I did so. If your skin needs more moisture, you may use an oil-based product before applying C Beyond. I would recommend ILIA C Beyond Triple Serum Broad Spectrum SPF40 Sunscreen. nan
