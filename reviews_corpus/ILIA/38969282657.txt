I love this product. I have normal to dry skin. My skin isn’t sensitive but it can be at time. This product wasn’t drying. It didn’t irritate my skin nor did it cause any redness. I was impressed with the way it plumped My skin and made it look flawless. I would and have recommended this to all my frenz and family. While the amount of product in the container is enough to last a while because the product doesn’t require a lot to cover the face, I think the price is a little steep for normal folks. Loving this
