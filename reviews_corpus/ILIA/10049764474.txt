I Received this product from PINCHme.First of all, I have to say that I hate sunblock. It has always dulled my skin and its oily, so I’ve avoided it my whole life and just used a lot of moisturizing products after I spend time in the sun. But now I have found my perfect product in the Ilia “C Beyond Triple Serum“. It has encapsulated Vitamin C, mineral SPF 40, and Niacinamide in a waterless base for brighter skin instantly and over time. Unlike normal sunblock, it brightens, smooths, and protects my skin, although it still has oils like sunblock does. This is way better than sunblock, though. I highly recommend it.
