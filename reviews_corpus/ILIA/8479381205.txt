Love this! I tried the Rare Beauty Tinted Moisturizer with Sunscreen and it just looked so dry and broke up on my skin. Most foundations/skin tints/ tinted moisturizers donâ€™t work around my chin and nose. I love this though! It actually gave me an even coverages while still letting my real skin and freckles show through. I felt it was on my skin all day long too. Highly Recommend! nan
