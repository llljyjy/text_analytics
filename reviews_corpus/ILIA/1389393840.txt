I received this as a birthday gift from my daughter and was delighted as I love Ilia brand products. I’m 62 and the older I get the less I want to wear makeup. This was magical on my skin. First, I tend to be dry so as skeptical as I was I applied moisturizer before this as it said to. At first I was like oh no!  It’s oily and shiny. And then it dried down to perfection. I had no pilling whatsoever. I put on a hint of Ilia Color Haze and it remained perfect all night long. Love it! Magical!
