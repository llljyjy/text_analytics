I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review and I choose ILia. I wanted to love this product. I love a good skincare/makeup dual product, but this one didn’t dry down, was sticky, and felt heavier than my full coverage foundation. I was hoping to use this as a base since it has skincare benefits, but it just isn’t going to work. I also felt itchy after a few minutes. Wantwd to love it…
