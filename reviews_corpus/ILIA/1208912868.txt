I think this is a wonderful product.The container is user friendly and the color was perfect. The only thing I can say bad about it is itâ€™s definitely not for oily skin but I received it as a free sample. It has no odor and your skin feels great after applying no icky feeling. Love that it has SPF in it also. nan
