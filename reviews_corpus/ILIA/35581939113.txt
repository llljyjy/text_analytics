This is such a great new staple in my summer skin care. Since reaching my mid 20â€™s I always wanted to implement an SPF during the day. I love the slight tint that this gives my skin. I also noticed a clearer face after about a week of use (less redness). I do have sensitive skin and there is a slight burn when first using. Wonderful summer staple
