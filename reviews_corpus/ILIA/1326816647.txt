I received this Ilia Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen With Vitamin C 10% + Niacinamide from PinchMe for free in exchange for my honest review. I followed the directions of how to use the product. It is a bit tricky.  Shake extremely well or it comes out clumpy. The texture of the product is oily, but drying.  Definitely use a cream moisturizer with this product.  The finish is sheer.  It gives the skin a very light.  I do like that it has vitamin C and a high SPF.  Overall, it is a good product. Good SPF Protection
