I received this complimentary from PinchMe for review.I really like this product, especially how it knocks out three skincare steps at once. Plus, it gave my skin a great glow after using itA little goes a long wayVersatile product that combines three skincare essentials in oneHas a lightweight texture that blends easily.The biggest con I have is no matter how I apply it pils under makeup, alone itâ€™s great.
