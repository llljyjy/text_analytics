I’ve been using this product for several weeks, and it’s become a staple in my makeup/skincare routine. I LOVE that it has SPF 40 - I have oily skin, and it’s so helpful for me to be able to have a product that offers some coverage along with sun protection. The main reason that I don’t use it daily is that I don’t always want to use products that provide any sort of cover-up; but whenever I want to even out my skin tone a little, I reach for this. I love the skin care benefits that it comes with, and I’ve been pleased with the way that Ilia’s products match my skin tone. Overall, I’m happy with this product and recommend folks trying it out to see if it works for them, too. Great for days when I want SPF + coverage
