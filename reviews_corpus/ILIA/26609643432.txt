Thankful there is a sun serum that protects my skin and doesn’t leave a white cast. I love that it goes on sheer and you must follow instructions when applying. I wish the instructions were on the bottle so that if you forget, there’s a reminder. There’s a nice moisturizing sheen to the ilia serum and it doesn’t have a funky odor. I love the sheet color for my dark skin. The fact the the serum has vitamin c, niacinamide and allantoin to brightens and protect my skin gives me great confidence. Brightens
