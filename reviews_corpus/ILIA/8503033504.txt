I did not like this formula at all. It’s thin and oily. You have to use a lot to feel like you’re getting the appropriate sunscreen coverage. I have dry skin which this is marketed for and it did not help at all, actually made my skin feel more dry. It pilled with almost every product I used. I am a new mama and don’t have time to use a product that doesn’t play nice with others. When it didn’t pill, it looked fine but definitely not good enough for how expensive this is. I am only finishing it because I don’t like to waste but I would never repurchase or recommend. There’s just too many other good products out there. Maybe people with oily skin would like this (but probably not), if you have dry skin this is a definite no! Not for me (or probably anyone). Save your money!
