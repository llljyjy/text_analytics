I love the brand but I wasn’t a fan of this product.  It takes several pumps to get some product out. The consistency is weird and dries up quick. I don’t feel like it gave me any type of glow or coverage. For the price, I don’t think that it is worth it. There are better products in the market. Not a fan.
