The coverage is nice and light. Unfortunately, that is the only positive. The smell is awful and the texture is dirty and greasy feeling. It burned when applied and made my skin red and irritated so I had to stop using after a week. I really wanted this to work with the light coverage, but itâ€™s a big no. Not For Me
