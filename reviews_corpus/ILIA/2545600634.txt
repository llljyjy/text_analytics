I really enjoy this serum with sunscreen. It is perfect to hide small blemishes when I am going out but don’t want full coverage. You have to shake it and make sure you follow the directions for the product to be dispensed properly. It has a light scent and washes off easily. I didn’t experience any blemishes or irritation from using! Great light coverage option
