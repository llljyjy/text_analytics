I got this product for free from Influenster. I’ve heard great things about this brand, but this product was not great. First, when you dispense it, it looks like it might provide some coverage, maybe a little blurring effect or mute redness, but it just goes on clear. It was easy to incorporate it into my routine, but even after using it for a month, I didn’t see any change in my skin. I also wish that the pump dispersed more/the amount you need to apply. It just gives you drops, and you need at least 4 to feel like you have adequate coverage. Fine, but there are better products available.
