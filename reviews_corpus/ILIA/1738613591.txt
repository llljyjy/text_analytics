This multi-benefit serum makes my skin look perfect on its own, or topped with the Super Serum Skin Tint! One star taken off for the tedious application. Mine did not pill as others have experienced. However, I took the time to apply this appropriately according to the directions and tips from Ilia: shake for 15 seconds; pump directly onto your face--one drop on forehead, chin, and each cheek; gently press it into your skin--do not rush; and let it set for 60 seconds before applying anything on top. It’s a bit of a pain, but I promise the results are worth it! Plus, it has SPF, so what’s not to love?! Amazing, but tedious!
