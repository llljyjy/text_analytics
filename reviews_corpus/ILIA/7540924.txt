I received this item for free to test and review from Influenster.I am pretty pleased with this product. At first the color really concerned me as I have very fair skin and the product out of the tube is rather dark. But I needn’t worry, it disappeared on my skin and made it look radiant. It has the consistency of a tinted serum and smooths on very easily. It then seems to soak into the skin with a powder texture. I couldn’t feel it once I had applied it, no heaviness or oiliness at all. THe scent was very pleasant, sort of a powdered sandalwood? It’s hard to describe, but nice. It really seemed to treat my skin nicely and it feels softer. With the added bonus of the sunblock include? Would definitely recommend! Would definitely recommend!
