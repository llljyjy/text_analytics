I tried to like this product, but no matter what I did, I could not get it to stop pilling. I even tried the extra instructions to not rub in and just pat on, but honestly - I don’t want to have to try that hard and take extra time to get a product to work. I also had trouble making sure I had even coverage when attempting to pat in, and that is super important for sunscreen protection. I have combo skin, and the product remained greasy on my skin and my makeup didn’t go on well. Sadly, just not for me :( Pilling despite following extra instructions
