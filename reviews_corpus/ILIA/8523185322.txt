If you’re charging premium price for an innovative sunscreen please make sure that the formula works.A good SPF is an SPF than you would want to wear almost everyday.

I have tried shaking it like there’s no tomorrow and it still pills. If you’re into looking like a pile of balled up dead skin cells doused with oil this is for you. I had never had a product fill me up with anger and hatred. Pills and poor formulation
