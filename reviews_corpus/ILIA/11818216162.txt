The product has sort of an earthy scent which I don’t mind but might not work for other customers. It’s nice and lightweight with an oil/serum texture, and it’s not really a product for coverage, which I had expected, although it does make it hard to tell if you’ve applied enough product (especially for something as important as SPF). The packaging, while aesthetically pleasing, also makes application a little awkward (the pump only dispenses a little bit of product at a time). No complaints about how it wears throughout the day, though. nan
