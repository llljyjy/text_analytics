It’s perfect for a daily sunscreen with skincare benefits. No strong odor. Lightweight and non greasy. It feels only slightly oily going on but it dries matte. I have naturally dewy skin and it doesn’t increase shine for me. It can pill when applied over some moisturizers. Best to let any other skincare totally absorb before applying this. I find it wears well under makeup though. Also - no white cast but isn’t really tinted (which typically looks orange on me). Basically it’s invisible once it dries. great daily sunscreen + skincare
