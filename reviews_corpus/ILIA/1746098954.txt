I received this for free to leave an honest review. I think this serum works great. I was dreading the application at first because there was specific instructions and bad reviews on the application. It was actually easy to use and apply. I applied it in the same manner as i do my other serums. It left me with a dewy glow after. The tint is hardly there which is good if you’re doing an all natural look. I like that it has such high spf coverage for a serum....i actually haven’t seen a serum with SPF already in it. Make sure to wait a bit for absorption after applying. Super dewy skin
