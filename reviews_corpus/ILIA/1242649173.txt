I am a huge fan of the ilia serum as it’s the only thing that doesn’t break me out.  So I thought this would be a lighter version of that.  It’s not.  It’s greasy and has zero coverage.  But what makes it go from bad to awful is that it stings and itches my skin when I put it on for about 5min.  It’s really just an awful product.  Ilia should remove it from their lineup as it is way overpriced and not on par with the quality of their other products. do not buy
