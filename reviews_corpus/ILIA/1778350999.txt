As someone with combination and acne prone skin, its hard to find a product that works for me. Especially when theres so many greasy sunscreens in the market that clog my pores and slip off my face midday. This sunscreen doesnt do any of that and it leaves me with a nice velvety look and a natural light coverage. It doesnt cover my angry red pimples which is too be expected with the light tint so I usually just add on some extra concealer for those areas. It has vitamin C and niacinamide which Iâ€™ve noticed been helpful in lightening my acne scars and skin discoloration. Overall, I really like this product and I would definitely recommend it! All in one super product!
