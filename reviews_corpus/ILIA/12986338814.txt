I read other comments before trying it so was kind of apprehensive about it pilling. I’ve tried it on top of a heavy moisturizer cause that’s what was recommended  on the official website, and it absorbed beautifully. It was very light, but at the same time if completely hid away some of the redness I had on my cheeks, and some pimple scars on my chin. It looked very natural, but at the same time hid skin imperfections perfectly. I absolutely love the ingredients, especially the vitamin C and niacinimide. These ingredients brighten the skin & fight small pimples and acne. I have a dry skin, and this triple serum mineral sunscreen was perfect for it. One thing though is that it does pill if you put on pore blurring primers underneath, it works very well with spray primers. I would definitely recommend this. I think it just takes a few tries to get the perfect look that works for you. Love it!
