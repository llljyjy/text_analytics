I’m glad to have received Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 from PinchMe. It is a weightless serum that provides higher spf than the regular serum/moisturizers. I regularly wear sunscreen on top of my serum, moisturizer, and before foundation and this formula is basically 2 products in 1 and leaves a less heavy feeling on my face. It is tinted and doesn’t leave a white cast and make sure to PAT, NOT rub, in order to avoid piling when applying foundation after. Also, shake the bottle well for an even application. Leave on for a minute or two for it to settle. It is hydrating and didn’t give me breakouts so far. weighless
