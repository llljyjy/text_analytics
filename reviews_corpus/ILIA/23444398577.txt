I am not a makeup girl so this was more than what i was looking for in a tinted sunscreen serum. It took me quite a while to blend in to my skin and it took more than a few tries to help me stop it from chalking up on my skin. I believe that for a make up pro this would be a good addition for hydration under products. nan
