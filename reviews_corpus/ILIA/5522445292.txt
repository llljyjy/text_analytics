I was pretty excited about this product but sadly it missed the mark. It smells like dog food and the texture is incredibly oily. For reference I have VERY dry skin and this never melted in. Just sat on top in an uncomfortable way. The amount of this product needed for proper SPF is not feasible with the texture. Also my skin had a reaction to this - I ended up returning. Can not recommend.
