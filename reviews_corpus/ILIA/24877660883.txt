Very powerful and not overwhelming! Before trying this product, I was always assuming that I didnâ€™t need sunscreen (spf) of any kind, but due to this new ILIA C Beyond triple serum with Vitamin C (which I love) and Niacinamide, I am now a believer! I was surprised at the outcome which was very smooth, even coverage that lasts. Very Good Product!
