I really love this product. I have been using it for exactly a week now and I am enjoying it. I put it on after toner/essence, cosrx snail serum and eye cream, but before my moisturizer and had not had any issues with pilling or it breaking apart. However, I do need to use at least 6-7 drops to cover my entire face - so I am unsure how long it will last, making me unsure of the price point. Overall it gives me a great glow and helps even out my skin tone. I will note, it can be a little greasy feeling when first applied, but so far every time Iâ€™ve used it, it sinks into the skin within 5-10 minutes! nan
