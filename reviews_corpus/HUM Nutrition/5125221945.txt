I was so happy to find this prenatal! Everything I’ve tried before has made me super nauseated but this one doesn’t bother me at all. This is especially rare for the vitamins that have just one pill. This has 100% or more of most of the nutrients I need, and the additional dha pill doesn’t have a nasty aftertaste either. It has been tough to find a vitamin that has more than 50 percent of the recommended amount. I had been taking one with half the amount recommended before this one, and I felt really fatigued and lethargic. Once I switched to this, I got some energy back, which just goes to show how important your prenatal is to your baby and yourself. Highly recommend this to all pregnant mamas (and post natal too!) Doesn’t make you queasy but has all the nutrients!
