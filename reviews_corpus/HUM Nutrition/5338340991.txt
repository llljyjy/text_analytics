I’ve been using these vitamins for just about a month now and while I haven’t noticed any differences in anything, I do have some sort of piece of mind knowing that I’m providing my body with ingredients to keep my vagina healthy. Although you don’t have to take it with food, I incorporated it into my morning routine with breakfast so it was easier to remember to take it. There’s no taste to it and it’s not a big capsule so pretty easy to swallow. Great ingredients
