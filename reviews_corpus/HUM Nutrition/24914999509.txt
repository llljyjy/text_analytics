These vitamins are a nice prenatal option if you are vegan, as many vitamins are not vegan due to the gelatin used to make them. They have all the essential vitamins needed when pregnant and breastfeeding to help babies grow. The only thing I do not like is the taste, but this is due to them being a vegan product. nan
