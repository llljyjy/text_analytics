As a newly pregnant mom of 3 I was excited to try out these vitamins! I have used other brands in the past and really wanted a vitamin with DHA and liked that this had a combo pack. I think these vitamins are easy to swallow and provide all the necessary ingredients for a healthy pregnancy! The smell of the powder capsule is a bit overwhelming to a nauseas pregnant woman but you get used to it. nan
