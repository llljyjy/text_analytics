This Flatter Me supplement works wonders for me, especially when I travel! Like most people, my digestion doesn’t work as well when I am away from home and my routine. Recently I went to Vegas for a week and took this supplement twice a day, and I could feel a real difference. I was eating so many heavy, indulgent meals and it truly helped my stomach to not become so bloated, which is typically the case for me. I also use this at home before lunch and dinner, and even though I’m eating lots of fiber and veggies, there’s much less bloating! This is incredibly helpful if you deal with a distended tummy after every meal. A Happier Tummy
