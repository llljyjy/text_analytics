I’ve got this digestive enzyme supplement by HUM Nutrition and I’ve only been taking these for a couple of days now. I’m glad this doesn’t have any nasty after taste and doesn’t have any side effects. This definitely does help in improving the digestion and helps reduce bloating. I’m going to continue to to use it. Good digestive supplement
