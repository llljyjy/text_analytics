Been on and off this supplement for years now. First time was 3-4 years ago, when I had cystic acne, completely cleared it up. Ever since I’ve incorporated most of the herbs and minerals in the blend in my diet, so I take one pill a day alongside a healthy diet and magnesium, vitd, collagen supplements. I do think this particular antixiodant blend is special and now a cycle it for anti aging benefits and to quickly heal hyperpigmentation. I haven’t broken out or gotten terribly sick in years.Would like to try Artic Repair for winter / dry season. nan
