While these gummies definitely helped me to deal with some of the scary stuff I’m seeing on the news lately, they taste so gross that I could not keep taking them regularly. They taste a bit like an old jelly bean mixed with licorice. It just isn’t a pleasant taste and I will not repurchase. There are other gummies on the market that taste much more flattering than what this tastes like and I don’t need something this I’ll tasting in my system before bed. It calms me down before bed, but at what price? Helpful but not tasty
