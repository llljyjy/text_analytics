It is important to know going into using a product like this canâ€™t be a miracle worker while also being healthy and safe. That said, I saw a subtle yet noticeable difference in my digestion and bloating after a meal. I may or may not repurchase because I think bad digestion typically calls for diet changes and not supplements (in most cases anyway), but if I were to take a supplement long-term, it would be this one. Nice to Have
