Okay so here are my thoughts on the HUM the Womb Service Prenatal Multi-DHA. I’m about 9 weeks into my pregnancy and was taking a prenatal vitamin that had a strong fishy odor that when taken, I could hardly stomach. I needed a switch. And love that with this product, it’s vegan, odor and taste free and packed with nutrients perfect for optimal baby development. I love & definitely recommend it, particularly if you’re sensitive to smells!!! GREAT product!!
