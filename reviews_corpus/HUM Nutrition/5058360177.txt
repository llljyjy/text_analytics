I primarily started taking this to help stabilize my mood. I don’t suffer from many hot flashes, and even when i do, they are mild - but my mood swings are horrendous. I work with patients all day, so I can’t get snippy with them and needed something to helm a bit.It’s been a month since I started taking HUM Nutrition Fan Club and I didn’t notice much of a difference, but friends and family (who didn’t know I started taking anything) have all commented that I seem to be in a better mood as of late. I did order another bottle to continue on with them, but so far if others are noticing it - then I’m assuming they are working. The few hot flashes I did get seem to have vanished as well and I haven’t had one in a couple of weeks. Helps Mood and Hot Flashes
