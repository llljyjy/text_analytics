I struggle with bloating after eating carbs which I am not going to give up so I was looking for a supplement to help with that. I like that this is a probiotic enzyme blend in addition to an herbal blend. I usually drink either peppermint or ginger to help with bloating after a meal so I like that both of those ingredients are in here as well and I feel like this supplement really works. Love for after pasta ❤️
