I started taking these because I experience acne on a nearly daily basis as a 30yo woman. I was hoping to see some improvement and after taking these for a week, I feel like I have! I thankfully didn’t notice any purging at all and have felt like this has been the perfect detox for my skin. The pills themselves aren’t scented or flavored, but are somewhat large so keep that in mind if that is something difficult for you. I can’t wait to see further results once I get to the end of the bottle. I’ve noticed this has also helped my bloating issues as a plus! nan
