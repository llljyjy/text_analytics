I finally tried HUM after seeing it across social media for months! I love that the tablets could be used on the go to get that extra boost of collagen and the benefits. I was a little disappointed in how long it took the tablet to dissolve (even with a couple of stirs). The flavor was decent, although I would probably prefer to add this tablet to an iced green tea for better flavor. I will probably stick to my powdered flavorless collagen for now, however, will keep these on hand when I am on the go to add to an iced tea. Decent On-The-Go Collagen
