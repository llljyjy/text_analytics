Iâ€™m throughly surprised at how quickly these effected me in such a short amount of time. As someone with a sensitive stomach, and who frequently gets stomach aches, vitamins  can sometimes really mess with me. Not only did these not bother my belly, but they very quickly helped balance me out down there after a round of antibiotics knocked me off course. Great to have in your arsenal
