After using this product for 2 months, it nearly completely healed my acne. This product was the only thing I did differently in my routine. My oil production stayed about the same. The redness, texture, and acne significantly improved. However, for me, this product caused fairly severe constipation. I stopped using the product and bowel movements returned to normal but the acne also started coming back. All in all, the product does treat acne with incredible results but may produce some unwanted side effects. I would neither recommend nor not recommend this product. Helps acne
