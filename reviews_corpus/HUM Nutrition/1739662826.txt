I’ve struggled with HG (extreme morning sickness) my entire pregnancy. It took me months of trial and error with different brands to find a prenatal vitamin that I could both stomach AND keep down, that also met certain clean and healthy product criteria.  A few key things that make this an obvious choice for me personally are that it is a vegan supplement with no silicones or parabens. I additionally have celiac, meaning I cannot ingest any gluten, and it is surprisingly difficult to find supplements that are gluten free like HUM’s. Lastly, I really appreciate that Vitamin C is included in this supplement and that I do not need to take something additionally. Overall I am genuinely impressed by the quality of these prenatals, and switching to a cleaner supplement has genuinely improved how I feel over all. I have been taking them for two weeks now and have noticed several changes. My nails have never grown this fast or strong ever in my life, even during my last pregnancy. Definitely will be recommending this prenatal to several friends who are also expecting. I also will be trying their other supplements! Best prenatal on the market!
