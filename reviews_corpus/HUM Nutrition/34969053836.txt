I’ve been using these for 10 days & they do seem to be helping with digestion. I regularly struggle with acid reflux/heartburn and that seems lessened. I also feel less bloating when I eat things like raw veggies & fruits that always cause extra air in my stomach. It’s tricky to remember to take them before I eat, so I set a reminder on my phone & that helps. My only complaint is that they make my urine smell sort of strong, but it’s not a dealbreaker. I like these significantly better than any other prebiotic/probiotic/digestion aids I’ve tried. I’ll have to use them longer to see if they help with longterm things like seeing a flatter belly. They reduce bloating after lots of fiber!
