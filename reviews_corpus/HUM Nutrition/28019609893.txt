I’m in my early 40s and have been noticing what I think are  perimenopause symptoms. Better to face up to reality than to be in denial, I decided to try these supplements. Not sure if it could be psychological, but I have already noticed at 14 days, some relief in my symptoms. Plus, it’s only 1 capsule and it’s easy to swallow, my only con is it has to be kept in the fridge once opened so not so convenient for travel. nan
