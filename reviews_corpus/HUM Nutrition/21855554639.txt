This is my first time ever trying HUM Nutrition supplements. I wanted to give it about a month before I reviewed it. I purchased Collagen Love, Turn Back Time, and Mighty Night. I figured, go big or go home! LOL To be honest, I’m not sure which of these is working, or if they’re all working in synergy, but I am very pleased with the results so far!! I am over 40 years old and, thankfully, I look relatively young for my age. However, I do struggle with hyperpigmentation, sun spots, dull-looking skin, wrinkles around the eyes, and occasional breakouts. I was hoping one, some, or all of these products would maybe help brighten, tighten, and soften my skin. I wasn’t expecting a miracle at all - but I do believe these supplements ARE helping to brighten, tighten, and soften my skin. (It’s not helping with the occasional breakouts, but I didn’t expect them to.) I take 3 capsules of Collagen Love every day, as well as 2 capsules of Turn Back Time. Then, right before bed, I take 2 capsules of Mighty Night. My skin truly does feel softer and it does look brighter; it looks refreshed when I awake. It hasn’t reduced the hyperpigmentation or sun spots - but, overall, my skin looks like it has a brighter glow to it. I’m also very impressed that the Collagen Love did NOT break my out because I’ve heard that collagen can cause breakouts for people who have been / are acne-prone. I’m definitely going to continue taking these and I would recommend to folks who are looking for some anti-aging supplements that will not break them out. I love it
