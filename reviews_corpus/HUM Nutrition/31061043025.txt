These prenatals contain an impressive list of vitsmins and micronutrients including choline and DHAs. I’m glad they aren’t very big - so I have no issues swallowing them. I also love the fact these vitamins are completely vegan - so they don’t have that nasty fishy odor. Great quality product overall! Great vitamins!
