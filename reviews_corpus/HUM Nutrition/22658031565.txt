I loved using these vitamins, and II really enjoyed the taste. I think it’s a bit too soon to know how much they’ve helped, but they taste fine, and they’re easy to remember, plus the packaging is cute enough that I like to keep it out to remind myself to take it. I’ll update my review once I know more! Great Option For Vegans and Vegetarians!
