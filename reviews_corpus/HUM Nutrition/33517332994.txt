I love HUM vitamins. When I choose the vitamins I take, I always check the % of daily value of every vitamin there and if it’s 100% (or sometimes more, over 200% for B12) it means they are good and cover your body’s and your baby’s needs. The DHA is great too, with no fishy smell. I notice the difference while taking the vitamins, I have noticeably more energy and don’t get tired too quickly. Has all I need
