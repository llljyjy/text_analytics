I love collagen supplements for my hair and skin and to help with getting a little extra protein in my diet. Sometimes though, I don’t have the time or the luggage space to bring large powders that require mixing with water. These supplements from Hum contain not only collagen but also vitamin C and other ingredients like polyphenols to help add some antioxidants to my diet. These are powder filled capsules that have zero flavor and were easy to take with water. I wish the nutrition facts included the actual protein per capsule though because it is harder to gauge how much collagen I get in the capsules compared to powder supplements. It is recommended to take 3 capsules per day to see an added benefit. With most collagen I noticed changes in my nails and hair but with this one I notice it more in my skin with a little extra glow compared to when I don’t take it. It can be harder for me to take all 3 capsules though and I tend to take just one or 2 since it can be a lot of water needed to wash all 3 down. nan
