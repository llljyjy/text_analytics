I’ve been using the HUM Nutrition Private Party Probiotics for the last several weeks.. and can honestly say I’ve noticed an improvement in my ph levels. It also seemed as though my menstrual cycle wasn’t quite as painful as it usually is oddly enough, though it must be somehow related to me taking these vitamins. Who doesn’t wanna keep things more balanced and fresh down in their lady region?! Looking forward to continuing to use these, and would absolutely recommend giving them a try. Great for keeping your lady region healthy!
