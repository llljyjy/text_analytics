These gummies are honestly incredible! First of all, they taste so good. They don’t have a weird aftertaste and actually taste like tangerines. I have only been using these for a few weeks but I really do think it helps with hydration in the skin. During the winter months my skin gets so dry so these have been super helpful. Overall, I’m impressed! They taste incredible!
