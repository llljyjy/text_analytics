I wanted to try these because I think it’s important to work on the inside of our bodies rather than buying cleansers or washes. I think probiotics and cranberry are an excellent way to do this without having to actually drink them having it in a supplement is very convenient! My stomach hasn’t hurt or been nauseous while taking these either. Convenient
