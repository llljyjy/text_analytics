This supplement pair is relatively good compared to others. It does have folic acid which is most important, but there is some choline in it which isn’t in most. I take a separate choline supplement anyway since there isn’t much in this one. The pill shape is a bit hard for me to swallow for some reason, but I think that’s just me and should be fine for most. I like that the DHA supplement doesn’t have a fishy aftertaste. Good supplement
