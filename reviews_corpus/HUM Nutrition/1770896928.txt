I’ve been using the Collagen Love supplements for the last 4 weeks. Over that time, I’ve noticed my skin feels more hydrated than it usually does in the winter months. I’ve also been going through a life change that would normally cause me to break out from stress, however during this time my skin has been less angry than normal and I’m experiencing less breakouts. The only thing I can contribute to this change is the Collagen Love supplements, so I am very happy with this product. I’m excited to see how further usage will change my skin! Happier & Hydrated Skin
