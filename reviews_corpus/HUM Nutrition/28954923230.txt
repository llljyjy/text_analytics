First off I’m blown away how clean these ingredients are as a mother of two there is no better feeling than knowing my taking product that are generally good for me and will benefit my children weather to be through my pregnancies or just through Breast milk! It also is vegan! Best part ladies is that there is no nasty after taste I’m was so happy trying it the first week and not feeling sick or dreading take them! The amount of product you get is very good for the retail price! I couldn’t recommend enough! Best out there ladies !
