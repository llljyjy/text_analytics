These collagen pop were yummy! You put the tablet into water and wait for it to dissolve. I did find mine took a little while to dissolve, maybe because I use cold fridge water. They taste super yummy that raspberry. I really wanted to try collagen supplements to help prevent aging (I’m 29) and I’m glad I tried these! nan
