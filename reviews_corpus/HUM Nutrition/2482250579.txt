I enjoy most of the Hum supplements I’ve tried and I was excited to try this one! Skin Squad is considered a probiotic which helps balance the gut. I have digestive issues and would love to try anything that can cause me to have less bloating and less stomachaches. It’s also a plus that it claims to clear the skin. Like all supplements, it can be difficult to remember taking them. Unfortunately I don’t see many changes in regards to breakouts but I do notice that I have less frequent stomachaches! nan
