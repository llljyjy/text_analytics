Favorite thing about these are that they aren’t sticky and don’t get stuck in my teeth. Other gummies are too chewy. Have had them for about a week now and skin feels more hydrated - with no other changes in skin routine. It’s the depth of winter right now, so that’s a big deal.  I find I have to stop myself from eating the whole tub, because I really love the flavor. Yummy gummy
