I am giving this product five stars.  I haven’t used it long enough to test it’s efficacy, but HUM usually has effective products so I’m not worried that it will be a dud.This is the only omega pill I have tried that does not have a fishy scent, nor does it make me burp.  It may have given me a little bit of stomach upset, but I started off by taking two pills per day.  One per day to start may be better. No Fishy Odor or Taste!
