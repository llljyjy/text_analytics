As a person who works from home, it can be difficult to unwind and get ready for bed at the end of the workday. I normally take melatonin to fall asleep and stay asleep longer. I decided to try this because The first time I grabbed a HUM nutrition product, it was a miracle for me and I was hoping that this melatonin would be the same.I guess it was my mistake by not realizing that this was a sleep supplement WITH melatonin, meaning that melatonin is not the main supplement in these little pills. There’s only 3 mg of melatonin in each. The serving size suggests one pill, however, if I even want to feel tired I have to take three and it puts me in a very very light sleep where I can still hear everything going on around me and if I wake up in the middle the night, I cannot go back to bed. Lastly, I’m not fond of the unnecessary plastic packaging, this bottle can be cut in half and made into two separate bottles! I’m giving this three stars because it may work for others, but as someone who often takes melatonin to get to bed at night and stay asleep… It’s a no from me. I would not buy this again.
