I have been taking the Hum Nutrition Skin Squad Pre+ Probiotic Supplement for Acne Prone Skin for about a month. I have had an increase in acne, on my chin in particular, in recent months so I figured this would be a good product to try and have the bonus of gut health support! These don’t have an odd taste and are on the smaller side so that is good. My skin looks a little clearer lately so I don’t think it’s a sheer coincidence! nan
