This is a thoughtful release, and I greatly appreciate that Hum consults the appropriate experts for their supplements (OBGYNs in this case)This includes both a vegan DHA and a multivitamin that supports pre and post pregnancy needs, with a focus on folate.I had some concerns not about the formulation but the size and taste of these. However, I am happy to report that these are not too large. It’s actually quite easy to swallow these with none of the dreadful “sticking” feeling you get with some vitamins. Additionally, the DHA is not only a good size, but truly does not leave any odd aftertaste nor the unpleasant burps!Overall, this is a great option for a pre/post-natal supplement nan
