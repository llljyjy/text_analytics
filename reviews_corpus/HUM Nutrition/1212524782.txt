I love when you can pick up necessities while shopping for beauty. I enjoy that these have the nutrients I need without being too large of a pill. I also love the packaging because it screams out to me to remember to take them daily. It gives me what I need to help nourish a continued healthy pregnancy with the 23 ingredients. It also doesnâ€™t make me feel nauseous like some other pre natals out there. nan
