Wow! I am so excited for these Glow Sweet Glow Gummies! I have been taking them for days now and I have to say that my skin is looking great! I tend to have dark circles under my eyes and not the most vibrant skin tone. Since I’ve been taking these my skin does have a brighter look. I will continue to take them and see if the difference is really there and stands out even more. From the first glance, the gummies are really cute because they’re in the shape of a heart. I also think that they taste quite delicious for a gummy. Overall, I will continue to use them and keep track of my results. Working on my Glow!
