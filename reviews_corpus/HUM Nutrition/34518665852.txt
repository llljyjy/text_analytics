I’ve been wanting to add a collagen supplement to my regimen, and this seemed like a great option. I take one with breakfast, lunch and dinner. After just one month, I am seeing less breakage in my hair, less breakage in my nails, and a bit more elasticity in my skin (seems less dry and maybe a few wrinkles have diminished)?? Can’t wait to see more next month! Working so far!
