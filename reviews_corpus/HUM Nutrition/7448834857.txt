I love Hum products so I was glad when they came out with a prenatal vitamin. My last pregnancy I had such a hard time finding a prenatal that worked. I can feel a difference in terms of taste/nausea with these this time around so I’m excited about that. However, I do highly suggest taking with food as my stomach couldn’t handle taking them solo. They also don’t smell great but most vitamins don’t. Hoping the long term use will be what me and baby need but very happy to try these out. Nice formula!
