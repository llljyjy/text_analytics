I LOVE THE PACKAGING OF THIS PRODUCT, BUT I DO NOT ENJOY THE SMELL/TASTE THAT THE CAPSULES HAVE. I ALSO WISH THERE WAS CALCIUM INCLUDED IN THE CAPSULE AS THAT IS AN ESSENTIAL MINERAL FOR WOMEN/PEOPLE WHO HAVE UTERI. I TOOK THIS THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND MY STOMACH FELT TERRIBLE AFTER. THIS PRENATAL SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH FOOD AND SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED ON THE PRODUCT IN MY PROFESSIONAL (PHARMACIST) OPINION. TAKE WITH FOOD!
