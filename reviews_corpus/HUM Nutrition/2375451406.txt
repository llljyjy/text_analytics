The gummy is denser than other gummy vitamins and has a citrus flavor to it. It smells a little almost plastic like but it’s not overbearing. 2 gummies add up to 30 calories and has 2 g of sugar. There’s vitamin c, e and hyaluronic acid. I didn’t know that hyaluronic acid was edible but I do use it in a lot of my skincare products for it’s healing properties. I’ll need to continue taking this to monitor the results! Good source of vitamins
