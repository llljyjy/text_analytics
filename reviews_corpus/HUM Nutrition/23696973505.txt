Finally!! I don’t have to take separate choline and dha supplements with my prenatals! These are super easy to swallow, and the best part is there’s no fish aftertaste like there is with other dha vitamins. I’m using these everyday until baby comes, and will probably keep taking them afterwards as well! nan
