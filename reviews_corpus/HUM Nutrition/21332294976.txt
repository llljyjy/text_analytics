I have always known that in order to become pregnant, high-quality prenatal support is crucial to the success of the pregnancy, and I never doubted that! I am very pleased with the quality of OBGYN-formulated prenatal support as well as the fact that it does not smell or taste overpowering at all.My favorite thing about it is that it contains all the probiotics my body needs in order to prepare to give birth. THE BEST!
