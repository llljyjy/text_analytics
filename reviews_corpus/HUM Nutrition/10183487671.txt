The supplements of this brand are very good.I tended to have urinary infections very often and since I have taken these supplements, I have not had them again! They have a herbal smell but they do not leave a bad taste in the mouth after taking it even without food in In my case. I love them although I would also love them to come in a presentation of gummies! Love the Ingredients!
