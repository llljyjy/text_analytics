I didn’t realize how good it was until I ran out. I didn’t have to think about PMS or my period for the few months I was on this. Usually the week before my period I eat enough for 3 growing teen boys and cry at the slightest thin. The week to 10 days of my period, I usually have several days of spotting followed by a 3 to 4 days of heavy bleeding, and then a few more days of spotting. But while I was taking this supplement, I didn’t even think of PMS or my period. it was amazing! My appetite ticked up slightly but nothing super noticeable and I didn’t notice increased emotions at all. I also didn’t have to take any pain meds for cramps!This past month, after bot being on it for about a month, I ate lime a horse, was on the verge of tears for a week, I bled through at night, and had to take Tylenol and Motrin like they were going out of style. I am back on here to order more. I am so happy to have found something that helps! I don't have to think about my period anymore!
