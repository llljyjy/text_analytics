I switched to HUM prenatals a week ago and like these much more than my previous brand. These come in two separate bottles: one with a multivitamin complex (including choline) in capsules and the other one with DHA softgels. Both pills are pretty big (like 2 cm long) but I believe it’s a usual size for prenatals (at least my previous version was the same). What is different is the source of nutrients. HUM prenatals have non-GMO vegan formula and no artificial colors - only the good stuff! One more major pro - they don’t have that fishy odor most DHA have. These smell somewhat like turmeric for me and I like this scent. I’m also glad both bottles come sealed so I can be sure they were stored properly. I wish however both also had child proof lids (not only the multi one). Overall I’m happy with HUM prenatals and definitely prefer these over the other brand’s I took. Great formulation!
