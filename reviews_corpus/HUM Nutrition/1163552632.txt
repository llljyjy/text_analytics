I hit menopause last year and there have definitely been some changes that I have observed. Like feeling fatigued quite often and feeling a lack of energy. I was quite excited to see that Hum Nutrition came up with a menopause relief supplement. Itâ€™s a one a day supplement and so far, I have noticed more energy to get things done, which I truly appreciate. When you feel tired often, it means a lot to finally be able to get things done like before! This helped give me more energy to get things done
