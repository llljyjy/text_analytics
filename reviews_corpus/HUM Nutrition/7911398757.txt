I was gifted the Hum Collagen Love Supplements and I gotta say I really love them! I noticed results after two weeks, and they really have made my skin feel a lot smoother, look a lot brighter, and fade some of my acne scars. Three tablets is kind of a lot to take every day, but it’s worth it for the results! I also love that it is natural with no additives. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who’s looking for a healthier easy way to prevent signs of aging! Great Product!!
