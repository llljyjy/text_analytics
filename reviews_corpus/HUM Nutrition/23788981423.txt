I wanted to add some collagen in my skin care routine and this looks like a good start , I am in my thirties, and it is a good age to start caring, although its too early to say , Seems like its working and my skin looks healthy, It did not give any side effects or bloating after using it for 2 weeks , I am using this 3 times a day with meal! healthy skin
