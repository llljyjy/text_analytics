Every women of reproductive age shoukd take a prenatal vitamin regardless of their plans to conveive. I feel really comfortable taking these as they are formulated by OBGYN so i know all the essential vitamins are included. Love that its all in one as supplementing with various different ones is a hassle. Taste is good and I donâ€™t feel like gagging while taking these unlike with other prenatal vitamins. Decent taste and includes all necessary vitamins
