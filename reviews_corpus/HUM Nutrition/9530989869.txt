I struggle with hormonal acne and wanted to see if using these supplements might help balance the skin texture changes and acne I get around my period. I did notice that my skin felt smooth and I didnâ€™t get any bumps along my jawline or lips (where they usually pop up) while using this month!! Great for Hormonal Acne Too!
