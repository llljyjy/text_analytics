Recently I came back from a trip to Canada and got cold while I was there. My ears started bothering me too. After taking antibiotics prescribed by my doctor, I started noticing some itchiness and discharge down there. I am so glad I started taking these probiotics for urinary tract health and vaginal support, itchiness is gone in just a few days nan
