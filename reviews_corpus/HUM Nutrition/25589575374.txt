I’ve tried a lot of different brands of prebiotics and I must say this product didn’t disappoint. The main advantage of HUM prebiotic is that it does act quickly. I’ve noticed my bloating problem going away after 5 days (the last product of other brand I tried only worked after a month or so).I started noticing changes in my skin after around after 2 weeks. I’ve had some breakouts on my cheeks, which didn’t go away for months and now they look a lot better. I’m going on the 3rd week of taking these prebiotics and I hope the results will get even better! Highly recommend! They’re quite pricey, but totally worth it! nan
