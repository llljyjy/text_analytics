I’m so glad I got to try these supplements. Ive been stressed recently so my tummy has been a wreck recently (bloating, gas, reflux, indigestion etc) and these seem to be helping a bit. I take meds for the aforementioned digestive issues way less and I am in general more comfortable and have less of that ’heavy’ feeling. nan
