this collagen is a MUST. i love the strawberry and lemon flavor and it actually tastes good. a lot of collagen has a weird after taste and this was not the case. it was such a good change up in my routine and its so effortless too. all i did was place the tablet in water while i was making breakfast and it was ready to go. highly recommend!! we love a good collagen
