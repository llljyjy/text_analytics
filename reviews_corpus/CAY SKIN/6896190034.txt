I don’t usually use chemical sunscreens. This chemical sunscreen applies easily like a serum. It feels very light , cooling and soothing. I love how it layers under makeup giving me a glow. The pump is very convenient. I can’t believe it is a sunscreen. No white cast at all. This product was gifted by Cay Skin. Glowy protected skin
