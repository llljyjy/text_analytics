If i could have given this 0 stars I would have.. I got the 100 pts rewards trial size and absolutely loved it! It gave the perfect glow and felt amazing. To my horror, when I bought full size it was a completely different experience. The product is AWFULLY separated and when you pump it out instead of finding a smooth lotion, you get a pool of oil in your hands.. Honestly, this product needs serious reformulation. I highly doubt that a product with such a uniformity issue is actually delivering the SPF 45 it’s claiming on the label. I received the product with lot code 1349. It just sucks because I wanted to love this product so badly but sadly it did not deliver.. Don’t waste your money!
