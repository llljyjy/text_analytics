I liked this a lot but had to return. Beautiful finish, great moisturizing feeling but I have sensitive skin. I felt an itch/tingling feeling when I applied butI brushed it off and kept using it for about 5 days to a week. I developed a pimple on my lip (I was starting my cycle so it could have been that but I don’t typically get acne there) I really loved the texture and recommend if you don’t have sensitive skin. Loved and wanted to Keep
