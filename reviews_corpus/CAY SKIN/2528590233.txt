Iâ€™m biracial with combo skin, and my face has never reacted well to anything with chemical or natural SPF in it. Every product with a SPF never fails to give me clogged pores, which sucks as someone in their 30s hyper-conscious of sun exposure. Whatever is in this stuff is a godsend for me. Have been wearing it daily for three weeks now with no issues which is unbelievable for me. Holy grail for me
