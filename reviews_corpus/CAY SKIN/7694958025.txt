I got the sephora sunscreen kit and brought the trial size of this sunscreen with me on vacation. I loved the way this sunscreen preformed, considering it was 95 degree weather and humid where I was vacationing! My skin gets a sunburn rather quickly and even with the UV index being 11, my skin did not burn. I loved the glow this sunscreen gave my skin, gave a “your skin but better look”. Didn’t need to wear any face makeup but I still looked put together! Will be purchasing the full size! Plus this didn’t break me out! subtle glow and doesn’t break me out!
