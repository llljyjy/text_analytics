I didn’t like this sunscreen at all. I found it to be streaky, difficult to blend, and it pills. The texture is slightly moussy, and in my experience was really challenging to work with. I’m looking for a sunscreen with a simpler application. It also made me look way too warm-toned (e.g leaning orange). Pass. nope
