This moisturizer is deeply hydrating and and adds an instant glow to the complexion! The formula contains niacinamide, which has been amazing for improving the texture of my skin and refining my pores. I love the addition of the high SPF content because it really protects my skin. The formula feels really nourishing on the skin but it doesnâ€™t make the skin greasy or heavy. It leaves no white cast on my tan skin tone and it works well under makeup! Gifted by Cay Skin. Instant Glow and No White Cast
