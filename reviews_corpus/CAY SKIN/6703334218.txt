Ok I am wowed by this lip balm!! If you like Summer Fridays lip balm you need to try this one out. It’s the same applicator and has a very similar scent to the brown sugar one. This one is described as a vanilla brown sugar scent, so it is sweet but I love it!! The consistency is nice, not overly stick at all and leaves a beautiful glossy glow on your lips. Love that it’s also water resistant, broad spectrum and SPF 30!! nan
