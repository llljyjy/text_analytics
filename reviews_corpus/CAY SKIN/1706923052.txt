I’m really impressed with this body lotion. I was a little skeptical at first because of the color but I love how seamless this melts into the skin! It’s perfect as a prep for body oils and doesn’t leave any greasiness behind at all! A little goes a long way and the packaging is a generous size however the pump only dispenses a little product at a time so I find for my legs and arms, I have to pump quite a bit. Overall, I love how it makes my skin look and feel and I love to layer it. I will definitely buy this again! nan
