Initially, this product did not have a strong smell which I really liked. Sometimes sunscreen can be overpowering. The formula was also super smooth. The SPF 45 sunscreen felt almost like a mousse and didnâ€™t make my face white at all. It blended in super easily as well. The packaging is also so cute. This product was gifted by Cay Skin but I will be repurchasing it! Really really love it and will def be taking it on spring break with me! 10/10
