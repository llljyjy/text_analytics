This lotion smells like summer to me. It’s a nice thick sunscreen which I really appreciate especially going into summer. My fave is always the first to burn so an spf of 45 is definitely needed. This product applies smoothly and isn’t too thick on the skin. This product was gifted by Cay Skin and I love it. Great face spf
