This lotion applied really smooth and lightweight. It comes tinted with a bit of sparkle. It’s slightly oily but once applied to face, you can’t feel it. It’s really great for days you’re outside as it adds a slight golden tint to your face. Lightly smells like normal sunscreens but it fades after a few minutes. Overall, super impressed, no white tints! Loved this sunscreen!
