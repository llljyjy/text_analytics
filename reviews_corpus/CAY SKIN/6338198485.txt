I liked this sunscreen more than I expected! I was pleasantly surprised by how light-weight this is. Pump bottle is also a plus. I was initially worried about the shimmery orange-tan tint of the product and how it would look on my light skin, but it blends out decently without looking super greasy. It does add a bit of color to my skin, and though it is not too noticeable, this factor combined with the dewy/pearlescent finish makes this a non-daily sunscreen for me - more appropriate for the weekend/special occasions just based on my skin tone and matte/dewy preferences. This product was gifted by Cay Skin but opinions are my own. nan
