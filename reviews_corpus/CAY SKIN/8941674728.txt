I received this product complimentary from Cay Skin but this is my honest opinion.I really enjoy this glow sunscreen.I love hydrating, glowy sunscreen as the last step of my skincare routine since I have dry skin. This one is perfect because it gives a natural dewy finish without feeling or looking greasy.I like the pump applicator as it is very sanitary. This absorbs easily and doesn’t pill on top of my moisturizer. It also absorbs completely when I reapply a couple hours later.Overall I’m really enjoying this product, especially during the colder months since I am always looking for the extra hydration.It is slightly tinted (blends away) and does not leave a white cast. The glow is real
