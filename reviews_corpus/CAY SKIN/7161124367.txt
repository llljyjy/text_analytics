I absolutely love the healthy luminous glow the lotion and sunscreen together give! It feels very smooth as well! I have dry sensitive skin and did not experience any form of reaction. But the only thing I donâ€™t like is the scent unfortunately. The lip balm is also very moisturizing but does leave a sunscreen taste. Complimentary from Cay Skin. Love the glow!!
