This was gifted to me by Cay Skin. Was excited to give this a try. Easy to apply, has a slight scent thatâ€™s not bad at all. Love the finish. It has some shimmer in it that gives you a glow. Excited to use it in the summer.Beautiful packaging. Compact enough to be able to carry with you in your bag. Application was easy. Will be telling my friends to give it a try. Isle Glow indeed
