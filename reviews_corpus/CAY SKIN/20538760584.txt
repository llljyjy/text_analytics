This sunscreen has a nice, lotion feeling and leaves a beautiful glow. The glow level is on the edge of being a little too much to wear on its own, but looks really nice under a foundation or tinted moisturizer. I love the packaging and that it has a pump.I will say that by the end of the day I felt it caused my foundation to look a little bit heavy, but it could have been then it didnâ€™t fully agree with the foundation I was wearing.If you plan on purchasing this sunscreen, definitely check out their spf lip balm. It felt super nice on the lips and it felt great knowing they were protected.This was gifted to me by Cay Skin Nice, glowy sunscreen
