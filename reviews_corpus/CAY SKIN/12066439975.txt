Picked this up on a whim and havenâ€™t been able to put it down yet. Love the texture of it, how it makes my lips feel and the applicator feels nice. A little goes a long way. There  was a little bit left after 3 Months off everyday use so I cut the tip of the applicator to get the last of it out. Never had a lip spf before so this is a great idea. Now have recurring purchases for this balm. Must have!
