This works well on my skin. Smooth and light texture as well. When it applied, it’s absorbed quickly too. My favorite detail about this is that it adds a healthy summery glow. The one factor I can’t get over though is the scent. It doesn’t quite fade so I do have to put on some perfume afterwards. Other than that, I do enjoy using it and don’t mind putting on some light makeup over it. I’d definitely wear it more if not for the scent. I received this complimentary from Cay Skin but this review is my own opinion. nan
