This product was gifted by Cay Skin in exchange for my honest review. After testing this for a few days I’m happy to say that I really enjoyed this SPF! I was nervous to test it since I’ve seen a lot of people say that it pilled on them or looked very orange but I haven’t experienced either of these myself. It gives a beautiful glow to the skin that looks great underneath makeup! I’ve also worn this on it’s own with a little bit of powder to bring down the glow and have loved the way that looks as well! Overall this is definitely the winning product from the brand for me. The standout SPF from the brand!
