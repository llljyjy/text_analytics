Iâ€™ve been searching for a new holy grail lip balm and was interested in this after seeing it has spf30. it works great, lasts all day or all night, and consistency is like a happy medium between gloss and balm. also smells like cake/cookies which I love. I ordered 2, one was completely full and the other was seemingly half empty, like other reviewers have complained about. quality control seems to be an issue there which is annoying to say the least, but the product itself is great. Great balm, bad quality control
