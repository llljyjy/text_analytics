I guess it’s fine as the product that it is. Light vanilla scent, super glossy but not quite sticky. However, after a couple of weeks using it, with plenty of product in the tube, I was having trouble squeezing anything out. I kept squeezing and the tip of the tube prolapsed. Then when I’d go to use it from now on a fountain of lip balm GUSHES out spilling out everywhere. This morning I tried to use it and along with excess product came the inside mechanism for the applicator (see pic). Also the tip got so ugly so quickly and idk why. I guess product got into the crevices from the inside?? But it literally looked 6 years old and crusty after like, a week. it prolapses
