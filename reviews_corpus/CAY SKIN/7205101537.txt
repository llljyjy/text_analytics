I’ll go ahead and say what many people won’t admit: This stuff is better than Laneige. The finish is super hydrating and silky without being excessively sticky. Laneige is popular, but if you’re really looking for something to truly address the issue of dry lips, I’d highly recommend this. Love love love it!
