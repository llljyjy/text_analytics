I received a sample of this in one of my orders and was so excited to try it out! I loved the ingredients and the high SPF count plus I’m always on the hunt for a great sunscreen and moisturizer combination. Unfortunately this did not fit the bill and I’m glad I had a sample before buying the full size. The white cast is out of this world and even blending it fully to the point of “creating wrinkles,” didn’t really smooth it out. The white cast was most prominent on my forehead and probably wouldn’t be a big deal to most who go in with foundation but usually at work, i go for the “no makeup, makeup” look and feel and with my dark skin tone, it was just too noticeable. nan
