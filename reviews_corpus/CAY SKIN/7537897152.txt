I have mixed feelings about this product (acne-prone skin type). On one hand, there is glitter in here and I find that the glitter comes off when I touch my face throughout the day (I do touch my face a lot so it is noticeable when the glitter gets on my hand). If I set my face with some powder and a setting spray, it does last long and glitter doesn’t tend to wipe off. I also find that this product needs to be shaken super well to mix for the best wear. This is something that can be overcome, but I would recommend unscrewing the pump and stirring the product with it before using for the first time because the more this product mixes together, the less noticeable the glitter is. On the other hand, I do love the way this wears on my face. It looks super glowy and there is no white cast from this product so it would look great on all skin tones. I don’t have any problems with this affecting my moisture barrier and my acne doesn’t react to this product at all. If this is a product that interests you and is something you would wear everyday, I would recommend it. However, do be aware it may take some trial and error to get this to perform at it’s best. nan
