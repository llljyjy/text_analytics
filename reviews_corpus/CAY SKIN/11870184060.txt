This may be my all time favorite sunscreen now! First of all, it applies like water and absorbs into my skin so easily, no cast or having to blend anything out. The slight tint adds a very subtle bronze, which even on my very pale skin looks great. Thereâ€™s a very natural glowy sheen to it which I love for no-makeup days. This will definitely be my go-to for this summer and beyond! I was gifted this complimentary from Cay Skin. Stunning for summer!
