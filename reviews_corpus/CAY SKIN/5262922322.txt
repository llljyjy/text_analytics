This is as gifted by Cay Skin, and it is a great sunscreen. My skin didn’t love this—I don’t usually do well with chemical sunscreen—but this works amazing for my daughter. She’s mixed, so it’s great that there’s no white cast with this. She loves the tiny bit of a dewiness that this adds to her skin! It helps make her skin look a little bit more “done” without adding coverage. Amazing sunscreen with no white cast
