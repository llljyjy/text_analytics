I’ve been in the search for a good spf product for my body and it’s been pretty hard ( I’m not a fan of sprays & oils) until I tried Cay Skin lotion! Moisturizing, good sun protection (spf45), no white residue on the skin, blends in super easily and leaves the skin glowing! I live in Florida, so spf is a must for me every day and I’m happy that I found a perfect one for me! Highly recommend! nan
