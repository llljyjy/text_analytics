This lip mask is amazing. It cured my incurably chapped lips. Mine have been chapped and painful for weeks, if not months. I’ve tried other expensive lip balms, Aquaphor, etc. but as soon as those wore off, my lips would shrivel back up. I was starting to wonder if I needed to see a derm or if lip filler would be my only option. I impulse bought this and my lips were significantly better overnight. Now it’s been three days, and they’re completely back to normal. Even when the balm wears off, they’re hydrated. Sometimes it stings a tiny bit. I don’t know why and honestly, I don’t care. Please never change the formula! I want to buy this forever! Did What No Other Lip Balm Could
