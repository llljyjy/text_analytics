I went to Sephora and saw an employee with the glossiest lips and asked them what they were wearing and they pointed me in the direction of this lip balm. Not only is it glossy, itâ€™s not sticky and extremely hydrating and fills in my fine lines! I am super picky about lip balms and this is my new favorite! Perfection
