I got a sample of this and was excited since I like the lip balm. I have oily/combo skin and agree with others that this sunscreen has a very greasy look on oilier skin types! The real kicker was how it migrated into my eyes and burned and stung all day long (I was at work and couldn’t wash it off). It didn’t irritate my skin so that’s a plus, but for those with sensitive eyes - watch out! I applied the same way I do all other sunscreens (I recommend supergoop, kinship, and biore UV if you can find it). MY EYES :(
