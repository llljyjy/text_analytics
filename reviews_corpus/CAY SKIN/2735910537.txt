Loved this lip balm! So moisturizing, spf 30, nice scent, clean product. Horrible packaging. Stopped dispensing after less than a quarter of tube use. Ended up ripping the top off and using my finger to dispense which saves the product but not as hygienic. Do not recommend until they change the packaging. Not worth the hassle. Bad packaging
