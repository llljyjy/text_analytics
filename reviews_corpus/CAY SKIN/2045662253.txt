This absorbs and blends well into my skin! No white cast. No stickiness. It’s a little pearlescent in the sun which I enjoy. Not sure why it’s tinted though since it’s a chemical sunscreen (all the chemical sunscreens I’ve used in the past never left a white cast). No smell. The pump is easy to use. Overall, I am enjoying this one! Gifted by Cay Skin. nan
