This product is for Black or Brown people because if you are lighter than brown, this will end up being way too bronzy and make you look like a shiny penny. This is also for people who simply want a glow and don’t care about sun protection because if you use the adequate amount of this product to actually be protected, you will again, look like a greasy shiny penny. This would look nice on the collar bone area or as a light layer when you’re on vacation. Overall, does not work for me and I don’t think it’s practical but would totally be a hit for people who just want to look bronzy on a warm day. Not for me
