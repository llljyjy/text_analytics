I bought this lip balm on the Cay Skin website since it was available before Sephora, and I can say it’s my favorite spf balm that I’ve tried. It is super comfortable and almost like a balm gloss texture. The applicator is super comfortable and unique too. The smell is a warm vanilla smell at first, and then it fades to a typical sunscreen smell. While that does last for a little the smell and taste does fade over time. This balm also lasts pretty decently on my lips after eating and drinking. Overall, this is a fantastic hydrating lip balm with added sun care benefits. hydrating and super comfortable
