I was reluctant to try this product, because nearly all of the positive reviews were incentivized.  Additionally, the reviews that werenâ€™t incentivized were not so great.   I decided to take a chance & purchase anyway since my current sunscreen was way too greasy & caused me to breakout mid day.  I am so glad I followed my instincts and purchased anyway. This product is AMAZING! There was no pilling, greasiness, or glitter everywhere as some reviewers stated.  I thoroughly shook the bottle before dispensing, then rubbed two pumps between my palms before applying to my face. The application will look shiny for maybe a minute tops, but dissipates shortly after leaving behind a great natural glow.  I have sensitive acne prone skin and this sunscreen did not burn or cause any breakouts. I will definitely purchase again when I finish this one. nan
