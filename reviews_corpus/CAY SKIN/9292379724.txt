I really liked this product when I first applied it, it gives a lovely glow and goes on really nicely, a little goes a long way. The downside I didn’t like was the unpleasant taste, and while I was careful to keep it away from my mouth every time I used it I had a bitter unpleasant taste in my mouth. I’ve read other reviews that mention it transferring easily and so that must be the issue. The other downside, also mentioned in other reviews is that it separates in the bottle and unless you shake it very vigorously you just end up pumping a thin liquid rather than the creamy product it should be. I had to return my first purchase because once it had separated in the bottle I couldn’t get it to mix up again. shake vigorously
