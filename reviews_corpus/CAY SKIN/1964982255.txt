// okayyyyy @cayskin came with HEAT! Never did I think I’d be in love with a shimmery face SPF in. My. LIFE! But here we are! That subtle glow is so fkn sexy but never ever gets greasy! I’m really impressed! This sunscreen is completely castless on my medium/deep skintone. I love how quickly and effortlessly it blends into my skin.  I did an application demo on my IG (@yvannabrooke) if you want to see it applied. I also did a side by side of the mineral spf.  Gifted by Cay Skin, however, all my opinions are my own. We have a winner!
