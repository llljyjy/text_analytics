I’m so sad this product didn’t work for me! While it was a little more sparkly than I would have liked, the dealbreaker was the fact that it got in my eyes and stung so bad. The texture was nice and it was fun to apply every morning. Maybe it’s just me having that problem, but I had to return it. I wanted to like this :(
