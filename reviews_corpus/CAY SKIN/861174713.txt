I love this lip balm!  It has a great smell and taste and I just love that it has SPF 30!  It stays on for quite a while and gives a nice sheen to your lips.  I had a bit of a problem with product not coming out of the applicator but used a small pair of needlework scissors to cut a small hole.  It works just fine now.  Not sure why the tip “closes up” but it’s an easy fix. my new fav!
