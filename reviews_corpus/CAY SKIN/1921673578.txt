When I first pumped out some product I gotta admit I was nervous. Let’s say I’m above 60. My skin is good. But ya know age is age. So anything remotely shimmery can be dicey. This product makes my skin look creamy. Soft. Smooth. I just love it. Even out my tone too. Plus I was in the sun working and no red! I typically tan anyway but first real spring outing. Love it Great SPF product
