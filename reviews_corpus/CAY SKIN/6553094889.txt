I love that this product has clean ingredients! Its hard to find spf products that dont contain PEG or other unsafe chemicals. I also love that it does not taste horrible given that you’re bound to taste some of it if its on your lips. I bought two! One for me and one for my bf, he loves it too. We’re always out and about and need to protect our lips from the Nevada sun. I came back to stock up on extras but it was sold out.. not surprised. This is a great product! The only downside is I did notice a lot of the tube is filled with air. I wish there was more product inside. Other than that, this is a new staple for me. New go-to!
