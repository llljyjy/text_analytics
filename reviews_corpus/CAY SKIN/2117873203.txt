Ummm. Yes to everything happening with this lip balm. It smells like 90s bath and body works’ vanilla brown sugar fragrance. The consistency is a little thicker than the Fenty gloss bombs, but not as thick as Vaseline or Vanicream lip products. Appearance wise, this looks like a less shimmery and less pigmented cross between Fenty (gloss bombs) hot chocolit and  Fenty glow. The only downside is that this product won’t last for hours and needs to be reapplied, but I guess that’s a good way to motivate folks to reapply spf. All in all, incredibly impressed with this product and will be recommending to my friends Glossy SPF Magic ✨
