I love that this is a glow boosting body sunscreen/lotion. It definitely leaves a beautiful pearlescent finish on my skin once applied. It feels really good on my skin, & absorbs into my skin nicely. The best part is that it doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin at all. I’ve heard that the face lotion from this brand, isn’t too friendly to those of us with darker skin. However, this one works nicely on my richly melalinated skin. Pretty nice offering from the brand, & I’ll definitely be using it all summer. I’m interested in trying out the body oil that launched with this product as well! A really nice lotion/spf hybrid!
