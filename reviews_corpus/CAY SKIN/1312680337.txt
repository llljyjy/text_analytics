I got this originally as part of the summer sunscreen deal earlier this year. When I used it, I was in love! I was trying to stretch out the mini size that I had, but my 7 year old son used it all up! When I asked him why he used it all up, he said “Mom! It makes my skin look amazing!“ Well, I could not argue with that! He is much fairer than I am, but it looked amazing on both of us! He has no idea that I am going to hide my full size bottle so I can keep it to myself! It is perfect for those days when you don’t want to wear make up or just want to get a few extra minutes of sleep and skip putting on make up. I like that it is SPF 45 because mini sunscreens are only SPF 30. Excellent deal! I did not have trouble with transferring or stinging if I began to sweat. I hope to see more from this line!!! Sold on the Trial Size!
