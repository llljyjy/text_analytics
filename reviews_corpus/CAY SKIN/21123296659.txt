#ComplimentaryfromCaySkinThese products are incredible. My skin feels super hydrated and protected with The Universal Mineral Face Lotion SPF 55 and The Isle Glow Face Lotion SPF 45. Cay Skin kindly provided me with a bonus product which is the Isle Lip Balm SPF 30. (Another big hit!!) Put simply, their lip balm feels like paradise for my lips. The Isle Glow Face Lotion SPF 45 has a really hydrating consistency, it melts right into your skin like butter. The Universal Mineral Face Lotion SPF 55 is a super lightweight cream consistency which covers your face gently like a cream cloud. This reminds me of a liquid highlighter because itâ€™s super rich and sheer. This will go perfectly under makeup or by itself during summertime. The Isle Lip Balm SPF 30 is an amazing clear lip balm that comes in a beautiful tube and looks a lot like a lipgloss. The scent caught my attention because it smelled wonderfully like coco butter. This is an instant favorite for me. Huge hit!!
