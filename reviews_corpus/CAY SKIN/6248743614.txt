This is definitely my new favorite lip product! I am a lip gloss,balm,& sleeping lip mask junkie I probably by a lip product once every 2 months. I personally really love the smell, this gives really warm tones of vanilla. The products is thick and moisturizing and leaves my lips feeling hydrated even when the product is no longer on my lips! I got this product for a trip because Iâ€™m gonna be in the sun and wanted to make sure my whole entire body was spf protected. But now I have a new favorite lip product ! My new favorite lip gloss
