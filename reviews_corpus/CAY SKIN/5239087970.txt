Who doesn’t want a back from the beach glow with the protection of a mineral sunscreen?! I’ve loved using this on no makeup days, yesterday I wore it while cleaning up our garden and knew my skin was safely protected from the spring sun with an spf 45. The formula isn’t greasy and makes it look like I’m wearing a soft highlighter without any makeup use. I highly recommend and will be restocking on this product. nan
