I was very surprised at how great this product is. Most sunscreen based face products I’ve used leave my face oily, too shiny, etc but this brand of products doesn’t! It absorbs immediately and feels like an expensive moisturizer. It is perfect for beach or pool days and I love it. I received this product complimentary from Cay Skin to give my honest review and my honest review is that it’s a great product! Will definitely every summer
