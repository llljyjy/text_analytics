I got this lotion as a gift complimentary from Cay Skin. The Isle Glow Face Lotion SPF 45 is a perfect day lotion for anyone who always forgets to put on sunscreen. I usually don’t use sunscreen...I know that’s bad, but they are thick, they smell and leave a white cast. This is amazing, I can use it and it doesn’t do that. I love that it is lightweight, perfect for my sensitive skin. The SPF lasts long, that’s perfect for everyone who sometimes forgets to put on sunscreen. My skin feels moisturized and glowy after applying this too. Love it! nan
