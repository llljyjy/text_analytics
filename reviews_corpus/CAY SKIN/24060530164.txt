I LOVE this lip balm! The formula is super comfortable and glossy, like an emollient gel texture. If you like medium-to-thick lip oils and glosses, you’ll probably like this. Imparts great shine, cushiony feel, actually moisturizing, pleasant vanilla flavor without the bitterness of usual spf lip products, and has lasted a while considering how often I’ve used it. Probably bc it stays on your lips for a solid amount of time. I would totally buy this again. Best lip spf I've seen
