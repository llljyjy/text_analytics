I received this complimentary from Cay Skin.  I really like how lightweight this suncreen feels, and how it doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin. Chemical sunscreens are typically my preference. I feel like it gives a subtle bronzed tint on my pale skin, but I don’t dislike it, and think it would be perfect especially in the summer! Great chemical sunscreen!
