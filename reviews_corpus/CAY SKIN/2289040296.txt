I’m in love! I grew up using unconventional products to try and moisturize my lips. I’m so happy to have found this clean product that actually moisturizes (and the moisture LASTS). It’s light and the scent is calming.  its like the pre-game to the party that is the isle lip balm. Definitely replacing my Leneige, which I didn’t think was possible. Better Than Leneige.. wild!
