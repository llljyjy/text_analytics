here I write my experience separately about this setUniversal Mineral Face Lotion SPF 55 is the perfect one for summer days out. It gives my skin a natural finish no white cast. It is reef safe and silicone free. It is made of plant based ingredients. While I applied this sunscreen it gives an instant moisture and natural glow. I apply this 15 minutes before sun exposure. For seamless blend I rub it on my skin for about 30 seconds. Isle Glow Face Lotion SPF 45 is a lightweight antioxidants that protect UVA/UVB.This can be use for all skin tones. Itâ€™s nude pearl blend gives my skin a natural look, blends easily and no white cast. After I apply my skin looks very healthy and moisturizer for the rest of the day. It also contains of Vitamin B3 and B5 which is very good for skin. I can wear it with or without makeup. Overall my experience from these two SPFs, my skin looks very healthy, fresh and smooth after I apply white cast at all.I recommend this. Good set of SPF
