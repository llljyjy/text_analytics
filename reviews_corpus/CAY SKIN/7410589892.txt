so it’s definitely lightweight not super oily at all and does absorb into the skin pretty great. pump also works pretty good so far. however if your expecting to smell vanilla in this, than think again lol. It has a very lightweight “amberish“ smell, it’s so faint you can barely smell it at all. That all being said it’s a good product for what it is I just wish it was spf 45 instead of spf30. Doest have much of a smell, but pretty pleasant.
