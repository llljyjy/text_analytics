I love this product! It just gives you a pearlescent dewy golden hour type of glow that I live for! I personally don’t notice any type of glitter on my face like others are saying it also doesn’t come off of my skin it stays on and sinks in. I feel like if you have darker / brown skin and can’t use products like Glowscreen (that makes me look terribly pale despite certain people claiming it’s a “holy grail”) then I’d advise purchasing this. Every single product that Winnie has came out with I have fell in love with and works well for my skin❤️. Pearlescent Glow
