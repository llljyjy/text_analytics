I really liked how this product felt on my lips, Iâ€™m always applying a lip balm if I do not have lipstick/lipgloss on. Unfortunately, due to the tip suddenly no longer working, I had to throw most of it out. No matter how much I squeezed with all of my might, still nothing, and if it DID eventually come out....it squirted everywhere making a mess. Hopefully the packaging changes for easier use. Needs new applicator - stops working
