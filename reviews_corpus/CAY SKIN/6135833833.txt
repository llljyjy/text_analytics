My lips have been dry due to medical reasons and this cold weather was not helping. They were chapped, cracked, and a mess. I tried several lip balms and oils. This was like a last resort type of deal. OMG no regrets. I am not a fan of the vanilla smell, but this one is so faint. I applied it on my lips and my lips were like, “ Thank you “. It made my lips so soft and hydrated. Cracked and chapped lips, where?!?!I like to apply this before lipsticks, it makes the application a lot smoother. This has basically become my go to lip balm. I can wear it under a mask and it does not get all crusty or sticky. For the price and the amount it is not too bad. There are more expensive lips masks, this is pretty good. I will definitely repurchase. LIP BALM MORE LIKE LIP BOMB YASSS
