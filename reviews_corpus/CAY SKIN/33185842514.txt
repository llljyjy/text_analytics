While I do love this product, I have to say that it’s more of a lip gloss than a balm. As a lip gloss, it’s amazing and I highly recommend it. The packaging is what warrants less than five stars, though. Even though you might still have more than half the product left in the tube, it stops dispensing! I love the formula and the vanilla scent, but the packaging is just so frustrating. I do recommend this product but beware the packaging... Beware the packaging!
