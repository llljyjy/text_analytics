I have oily t zone skin and tend to be too pink in the face, with very fair and super sensitive skin—I have an autoimmune disorder that effects my skin greatly so it’s difficult to find products that work/do their job, stay on, and dont irritate my skin. I love looking tan, and have been enchanted with Sally Hanson clear tanning spray for legs, and adding drops of Sol to moisturizer to get that beach look this summer since too much time in the sun aggregates my condition. Got this sample, and it’s my new favorite, exactly what I’ve been searching for all my life! I’ve tried so many products over the years, and this one honestly is the singular formula I’ve found that makes my skin just its best self—I actually feel comfortable and confident not wearing any face makeup after using this! Still pop on mascara and eyebrow pencil since I’m super blonde and look like a baked potato otherwise! Very highly recommended, worth every penny! Will be buying the big bottle when I run out!
