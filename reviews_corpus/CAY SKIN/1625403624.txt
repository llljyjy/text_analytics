This was complimentary from Cay Skin - I haven’t even had this too long and I am obsessed! It has become a staple in my everyday skincare routine. It’s dewey, but not at all oily which I love because I have pretty oily skin, especially in the summer months. It’s also very light and easy to throw on as my last step when I don’t want to wear makeup, but I want a nice beautiful glow. 5 stars!
