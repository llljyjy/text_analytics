This is my new favorite SPF, hands down. First of all, it’s NOT WHITENING! It gives you this beautiful healthy sun-kissed golden look. It’s almost like tinted moisturizer, but lighter. Seriously, so lightweight! I can’t feel it in my skin, it doesn’t feel like it’s heavy and my skin can’t breath underneath it, which is quite often the case with many sunscreens. It’s moisturizing and protecting at the same time. I can apply my regular foundation on top, and it goes on smoothly and doesn’t cake. However, the lotion itself gives such beautiful finish, that sometimes I don’t feel like applying anything on top at all. It just looks like my skin but better. nan
