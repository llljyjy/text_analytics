Horrible sunscreen. I bought this to check it out, because of the buzz and also because I like to try different sunscreens. If you think mineral sunscreens are horrible, then you have not tried this yet. This sunscreen peels so badly and the texture is “mousse“, however, it does not sink in and stays on your face like a thick foundation. On top of that, it really stings your eyes. The bottle itself was cheaply made, because the letters and descriptions “Faded“ away only after 2 days. Horrible quality and I am returning this product for sure. 45mL for this price and the quality is unacceptable. Worst sunscreen I have ever tried.
