Gifted by Cay Skin. Sunscreen is usually tricky for me because the hydrating ones make my acne prone combination skin feel greasy or break out and the matte ones feel too dry. I love that this felt like a light moisturizer because it left my skin looking dewy and feeling refreshed. Tbh, I almost felt the need to put on two layers because I was so used to the heavy feeling of other sunscreens. Made me wonder if something this breathable could actually protect my skin from the sun. I like this one and will probably use it as my winter sunscreen or during dryer seasons and climates Approved for now
