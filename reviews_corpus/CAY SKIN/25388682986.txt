This SPF lotion gifted by Cay Skin has a nice bronzy tint to it and really makes my skin have a glowy tan luck. I’d like to use it on no make up days to give my face a little color and glow. It also works well under make up. I didn’t notice any fragrance. I have normal skin, and it didn’t seem to be too oily or too matte/drying. nan
