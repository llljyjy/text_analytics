I honestly don’t know how this hasn’t gone viral yet. I’m VERY picky about my lip balms since my medication makes my lips uncomfortably dry. Most everything I try contains lower quality ingredients and dry my lips out instead of moisturize. UNTIL NOW! This balm is like nothing I’ve ever used. It smells nice and natural, has SPF, melts into my lips beautifully and once it’s time to reapply my lips feel sooo soft! Even my partner commented on how smooth and soft they were! This is a true moisturizing balm and not just something that sits on the lips. If you’re on the fence just buy it! MIRACLE IN A TUBE!
