Love the packaging.  Aside from it providing sun protection, the product leaves a glow on my face! It has these tiny glow particles. I don’t know if this will be something I’ll use during the summertime, since I’m not sure how well it’ll do in the heat. I don’t want my skin to look oily. But for now im enjoying it plus I love that it has niacinamide!! :)Gifted by Cay skin Might be Game Changer!
