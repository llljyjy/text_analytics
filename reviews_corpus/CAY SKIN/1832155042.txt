I don’t usually write reviews, but when I came here to do some research after this product just stopped working and saw I wasn’t alone, I had to say something. This product is great, high spf, clear, not too sticky and lasts a long time. Just lovely. After a few months though, the tube just stopped working. I pierced it with a needle, squeezed and squeezed, and nada - it just got clogged. So sad to not have access to 1/2 the product. Wound up having to throw it away.If they fix this issue, I’m definitely in for another tube! Great Product, Awful Packaging
