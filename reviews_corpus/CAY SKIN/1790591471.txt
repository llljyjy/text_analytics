The Isle Glow Face Lotion was a product that exceeded my expectations. The texture is gorgeous and has a beautiful tint to it, nearly looking like foundation when you pump it out of the bottle. It felt so smooth on my skin and was more of a luxury experience compared to applying “regular” sunscreen while still getting a whopping SPF 45. The bottle is so chic and aesthetic and looks great on my counter. I look forward to using it now and all summer long when looking for a lightweight SPF product. I received this product complimentary from Cay Skin but all opinions are my own. Beautiful SPF Face Lotion
