The packaging feels nice and sturdy and not cheaply made or like the pump will fall apart. I’m always looking for a great new sunscreen product that won’t feel greasy. This was nice and lightweight and sank in quickly like a lotion, and added quite a bit of shimmer. It wasn’t visible indoors but once I stepped into direct light it was a ton! I could do with a lot less of that - even after a shower I had it on my arms which is odd. I liked that it didn’t feel greasy and had hardly any scent though. I don’t think the shimmer really transferred to clothing - at least I hope not! This would be great for shoulders and legs at the beach or a special event, I’m not sure about daily use. nan
