Super light on the skin. It doesn’t even feel like I am wearing sun screen which I love! I don’t have any issues with it pilling under my makeup nor does it stick to any dry patches. I have oily skin and although this is a glowy sunscreen, I don’t feel like it makes me look too oily. It blends beautifully into the skin and doesn’t leave any sort of white cast. Complimentary from Cay Skin Blends beautifully
