I’ve been using this for a couple of weeks and I really like it! It’s thick and hydrating, but not super sticky. It usually absorbs a bit into my lips after applying (they get really dry this time of year!). I’ve started putting it on after my morning skin care routine too - I am pretty picky about lip masks/moisturizers, so I would say this is a win! nan
