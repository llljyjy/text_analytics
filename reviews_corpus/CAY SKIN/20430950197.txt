LOVE the formula of this facial sunscreen. I am very cautious about the sunscreen I use on my face since it always breaks out from 99% of sunscreen brands out there. I was eager to try this new brand when I was gifted by Cay Skin. Added bonus: it gives you that glow, for an extra “sun-kissed“ and fresh look which I’ve never seen from sunscreens I’ve used in the past. Will definitely use this daily to upkeep with my SPF! nan
