The headline says it all! Iâ€™ve been using Laneige until someone recently recommended this lip mask to me. I tend to have issues finding the best of the best for my lips, but my search ends here! I have had no complaints since the purchase. My lips feel great with absolutely no need to constantly reapply the mask like some other brands out there. Better than Laneige!!
