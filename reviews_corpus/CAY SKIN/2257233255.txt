This is the lip mask of my dreams. I put it on before bed and again in the morning before work, and it both lasts and delivers remarkable results. However, I am removing one star because it REEKS. The fragrance (like the strongest of vanilla cake scents) is probably acceptable for most people, but I am very sensitive to scents and flavors in lip products and this gave me a migraine the first time I tried it. The formula is totally worth it,  and I donâ€™t get headaches if I use a small amount; I just wish it came in other scents. smells awful but DELIVERS results
