I don’t do masks but this looked intriguing. Honestly, I don’t think sheet masks are all that; I’m more focused on things that can improve my skin, not just add a temporary glow. I’m still not totally sure this is for me, but— I’m keeping it for one reason alone. So I have this blemish on my forehead that just won’t go away. I don’t think it’s a zit but it sort of looks slightly poppable. And every now and then I just can’t help myself and I try to pop it with one of those blackhead tools even though I KNOW I will have a dent in my forehead for hours and nothing pops out. Anyway. The other day I tried (and failed) popping again. Had the big dent. So I decided to try rubbing the UFO on my spot, first with heat and red light then with cool with green light. And guess what?? The dent was GONE. I know,  not what it’s intended for. But if it took that away, I think it’s probably going to at least make my face a little happier when I use. nan
