I love the idea of getting facial treatment at home, and Foreo has a ton of great products for that exact purpose. I have only had a chance to use this Bear device a few times, but so far I’m very impressed. I like that it syncs up with the app, comes in a cute bright color, and is compact and easy to store. I used the device with the serum sample that it came with and also a serum from a different brand, and both worked well. I have only been brave enough to try the first level/setting, but I plan on gradually working up to higher settings. I found this device very easy to use, it felt like a nice massage on my face/neck, and I didn’t experience any discomfort or irritation. I think it’s too soon to see any dramatic results, but my skin has been looking very bright, even, and smooth. I’m excited to continue using this and I definitely recommend it! I received this product complimentary from Foreo in exchange for my honest review. Foreo Bear
