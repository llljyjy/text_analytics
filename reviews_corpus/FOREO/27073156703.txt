This is an expensive purchase I must say.But, I have seen a BIG difference in my skin from this.I’m sure you can find a cheaper one somewhere, but this does work really well!I use my hyaluronic acid afterwards on the other side of the device.Helps penetrate into your skin better. I really like this product. and like I said, I’m sure you can find a cheaper one out there I just don’t know what the difference would be if you got a cheaper one. I haven’t personally tried. Deep cleans your skin
