I tried the Bear a few times and it’s okay, I love a good facial massager but I also think I can manipulate the gua sha just as good. I tried the treatments that you can download onto the app and they’re alright. I just did the same moves that I normally do with my facial the first few times I used the bear and it was nice. Would I recommend a $300 device No. This product was gifted by FOREO. I have the cleansing Foreo device and I love that! Not worth it
