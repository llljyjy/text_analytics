I’ve never owned a facial toning device before and was super stoked to try this out. It’s pretty easy to get the hang of, I occasionally will feel a little shock if I don’t have enough gel on my face but other than that no pain. The results are pretty much instant looking forward to seeing how this holds up long term. But overall I’ve been loving this! *gifted by foreo* awesome facial toning device
