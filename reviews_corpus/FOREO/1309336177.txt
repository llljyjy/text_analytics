This microcurrent treatment is non-invasive to help reduce fine lines and wrinkles and boosts blood circulation to stimulate production of collagen to rejuvenate the skin.  Foreo makes this process very easy by having an app that guides you through the facial routines.  The treatment is customizable with the 10 levels of intensity.  One thing to remember is to make sure that you have enough serum to easily guide the device and that both spheres on touching the skin at the same time otherwise you will feel the zaps.  Iâ€™ve been using the device for other a week now and do see that my face has a nice glow to it, but I have not seen the lifting benefits yet.  I will continue to use to get the full benefits.
