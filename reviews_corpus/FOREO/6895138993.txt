There’s cleaning your face & then there’s REALLY cleaning your face & taking care of your skin in a way you wouldn’t think you could do at your own home! This facial cleansing device is absolutely amazing! After my first use I could already feel & see a difference in my skin, it felt more clean & smooth & it looked Radiant! It’s so easy to use & you can customize your cleansing routine to regular, gentle or deep cleansing, I love the regular setting for my cleanse, it works wonderfully! This will become a staple item in my skin care routine! Not only does it cleanse your face, if you turn it over & go to your app it has 5 massage routines!! Deep Tissue, Trigger Point, Lymphatic Drainage, Shiatsu & Reflexology massage. The trigger point is my favorite massage setting as I always have tension in my neck & head...This awesome device helped relieve the tension, I couldn’t believe it! This is an absolute MUST! If your serious about your skin, I absolutely recommend the Foreo Luna 4 & the best part is it’s made for sensitive skin! If you’re thinking about it, just get it! You will not regret it!! Must Have!!!
