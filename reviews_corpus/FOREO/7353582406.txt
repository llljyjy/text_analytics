The only reason I got a Luna Play Plus 2 was because, I assumed, like the original Plus (which the Foreo site seems to use interchangeably for the original old product and the entire line), it could be recharged with an AAA battery. Nope! I looked up the instruction manual online (the one bundled with the product is absolutely useless), and it turns out they’ve “innovated“ on the Play Plus 2 to make it as bad as the original Play was. After a year, you have to toss it out. “Once you’re ready to upgrade“ after your “taste“ of how great Foreo is (quotes are actual copy from their site referring to the Play line), buy one of the more expensive models! What in the condescending nonsense...To add insult to injury, after 4 tries I can already tell this thing will not last until the battery runs out. The responsiveness to the power button is spotty and I have barely even done anything to it (it hasn’t even SEEN water!).I don’t usually understand how people get so heated about a product that they swear they will never buy anything from a company again, but I’m there today. Done with Foreo for-ever. Anyone have any other face device recommendations? NOT rechargeable, which was the whole point
