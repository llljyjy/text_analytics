So far I am loving what its doing to my skin, yes its subtle, and yes consistency is key. Its super easy to incorporate into my routine, and it sits super cute on my counter with my matching Tatcha.I want to adress some reviews online:1. The App - Many people say it’s stupid you need the app to use it. I find it incredibly smart that you have to register the device and explore the videos and tutorials in order to learn how to use it. Let’s not forget this is a device that should not be incorrectly used. That said YOU DO NOT NEED THE APP TO USE IT EVERY TIME. Turn on the universal button, select the intensity, with the lights on and the serum on your skin hold it on to the skin and it will magically start - This baby is smart and everyone complaining about the app is stupid and didn’t do the research2. The serum - Look I am sure that these people developed the best possible serum to use with this. However there is a reason it’s called serum serum serum, you need ALOT of it. the device wont work without it and it quickly dries up so you are constantly reapplying which makes this serum OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE. I’ve been using The Ordinary Marine Hydraulic serum which is also glycerin based and its working perfect (Well, its pretty runny and the applicator isn’t the best for this but hey $8 vs $59 - I find the tricky application well worth the price difference) Outsmart the Bear <3
