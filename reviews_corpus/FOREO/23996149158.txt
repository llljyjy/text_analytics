I’ve been wanting to try a microcurrent device after seeing my friend have amazing results with her Foreo…and I was NOT disappointed! The results are immediately noticeable, but for long term results you have to be consistent. It’s very easy to use and fool proof if you follow the directions in the Foreo app. A facial workout only takes approximately 2.5 minutes, and it’s 10000% worth it. nan
