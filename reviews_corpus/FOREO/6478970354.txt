There are not enough good things I can say about this device. 1) the compact size is not only great for a carry on, to thrown in your purse, or even just to bring in an overnight, it’s so convenient. 2) while I don’t fully understand why the vibrations vary, I do love how it makes my face feel, and I almost feel like it’s “telling“ me when I’ve washed my face enough! 3) MY SKIN! It’s like a personal aesthetician is cleaning my face every day. Seriously. I cried after using this I was so happy with the results. Dry patches on my skin that have been there for YEARS are gone. In a DAY, ladies and gents! Basically, the TLDR? You HAVE to buy this! TLDR - You Need This!
