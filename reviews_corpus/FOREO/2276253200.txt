Microcurrent facial treatment is my favorite at home device to use. Because it really works! I only need 3 mins to complete the treatment in the morning for a mini facelift. The anti-shock system is great that I donâ€™t worry about the current being too intense. The only gripe I have is that it can only be activated by Foreo app when you use in the first time. After that, I can use it without the app. But the intensity of the t-tonic (vibration) needs to be adjusted by APP later on. I will use more to see the long time results. Gifted by FOREO. nan
