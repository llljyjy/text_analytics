This device was sent to me complimentary from Foreo. I have a microcurrent device from different brand that I don’t use too often, but I was curious to try out Foreo Bear, because I love this brand and their Lunas. This beauty tool is very compact and fits perfectly in the hand. I also love a small charger which makes Bear very travel friendly. It can be used both with and without the app. I already had the app as I have Foreo Luna facial brushes, so adding Bear was extra easy. I love that it shows how full the battery is, gives all information about this device and not only lets control the strength of the microcurrent, but also has a few guided routines. While it’s pretty easy to figure out how to use Bear, those routines really help to make sure you use the device properly and at the right speed. So far I’ve been consistent with using Bear and my skin feels tighter and more toned. I really love the results and will keep using the device Love using this
