This device has a combination of incredible technology with microcurrents, t-sonic pulsations, and an anti-shock system. The advanced microcurrent helps tone facial muscles, tighten the skin, and  smooth the look of wrinkles. I downloaded the FOREO app, connected my device, and customized my favorite features! It has 5 intensity levels, you can use it for anything from gentle therapy to targeted repair. The guided routines in the app are very innovative. After one use, my skin immediately felt lifted and I felt drainage. The advanced contouring has made my skin glow. It is 100% waterproof and has up to 90 uses before it needs to be recharged! It improves my beauty routine because it is essentially a quick facial at home made to target fine lines and wrinkles. My skin feels like I had a salon facial! I have noticed less puffiness, smaller pores, and skin firming.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking to up your skincare regimen! This product is well worth the investment! Not Painful Shocking!
