I’m glad I got this on sale when it was only like $20, cause I don’t feel so bad wasting my money on it. It doesn’t do much tbh, if you are into cleansing brushed there are better on the market & if you’re looking to get one: don’t. Honestly your fingers are good enough, most nights I don’t even bother using it cause it’s just an extra step having to clean & dry it afterwards. not worth it
