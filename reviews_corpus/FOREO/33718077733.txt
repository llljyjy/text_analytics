I have always wanted to use a microcurrent device to help tone and “exercise” your facial muscles to firm them up. I have purchased one in the past, but have been too leery to use it. However the Bear is a really easy to hold, “friendly looking “ tool that I felt better to start off my journey with.  I love the cute pink color, and it’s small and compact easy to hold. It charged quickly and connected to the app quickly as well. The routine to miscrocurrent your face was super easy and quick! And it didn’t hurt at all. I may have felt a TEENY, TINY little zap hear and there. Probably when I wasn’t holding it correct. But the whole process was nothing to be scared about at all, and the app guided you they the routine super easy. I want to use it faithfully for a few months to see the biggest benefits. But even after a use, you skin does feel tighter. I’m am super excited to keep using it! Really Easy Tool!!
