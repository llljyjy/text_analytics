I don’t normally write reviews but I had to for this one, I also thought I should clarify some things other reviews passed over, unfortunately the Sephora website isn’t as detailed on this versus the other products and I had to do a lot of my own research. After using this 2x a day for 5 days (I will update review if things change) my skin looks AMAZING! My issue was most physical exfoliants break out my skin and even after a chemical exfoliant I still have the dead skin that needs to be removed plus I can’t do real chemical exfoliation in the summer and it’s just felt like the dead skin was building up, it was even making my foundation flaky!!On the third day of use my foundation went on flawlessly! I couldn’t believe it I actually had smooth skin! One thing I noticed about this description versus others is that it actually uses sonic pulses instead of “vibrations“ like a Sonicare toothbrush it will actually break apart build up to remove it instead of just massaging it (this is a huge advantage if you do research on sonic pulses). Also some people seem to be upset that its not Rechargeable but you CAN change the battery. I saw one review that the screws rusted so they can’t change them so even though it’s waterproof, I’m keeping mine dry to prevent this, the more expensive versions are Rechargeable if that’s what you’re looking for.based on what I’ve been seeing with this I will absolutely splurge on the next purchase and get the full size full feature one, but I wasn’t sure how’d I’d feel, I absolutely love it and can only imagine how great the full size one is! Absolutely Amazing!
