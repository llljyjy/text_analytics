I honestly do think this is a really cool device and I’m definitely intrigued by the idea of it working to tone my face but I can’t tell if I’m sold on it. I used it a second time putting the microcurrent down to one doing the iCardio and unfortunately I don’t think I’m a fan of this product. If I like it was pinching my skin I almost found it too uncomfortable to finish the exercise because I didn’t feel like it was achieving much for me. I read some reviews and it seems like you need a sufficient amount of serum to achieve best results so i will try that next time. gifted by foreo Cool idea
