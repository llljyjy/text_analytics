This device appealed to me as my face is starting to show the first signs of aging. I was especially intrigued by the toning claims of using microcurrent. I also found the small size appealing as it can glide easily around the eyes and mouth. I find the process easy and relaxing. I really like that you have to use the app with this. It keeps me focused and clearly guides the routines. I also appreciate that you can control the microcurrent setting from 1-6. After using my face looks noticeably lifted and “more alive”. Really has made an awesome addition to my skincare routine! I received this complimentary from FOREO. Perfect for first signs of aging!
