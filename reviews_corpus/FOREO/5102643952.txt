It’s hard to talk about the functionality because it’s pretty subjective and is based on how often it’s used. The device is very easy to set to and use. I like that you can follow along with a video on your phone to use it for different facial treatments. It only comes with 1 sampler packet of the serum - which is a one time use and it made it pretty hard to do a comparison to see if the foreo serum is actually needed or if I can use something comparable. I think this is device I would have to use everyday for a number of months to see a review & not just 14 days. Gifted by foreo It’s hard to say
