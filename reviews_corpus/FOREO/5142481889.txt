I purchased this during the VIB sale, and when I received it it wouldn’t turn on.  I changed the batteries and it worked for about two days before it stopped working again.  I tried changing the batteries a few more times before I reported the issue and requested a new Luna.  When my second Luna arrived, I experienced the same issues.  This is supposed to work for 400 uses before the batteries die, but I can barely get two uses out of it!I’ve happily purchased many Foreo products throughout the years, but it seems this product is defective and unusable. Incredibly disappointed
