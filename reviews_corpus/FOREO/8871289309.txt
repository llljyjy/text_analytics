I’ve tried a silicon scrubber before but I never liked it because it was manual. I saw that the 3rd version won the allure award so I figured I would try this since I feel like my hands can never clean my face as thoroughly. I enjoyed how this product had different cleansing modes, so if I wore makeup I can clean deeper to ensure all the gunk is out of my pores. Overall, I am really enjoying this product, and it’s definitely worth the price for me. nan
