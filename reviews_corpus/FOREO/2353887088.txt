Ok I hit my 30â€™s and had a baby and boy did those fine lines and wrinkles started showing. I wish I had heard about this way earlier. Its so easy to use, the app guides you through everything. I am too chicken for botox so this is a great way to take care of those fine lines. After first use your face feels amazing. My skin was glowing. Highly recommend this to anyone!
