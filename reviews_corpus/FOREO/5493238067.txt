I got my UFO a few weeks back with a lot of hesitation because of the price and the obvious question is it worth it. I bough this guy on sale from the Sephora app and boy I’m glad. Breakdown APP : maybe it’s bc I’m tech savvy that I take it for granted but I don’t get why people hate it so much. With all the settings they have its would be a nightmare to have so many buttons on the machine. Plus once you set your fave mask you don’t even need to open the app. MASK - I only tried 4 and so far so good . Each mask comes with a lot of product so much that from one mask I get two days with it. I bought thin baby cotton wipes that I cut into circles and with the remaining product from the nigh before BAM I get another treatment.. UFO - my skin feels 10 years younger, it’s fast, the thing heats opens your pores let’s in all the goodies then cools down (my favourite). In terms of the lights I don’t know how effective they can be since you don’t need to wear eye protection but hey! one can hope with long term use it could bring some benefits. in my humble opinion it’s worth it. I have seen a difference in my skin, my makeup is looking bomb and last but not least It’s a time saver it’s overall wonderful experience. UFO = Ur Future Obsession — yup …nailed it
