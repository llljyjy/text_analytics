To be fair, the product does the job I guess. Since I was losing weight and using this machine at the same time, my face was smaller by either reason.The thing is, my mini bear ran into issue. It turned on automatically and no way I could turn it off, it was really annoying since I carried it to the office, it ran loudly for hours until out of battery (this is a popular issue that a lot of people get, so think carefully about purchasing this). When I talked to Foreo, they allowed me to return and get a new one. All I needed to do was sending the machine back to their company in US. But since I purchased not through Foreo’s website, I had to pay shipping fee out of my pocket. I reached out to Sephora and asked if they could ensure the warranty policy. But everything they told me was apologizing and couldn’t give me any support. If Sephora can not ensure the warranty policy for customers, they should stop selling those products of the third party. Please let customers purchase from someone else that has better customer support. PLEASE! Don't buy unless you don't want to use warranty
