I love this! It makes the whole cleansing experience just better! It feels good like a soft massage. It makes my skin feel softer and cleaner when I use it. It turns off on its own after a minute, which is fine. But I’d rather use it as long as I need then just turn it off myself. I think the price is a little high. It doesn’t do anything that a $25 comparable product from Amazon wouldn’t do. love it!
