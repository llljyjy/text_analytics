Complimentary from Foreo. I recently discovered micro-current devices and decided to include them in my routine. I wanted to try it as a preventive measure and help lift and firm the skin of my face. I have tried another brand, but I found it a bit painful, which didnâ€™t occur with The Foreo Bear. This one glides smoothly on the skin, and it is very easy to use and hold. The app that provides the different routines is also easy to use and makes the device beginner-friendly. I think this is a great device, and I love the results I am starting to see. My skin feels and looks firmer, and my fine lines are less noticeable. Easy to use
