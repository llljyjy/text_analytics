I incorrectly assumed they would be sheet masks but they are actually pouches of a serum. A single pouch lasted me a few nights and they really helped for my dry skin. The cold and dry climate had my skin cracking but these packs immediately helped nourish my skin. Good product overall! not a sheet mask
