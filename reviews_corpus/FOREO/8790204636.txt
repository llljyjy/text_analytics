This device was gifted by Foreo. I have been using this 4-5 days now and I’m super impressed! I was so excited to receive this because I love beauty products, especially high tech and anti-aging products. This device is great for anyone who wants something that helps with multiple signs of aging like fine lines, wrinkles, etc. I love how it connects to your phone and has videos that show you exactly how to hold and move device. I do see a small difference afterwards in my cheek area. It definitely looks more lifted. I can also say my skin looks more toned overall. I look forward to using this device every night, it’s like my own spa/me time! I know it’s pricey, but it’s worth it 100%!! Pricey, but totally worth it!
