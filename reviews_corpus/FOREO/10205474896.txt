Love that this Foreo Bear Facial Toning device that was gifted by Foreo targets signs of aging like wrinkles and fine lines that are obviously showing in mine already.The microcurrent from this device also helps achieve a lofted and glowing skin. I totally enjoy the Bear’s guided microcurrent facial routine treatments in the Foreo App. This feels relaxing and my skin felt rejuvenated after using it. I will still have to see how it could help in long term. It’s a little pricey for it’s price tag of $299 but it can be a good investment (or gift to yourself ) for skincare loving person like me. Such a nice facial toning device
