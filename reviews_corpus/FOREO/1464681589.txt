As someone who owns a competitor device to the FOREO bear, I was really excited to see how they compared. At first, I was kind of annoyed that this seemed to only work with the Foreo app (you can use without but it doesn’t have the same options) but I actually kind of enjoy just following the treatment video, it seems to make it go by faster and keeps you on track with how many strokes across your face and where. I also like that there are multiple routines to follow. I find the FOREO bear very easy to hold and maneuver across your face compared to others. It doesn’t zap much, even though I am using on the highest microcurrent level. As long as you use the proper amount of gel, you’ll be good! I love that this vibrates as well as provides microcurrent because it kind of feels like a little massage. I can’t wait to see my results over time, and this is an easy device to stick with! Only downside is this comes with enough microcurrent gel for about 1 treatment. You have to buy it at the same time or you won’t have any to use! Wish it came with a small tube, at least with a week’s worth. Maybe better than Nuface?!
