The Bear was gifted by Foreo for reviewing purposes and I have mixed feelings about it.The device is supposed to target first signs of aging such as fine lines. The micro-current technology it uses is well researched and shows improvements in that area. However, using a device by yourself without a professional present might not show the same results.The Bear is easy to use. Once you download the app, you fill out a quick questionnaire which determines your device setting. Then you can follow along different video demonstration for various treatments which all last around 2.5 minutes. I like using the Bear - it feels like a nice facial massage. However, I didn’t see any immediate results after treatments (which is usually the case if you see a professional). My hope is that I will see a difference in my fine lines with longer, continued use and my guess is also that the app always “airs on the side of caution“ and recommends lower settings that aren’t as powerful (which of course is favorable!). On a scale from 1-10, I started with a 4 and hope to increase slowly over time to see more results. easy to use but no immediate results
