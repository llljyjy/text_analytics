I’m loving the new Foreo Luna 4 for Balanced Skin and so is my skin! I use it morning and night and it works perfectly with my face washes. The large size is perfect for cleansing my whole face and cleanses perfectly with its silicone touch points that are cleanse in 3 modes and 5 massaging routines. I love that it’s so customizable and the ease of using the app is amazing as well. My skin feels so soft, clean and fresh after use. I love the silicone because it stay cleaner and is better for my face. This is my new favorite face tool and totally recommend. New favorite face tool!
