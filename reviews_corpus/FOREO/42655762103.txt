As a person who has tried multiple cleanser devices from competing brands, Foreo is definitely one of the best. It has the softest silicone bristles that make me feel super nice and gentle on the skin. I also love to use it for facial massage. There are multiple massage modes that targeted different facial areas. It helps my muscle destress and relax. I think it is a good investment. nan
