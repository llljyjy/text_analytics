First of all, I like how compact it is and how easy it makes to travel with. It glides very easy when using the conductor serum. I always glide it upwards, from the center to the sides of the cheeks, and around the lips.The app is also easy to use and follow and the device will be ready in just a few minutes. Creating an account and linking the device was easy and fast. I like that you can either do your own facial or you can follow along 3 different kinds of facial massages. They’re very easy to follow and work the whole face.I don’t notice any tingling or any discomfort. I do see some results in firmness immediately after each use. I have been using this for a few days and I can’t wait to see longer term results. Great facial at home!
