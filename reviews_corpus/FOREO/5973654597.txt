This is my first ever facial toning device so I was super excited to try it when gifted by FOREO. Iâ€™ve used the foreo luna, which is more like a gentle deep cleanser. This made my skin feel very relaxed, less puffy and more bright. The app is cool too, makes the experience feel more personalized with different routines versus me just winging how to use it lol. Expensive but definitely works! Effective Toning Device! Very pleased!
