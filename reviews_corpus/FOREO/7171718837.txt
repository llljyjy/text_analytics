Review is for the actual device not it’s sheet masks - I love the device a lot. It is everything you need for a mini at home facial to enhance the experience and effectiveness of your products. I don’t think the masks that it comes with or that you buy for it are anything special but you can use it with any serums or your own sheet mask and it works  amazing device Get it while you can
