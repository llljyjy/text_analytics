This Foreo for combination skin makes such a big difference in the way I clean my face. It deep cleans my skin, removes dirt, oil and makeup and cleans my pores and after cleansing I can use my favorite serum with the Luna 4 for a firming massage. I love how easy it is to use, navigate and customize the different cleansing and massaging settings. It has regular, gentle and deep cleansing modes and five firming massage routine to choose from - lymphatic drainage, shiatsu, deep tissue, trigger point, and reflexology massage and they all feel so relaxing. The app is easy to set up. The design makes it so comfortable to hold and move the device around my skin. It does not only deep cleanses my skin in a gentle way but prepares my skin for massaging my skin with my favorite serum. My skin feels so clean, soft, and smooth afterwards and just looks radiant. It enhances my skincare routine and I highly recommend this Luna 4 for combination skin. Enhances my skincare routine
