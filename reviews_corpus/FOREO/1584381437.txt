I love trying new products as much as the next skincare addict, but there are few things that are compelling enough for me to write a review about. This little device is amazing. I have been using it daily for about two years and I can’t say enough positive things about it. Over time, it is truly effective at diminishing the appearance of fine lines and the treatment time is quick enough for lazy days. I am also impressed with the device’s longevity and battery life. I’ve only have to charge it a couple times since I got it. This is an essential part of my skincare routine. Love my Foreo bear!
