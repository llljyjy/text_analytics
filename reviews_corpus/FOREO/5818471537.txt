Major disappointment. This thing is a tech nightmare. Doesn’t connect half the time (and who wants to be tied to an app when you’re trying to unwind???). Doesn’t work in offline mode 90% of the time. 90 seconds for the treatment? That’s not relaxing. Or effective. The masks are meh - I get more hydration and glow from a $4.99 drugstore sheet mask. Save your money. Their Bear is worth it. This one...all hype. I'm high maintenance. My beauty tool shouldn't be.
