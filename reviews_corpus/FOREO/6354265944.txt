I’m familiar with microcurrent (have used the nuface before) so I felt like I knew what to expect with this one. Compared to that, I prefer using my FOREO mini bear. This device has more options for treatments — for example, you can set the level of microcurrent from very mild to very strong as well as whether you want it to vibrate too. I really appreciated this feature as it feels like I can actually customize it to my exact needs. nan
