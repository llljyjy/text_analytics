This product was gifted by Foreo in exchange for my honest review. This is the first time I experimented with micro currents.  I was very excited to try this because microcurrents  are supposed to tone and shape your contour and reduce fine lines and wrinkles. This device has an anti shock system. I didn’t realize that you need to download the app in order to turn it on!The app has a few pre-set treatments. You use your device while following along with the video. There is a way to use this without the app once you initially download the app but I haven’t tried that yet. My thoughts:This is a convenient and time efficient alternative to going to the spa. The device fits comfortably and naturally in my hands. The video is easy to follow along. I find that it glides most smoothly if you use a lot of serum because some serums dry very quick and then there’s too much friction. For me, and maybe it’s because my skin is more sensitive, I felt quite a few zings. It doesn’t hurt, it’s more of a pin-stick feeling. I’ve been using this on the lowest current. I didn’t see any immediate results but my skin does feel much more stimulated and alert. I would recommend this to others who are into micro needling and micro currents.. For me, I’m not too comfortable using this after the constant surprise zings. Good device but not for everyone
