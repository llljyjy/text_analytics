I have been using this product for about 6 months now and I cannot say enough incredible things. I use this serum underneath my moisturizer and over my toner both AM and PM, everyday. Since starting this product, my face has drastically changed from the acne, cysts and red blotches to 80-90% clearer skin. Not only has it removed my acne, cysts and rough texture, but it keeps from new acne forming. Because of how much I use it, I have purchased about 10 bottles over a 6+ period. On a separate note, my acne was from a new birth control I started using. I recommend anyone who has sensitive skin, dry skin, acne prone skin or just wants to maintain healthy looking skin. Also to comment on the peeling/flaking of others comments, i do not experience any of that, but I do wait 1-2 minutes after applying my toner. 10/10 Highly Recommend this Product
