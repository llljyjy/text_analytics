I am a 24 year old Caucasian woman and for the first time in my life have been struggling with acne issues. I wasn’t sure where the problem was coming from other than possible stress, hormones, diet etc. I recently bought this and added it into my skincare routine and I am noticing a huge improvement. My bigger acne areas are closing up and others are healing quickly. My face is less bumpy in general. My skin seems to be glowing! My current skin care routine are these products Night time routine 1: wash face with L’Bri pure and natural “gentle cleanser.”2: wipe face with L’Bri pure and natural “gentle freshener.3: spray face with Lush “breath of fresh air” toner4: apply the Ordinary salicylic acid (this product)5: apply eye cream, overnight lip moisturizer. Go to bed.Morning routineSteps 1-4 of my nighttime routine. I am not a beauty professional and do not have much knowledge of skin care like some might, but this is what’s working for me right now! Amazing!
