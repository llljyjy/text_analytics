Love this line and love this product. However, make sure your sking is DRY before you put it on. Something about wet skin makes this product burn like heck! If you have sensitive skin, donâ€™t go the full 10 minutes, work your way up to it. I started with 5, but now I will leave it on up to 15 minutes. Makes your skin feel soft and smooth after using. nan
