I’m brown lady in my mid 30’s with blemishes/dark spots and I decided to give the ordinary a try. However, the ordinary did not work for me. I’ve been using it for over 6 months on a clean face and after facial steams but I don’t see any results. I also noticed when I use it use feel a burning sensation all over. I won’t be buying again not too ordinary
