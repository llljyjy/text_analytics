My favourite drugstore makeup removing cleanser has been discontinued and Iâ€™ve been on the hunt for an affordable one step makeup remover/ cleanser. This one is definitely it! Melts away makeup easily including mascara and rinses perfectly clean. I do wipe off the dissolved make up and excess product with a damp microfibre cloth which provides deeper cleansing/ exfoliation, (side note: the actual best face washing hack!! I purchased amazon brand, bulk microfibre house cleaning cloths that I use for washing my face only- so much more environmentally friendly than paper towel and way more sanitary than using the communal bathroom hand towel to dry your face!!) but the cleanser on itâ€™s own is perfectly sufficient at removing makeup and leaving the skin clean despite not being a foamy or super oily formula. It is a thick gel/cream that melts to a thin, slightly oily, gel consistency, devolves your makeup and then rinses clean. 10/10 would say buy this. And the bulk microfibre cloths. ðŸ˜˜ðŸ‘Œ So good!!
