For the price I can see why so many people love this serum, but if you have the money I would say go for something else. This formula pills up so badly on top of other products and even on itself. It does it’s job at getting niacinamide into your routine but if you can’t pair it with other products there’s no point to it having such a simple (cheaper) formula that’ll end up making your skin look worse from the added texture inelegante formula
