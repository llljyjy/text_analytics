I have very dry, sensitive skin and get acne breakouts (half are cystic). I don’t have many issues with The Ordinary products and love acid products. I rated this low since it didn’t do as stated and made me break out horribly.I used this in certain areas as a patch test. No issues or stinging when put on product. After about 5-6 days I had broken out where I put it. I think it’s the oil-- however it’s rare I break out like THAT. I’m just going to try the regular Salicylic Acid since I’ve never had an issue with AHAs and BHAs serums. Made me break out really bad
