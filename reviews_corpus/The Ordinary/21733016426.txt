I have been using this for almost two weeks. During the day, I later over CoQ10 and mix with a peptide moisturizer before applying makeup. At night, I later over a high concentration C serum, and a matrixyl serum. Then I follow with a thick layer of moisturizer. My nearly 53 year old skin looks supple, feels soft, and my formerly huge pores have vanished! Of all the products Ive used - from pricey Cle de Peau to Paulaâ€™s Choice -  this has made the biggest difference. Plays well with other products and, when mixed with a light moisturizer, works great under makeup. Amazing and thank you! Huge change in skin!
