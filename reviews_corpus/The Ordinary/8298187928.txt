I dont know why, but I love this product. I dont have anything in particular I was ’targeting’ when I first tried it, i just was buying a fleet of products for my first ’skincare regime’ in my thirties, and Ordinary was a cheap and accessible way to start that. I’ve stayed for this product and the Hyaluronic Acid and Moisturizer. It just feels better on my skin! I’ve actually even brought this camping with me, AND I CANT EXPLAIN WHY! So that in itself is, in my opinion, the review of a great product. I put it on before my HA and moisturizer, and it just feels Clean and Firm and lovely. One of the only things I use consistently
