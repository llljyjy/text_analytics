I use this every night before I sleep, and it helps a lot with my acne. It takes a while to absorb through the skin though, and it might still feel oily after hours. Sometimes when I’m too lazy to put on my moisturizer, I just use this instead before I go to sleep. It’s worth the price too! Good product, takes a while to absorb though
