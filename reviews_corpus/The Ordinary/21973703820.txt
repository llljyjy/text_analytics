I only used this two times and this was the only new skincare product I introduced. My skin broke out into 5 new juicy pimples that were really red and painful. I only used 3-4 drops the two times I used it. Would not recommend if you have really sensitive skin like me, but this has worked for a lot of people so I would still patch test this and start with once a week and monitor if you have any new irritation from it! This caused IRRITATION not PURGING (for me)
