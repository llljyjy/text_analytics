Effective, but leaves my skin oily. I see other reviews who rated it highly often use it before bed; that makes sense, because it would be impossible to put makeup on after this. Aside from leaving my skin oily, I will say itâ€™s effective! I have hormonal acne-prone skin and this moisturizes while managing breakouts instead of causing them. I would recommend this as a night-time moisturizing product to try if you have acne-prone skin; definitely not an anytime product. Leaves skin oily, but works well
