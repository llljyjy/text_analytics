I have puffy under eyes especially in the morning and my under eye skin is a little loose.  I have been using this products at least once a day sometimes missing a day here and there for about a month.  This is no miracle potion that will give you perfect under eyes and no one should expect that but I will say I have noticed a difference since using this product.  My eyes look less tired in the morning and my under eye skin is saggy it seems tighter and less puffiness.  This is a great product and a must have in my skin care routine. Wonderful product!
