I’ve liked all of the ordinary’s oils that I have tried but this one was disappointing. I have normal to dry skin so perhaps I’m not the target audience but I felt like this would be good for the hotter weather. However the texture of this feels like it’s not quite an oil and not quite a serum. It’s so runny that I have a hard time getting it on my face. Will definitely not be repurchasing. not a fan
