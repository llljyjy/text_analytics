I love this toner! It is a bit strong at first but I think it’s something your skin has to adapt to (at least mine did). I now use it every night after I cleanse my face and it doesn’t burn or string me (I know you’re not supposed to use a toner that much but it works for me). I think this is the sole product (combined with a SA cleanser) that has completely gotten rid of my hormonal acne and my skin looks more even. It also didn’t leave any sort of residue on my face like I saw someone mention in another review - but that’s my experience! It’s definitely worth trying out considering the price.
