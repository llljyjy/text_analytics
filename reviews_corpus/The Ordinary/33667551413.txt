Omg Iâ€™ve been using this thing for like a month now and I had REALLY bad skin and cystic acne and everything and this has done such a beautiful job cleaning it up I totally recommend it if it works for you and it doesnâ€™t have any funky smells or textures either. Love it ðŸ«¶ The first picture is the before and after so you can see :) ALSO PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use sunscreen if you donâ€™t your skin will peel and hurt like crazy (I recommend the Supergloop Glow Screen) <33 Works Wonders
