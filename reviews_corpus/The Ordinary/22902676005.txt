I intended to use this on my face but it collided with a lot of other acids I was using so instead I tried this on parts of my body where I had hyperpigmentation (arms, legs) and all I can say is that this stuff lightened those areas in about a month of consistent use. It is a cheaper/effective alternative to other lightening creams or serums that really donâ€™t so much. magic in a bottle
