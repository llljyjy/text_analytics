At first this was working great. Has promising results BUT whatever is in this formula puts a thick film over my face. I had to use a strong acid peel like to get it off. I thought it was a fluke so once I stopped peeling I tried it again tonight. I can feel that film starting back up right away. Usually love Ordinary but not this one. nan
