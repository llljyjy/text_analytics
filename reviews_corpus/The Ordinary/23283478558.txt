so confused by this product. i love the regular plant derived squalane but it did make my combo skin oily so i figured i’d try this. left my skin in literal flakes? after i put cerave moisturizer on top of it? i’ve never had that happen. i had to put 3 layers of this serum for it to even feel like there was anything on my face. so weird. this formula is like water. so liquidly it’d probably be better off mixed with a different serum or lotion not used on its own. definitely not a fan and will be going back to the 100% plant derived squalane. felt like nothing was on my face... in a bad way
