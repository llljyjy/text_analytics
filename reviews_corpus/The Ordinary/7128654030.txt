I have almost used a whole bottle of this up and have been enjoying it. It is nice and hydrating and leaves your skin feeling plump. I love that it has peptides, although I haven’t noticed much difference in fine lines. Maybe that’s something you have to keep using to notice more of a difference. I’m impressed that while this has HA it hasn’t dried me out in this dry climate. That’s something I have experienced with other HA. Overall, it’s great and would recommend and repurchase. Great serum!
