I purchased this awhile ago and didn’t really like it.  As some others have said, it made my skin a little itchy.  Since then, I’ve stepped up my skincare routine and implemented retinols and other acids into my routine.  I ran out of my usual toner, so I grabbed this one from under my sink until I could repurchase the other.  It doesn’t make my skin itch now that I’ve been using other resurfacing products for awhile and I actually like it.  SO, if your skin is sensitive or you don’t use other resurfacing products, be careful. nan
