This might sound like a joke but it’s not. Literally for days after I use this product my skin smells. My face smells like mushrooms and no matter how much I wash, I can’t get rid of it until it just goes away. This only happens with this product. I don’t find the product makes a difference for me either, but since I found out that this is the cause of the smell, I can no longer use it. Just awful. why does it make my skin smell like mushrooms?!
