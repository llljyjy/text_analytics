I’m glad that this seems to have worked for other people, but it didn’t for me AT ALL. If anything, this product caused more breakouts than it prevented. I used it for a month or two and noticed I was getting small bumps on my chin and forehead. I thought it was just an initial reaction and that my skin just needed to adjust, so I gave it more time. However, these breakouts just continued to get worse and didn’t go away. I have combination skin, and I think this product is just too oily for me. I wanted to love it, but it just isn’t for me. I won’t be buying this again. Caused more breakouts than it prevented
