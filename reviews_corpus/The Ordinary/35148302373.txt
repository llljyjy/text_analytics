I use this for my hair, and prefer it for my hair than using the full squalane molecule. my hair is low porosity, and type 4a so hemi-squalane is able to penetrate my hair pores and seal in water while also attracting more moisture from the air. In my desert climate, this is a must! I seal the hemi-squalane with a tiny bit of shea butter, my hair is super soft. curl pattern is maintained. can’t believe i haven’t been using simpler products like this before. love this TO product. 4a Hair Hydration Dream
