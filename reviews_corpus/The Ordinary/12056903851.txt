Love this stuff! And love the consistency. I have large pores and acne prone skin from my hormones and this did the trick! Within a week, my pores were clear, my pores were smaller and less noticeable, and my acne was getting clearer. I will always use this product in my skin care routine morning and night. It has a oily consistency so I recommend using at night and not under makeup but if you don’t use makeup during the day then I recommend using in the A.M. great stuff. It’s now my top 3 favorite product of all time. Great results and for the price you pay it’s definitely worth buying. You won’t know your results until you try. Love this stuff changed my skin for the better
