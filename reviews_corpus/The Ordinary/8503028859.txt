the 5-star review is specifically because i have very dry skin and this is super helpful for that. IF YOU HAVE OILY SKIN THIS WILL MAKE IT WORSE AND IF YOU HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH DRYNESS THEN THIS WONT DO ANYTHING FOR YOU!!!! but if you have dry skin this will quickly become your holy grail. definitely use this after cleansing and toner -- it will rub off any other products on your face. nan
