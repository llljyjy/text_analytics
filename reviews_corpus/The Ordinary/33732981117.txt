Love this!If I feel a pimple coming on, all I need to do is use this and one of two things happen either it goes overnight (doesnâ€™t develop) or it gets ripe for extraction by the next day and with continued use will be gone in a jiffy. It is oily and sensitive skin friendly however does sting a bit on the first use specifically around the eyes, under nose and other really sensitive area on the face. I then opted to use it only as a spot treatment Pimple Miracle
