I have been using this serum for over a year and can say I have noticed a huge difference in my skin. Overall texture and tone has improved. I do not have a significant acne problem, but my skin was a bit clogged and can be pretty sensitive so it is great to have a serum that I see noticeable differences with without irritating my skin.
