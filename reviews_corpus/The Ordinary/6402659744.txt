This ones good. I used this a few years ago and it’s antioxidant power was fantastic. I was fearful of the orange tint this has, but just made sure to top it off with a moisturizer and didn’t have too many issues. It’s smells a little odd but that’s nothing with what you’re ultimately getting. I finished this small bottle and had brighter tighter skin, something I could notice and a change I was impressed by. It does have a slightly oily texture but if you can find a good place to fit this into your skincare regimen, you won’t be disappointed. good things come in small packages
