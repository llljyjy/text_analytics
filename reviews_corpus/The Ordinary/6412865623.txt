I have been using this mask once a week, every week, and I can feel it make a difference. Every time I apply it, I feel a light tingle, not a sting. After 10 minutes, I rinse, and my skin is much smoother to the touch. I follow with toner, HA, and a heavier moisturizer to help set off the SA. I have oily skin, with period breakouts along the chin, and I do notice that it helps reduce the redness and the post-blemish scars. I wouldnâ€™t, however, use it more than once a week. I have purchased 2 tubes of this mask so far. Helps With Oily Skin
