This is my second time purchasing this product and I really enjoy it. I was STUNNED when my friend told me your supposed to WET your hands or face before putting it on for it to work. I was using it all wrong. Since then Iâ€™ve been applying it with water and my skin LITERALLY sucks it in. Love this product and use it almost everyday.Dry/dehydrated/sensitive skin. PUT IT ON WITH WATER!!
