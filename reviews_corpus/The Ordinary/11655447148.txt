I really love the feeling of this cream. It makes my skin feel very smooth and supple and I do feel like it’s mildly improved the redness and texture. I use it in combination with The Ordinary’s hyaluronic acid and natural moisturizing factors so I’m not sure which product I should credit most but it does feel very lovely. nan
