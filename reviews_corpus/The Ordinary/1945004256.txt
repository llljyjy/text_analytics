Great little peel at a fantastic price. I’ve used many high end AHA BHA, glycolic peel products from brands like Tata and drunk elephant. This product is comparable and really helps even skin tone and get rid of pesky trouble spots. For the price, you can’t beat it. I have acne prone sensitive skin and this did not cause my skin to peel. I do recommend a good moisturizer and facial oil afterwords as your skin is prepped and ready to drink it in. I use Caudalie Vino glycolic night cream and Tara Harpers facial beauty oil. Excellent
