My skin fortunately does not have a lot of issues, but I bought this because I wanted something to make my skin less dull and more smooth+brightened. I went a week without proper skincare because I was on a trip, came back and used this 3 times a week, and I saw noticeable difference within the first week! My skin feels much smoother, and my pores became less noticeable. It does sting a tiny bit, has a sour smell, and leaves peels on my skin, but since it is supposed to be use at night, those did not pose much inconvenience for me. nan
