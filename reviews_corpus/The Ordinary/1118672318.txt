Heard this was good for dry heels and underarm hyperpigmentation, and it is! It transformed my feet, it’s better than moisturizing, foot masks, or the physics exfoliates I’ve tried. Only tried on the face twice and while I can’t tell if it’s doing anything there, it wasn’t irritating. So pleasantly surprised by and happy with this product. amazing for body!
