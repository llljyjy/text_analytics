This is my go to face mask whenever I have a breakout! It completely dries out the problem areas and find my skin feeling fresh and clear almost immediately rinsing off and even more the next day!! Donâ€™t walk RUN to this product!! I have sensitive skin but this mask does not irritate my skin at all. Originally I put it all over my face, but now I target my problem areas and spot treat them. Both worked well for me! Great for Breakouts!
