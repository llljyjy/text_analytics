I have to update my beauty profile but essentially I have extremely dehydrated skin. So parched that product tends to just sit on top of my skin and do nothing. I use other products with squalane so I figured it couldn’t hurt to try this out. My. Skin. Is. So. HAPPY!! I use this in conjunction with the Sephora Pineapple sheet mask serum (I squeeze the leftovers into a dropper bottle) and HOLY. COW. My skin loves it. I know the bottle says nighttime application but I do not care. I use it at night AND in the AM after a water cleanse. I have noticed that it definitely works best on warm, damp, straight out of the shower skin, but not so much so that it is a one-trick pony. It’s the 5th of my 6 step skincare routine I usually top it with Belief Moisture Bomb moisturizer. I haven’t noticed any pilling or melting with the addition of this to my routine.  Definitely works for gua sha or rollers if you use those in your routine. It sits pretty heavy on my skin, but in the best way. Like an all day experience of those first 10 minutes after a shower where you’re a hydrated, dewy and plump before everything is soaked up and dries down a bit. Also did wonders for my lips which suffer horribly all winter. I even rub it into my cuticles for a lil extra hydration. It’s definitely a forever product for me. Exactly what I needed
