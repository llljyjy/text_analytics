This needs to come to Canada!!!! When I was in the US I bought a few bottles and love it. I have light skin with rosacea so I have to be careful using it. My first time using this, because of my skin type, I only put it on for 3 mins then built up to 7 over time. I will only apply a light face oil on after. Ordinary rose hip face oil. Feels great and gives a smooth soft look/feel. nan
