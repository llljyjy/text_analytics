Best serum ever. Started using this years ago and have been on and off ever since. It’s the first niacinamide I ever tried and it helped with my acne & complexion so much. Only con I have is sometimes it seems like the percentage of niacinamide is too high? My skin stings some days which is why I’m on and off with this serum. It’s less irritating if I use it after a hydrating toner though. Still this is such a good serum for such a low price. nan
