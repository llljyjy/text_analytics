Yes, another Holy Grail. Not only is this a fantastic oil, it’s a multi-tasking one as well. It has replace several products for me. A little goes a long way so I also use it on my arms and legs after showering and they’re soft as a baby, even the next morning. It only takes a minute to absorb and you can get dressed straight away.  All I can say is try it. It’s always a good idea to do a patch test before using full face. The only thing wrong with this, it needs to come in a two (2) ounce size., please. Holy Grail
