I keep finding myself trying to use this product even though I can’t stand the smell and it gets me every time. I can’t work up to trowing it away yet but I always end up washing my hair out minutes after applying. If you have a sensitive nose, I would stay away from this. I wish I could have lasted longer to see results. nan
