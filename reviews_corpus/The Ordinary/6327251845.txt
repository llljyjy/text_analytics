I can’t use their niacinamide serum (or really any of their other serums) because my skin is sensitive and it causes me to break out. I thought I’d give this a try and it’s amazing. I wash my face with a gentle soap, tone with witch hazel, and apply this mixed with organic aloe gel. When no longer tacky (that’s the aloe), I top with the hemi-squalane. My skin texture has improved drastically and my insanely oily skin is much more balanced. I’ve been using this for about 7 months now and still on my first jar. I’m also comfortable going out with less/no makeup for the first time in over 20 years. Great investment. Great for oily / sensitive skin
