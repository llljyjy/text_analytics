I got this bc I was trying a whole brand new skin care regimen and it had great reviews. The smell didn’t bother me too much. The first time I used it I definitely noticed it, but I’ve been using it for over a month now and can’t tell at all. I took off one star because it seems to get kind of goopy? Not sure how to describe it. At night I put my vitamin c moisturizer on, and then I apply this oil. I’ve tried applying it immediately after my moisturizer, and I’ve tried letting it dry before applying the oil, and it still seems to mix weird with my moisturizer, causing little balls to form all over my face. It’s not ideal, but it’s not terrible. Maybe I’ll try a different brand after this one. You can see in the photo, some of the ball mixture is in my hair. But overall my skin has been looking great, so I have to give some credit to this product. nan
