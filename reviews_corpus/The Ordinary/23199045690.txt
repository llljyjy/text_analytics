The first few times I used this mask as directed I wasn’t that impressed. But then one time I put it on just the areas where I had breakouts, and I accidentally fell asleep with it on for about 4 hours, and in that time it significantly improved my breakout! I’m talking the pimples shrunk like half their size! Now, instead of putting it on my entire face for 10 minutes, I put it on just the areas I need, like a spot treatment, and leave it on for 4-5 hours during the day while I do chores around the house. It works like magic and that way it doesn’t dry the rest of my skin out. I just finished the mini I had originally bought and I’ve already ordered the larger size! GOOD AS A MASK, AMAZING AS A SPOT TREATMENT
