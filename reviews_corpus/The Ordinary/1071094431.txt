This is a gentle exfoliating serum that I alternate with 10% Lactic Acid + HA that doesn’t cause my sensitive skin to react. FYI - This serum is not oily if you read and follow the directions. A couple of drops spread across palms, then patted or lightly pressed into skin provides just the amount you need and it absorbs quickly. For those who said it made them break out, it’s likely just you’re congested skin purging. As with all of The Ordinary’s products, simply follow the directions and try using less product and see what a difference it makes. A gentle, yet effective treatment
