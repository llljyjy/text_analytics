I have been using this on my face and legs for a weeks now and it has really made a difference. The keratosis pilaris on my legs is significantly improved and hopefully with time it will help fade the pigmentation scars from it. On my face I have noticed a reduction in my acne, some of the pigmentation and scar tissue from acne and the overall texture of my skin. It is fairly strong so I would recommend starting slow and spot testing your skin to see how it reacts. Love this product!
