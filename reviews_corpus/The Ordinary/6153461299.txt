I regularly use AHA/BHA’s and Tretinoin in my skincare routine and the recent addition of The Ordinary’s Rose Hip Seed Oil as my last step for morning and night is a game changer. My dry, sensitive and often reactive skin, soaks in this dry oil and feels hydrated and replenished without breaking out. This product has made a noticeable difference to my moisture barrier with consistent use. Perfect pairing for chemical exfoliating.
