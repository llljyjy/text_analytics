Gets the job done! Melts sunscreen, foundation, and my waterproof mascara all at once. I rub between my hands to warm it up and to turn it into an oil. Then I massage it all over my face, concentrating on my eyes last. When I get to my eyes, I hold my hands on top of my closed lids so the oil can loosen up the mascara, and then I gently massage to melt it away. I use this as my first step in my double cleanse. Bonus that itâ€™s affordable! Love this for first cleanse!
