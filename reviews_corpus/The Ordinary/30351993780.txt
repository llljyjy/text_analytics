Absolutely amazing. I can tell when I run out and miss a few days - I’ve started stocking up a couple bottles at a time. When I run out, my skin starts to show a little more roughness and, depending on the time of month, my face definitely begins to break out. I honestly don’t know what I would do without this product, it’s saved my skin from nasty little forehead whiteheads, painful cystic breakouts, and blackheads on the nose. It’s affordable and it works. Plain and simple. Only complaint is that it does tend to run out often. Makes sense... Amazing. Affordable and works, plain and simple.
