I really love this serum. It does pill if you use it on top of other products. I got around this by applying this first and then other products on top and it doesnâ€™t pill. It is also hydrating, I ran out of moisturizer and other products, the only product I had left was the vit c serum so I used that and my skin still felt very moisturized all day and never got dry or flaky. if it pilled read this review and try again!
