Game changer! I can’t compare to the bioessence squalane, but this stuff is magic. It is so silky, luxurious feeling, and absorbs well into the skin leaving it very plump and hydrated. If you’re anyone who uses glycolic/BHA/AHA acids or retinoids, or just suffers from any dryness, I suggest using this to follow up after those treatments. Ironically I am an oily skinned girl, with periods of dryness from treatments. This solves that problem & balances my skin. Just buy it! magic
