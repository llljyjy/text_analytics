This product is amazing (for the price point)! For silky for a toner to touch and easily applied! It smoothens my skin texture and relaxes my skin slightly before applying a serum. I personally don’t expect a toner to completely renovate my skin so this is a great option for a very reasonable price! Considering it is a glycolic acid I was concerned it might dry my skin out (and I am also using retinol since 1 month adding extra dryness), but it didn’t! Definitely give it a try:) Great product for a great price
