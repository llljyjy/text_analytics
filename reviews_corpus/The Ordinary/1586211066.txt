Love this!!! I use tons at night under my moisturizer, especially if Iâ€™m using retinol or a sulfur acid at night (which boosts collagen). I wake up with the most amazing plump skin. Great for winter in daytime too. I had horrible acne scars for years and now my skin is totally clear and healed. I feel this, a great moisturizer and a retinoid at night has made my skin amazing. Cannot recommend enough. Great for the neck too. I use a lot of it daily but have tons left. Its lasting really long and is a great price. Best face oil!!
