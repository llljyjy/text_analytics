I’ve tried many The Ordinary products over the last 2 years (for dull skin, general aging, and hyperpigmentation) and this one by far makes the most noticeable difference, the fastest. Only a couple days of use and my skin looks brighter and more even-toned. I’ve been using this product on and off for about 6 months now and when I remember to use it, my skin always looks and feels better. If you buy one product for the ordinary, this is the one! I have sensitive skin and this does have a slight tingle to it, I always dilute it in The Ordinary’s Natural Moisturizing Factors (my other favourite product of theirs). If u buy 1 product from The Ordinary - this is it!
