I usually am a huge fan of peels and exfoliants. My skin can handle a lot including high doses of retinol. However, not this. I tried this for a month straight two times letâ€™s week and I wake up with a breakout every time as well as do not seeing a positive change in my skin.  Although I love the ordinary Brand I think this is just one product my skin does not like. nan
