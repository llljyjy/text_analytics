I LOVE this cleanser. I wish it came in a bigger bottle. I have dry/combination skin and this makes my face feel so smooth and moisturized after, but definitely not oily by any means. It feels healthy. I’ve tried so many cleansers and this one is by far the best for my skin. It doesn’t have any scent to it and removes makeup (even mascara) really well. Doesn’t burn your eyes either. HOLY GRAIL - wish it came in a bigger bottle
