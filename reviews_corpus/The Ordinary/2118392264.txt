This product definitely does what it says it does. But it is a very potent acid solution, so you need to really make sure you follow directions. I made the mistake of using the solution while my skin barrier was compromised from retinol and my skin had been extremely dry and was peeling a lot. The moment I put on the solution, I felt something in between a burning sensation and tingling, which I wasn’t exactly sure what it was because I have a high pain tolerance, but as I waited a few minutes, it was definitely pain. I removed it right away, but in some areas the product ended up traveling deeper into my skin, causing a mild burn. I applied aloe right away and all the redness disappeared by the morning, but it looked more like I got a chemical peel done professionally than a home treatment. My skin became darker in those ’deeper traveled’ areas and has been peeling the past couple days. My skin texture is a lot smoother after the dry patches peeled off eventually, but I don’t think you’re supposed to have a full peeling experience according to other reviews. Does what it says, but be careful!
