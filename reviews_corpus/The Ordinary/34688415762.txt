I have super dry sensitive skin, and this stuff is amazing! My skin has never been this soft and moisturized before! I use a 2-3 drops after I apply my moisturizer and will use it all over my body by mixing about 3-4 drops with my lotion. It took me about 5-6 months to finish a whole bottle I finally have moisturized skin!
