Iâ€™ve always said that The Ordinary had great access to active ingredients/acid exfoliants at an amazing price point, and this toner is no exception. I find this toner to be a great entry item for people new to acid exfoliants and it gives great, glowing, results. I use mine about 2/3 times a week or whenever I feel like my skin needs a boost. It adds glow, smoothness, and refines texture after just a few uses.Those with sensitive skin may need to be careful, as with any exfoliating product. I love using a ceramide cream and face oil after to help restore and nurture the skin. Gentle + effective exfoliants for newbs and vets
