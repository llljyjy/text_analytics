The first day of using this I broke out bad. I’m prone to getting fungal acne and it triggered it badly. Which is odd because the reason I purchased this product was because of the ingredient list. So at first I thought maybe it’s just me and not the product. But the recent reviews purchased the product the same time as me and had the same break out results. So yeah I agree it breaks you out. not fungal acne safe
