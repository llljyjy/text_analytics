I have extremely sensitive acne prone skin, and I have to be really picky about products that I choose. Recently I had been suffering with acne flare up and I thought of trying The Ordinary skincare. The mandelic acid has proved to be extremely helpful in my recent acne journey and I definitely recommend both mandelic acid and niacinamide from TO to anyone who has sensitive acne prone skin. The pictures that I have attached are one month apart! Acne Killer!
