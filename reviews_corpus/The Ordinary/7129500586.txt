I’ve been using NMF twice a day for over a year now and my skin still loves it! I have very oily, acne-prone skin that is extremely sensitive. I had been using cera ve cream before this, but my skin started to break out with it over time. I’ve had no irritation so far with this, which is really saying something for me! Natural Moisturizing Factors has a wonderful almost cloud-like texture that sinks in and makes my skin so soft without being too heavy or greasy. The first day I used it my husband touched my face and complimented how soft my skin felt. If you have sensitive skin and want a simple, affordable, lightweight daily moisturizer I would definitely recommend! It pairs great with serums, oils, and sunscreen too.My current AM routine is squalene cleanser, buffet serum, niacinamide + zinc, NMF, and The Ordinary spf. If I want a little extra moisture in the winter I’ll add a drop of argan oil before spf and it blends in perfectly. At night I use squalene cleanser, Inkey List BHA cleanser, buffet, NMF, prescription tret, and lock it all in with rosehip oil.For the first time in my life I’m getting compliments on my skin, and it’s pretty affordable too! It’s been a bit of trial and error but focusing on moisturizing (especially when using actives like BHA and tretinoin) has made a big difference. My Go-To Moisturizer
