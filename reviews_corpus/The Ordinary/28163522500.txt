I absolutely love this product, but I will say for new beginners. Be careful at first my skin felt like on fire the very first couple of times but now my skin has no reaction to it ￼ for people that are not used to putting strong exfoliating skin products on their skin. I strongly recommend to leave it on for at least 60 seconds instead of the full five minutes. ￼ Love it but be careful
