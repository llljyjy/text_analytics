So, I have used this after looking for a basic exfoliating product and was recommended this. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great product! But it is the kind of strong stuff that medical aesthetician’s use when they talk about a chemical peel. I personally feel that even with proper application with gloves, it still is way too strong to be sold to the public. Even when I applied it very sparingly with gloves and followed up properly with sunscreen and moisturizer afterwards; I can sufficiently say that it damaged my skin barrier. I’ve given this product over a month or two, yet anytime I try to use it after giving my skin a break I still damage my skin barrier. Stuff is STRONG, be careful!
