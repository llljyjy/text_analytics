I enjoy light moisturisers; however, they’re not enough for my dry skin. I add this squalane after using my moisturiser and it’s perfect. I use five drops before I go to bed and I wake up with soft but not oily skin. I’ve tried using three drops and it’s simply not enough.This is a heavier oil than Biossance, but those with dry skin/wanting hydration will enjoy this quite a lot. Overall, amazing price and stellar product. Perfect hydration for my dry skin!
