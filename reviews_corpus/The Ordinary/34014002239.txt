My skin was quite dry in the winter, and this serum has revitalized it, making it look less fatigued and helping to lessen the appearance of wrinkles. I apply it in the morning and evening after washing my face for the greatest results. I have rosacea and dermatitis on my face, so I was concerned that it would irritate my skin, but it has worked perfectly for me. LOVE it!
