I’ve used anything you could ever think of from Neutrogena, CeraVe, Keihls, Clay masks, drinking water, St. Ives, and so much more to get rid of my acne and nothing has worked. I heard a lot about the ordinary and I thought it wasn’t gonna work either but I decided to give it a go. GIRL WHEN I TELL YOU THIS STUFF DOES WONDERS I MEAN IT!!! Because I’ve only been using this for like a week and I already see results, i am beyond impressed with this product, and the fact that it’s only $7 like what!!! nan
