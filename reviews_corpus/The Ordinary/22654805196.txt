I bought this toner a few days ago and used it about 2 hours ago AND WOW! I suffer from super dry skin, strawberry legs and those hard to get rid of bumps on my arms. After using it, I had run my hand across my leg and the amount of dead skin that came off was crazy! The product is a little sticky feeling on the skin which some people might not like but from what I have seen so far this stuff does it’s job and it does it well! It doesn’t sting or agitate my skin at all! Dry skin? Strawberry legs? Here’s your solution!
