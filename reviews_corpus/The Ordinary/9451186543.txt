If you have acne prone skin, while still being dry - this serum is a godsend. It melts into your skin like butter, I like using it at night mixed into my moisturizer before using an oil, and let me tell you I wake up with glowing skin that is smooth, radiant, and plump. No stinging, no “tightening”, and I have no fear of it drying my skin out or clogging my pores. Where my dry skin acne prone ppl at!
