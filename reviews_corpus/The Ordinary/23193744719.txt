I wanted a product that can help with my pores and at the store it was recommended I try this product. The employee also advised me to use a little bit of water because of its thickness when applying. I like that it feels like a shield at night when I’m sleeping. In the morning, its very shiny and even after washing my face, I can still see the shine. Within 24hrs my skin is back to normal. I don’t feel it does much for my pores BUT it helps with redness and acne. I get a few pimples usually around my period and this takes care of them. I only use this product 1-3 times a week but I love it. After 24hrs of use, my skin looks brighter and clear. Good for redness/acne
