I’ve tried a few products from The Ordinary and they’re really good and affordable. So I decided to try their Bit C. I’ve been using it for about a week and it doesn’t irritate my skin. What I don’t like is that it kind of peels off with anything I put after, like my moisturizer and SPF. I’ve tried mixing it with the moisturizer and it happened too. nan
