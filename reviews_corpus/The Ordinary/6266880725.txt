I find this way too harsh for my face, even though I have “rhino skin” that is used to regular chemical exfoliation.However, I do think this is a great, inexpensive option for bacne or keratosis pilaris (“KP” or “strawberry skin”) on the body. The trick is to put a spray pump on the bottle and regularly spray on those larger body areas right after a shower. Make sure you let it dry down, as it is pretty sticky upon first application. Good for bacne or KP, but not face
