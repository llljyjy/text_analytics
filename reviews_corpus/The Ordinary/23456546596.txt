This is a serum I ALWAYS have, regardless if I’m at home or traveling. If My skin is ever feeling severely dehydrated or irritated, this is what I reach for. Pairing this with a hydrating toner/essence and hydrating moisturizer is a must during the dry winter months or after a day in the sun during the summer. It plumps up my skin and pulls that hydration in to my skin with ease. The only con of this serum is that it can be a bit tacky/sticky if you use just a bit too much. Since I use it quite regularly I haven’t had this issue in a long time. Always have it on hand
