I’ve only used this product once which was last night, and wow I can already tell a difference. I noticed my skin is brighter and seems smoother just after one application. It does have a granular feeling to it which is slightly offputting, but I don’t really mind since it works. I’ll continue to use it nightly during my skincare routine. works for me!
