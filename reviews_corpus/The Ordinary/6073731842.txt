Itâ€™s another win for the price! Using this product in blackhead heavy areas really helps clear and unclog. I use it biweekly alongside the ordinary AHA peel and see significant results in skin texture, pimples and overall appearance. Make sure to read instructions and use it only with a max 10 minute wear time. This is an acid, and using it incorrectly can damage the skin. Using it right? World of difference!! a great value product, read directions
