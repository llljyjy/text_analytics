Bought this product on The Ordinary’s website. Should’ve bought it on Sephora’s app! It helped a lot with dark spots and acne scars. It can be a little irritating at first but your skin will get use to it. It has a thick texture. It’s funny, I wasn’t use to it, but it okay for me. This product is more than affordable! Love The Ordinary :) Good for acne scars and more than affordable
