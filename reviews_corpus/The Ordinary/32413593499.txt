I’ve been using this product for just about two months now, and I’m finally seeing results. I dilute this with The Ordinary’s Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% serum, and it has shown decent results. My acne scars have faded a bit, and I’ve noticed a lot of my cc’s (closed comedones) on my forehead have disappeared. Overall, I’m satisfied with this product—especially for the price. Side note: I literally haven’t even used 1/4 of the bottle yet (and like I mentioned, it’s already been 2 months)! Would Recommend
