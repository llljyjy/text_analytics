This is the secret to saving money. Dissolve in water/gel formulas, or add some to a regular face toner and use it to bump up products with a high dose of this, you could use it for the body as well I would imagine. Good for all ages/skin-types to add glow and clear up some yucky blemishes naturally. Good $6 investment
