This is my first time trying azelaic acid and my skin loves this! I just finished the bottle. It calms down my inflammation and smoothed the texture on my face. I also noticed if I have an active breakout and apply this at night, its significantly decreased by morning. I haven’t noticed any brightening in my skin yet, but i’ve seen other benefits so I will re-purchase and stay consistent. I’ve only been using for about 4 weeks and I’ve heard this ingredient takes time to show improvement with post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Patience is key. I apply this mostly at night after cleansing and before night cream. Get this! Great for redness acne prone skin.
