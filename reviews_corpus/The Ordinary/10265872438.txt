This is a great for exfoliation. I’ve been using this for quite some time and repurchased it twice. I got a lot of scarring on my face two years ago. Once the open wounds healed it left some pretty intense hyper pigmentation. I really attribute this AHA BHA peel as one of main reasons why my scars disappeared quickly. Use according to the directions and make sure you follow up with appropriate skincare after. I’d recommend this to anyone looking to improve their skin texture, getting rid of hyper pigmentation, and trying to improve their overall skin health. I’d also recommend to use it over knees and elbows too! As a south asian woman who was very clumsy when I was little, I have thick, rough, and textured skin on my elbows and knees. It’s always been an area of concern for me and I’ve been trying to exfoliate it for years without seeing any improvements. This peel is starting to smooth it out. Will be consistently using this and seething how it goes. Try it on your elbows and knees
