This product doesn’t get enough love than it truly deserves. I actually find it very gentle, easy to use, and it does its job well. The texture is on the thinner side which is great because it works with all the other serums and creams that I pair it with. It hasn’t caused any breakouts or anything and the hydration is sufficient. Now does it make you 10 years younger and exceptionally glowy? No, but neither do the much more expensive counterparts. All in all I really like it considering the price and I will buy it again :) UNDERRATED
