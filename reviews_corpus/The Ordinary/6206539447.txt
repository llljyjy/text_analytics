I use this in combo with The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin and it keeps my skin moisturized and glassy BUT I really don’t like the scent and feel of this product. It smells like glue and leaves a sticky layer on my face. Right after applying this product I have to use a hyaluronic acid moisturizer to get rid of the stickiness. I’d recommend Inkey List’s niacinamide if you don’t want that glue smell. Sticky and smells like glue
