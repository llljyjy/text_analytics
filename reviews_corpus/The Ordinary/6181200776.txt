I love this cleanser in the morning. I can’t go without cleaning my face in the morning and this cleanser makes my face feel clean without drying it out and doesn’t leave an oily residue at all. I have only used it, in the morning or a night on days that I have not worn makeup. Bring scent sensitive, I appreciate that this product has basically no smell at all. It’s creamy, not very thick and rinses easily. Great for starting your day!
