A few months ago my skin was dehydrated. I was getting painful acne where my mask was rubbing on my jaw and chin. The oil production in my T-zone was out of control. I decided to make a change to try and clear up my skin concerns. I increased my water intake and started a skin routine 2x/day. After cleansing with Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser, applying TO niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, I mix a pea sized amount of this moisturizer with 5 drops of their 100% plant derived squalene serum. 99% of my acne has cleared up, my skin is softer than ever, my redness has improved and Iâ€™m no longer having to keep blotting papers on me 24/7. A really great, affordable moisturizer
