I was waiting on the Ordinary to reformulate their salicylic acid serum for EVER and I’m so glad it’s back! I use their niacinamide day and night, but I sometimes swap it with this SA serum and love it for keeping oil and dirt at bat. Plus if you have small breakouts or a pimple that’s coming to a head—it’ll knock it right out! Perfect for those nasty little pimples under the nose from wearing a mask. Super gentle serum for the daytime, absorbs quickly and not sticky at all. I use it also as a spot treatment, so I’m not sure how well it performs after 6-8 weeks of consistent use—that’s when the Ordinary’s products are typically most effective. Definitely worth the buy! I actually like this better than the Inkey BHA serum, which I was using pretty consistently before this. So glad this is back!!
