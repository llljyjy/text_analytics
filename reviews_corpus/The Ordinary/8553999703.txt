It didn’t di much for me, while the silky texture feels great, I can get over the slight smell it has and I didn’t feel it did much in terms of breaking down spf or excess sebum in my skin, I also felt that it left a weird layer on my skin. I tried it because it was affordable but definitely nit as effect as other pre cleans products. 🤷‍♀️ wouldn't recommend for makeup wearers
