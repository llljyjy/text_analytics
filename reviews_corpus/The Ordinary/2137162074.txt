This is my favorite product from The Ordinary hands-down. I have dry, sensitive acne prone skin. I use this mainly as a night serum. This is the first acne serum I have used that does not dry out my face to the point of peeling. It seems to have an oily consistency. This works wonders for my dry, sensitive skin. It clears and treats acne without drying out the skin. It  cleared the blackheads on my nose and forehead. The Salicylic Acid works as an effective exfoliator. I cannot frequently use peels or scrubs because they are too harsh for my skin. I have finally found an exfoliator that doesn’t cause irritation. It really clears out my pores. A few months of using this product has made my skin smoother, reduces blackheads, reduces skin congestion and reduces pore size. This product is GOLD. Because of the oily consistency, I find this product difficult to use with other moisturizers. I usually skip applying this product in the morning when I apply my normal moisturizer. When I apply this product at night, I only apply my eye cream and skip face moisturizer all together. To use with moisturizer, I recommend spot applying this serum to only the acne prone areas. I don’t recommend applying this serum under foundation. Can't Live Without It
