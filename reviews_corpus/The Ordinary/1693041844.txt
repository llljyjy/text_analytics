I’ve had pretty dry skin after accurate and it gets particularly dry in the winter. This is the only product that I’ve found actually makes a difference in my skin. It’s not greasy, which is perfect and yet it penetrates so well and I can feel a significant difference. And you cannot beat the price. I’ve tried high and end extremely expensive products. Who would’ve thought this simple and affordable little moisturizer would’ve done it. I add a drop of rosehip oil in the evenings and wake up nice and dewy. highly recommend
