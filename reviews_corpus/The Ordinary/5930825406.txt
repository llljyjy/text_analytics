My sensitive skin usually has a hissy fit when I use serums containing a number of ingredients or any SH at all.  I am so happy that has NOT been the case with this wonderful serum!  I have been using it at night only and after about a week my skin feels so supple and looks ever so slightly glowy.  All this and magical copper too -- what more could I ask for ... Merci BEAUCOUP, Deciem!
