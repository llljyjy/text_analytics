The Ordinary, and Sephora with the new ‘mini size’, has really done something underhanded with this new price increase. It was obviously planned because you can’t find a single mention of the previous price anywhere. The mini size is not new! It’s always been available…just at a different price! I’ve purchased this moisturizer for years and years. I use a lot of Ordinary products. This type of tactic really puts me off and I think I’ll probably move on. Thankfully there are so many cosmetic companies right now that something like a moisturizer can be easily replaced. Really….new ‘mini’ size
