As suggested by Dr. Mark Strom, I use 5 drops at a time for 10 minutes once or twice per week.  I am extremely pleased with the results.  My pores look smaller and smaller.  My skin looks more even and brighter with each passing week.  I also like that this product is quick to apply and easy to remove, so you can do it quickly before bed.  I always use a gentle cleanser the next day.  This works just as good as more expensive products I have tried that are messy to remove.  Iâ€™m keeping this in my skin care rotation for the long haul.  Look at this 39 year old baby skin!  (No makeup or beauty filter...just good lighting). 39 Year Old Baby Skin
