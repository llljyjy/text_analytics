I read that using this on your scalp would help with flakes and it DOES! I spray this on scalp and leave it on for 30 minutes before rinsing. Right now I use it about twice a week. Once a week, I use Fable and Maine’s scalp treatment oil after and it’s a god send. If you have dry scalp or just want some good exfoliation you should try this USE ON YOUR SCALP
