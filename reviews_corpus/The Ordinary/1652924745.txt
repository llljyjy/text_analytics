I bought this a few weeks ago and I absolutely adore this as a day serum. For the price, it works better than a majority of the expensive serums out there. I highly recommend it if you’re on a budget. The only critique I have is the scent. Perfect if you’re not big on scents because it’s not really scented but I find it does have a slight scent as I am very sensitive to scents. Amazing for Skin and Your Wallet!
