Purchased this on an impulse decision between inkey list and ordinary. I decided to go with this due to the price point and because it’s stronger than the inkey list vitamin c. I was put off by the texture at first. It made my face a bit red but never made me itchy or felt any stinging sensation. My face can be sensitive so I was surprised by this but maybe it’s also because I layer lots of serums before I applied the vitamin c. I read some of the reviews because I was planning to return due to the pilling of the product but I’ve changed my mind and I will just mix it with a different moisturizer to get rid of the gritty feel and hopefully less pilling will happen! Love the way it makes my skin feel and look brighter. Will definitely purchase again. great vitamin c but be aware of the 23% vit c
