Anybody paying $30, $40, $50+ for face moisturizer, please stop. This moisturiazer is gentle, never caused a breakout, leaves me moisturized all day, and best of all is on a drug store budget. It truly cannot be beat and I will suggest it to anyone who doesnâ€™t conflate cheap cost with lack of quality! Men + Women alike should try!
