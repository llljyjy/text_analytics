I found the best way to use this product was as an overnight face mask once or so a week. Great introduction to azelaic acid for treating acne. Very effective and not super dying. However you get what you pay for as far as the texture and it pills like crazy in the day. I’ve ended up switching to the Azelaic Acid from Paula’s Choice but I would totally go back to this one in a pinch. nan
