Not quite sure who recommended this to me but immediately upon applying my skin started to burn and and my face felt hot. It was the most uncomfortable feeling I’ve had using a skincare product. My skin is a bit sensitive so maybe that’s the problem. I’m sure it works for some but it’s definitely not the toner for me. Will be returning No Way
