I use this once a week only. It’s gentle and does does irritate my skin. My face looks beautiful the night of application. I do not use any other serums etc with this and only cleanse and moisturize to keep it simple. No issues. I’m thankful as previous chemical exfoliants were too harsh for my skin, dried me out and disrupted my skin barrier. I’m good to go now.m and have had no new breakouts. Good and Simple
