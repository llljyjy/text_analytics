A neutral, unremarkable moisturizer for a very good price. I use it as a non-greasy, hypoallergenic moisturizer for hands and face when I’m skin cycling and need something that won’t react with my skin. I stopped using it for a few years, bought it again, and remembered why I stopped using it; it doesn’t really stand out! But can’t beat that price. Basic moisturizer, nothing special
