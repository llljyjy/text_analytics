I love this stuff. Facial oils have always been best for my skin, but some of them get so expensive, or don’t absorb or provide lasting hydration for my skin. But this one checks every box. It’s perfectly moisturizing without being too heavy, and actually keeps my skin hydrated. The price is also perfect. I love this stuff. amazing for my combo skin.
