Saw a TikTok video a few weeks ago about how this girl was using it for her scalp, back acne, strawberry skin, and dark armpits. I originally bought this almost a year ago for my face, and it worked very well. After seeing the video, I tried it on my scalp and after a couple of weeks I have started seeing less and less dandruff after a few days of no wash (I try to wash my hair every 2 or 3 days to maintain health). I also tried it on my back and underarms and I have noticed such a big difference! 10/10 recommend. Whoever that girl was with the Tiktok, you are a genius. :D nan
