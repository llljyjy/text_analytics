This serum is great for occasional breakouts which I have mostly at summertime. I used to think that I am picking wrong moisturizer creams because they felt so heavy but when I put the serum on my skin before the cream, it makes the cream feel much lighter while you still feel moisturized and get that glow my skin never felt better
