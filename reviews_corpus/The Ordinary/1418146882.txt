I have older, dry, sensitive skin with some rosacea. This oil is great for use at night mixed in with my moisturizer or during the day when I am outside in cold weather. It has a very soothing feeling and leaves my skin soft, but not oily. It does have an odd smell, but that goes away quickly and doesnâ€™t bother me. Great for healing dry skin
