I’m in love with this product! It’s effective and affordable! Since the mask mandate, I struggle with surface acne. No matter what I did I could not clear my skin up. It would be clear for a day and then I’d have to put a mask back on. This product cleared that acne up in about 2 weeks. I use it once a day right before bed. I let it dry and then layer benzoyl peroxide over top. My face is clear and honestly looks better than ever! I’m definitely going to repurchase. Clears Mascne!! Make sure to follow directions
