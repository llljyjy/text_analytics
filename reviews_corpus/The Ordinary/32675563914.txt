I don’t like how greasy it feels on my face as I rub it in, but it sure does remove all my makeup in one go! Also it makes your eyes a bit blurry and foggy for a while afterwards. With a cleansing oil I find it’s more convenient than something like this as it is more slippery and easier to massage in. Also makes it easier to avoid eyes. I Prefer My Cleansing Oil :)
