I’m not sure if it was just me not using it for more than a few days, but I felt it didn’t do anything extra on the dry skin of my face fresh from face wash. I would have to quickly put the moisturizer quickly to get some hydrating feel. However, I know my friend has used this and had great reviews. So maybe this is one that you gotta persistently apply to notice. I think if you’re on a budget, then try it. nan
