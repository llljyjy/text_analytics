This is the second time in a row Iâ€™ve bought this serum, and it works wonders for texture and dryness. I used to struggle with having rough texture on my jawline, under the chin, and forehead, but after put this one, the stickiness dries down immediately, and I follow it up with a moisturizer. The price makes it a 10/10 serum. GREAT serum for skin texture from dryness!
