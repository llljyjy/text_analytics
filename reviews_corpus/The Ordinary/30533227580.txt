For background I have normal to dry skin but am prone to sebaceous filaments on and around my nose. I had used PCA’a nutrient lactic acid toner and found it was perfect for both of those skin concerns so I thought I’d opt for a more affordable lactic acid. I honestly wanted to love this but I feel it made no difference as far as my texture. It kinda just dried me out and made me feel sticky. I used up half the bottle but no difference. I have pretty good skin but I feel the ordinary is for teens/adolescents. Not ppl nearing 30. it’s a no for me :(
