Greasy, oily. This does not sink into my skin at all - just lays on top. Comes off on pillowcase during the night, leaving an oily imprint where I placed my head (I’m a side sleeper). Does come out in the wash. Saw no improvement to my skin after use (only used a few times, however).Surprisingly, didn’t break me out at all so that’s a plus. maybe it’s just me?
