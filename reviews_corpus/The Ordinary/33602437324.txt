This vitamin C is very gritty and doesn’t really absorb into my skin, it also isn’t good for layering products on top of it as this product makes it feel like anything you put on top of it just sits there and doesn’t absorb into the skin.I think I will just stick with a vitamin c serum instead. Not for me, doesn't absorb.
