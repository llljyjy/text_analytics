It’s okay for the price but not worth it for the percentage. Dermatologists recommend getting niacinamide serums that are 5% or below due to risk of irritation. I tried this and wasn’t really impressed. I find that when I use the ordinary, my skin breaks out more than expected and becomes irritated. Do not recommend any of the products. Additionally, the AHA BHA serum burned my face and made me breakout and destroyed my skin barrier :(((( nan
