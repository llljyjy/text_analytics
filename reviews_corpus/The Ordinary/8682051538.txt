I really enjoy this product. My skin care be very sensitive to active but i haven’t experienced that with this. I wake up the morning after using it with brighter skin and i’ve noticed a large improvement in my skin texture. I use it about 1-2 times a week. The only complaint I have is the smell, it has a rotten egg smell but it doesn’t linger. Another winner
