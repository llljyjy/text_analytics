3 stars because this stuff is so watery it’s difficult to spot treat with it. I may end up mixing it into an eye cream or serum to use it up. I had really high hopes for it but as I said, so hard to keep it from running right off my fingers when I try to apply it. Can’t say I’ve seen any big difference to my skin after using 1/2 the bottle. I do notice some sensitivity if I get too much of it in one area. meh
