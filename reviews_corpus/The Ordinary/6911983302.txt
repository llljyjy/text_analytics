My forehead used to be so tight with no lines. I wanted to use this as some sort of ’preventative’ measure. All it did was make my skin saggy, my forehead to fold into million fold when I raise my eyebrows and new lines to form. I have no idea how to reverse this and this is only after using it for around 10 days... I am very disappointed since I love ordinary products but this caused some damage I have no idea how to repair. Avoid
