I am so impressed with this product! I have struggled with hormonal acne for ten years—but the hardest part for me is the aftermath of the actual breakouts. I can’t see past the marks on my skin/it is hard to recognize my progress with my scars. This has truly been one of the only skincare products that gives quick and noticeable results with consistent use. I looked in a mirror today and I saw and felt a difference in the texture and appearance of my skin and my scars—which for me is a very big deal! These pictures were taken one week apart. the difference one week can make!
