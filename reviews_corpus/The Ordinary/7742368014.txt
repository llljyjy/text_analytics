Overall: The Buffet is very much a buffet experience. The quality isn’t amazing, but you also didn’t spend much. It’s still pretty good for the price, but you’re left wondering if you’d have been happier had you spent just a little more.I purchased this serum after Southwest damaged multiple items in my luggage, including shattering a bottle of Shiseido’s Ultimmune. Their solution was to give me a not even half the value of what they damaged gift card (so I could get my stuff damaged again later I guess), so I decided to try a less expensive serum I’ve heard lots of good things about.My skin texture is very dry. I need products that provide moisture and help lock in that moisture. I felt the serum let me down here, as I was applying a LOT just to get that result. One thing about applying a lot of this serum is you get a sort of sticky texture going on. If you give it a minute, it dries down to be less sticky but still not sticky-free.I’m unfortunately not seeing the results I was promised by multiple other reviews/hype TikToks after about a week. A little disappointing as I love so many other products from The Ordinary (side note: the caffeine drops are AMAZING). That’s not to say this is a bad serum, though. The price is incredibly reasonable for a serum, but it simply isn’t strong enough for dry skin. I think you’d be happy if your skin is normal or oily if the stickiness doesn’t bother you. If you have dry skin, you’ll find yourself needing to use a lot of serum to get decent results and probably should consider another product. It’s Giving Buffet Quality
