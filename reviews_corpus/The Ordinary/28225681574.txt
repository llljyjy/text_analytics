i swear by this! started using it last april and have since incorporated it into my skincare routine. its helped cleared my acne scars (when i started using it my acne scars / acne in general on my cheek area was bad). its also helped minimize the size of my pores and make my skin just overall better! i use it along with the niacinamide acid. only con is that i find it to be a bit sticky but i donâ€™t mind since i only use it before bed lol. also great price and the bigger bottle lasts me around 4 months with everyday use! LOVE !!
