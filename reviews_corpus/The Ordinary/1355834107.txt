I’ve been dealing with perioral dermatitis for over a year, and I’ve had to go back to this cleanser because it doesn’t bother the PD area or dry my skin out at all. I have sensitive dry to normal skin as well. It also really helps with the excess sebum around my nose and chin! I’m not even using moisturizer on my PD areas, and it’s not dry or flaking at all (it was so dry after the last cleanser I used). As for makeup removal, I find if you rub in on for a bit first, it works very well at removing everything. I’ll continue using this since it seems to be the most effective cleanser I’ve used in the last year. Safe for sensitive dry skin
