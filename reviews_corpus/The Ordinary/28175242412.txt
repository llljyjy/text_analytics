I’ve used only two hyaluronic acid serums, this one and one from The Inkey List, so there are probably other excellent HA serums out there. But this one does the trick for me. It goes on smoothly, and I can layer on products on top without too much wait time. I follow the guidance I’ve seen about applying after cleansing before the face is completely dry. For reference, I have dry skin, and I live in Minnesota. The harsh winters (really from mid September through April) do a number on my skin. This serum along with a rich moisturizer twice a day are the key for me. nan
