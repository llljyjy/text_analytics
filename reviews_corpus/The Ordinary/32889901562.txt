I typically have pretty sensitive skin, but no product has EVER given me a chemical burn! Not the products fault, just my own. Used on underarms to help with smell and it burned my skin so bad :( AMAZING for my hair care routine!! Always helps so much with dandruff and for my wash days in general! Love hate relationship tbh
