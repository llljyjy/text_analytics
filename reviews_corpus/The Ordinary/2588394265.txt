This is everything I wanted! It’s the first step in my AM and PM. I have been doing a pretty heavy retinol regimine and although I knew it was working, I really didn’t see how much it was doing for me until I paired it with proper moisturizing. My skin is fresh and pink. It’s my dream skin. This paired with The Ordinary NMF+HA moisturizer is everything. It’s the dead of winter here and my skin couldn’t be happier. Holy Grail for me
