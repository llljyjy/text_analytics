Iâ€™ve been using this product for several years now and love it. My skin is on the oily side, and it is very reactive/sensitive. This serum is the only thing that helps keep the oil at bay without breaking me out, and it keeps my skin more smooth and fresh looking than without it. If you have oily or combi skin, this product is your friend! If you have combo/oily skin, this is you're friend
