I would swear by this stuff if only for the fact that it is the only thing that makes any difference for my hormonal acne. Every so often I get these deep, painful blemishes along my neck. Nothing works for them and they can take weeks to clear up. But this stuff takes care of them in a matter of days! I wouldn’t believe it if I hadn’t experienced it myself and it still seems too good to be true. That aside, it also works great for the rest of my face. It definitely smooths and brightens my skin overall. The smell is a bit icky, but it’s worth it. Generally, I use it in the evenings along with The Ordinary’s squalene moisturizer, plus right before bed I add a heavier moisturizer. Specific to the hormonal acne, I use it as a sort of spot treatment after washing with a benzoyl peroxide cleanser. I hope this stuff is always and forever produced and sold. It’s a miracle worker for me. nan
