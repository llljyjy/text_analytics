As a mature woman with dark spots I did my homework and decided to give azelaic acid. I figured what better way to try is with a basic. I read up on the Oridinaryâ€™s azelaic acid and decided why not as dermatologists recommend it . It has a four star rating on sephora and estitchians recommend it.Unfortunately,  it is overly drying and pills terribly. Perhaps, I will see if someone else would like to try this product.
