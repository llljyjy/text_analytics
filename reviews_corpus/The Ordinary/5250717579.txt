It’s only been a few days but I’ve already seen an improvement in my skin. I bought this to help with skin texture, which I know will take time, but I can already see how much more healthy my skin looks. I mix 2 drops with the Ordinary moisturizer (which I also love) and apply. I have sensitive skin, so I thought mixing would be the best way to introduce this new product and it’s been great! And the price point is incredible! I’ve also been using the Niaminicide + zinc for over a year to help manage break outs, I’ve even gotten my teenage daughter and all her friends hooked on it! I love The Ordinary! Fantastic Product!
