Full disclosure: I use this in addition to other actives so I can’t say how transformative it is on its own. So, I purchased this because I know resveratrol is a great anti-aging/brightening ingredient and I wanted to include it in my nighttime routine without paying $$$ for it. Caudalie uses it in almost all of their products but it’s so pricey. So I have been using it at night for about two months with my Retin-A (tretinoin) and I must say, I can see a difference. ( fyi- I have been using tretinoin for over a year so I can actually say I saw a difference) It helped to fade dark spots in conjunction with the tretinoin and my face looks smoother. It does feel a little warm upon application as the other reviews have said but it doesn’t burn and it fades quickly. I have acne prone/dry skin and I have not experienced any breakouts. I would dare to say it may have improved my acne. This product just doesn’t get enough love and it’s so underrated. It works well with almost every active and it soaks into the skin quickly. It may seem oily but it really does absorb. Now I do have dry skin so my skin may just soak this up quicker than someone with oily skin. This product is a lifelong keeper for me and I’m so glad I gave it a try. It’s worth it folks! A nice addition to my nighttime routine
