This is amazing for my skin. I use it every other day at night. Literally 3 drops is more than enough for my face, neck, and hands. Any more than 3 drops and my skin doesnâ€™t absorb it and I eventually have to wipe it off.I get a nice glow to my skin after applying it. It feels like an oil (absorbs quickly and smoothly) and smells like a vitamin C packet that you open and put in a glass of water. My face has a subtle but growing glow and my dark marks and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation are lighter/fading (some of them, including years-old hyperpigmentation marks, are gone). A bottle of this every other night with two full pipette/droppers lasts me about 3 months which is amazing in terms of quantity and price. Great for Dark Marks
