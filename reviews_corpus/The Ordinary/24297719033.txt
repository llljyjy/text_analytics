It’s good, it absorbs pretty quickly and doesn’t make my skin feel oily or heavy. However it doesn’t make me feel too moisturized for very long, it might just be that I have some really dry patches, it would probably work better for someone with mildly dry skin. Good, but not as moisturizing as I need
