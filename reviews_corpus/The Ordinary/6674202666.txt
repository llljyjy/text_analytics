[Disclaimer I have been using this product for 1 year now] Significantly helped with texture and dark spots! I suffer from cystic acne monthly and I use this twice a week mixed in with my glycerin based moisturizer at night. A little goes a long way I never use more than 2-4 drops when applying. I alternate from Paula’s Choice BHA (before moisturizing) and this product. 10/10 recommend!! Don’t forget to wear SPF everyday too :) Amazing for texture and hyperpigmentation!!
