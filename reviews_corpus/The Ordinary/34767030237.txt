I’ve been using this product for nearly a year and it has helped a lot. My acne is mainly concentrated on one side of my face and appears in small bumps. Before using this, I never found a product that could take away the small bumps but after using this, they went away in two days! After 4 years of struggling with tiny bumps, they went away just like that. This product helps a ton with acne control but for me personally has not helped remove the dark spots left from my acne and has not done anything to help with hyperpigmentation. I am dark-toned for reference. I’m still giving it a five because of how fast the results came and how effective it is when you use it twice a day regularly. nan
