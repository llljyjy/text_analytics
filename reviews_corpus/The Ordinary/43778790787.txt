This is my third bottle and I swear it transformed my skin. As someone with slightly dry skin, this has the perfect balance of moisturizing my skin without too much extra maintenance. Coupled with a good cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen and youâ€™re good to go. Highly recommend (especially for the price point)! A skincare staple
