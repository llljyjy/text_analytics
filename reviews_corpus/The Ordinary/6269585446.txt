After using this product for two nights in a row, I hate this product.  I had just gotten a HydraFacial to clear up my acne and was looking for something to add some hydration.  My skin was completely clear before and this product gave me acne along my hairline and on my forehead.  Basically all over my face so I will not be using anymore.  I highly do not recommend this product! Caused acne; do not purchase
