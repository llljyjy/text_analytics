I really like this product as a day time serum. It helps keep moisture in my skin, has a refreshing pine scent at first application that gradually dissipates, and doesn’t irritate my sensitive combination skin which is great! I have dry, oily, acne prone, and sensitive skin so it’s nice when I find products that work and it layers well with rest of my routine. I like it
