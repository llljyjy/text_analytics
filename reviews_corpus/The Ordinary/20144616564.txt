i LOVE this moisturizer. i love the size, how cheap it is, and the texture. i have oily, acne prone skin, but now that i’m post-acutane i do notice my skin hasn’t funny recovered, and needs occasional heavy moisture. while i typically prefer a lighter moisturizer, i’ve been using this for over a month in conjunction with the Mad Hippie vitamin c serum, and my skin looks SO GOOD. my acne scars have faded, and i’ve even gotten compliments on how my skin looks. this doesn’t clog my pores AT ALL and doesn’t leave a greasy film. i do only use it at night, because of how oily my skin can get. <3
