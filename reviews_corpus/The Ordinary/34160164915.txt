I’ve seen this product recommended for brightening acne scars and everything, so I wanted to try it. It broke me out, maybe because I used it straight to my face. So I was scared to try again, but I gathered my courage to try jt again since it’s a waste. The second time, I diluted it with my moisturizer, yet it still broke me out. I’ve put random things on my face and this is the only product that has broke me out. Maybe it works for other people, but for me no. nan
