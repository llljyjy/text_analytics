This product is pretty ordinary (haha) but effective. The gel texture is perfect for oily skin but would also be great as a layer before moisturizer for drier skin types. A little goes a long way. My favourite thing about this product is the price point. For the size and quality, it is fantastic! Given that everything is so expensive these days, this is a rare find. If you’re on a budget, I highly recommend. I’m using it as my primary moisturizer for the summer since I’m super oily but can definitely see adjusted use into the colder months too. Pretty good!
