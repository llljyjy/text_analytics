Absolutely love this product! I have been using it for the past two years and it helped my acne prone skin significantly. After first use it makes my skin very soft and smooth also helped with discoloration caused by acne. I have sensitive skin, so I only use it for 8 minutes and immediately apply a very good moisturizer that helps soothing/replenish moisture. A must have!
