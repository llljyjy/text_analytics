I use this product every day after my toner, serums, and moisturizer. I love this product and use it with my gua sha and have been results over time using both. I love this oil for this purpose however you need a bit of product for the gua sha to work and therefore you can look a little shiny after using it. However, after blotting the excess off I look so refreshed and healthy. Use with a Gua Sha
