I was excited to try this vitamin C powder to make my own serums.  I have used Vitamin C products in the past and know how they should feel.  Unfortunately, this powder did not seem to have any affect (aka tingling) which is normally felt after application.  I’ve used it alone, dissolved in water, as well as combined with hyaluronic acid.  It does dissolve very easily, which is a definite plus.  I don’t know if the product is expired, as there is no date on the packaging.  Very disappointing :( Disappointing
