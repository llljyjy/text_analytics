I initially tried this on my face and hated it as it totally destroyed my skin barrier, caused me to breakout, and caused extreme dryness. I started to get creative with how I used it, and now I use it on my underarms each night (might have to do this every other day because some people get burns) and it causes me to sweat less the next day and not smell like BO. I also put it on my back each night and I haven’t had any bacne since. I have KP on my arms and legs as well, and find this does help smooth the bumps. Overall, I can’t live without it now. It’s an amazing product. HARSH for sensitive skin but AMAZING FOR KP/BACNE
