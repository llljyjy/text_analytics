I wanted to give The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% exfoliating peel a try due to the expansive reviews I have heard. Personally for me 10 minutes is too long and when leaving the product on for 7 minutes I notice my skin burned in certain areas. Didnâ€™t notice any other significant changes. I plan on finishing this bottle with minimal wear time but after that I will not be repurchasing. a no for me
