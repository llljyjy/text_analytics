What a value for money!!This is such a good makeup cleanser. It’s very effective, breaking down makeup in a matter of seconds. It then emulsifies ever so slightly and washes of in a instant. It hasn’t broken me out and doesn’t leave the skin dry. The only problem is that sometimes it takes a little extra effort to melt the product. Initially it might feel as though it’s tugging at the skin. But eventually, it becomes slippery and I can, with ease, move it around to remove makeup, dirt and sunscreen. I love using it on days when I don’t have makeup too; just as a first step to a double cleanse. P.S. I don’t use waterproof makeup. nan
