I was using glow recipe niacinamide dew drops and wasnt seeing the results I was expecting for such an expensive product so I started looking for a new product. this was so cheap I figured it can’t hurt to try. so glad I did because this is perfect. took off one star because I don’t know why they would make the scoop so large if you are only supposed to use 1/4 of the scoop. just make the scoop the right size please. I mix this with a hydrating toner and I have the baby soft, redness free skin of my dreams! nan
