I can only sleep on my left side due to a physical issue so my left eye fills with fluid every night. This does help with my puffiness but has not helped with my discoloration. I just bought the inky list’s brighten-i eye cream to pair with this product in hopes that it will help my discoloration. If the combo does help then I will buy my 3rd bottle, if not then I’ll move on to something different. Helps with my puffiness
