I’ve gone through two of the smaller bottles and am now onto a new bottle of the bulk size. This has really helped my skin and I personally experienced very little purging when I started using it. It’s also has never pilled for me even with multiple other products, but it will pill for you if you use it with any of their vitamin c products. Their vitamin c is different others (idk why) and it WILL make it pill so don’t mix the two. I’ve heard people say to use it once a day but I use it morning and night with no issues. I don’t thinks it’s helped brighten  any scars but I could have just not noticed tbh - It’s helped me with my acne though and my skin is clear almost all the time! ~ [PS you should use this on a clean face after toners and before your moisturizers, also I’ve noticed after a few uses of a new bottle it gets a little sudsy almost? Idk how to explain it but if it happens your products isn’t expired fyi] One of the only products I can NEVER run out of <3
