Recently I’ve had so many pimples around my mouth, which I’ve never had before so I assume it’s due to wearing a mask a lot. I tried all the other products I have that usually work great for any pimples I have (I also love the ordinary Niacinamide) and none of them were working. I’ve used the ordinary salicylic acid in the past (the other version in the clear bottle) and it was okay but I preferred the niacinamide. Anyways, I bought this to hopefully find something to get rid of all my pimples. I literally got this less than 48 hours ago and the pimples around my mouth are almost completely gone. Also I really like that it’s squalane based, compared to the other salicylic acid they have. I definitely think the oil in this doesn’t skin into your skin well, so maybe not the best to use in the mornings since you will look a bit oily if you use too much, but if you just use a little bit in the morning it looks fine. Got rid of my maskne!
