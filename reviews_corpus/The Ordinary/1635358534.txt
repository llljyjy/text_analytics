For the price, I feel like it over performs; for a product, it’s mediocre. I bought this while I was waiting for my Dr. Barbara Sturm products to come in, as I am a daily devotee to that hyaluronic acid serum. There is no comparison. This serum feels drying if you don’t IMMEDIATELY follow it up with powerful moisturizer, so if you can do that—results are minimal but better than nothing. Otherwise, I used it for a week and a third of the bottle is now gone. Additionally, there’s a slight scent of coconut? So for traveling I might get this to hold me over until I can get back to the good stuff, but there’s a reason it’s $7 and not $300. Good Value, Mediocre Results
