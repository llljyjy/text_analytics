Ok, I have never written a review despite getting all my skincare and most of my makeup at Sephora for the past decade so I hope you know how much I mean it when I say this is AMAZING. I have extremely oily, cystic/hormonal acne prone skin, in my mid 30s. I use this at night over The Ordinary’s 10% lactic acid and my skin has never been less oily. And I generally use a Nuface on the looser skin under my chin to keep it tight, and to my shock after using this for a month I no longer need it!!! Never, ever in my life has any kind of product actually, legitmately tightened my skin, no matter how fancy or expensive. Please lord never discontinue this, its the best thing that’s ever happened to my face. Plus its super inexpensive, and a little goes a long way, I’m just finishing my first bottle of this after 2-3 months. Incredible
