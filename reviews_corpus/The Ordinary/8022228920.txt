First thing that caught my eye is the PRICE! its super cheap in comparison to other products at Sephora. A friend recommended this and I am glad she did. Leaves my skin super soft and I see some changes in even tones all over the face. Be careful as its strong. I use it 2/3 times a week only. Would surely buy again! Good Peel!
