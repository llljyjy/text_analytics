This is good if you have oily skin because it won’t look greasy. It’s great for hot months because it’s not a weird greasy moisturizer. i Have dry patches on my nose and forehead and won’t recommend if you have dry patches  along with it. Good moisturizer on the go. It good oily skin or normal skin type.
