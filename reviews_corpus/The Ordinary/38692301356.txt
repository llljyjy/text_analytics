ive been struggling to find a good, cheap moisturizer for oily skin and a sephora worker suggested this for me and i havent looked back since! it feels a bit greasy at first but it absorbs in and helps so much with acne! ive noticed differences from the first days using it. very satisfied it might have a very faint smell but its not very noticeable. i use this at night after my  cleanser. totally recommend for oily/combination as someone who does have oily/combination skin :) perfect for oily/combination!
