Wonderful stuff and so affordable. I use this as a base moisturizer morning and night, immediately after cleansing (face still a bit damp for best results). I had a very bad case of seborrheic dermatitis last year and this magic potion has helped keep it at bay since it cleared up. My Magic Moisturizer!
