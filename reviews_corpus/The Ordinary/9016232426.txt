I’m pleasantly surprised by this mask! I am 31 with hormonal acne and occasional breakouts. I have oily skin, but otherwise not bad. I wanted something effective that I didn’t have to use constantly. I use this mask 1-2 times a week and the next morning my skin glows! It’s great around that time of the month at keeping things under control! Great mask for occasional acne!
