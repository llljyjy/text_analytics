I have been using this for about 6 weeks now and my skin looks fine, but I don’t see much of a difference yet.  After applying it, my skin feels very oily and sticky for a few hours (I don’t put much on at all either). It also has a very grainy texture, though this is my first vitamin C product, so I’m not as familiar with what it should feel like I guess. Oily & Grainy texture
