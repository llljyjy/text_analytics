I love this acid, and it worked very well for my dry, acne-prone skin. I was much happier with my second repurchase, where The Ordinary added a lid that could be used for dispensing, as opposed to the flat cap (I struggled much more with application prior to this). Now that I have been on weekly Retin-A treatments, I have had to stop using this and other actives, as they intensify the peeling and even cause breakouts. This has nothing to do with the product itself, but the intensity of the Retin-A combined with other actives on my skin. I’m hoping to gradually be able to use one active a week once my skin calms down, but will likely opt for The Ordinary’s lactic acid as it’s slightly more hydrating. But I did use this very often prior to prescription, and it was my preferred acid treatment. Love, just a little too intense with my Retin-A.
