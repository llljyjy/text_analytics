I used to use this serum in my skincare routine, and it was alright, nothing crazy. As I started to cut down and simplify my routine, I decided to start using this serum in my hair to help lock in moisture and help make my hair products more effective. I actually got the idea from tiktok and love it! Have been using the serum for my hair ever since! Hair care Secret weapon
