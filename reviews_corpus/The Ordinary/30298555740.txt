This face wash is the BEST thing I’ve ever tried. I have very dry/dehydrated skin and I always have felt that stripped feeling after face washes and thought that was the norm. After trying this, my face actually feel hydrated now without layers and layers of moisturizer! My skin feels so velvety after each use and is very gentle. I use in the Am and double cleanse in the pm, once to get make up off (which it’s pretty good at!) and another to make sure I’m all clean. Fantastic product and I’ll continue buying for the foreseeable future!! SAVED my skin!
