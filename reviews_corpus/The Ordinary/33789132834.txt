I have combination skin, this was recommended by a Sephora Employee. Note this is only used at night, I decided to try it and I was surprised the next morning. When I woke up, my skin was not only glowing but my acne improved a lot just with one night. I have been using this toner for a week now. It has healed my acne scars (not completely) and also has helped my skin texture. Toner Review
