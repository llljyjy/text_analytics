So I can’t yet give this a full 5 stars because I haven’t been using it long enough to see the full results but I have been using it since it arrived at my home in early February and honestly I can already see a difference in my skin. The areas of my face that have hyperpigmentation due to past breakouts have improved. For reference I am African American and I have acne prone combination skin. This is something I do see myself reordering when I get low. Noticing Results Already
