It’s a great price for a hyaluronic acid serum. I like that it has only a short list of ingredients and the glass packaging. However, there are 2 reasons make this only worth 3 stars for me: 1) My face feels tight after the serum has dried down (adsorbed?). I’m not sure if that’s normal or has something to do with my dry skin type, but it isn’t as hydrating as I wanted.2) The main issue I have is that, it pills seriously whenever I apply this with my vitamin C, retinol, or some other serum. I have to wash my whole face off and apply my skincare all over again whenever such pilling happens. After a couple tries and pilling, I just gave up and so I don’t have much use of it anymore. This also happens in another one of their serum I tried. nan
