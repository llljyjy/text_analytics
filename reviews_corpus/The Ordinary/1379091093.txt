I went to The Ordinary’s website and took a quiz for what products I should use based on my skin goals. This the the first serum I use as my base, followed by their Buffet + Copper and Niacinamide serums. My skin has 180’ed since using these serums. I have combination skin that sometimes flakes in my dry areas and these serums have completely evened out my skin. This amino acid serum is lovely & light - making it a great base to build upon with serums, moisturizer and/or makeup. nan
