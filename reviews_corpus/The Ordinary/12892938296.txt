So I’ve used Vitamin C from Clinique, La Roche Posay, Goodal - none of them have anything close in texture to this product. As other reviews have mentioned, the HA spheres create an “exfoliant effect“, which personally isn’t something I’m looking for in my Vit C. Additionally, I find this product leaves the face pretty oily vs. other Vitamin Cs. So unfortunately not a good buy for me! unfortunately not a good buy for me!
