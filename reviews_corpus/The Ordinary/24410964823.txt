I rate this product a 4 starts tho it’s not very strong and it didn’t do much for my hyperpigmentation but I did notice a subtle brightness and when I runed out I definitely noticed the absence, in my opinion this should me taken more as an elevated hyaluronic acid it’s very hydrating and unlike the actual The ordinary hyaluronic serum it’s not sticky and it wears beautifully under makeup. I used this on the days I use my Paula’s choice bha exfoliating toner and the combo is INSANE (using spf of course) it makes the skin look flawless under makeup like glowing but not greasy at all. Safe to say I really like this serum and I’ve already repurchased the bigger bottle. Get this one instead of the Hyaluronic acid, just know if you’re looking for something to target hyperpigmentation this is not it, however it is a really nice serum and I do recommend it. Subtle brightness, very hydrating
