I watched my face get extremely & disgustingly oiler over the last 2 weeks and my pores clogged up. I was so disgusted when I took a really close look after 2 weeks of twice a day use. My pores looked like they were literally plugged up. I feel idiotic I didn’t realize this was the cause. I had just incorporated this, summer Fridays new HA and PTR water drench (great for oily skin) My moisturizers were pilling started my skincare journey a year ago. I FINALLY got my oil & breakouts in check. I usually use the Farmacy nia mask at night but wanted to introduce one in the am. I chose this bc of the price instead of Paula’s choice. Big mistake. negative stars
