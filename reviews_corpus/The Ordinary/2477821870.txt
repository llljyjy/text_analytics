The price is unbeatable and the product is hydrating, but not so much that it’s worth poor make up application in the a.m. It is sticky and causes my foundation to look like like my skin is peeling. My bronzer also gets muddy looking if I use this prior, even when I give it ample time to dry. I’ve tried with a moisturizer and without and it produces the same peeling skin (yuck!) look. I’ll use this in the evening and hope that it provides long term hydration results. Sticky and not good for make up
