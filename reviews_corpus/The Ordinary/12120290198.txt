I first discovered this oil about 4, possibly 5c years ago when my skin was going through a major upheaval - very dry, flaking skin, post inflammatory hyperpigmentation - and have had a bottle in the house ever since. I am sharing this genuine and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.  In the warmer seasons, my skin is combo (oil T-zone and dry cheeks). This comes in handy for those days or nights when I need something to soothe redness and infuse more moisture into my cheeks.  In the cooler months, this is part of my daily evening skincare routine - mixed in with my moisturizer or applied as the last step of my skincare routine; or sometimes I do both. In the winter when my skin is dry all over and some days, very, very dry, I keep a bottle on my nightstand, to moisture my face and hands just before turning out the lights. My skin drinks up the goodness overnight and my skin looks rested and looks and feel nourished. I cannot recommend this oil enough. It saved my skin years ago and I’ve not been without it since. The price is hard to beat, but be assured that this is not just a good product for the price point, it’s good, period. My not-so-secret weapon against dry skin
