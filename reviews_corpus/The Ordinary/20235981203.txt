I need to write review this time since this is really disappointed. My skin is not that sensitive but I got countless number of tiny pimples after 3 days using it. The first time I tried I thought it was due to other product so I stop using it for a long while. But when I tried again the same issue happen. It took a month for me to fix last time. Still hoping for my skin to recover faster this time :( Million tiny pimples after using
