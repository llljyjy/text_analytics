This is not an essential product in my skin care routine, but I really appreciate the extra hydration in our cold, dry winter months. I use this in the morning in place of a serum and under IsClinical Shield and at night again with my usual serum if my skin feels like it needs it. For the price, itâ€™s a great product to have on hand. Not life-changing, but great for the price!
