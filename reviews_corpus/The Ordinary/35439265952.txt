Did this help to lighten a new dark patch I’ve noticed on my upper cheek, or existing acne marks? Unfortunately it didn’t. And that’s unusual because I usually respond very well to Arbutin, even at 1% or less, yet for some reason not with The Ordinary’s 2% formula. I did notice the tiniest bit of smoothness in my skin texture (the Lactic acid maybe) and my skin did feel lightly hydrated using just a few drops of this (possibly the Sodium Hyaluronate content) twice a day. But then I started to notice mild acne and clogged pores appearing on my chin and forehead after a weeks’ use, and had to stop applying it to my face. I was hopeful that taking it down to just one application per day might lessen the issue but it didn’t. Not one to waste something, I’ve been applying a couple of drops every night before sleep on my slightly dark, patchy underarms, after washing-off the days’ anti-perspirant. I’ve been doing this for the last 3 and a half weeks but not seen any difference so far. To be fair I’ve yet to come across a product that does lighten them, even with multiple brightening ingredients in, not just Arbutin, so I can’t say I’m exactly surprised.
