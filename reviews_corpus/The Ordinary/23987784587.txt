I rave about this one!! I have very dry and sensitive skin so products that claim to get rid of dark spots are often too strong for me or are meant for someone with oily skin, but this makes my acne scars/ texture disappear! I use it every PM and after a few uses, I noticed a considerable difference on once stubborn scars. Definitely a thinner oil, so I use it on top of a moisturizer. Some people complain about the scent, but I can hardly smell it! I havenâ€™t used this on my hair but it leaves my skin glowy and healthy. Made my dark spots disappear!
