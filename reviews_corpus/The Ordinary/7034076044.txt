I have very dry skin that can flake. I’m not prone to breakouts and am not oily in the slightest. I’ve tried a lot of oils. Sunday Riley. Juno and Luna. both great but the B oil is just as good and nowhere near the price. B oil will be my go to for as long as it’s around. not too oily. not a strong smell or color. but is sturdy enough to give you a hydrated sealed in feeling. I like it as a closer for my skin care routine. Great oil. As effective as high end
