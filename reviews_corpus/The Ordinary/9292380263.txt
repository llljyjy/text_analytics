LOVE this product! On my second bottle of this oil as I use it as my daily moisturizer! I was originally recommended this product by the representatives at the Deciem store in Toronto, ON due to my constant milia which I had been suffering with for YEARS. My skin has always been on the dryer side and I have been using The Ordinary’s Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA for the past 5 years thinking it would help. Although it did help my dry skin, it was too heavy, causing my milia. The rep at Deciem asked me if I had ever looked into face oils and I instantly saw a red light saying “no!!! don’t do it!!” Because I always thought oils were too thick and would break me out. She tested a bunch of different oils on my hand and asked me which one gave me the desired finish/smell/absorbency which was the Argan Oil. I started using twice daily (AM/PM) and within a week ALL of my milia was gone. 100% recommend!!! This product changed my whole life and face!!!
