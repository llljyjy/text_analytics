my skin started breaking out so badly with having to wear a mask for 8+ hours a day and naturally got worse the more i wore the mask. i’ve always struggled with acne, blackheads, blemishes, etc. i was recommended this product by a friend and i swear it’s changed my life; my skin has never been so clear, so consistently one shade, and i’ve never had calm skin so quickly. i find that i don’t need to use a ton of product each time i use it and i do my face, neck, and chest; since i started using this product about a year or so ago, i’ve maybe gone through two bottles (1oz). an honest to god miracle product
