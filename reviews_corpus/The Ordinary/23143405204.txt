i have heard so much about this brand in general but specifically this product, i had seen it everywhere from tik tok, pinterest, to YouTube so when visiting sephora i thought i would pick some up. not only was the price amazing but it will last you FOREVER. i had tried 1 or 2 chemical peels before but they all had been in pad form which erritated my skin in the winter but this product doesn’t and there wasn’t any stinging just a slight tingle where i have some acne. it made my skin glow so much and took all the redness away from former acne marks. it made almost all my texture go away and that was only in the first week of using it . if you dont have it you NEED to get it. A definite LOVEEE
