I bought this product last year because i was thinking it would be a very affordable version of bio oil. I put it in the cabinet and actually forgot about it until the other day when i was looking fir something to soothe a rash on my neck.  The rash was a bit itchy but the skin was dry so i knew that i needed something gentle but effective. I first tried aloe but it didnt help with the dryness. Then i remembered i had this squalane and tried it. Immediately the redness went away and my neck felt soothed.  I could not believe how quickly the rash resolved with this.  Its really like a miracle oil! Miracle Oil!
