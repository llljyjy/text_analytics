Oddly arrived with a super goopy, thick texture. I’ve used plenty of serums and in all of my experience, the texture is either like liquid or oil. The serum feels sticky upon application and leaves an unusual residue on my fingers. I haven’t noticed it helping my skin whatsoever after using it for weeks. Would not buy this again or recommend this. Sticky unpleasant texture, no results
