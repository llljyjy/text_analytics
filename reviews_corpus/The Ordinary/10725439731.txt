Love this stuff! And an absolute steal. I’ve always had issues with dry skin in the winter, but when I use this AM and PM my skin stays nice and hydrated. My dermatologist suggested I follow it up with a moisturizer afterwards, and I’ve found that that works best for me in terms of getting smoother and more hydrated skin. Highly recommend! 5 Stars! (And a bargain….)
