The results aren’t awe-inspiring, but they’re about as good as you can get from a non-prescription skincare product. This is my favorite product from TO. I use it everyday and it has definitely helped smooth my forehead where I tend to break out with small comedones (usually during PMS). It is an acid so definitely make sure you avoid contact with your eyes or you will hate your life. Use it everyday, but don't expect Rx results
