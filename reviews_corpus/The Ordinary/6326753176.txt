Completely transformed my skin. I use this once a week max or just whenever my skin needs a good deep cleanse. The first minute is uncomfortable but then the feeling subsides. I leave it for 10 minutes and then use a rag to gently wipe it off making sure it doesn’t go anywhere near my eyes. It’s helped not only with the build up I get on my nose but has also helped with deep scarring I still get. I use a very gentle essence and then just moisturizer after. renewed skin
