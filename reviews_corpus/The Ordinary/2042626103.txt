I have dry skin with occasional redness and acne flare ups. I use benzaclin (clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide) and tretinoin .05% at night, which contributes to the dryness. I like to use this serum in the morning. I use it first after washing my face, follow with a morning acne treatment, then my moisturizer. I have gone through several bottles of it and am extremely pleased- my skin looks plumper and feels more hydrated because of it. nan
