It’s good as a first step of a double cleanse as a cleansing balm, however it dries the crap of my skin, and i have very oily skin. I don’t feel that clean after using so I recommend using a good second cleanse. Stings my eyes and quite difficult to work around on my face. Shame, really wanted to love this :( Meh.
