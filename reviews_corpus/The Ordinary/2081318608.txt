This is THE ONLY thing that can calm my redness without causing irritation. I have dry sensitive skin with a history of rosacea. And some patches of my face pretty much stay red nowadays. This immediately spot-reduces the redness, and has a matte effect. I think it even brings down inflammation by a tiny bit... The only downsides are: it does make your skin gently purge. So you can wake up the next day with some baby whiteheads in places you weren’t expecting them... But the MOST annoying part is that I can’t layer ANYTHING on top of this. Not even a tinted SPF. It just pills and flakes and crumbles and sometimes leaves my skin look more uneven than before.Your best bet it to only use this at night, or on days when you don’t need to apply any other skincare products in your AM routine. Good for redness, bad for morning routine.
