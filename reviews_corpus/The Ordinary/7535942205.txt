I wanted to try something new because the DE baby facialIs so expensive and After seeing the reviews and price point for this I decided to try it. It doesn’t really do much for me. I can see that have some purging after use but what sold me with DE babyfacial was how my pores were SNATCHED after use. Like..uneven texture who? Unfortunately this let me down, I get a lot of buildup on myNose and this hasn’t helped at all. I’m still at square 1 after use. Because it helps exfoliate in lesser problematic areas I’ll use it but I guess it’s time to keep looking. disappointed…
