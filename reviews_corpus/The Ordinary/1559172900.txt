Very rarely do I ever repurchase a product over and over again but with one, I find myself missing it in my routine if I run out. I’m not really tracking any noticeable “results” per se but it simply feels really pleasant when I put it on, little cooling and “depuffing”…and I reach for this way more than my expensive eye creams. Can’t live without
