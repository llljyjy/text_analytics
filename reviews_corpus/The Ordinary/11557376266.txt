This stuff packs a punch. I use it all over my face and body and have found it to be effective at reducing dark spots. It does leave a slight sting to my face, but nothing unbearable. I have sensitive, acne prone, combo to oily skin and I have not found it to irritate or break my skin out at all. Will be purchasing again. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.
