Iâ€™m going to be honest, when I initially bought this I really did not enjoy how tacky it made my skin feel, to the point where it made my moisturizer slip off (YTP Superfood). However after starting Retin-A .025 and my skin drying in the process the tackiness has come in handy as it feels like a moisture barrier before I put on the retin-a. I use it only at night but I feel very hydrated and if I were to use it during the day I probably would only use a very light moisturizer if at all tacky but not bad
