This is the only product that has cleared the acne on my chest and back, including both over the counter and prescription products, in the last 20 years. I use it 3-4x a week. I don’t really use it on my face, but I probably could replace some current products I’m using there for this. In addition to clearing my skin, I’ve also noticed my chest is much smoother and looks like it did in my twenties (I’m 37!). super effective and affordable!!
