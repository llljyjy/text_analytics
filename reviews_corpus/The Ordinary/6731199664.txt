(very oily, dry, sensitive skin) I gotta be honest, I was quite skeptical that this would actually work for my skin. I tried this out after using dermalogica daily exfoliator (it dries my face out) and this made the tightness in my face completely go away. It is a thick consistency but soaked into my skin very nicely, fragrance free for my very sensitive skin! I will continue to try this out and most likely repurchase the bigger bottle! This moisturizer definitely beats ones that are more than double or triple the price! Surprisingly love this
