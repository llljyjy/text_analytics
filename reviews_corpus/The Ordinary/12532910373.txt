I love this product so much! Just 2-3 drops in the evening is all you need! I rotate it in my routine. I use this every night except on the 2 or 3 nights a week I use retinol (they should not be mixed Iâ€™ve heard) I have noticed since I started using the buffet line my lines are softer, (especially my forehead lines) I have had them in my routine for over a year and I think it takes a few months to really see the improvements but for me, this is a great product, I find it very effective and not to expensive compared to things out there. I use the regular buffet in my day time routine and the buffet + copper peptides in my evening routine. this is my favorite product from this brand, right next to The Peptide Serum for Hair Density and thier Niamincide and Zinc serum. It's in my Top Faves
