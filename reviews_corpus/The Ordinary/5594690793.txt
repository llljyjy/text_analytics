The Ordinary offers clean skincare at affordable prices. I’ve repurchased this several times and I’m always pleased with how it works on my skin and hair. It does exactly what you’d want an oil to do. I’ve tried higher end argan oil, and the results in my skin and hair were really no different than what this oil does. And at this price point, you can’t really go wrong. nan
