I absolutely LOVE this!! I would say a little goes a long way. At first it left my skin looking greasy/shiny, but after a bit I guess when I got used to it it absolutely saved my skin - pores are gone, no pimples, and I just love it :) I used this twice a day for the past 2-3 weeks for reference :) Saved my pores!!!!
