I have been using this cleanser for about four months. It is very good if you are too lazy to get your face wet and wash it twice a day. That is why i recommend to have one for those days that you don not feel like washing your face. The only downside is that if you have heavy make up, foundation, blush or stuff like that, it does not remove them throughly. So if you want something that works with a lot of make up, this is not for you. Otherwise, it is a good choice. nan
