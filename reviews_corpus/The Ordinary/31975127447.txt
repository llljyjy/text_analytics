I like the nourishing feeling of squalane. This cleanser may still feel drying at times - maybe I’m being nitpicky. Repurchased many times - these days I only use to get the hefty amounts of sunscreen or complexion products off my face if I’ve been out and about - as it’s very effective. For regular end of the working from day shower routine, I use a simpler water-based cleanser. nan
