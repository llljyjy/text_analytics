I actually bought this by mistake as part of a set, so I wouldn’t have otherwise trusted or tried this product. That said, I’ve been using it am/pm for two weeks and am SHOCKED that it actually as worked! The circles under my eyes are noticeably lighter, so much so that I don’t even use under-eye concealer anymore. While the effects aren’t dramatic, this definitely helps me feel more put-together. On days I have to be somewhere early, it’s a great way to depuff my eyes and make me look more awake. I’ve also noticed that my fine lines are a bit fainter!  I’m not sure whether I’d buy it again, simply because puffiness/circles aren’t a huge point of concern for me, but I’m really happy with its effect on my overall appearance. It worked for me!
