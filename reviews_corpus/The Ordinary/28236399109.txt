bought this about a month ago and have been using daily. I’m 40 and never had much of a skincare routine but have been using daily moisturizer for fine lines and was still having bit of dry areas around nose and eyebrows. after just couple uses skin felt so much softer, and dare I say after a month skin looks bit nicer and fresher. for the price its pretty amazing and will keep using this for sure. it does pill a bit which is lil gross but if you let dry completely before makeup and other skincare it’s not too bad at all. texture is sticky and not used to that but face feels great and soft so these couple of negatives aren’t worth not using for sure. hope this helps and best wishes! worked really well so far!
