As a retired esthetician with 25 years experience I know L-ascorbic acid is one of the best (and most easy to lose itâ€™s effectiveness unless stored properly). Even then, once a serum is exposed to air it breaks down. I have always kept my serums in the refrigerator. Anyway, so far I am impressed with this product. It is definitely potent and I like that you can combine it with any of your products. Since using it I have gotten even more compliments on my skin. Get it but do your research so you know the correct way to use it. This is GREAT
