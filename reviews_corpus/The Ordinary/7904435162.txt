This is a simple and effective cleanser that functions as an oil based cleanser. It also comes at a great price. It is great for removing makeup, especially heavy eye makeup, and there is no heavy fragrance or active ingredient that would make this irritating to skin. It is irritating if it gets in my eyes, though.I feel like the full size of this product is always out of stock, which is upsetting. I buy the mini size for that reason. Gently melts off heavy makeup
