Before using this product, my skin & complexion just looked dull, especially in the winter months. I’ve found after using this consistently that my face is brighter, ruddy even, and that my blackheads are more under control/smaller than before. I use just a little bit (less than a pea size) dabbed on my face under my moisturizer 1x/day so I don’t see any of that pilling people talk about. And it lasts a while if you do that. Def recommend for folks with normal skin looking for a slight but noticeable improvement (especially at this price point--worth trying)! nan
