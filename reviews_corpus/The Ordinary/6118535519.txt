I didn’t experience anything from this product one way or another. I don’t have acne so maybe thats why? I just wanted something to help with general redness but this wasnt a fit. HOWEVER, I feel like this would have to have some sort of miracle level effect on the skin to make the pilling worth it. If you itch your face, you can feel the pills. Idk how anyone would wear this with makeup? I would deffo try just using this at night for the first time so you can see what I mean. No effect, but pilling like crazy.
