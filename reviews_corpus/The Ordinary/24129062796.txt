Was seriously intrigued by this product. I’d read many comments here and also watched YouTube video reviews. Bottom line: use smartly. If your skin is sensitive, only use once a week. If it tingles after you pat it on but the sensation goes away quickly: use two to three times a week. If you are concerned with milia: apply to the tip of a cotton bud and dab on the small area, same with post-acne discolouration spots.I’ve yet to try it on my scalp but this has done wonders on my under arms and inner thigh discolouration.Very satisfied BUT recommend being attentive. Exfoliating acids are great but results are best paired with patience and attention. Be smart with this one!
