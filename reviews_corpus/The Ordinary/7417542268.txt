I’ve been using this va as part of my approach to get test my acne + scarring. Unfortunately, this made me breakout a ton. I kept using it because I thought it was purging, but the breakouts kept coming and left scars. I’ve given up on it. It’s made me so self-conscious of my skin now. The pictures are a few days after stopping, so the pimples are smaller. Caused bad breakouts/scarring
