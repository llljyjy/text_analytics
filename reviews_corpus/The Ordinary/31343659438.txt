I asked for this as a Christmas gift and I’m so happy I got it. I have normal skin but my skin has been a little dry during the winter. I mix a few drops of this with my moisturizer, and when I put it on at night my skin is super hydrated the next morning! My skin looks and feels so glowy and soft.  It probably isn’t the best for oily skin, but that isn’t too much of an issue for me. Definitely similar to the “slugging“ effect when you mix it with moisturizer which I looooove! I will definitely be purchasing this again!!!! Chef's kiss mwah
