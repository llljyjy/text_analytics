Personally I love this product, it’s affordable and works well. I have an area on my cheeks where I always get clogged forming big irritated pimples that do not squeeze out. My esthetian said that it’s just the nature of that area and the key is to exfoliate that area.This product works great on blemishes to help reduce clogged poors as I believe it is an exfoliant. And the areas been clear since I’ve started!My night routine:RetinolNacinimadeFace creamHope this helps :) Helps with blemishes!
