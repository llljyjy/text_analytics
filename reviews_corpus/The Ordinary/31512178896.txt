I love this product! I have added it to my skincare routine along with a vitamin C serum & a broad-spectrum, mineral sunscreen with the goal of lightening my sunspots & acne scars. I have noticed a dramatic difference in only 3 weeks! I’m not sure which of the products is working so well or if it’s the 3 of them combined, but I am not going to stop using this glycolic acid anytime soon. Would definitely recommend.
