First off, this is not the product you want to “wing it” with; follow the directions verbatim, to the letter, and to the t. Keep the packaging! You only leave it on for 10 minutes so set a timer, tell Siri and Alexa to set timers, call your mom and tell her to call you back in 10 minutes. It will probably tingle, I take it off if it starts to become uncomfortable. Of course, my face doesn’t literally peel but it does make my skin a little sensitive after and, like a professional peel, my skin looks brighter the next day. My dark spots lighten with consistent use. I wash with First Aid Beauty Face Cleanser and then slather on a peanut butter thick layer of Ultra repair cream intense hydration . This is super effective if you use it properly and listen to your skin. It’s a generous amount and, like all of The Ordinary’s products, it’s super economical. I highly recommend it. Serious Business
