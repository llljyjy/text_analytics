I’ve been using this product for a couple years now.  It completely affordable and it’s a great multi-use product.  I use it before bed on my face and neck, or in the winter when my skin is extra dry.  I also use it occasionally on the ends of my hair, and have even used a little bit when I can’t find my chapstick (try not to get it your mouth). Heads up if you’ve never used it: It’s natural, so some people may be allergic awsome for moisturizing
