I love it! -> Following the instructions, With a clean and dry face, I applied it with a flat brush all over my face, I only left it for about 10 minutes. and began to feel a little burning tolerable to my feeling. Then remove the remains with a cotton pad moistened with cleanser. I have been using it 2/3 times a week and I can notice my face is brighter and clearer.    My skin feels fresh and luminous I loved the result removes dead cells and any impurities that clog pores. I definitely recommend it as it is a chemical exfoliant and there is not as much chance of burning the skin with friction as with regular physical exfoliants. After exfoliation my routine-> cleanser -> Toner -> moisturizer -> serum -> sunscreen âœ“ Exfoliating peeling solution
