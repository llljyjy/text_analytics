Wow. Iâ€™m 65 and in the last year my skin texture changed dramatically. I think it was partly due to wearing masks and parts of my face felt like sandpaper! I tried exfoliating scrubs, shaving, and nothing worked. This had my skin smooth in a week. I use it most nights with an essence and moisturizer. For $8 this is a winner for mature skin. it works!!
