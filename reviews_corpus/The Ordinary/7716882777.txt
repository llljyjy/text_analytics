If you have very sensitive skin, this cleanser is a must have! Both my daughter and I use it with great results – and I am in my 40s and she is in her teens! Very different skin issues, and this works for both of us. Squalane is very gentle and very beneficial for the skin, and The Ordinary has not added all sorts of chemical junk in with it in the cleanser as so many companies do. It’s gentle but effective, great for removing make up, and keeps my skin clear and my pores unclogged. And the price cannot be beat! I’m a big fan of many products by The Ordinary; I’ve done my research and I buy their serums and combine them to suit my needs. I am in my 40s and have very few visible lines. I actually had more in my 30s prior to learning about proper skin care and using these products! I do the same for my daughter who has oily acne prone skin and her face is now clear and her skin has a healthy glow. This is a great product to add to anyone’s skin care regime. It leaves your skin clean and free of residue so it is ready to absorb whatever serum‘s or creams you may use. And at this price it would be silly not to try it. I highly recommend this for anyone with any skin type. You just can’t go wrong with this product. nan
