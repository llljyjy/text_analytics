Although the gritty texture isn’t the best I can definitely look past it because i do like the properties of this serum. However some days the pilling is much worse than others. I’m unsure why because nothing about my skincare routine has changed. Some days the pilling is so bad I feel like none of it has rubbed into my skin; it’ll even leave clumps onto my fingertips. For that reason I’m only giving this 3 stars because it seems very wasteful and possibly inadequate on the bad days. inconsistent and too much pilling
