I ALWAYS have this in my supply. It’s perfect for emergency break outs and keeps your pores clean without the irritation that similar products have. I have very fair reactive skin and I’ve never once been irritated after use. It’s so cost effective too! I apply it with a foundation brush to waste lass product as it’s pretty thick and sticky. Stock up when you see it!
