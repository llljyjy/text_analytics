Did not like this product at all. It’s very thick and it felt like I was putting sunscreen on. I would use just a little bit and tried to rub it in but it just left white streaks that I had to wipe off. This also didn’t feel like it was doing much for my skin, definitely have had other moisturizers that worked better. felt like sunscreen
