I’ve been getting a lot of breakouts on my chin, so I did some research on The Ordinary’s website and saw Niacinimide was a top product for congested skin. I was so excited to try it, but the first day I used it I had even more breakouts. I thought my skin just needed time to adapt, but I’ve been using this for two weeks now and my skin is just getting worse and worse. I have sensitive combination skin that is very acne-prone, so maybe this is too strong for me. Disappointed
