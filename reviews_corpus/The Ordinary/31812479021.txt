This stuff is amazing! Whenever I use this, I can expect clearer, brighter, smoother-looking skin the next day. It doesn’t wreak havoc on my skin even though I use Tretinoin about 5xs a week. It is seriously like visiting an esthetician and getting a nice clarifying treatment on my skin. And as always, add a littke extra moisturizer and SPF to your routine wheh using this! Just an FYI: I have dark skin, oily-combo skin, I’m acne prone, and typically non-sensitive. A Major Boost to My Skincare Routine
