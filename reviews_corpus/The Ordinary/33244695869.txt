It’s really good and hydrating but it does not go well under makeup, it makes my makeup look cakey. I would recommend to buy this only if you want to use it for your night skin care only. Other than that, I love how it makes my skin feel, and you do not need to use that much product or else it’ll leave a white cast. not for your makeup routine
