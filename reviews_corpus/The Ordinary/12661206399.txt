Honest review !!!! I was looking for pure form of vitamin C serum and gentle enough to use every day ,I didn’t know what to expect from this product but a gave it a try ….and I’m not regret it ! I’ve been using every morning for a month ! my skin type normal / oily ! I use 2-3 drops and  it’s enough for face a give 2 min after and use moisturizer , I get beautiful glow right away !I’m happy with the result ,will continue to use .Once I opened I store in the fridge . Must try !
