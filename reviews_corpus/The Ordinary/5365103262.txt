I have to admit I was such a skeptic because I’m so used to spending $60 - $100+ on similar products in my skincare routine.  I’m blown away by how beautifully this Niacinamide worked on my skin, how thoughtful and clean the packaging looks, and of course the unbeatable price point. I use after applying HA and then Tretinoin at night before I use my moisturizer. I was blown away at how soft my skin felt and hydrated it looked the next day after incorporating this product. In my personal opinion a must if you’re using any sort of retinoid to keep your skin hydrated. nan
