I purchased this initially bc TIBAL recommended it for redness. I have repurchased many times as it is inexpensive and may be helping my skin but nothing dramatic. I will say this can pill easily under makeup or other products so I use it at night. I also recommend mixing it with moisturizer if you have sensitive skin. It would also be a great mattifying product if you are looking for that. a good option
