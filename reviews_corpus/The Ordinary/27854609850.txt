so good!! i recently bought this and it’s been very amazing on my skin, ive noticed it being so much more hydrated but not oily, i have combination skin and ive noticed this to not create an oily look which i love. i use the origins zero oil toner before this which is why these great results are happening. really recommend this product the ingredients seem very good and it’s super hydrating, such a great serum definitely going to repurchase so good!!
