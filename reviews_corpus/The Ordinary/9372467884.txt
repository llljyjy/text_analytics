I have been honestly surprised at how much thus has truly helped my hormonal cystic acne and small whiteheads. I wouldn’t say I’ve noticed a difference on blackheads but I have very minimal and the cystic acne has been my real concern. This will be a forever product for me. I use am and pm, start slow and gradually build up. The corners of my nose are a lil sensitive so I don’t apply there. I began using it all over and as my skin has cleared up I mostly use as a spot treatment. I’ve found it’s best to let it sink in for 15 minutes or so before finishing up with moisturizer. Worth it and so grateful I found this. Oh and has also helped with my acne scarring too!! Buy this! this is IT broken out friends!
