I have extremely dry skin and this is the best face oil Iâ€™ve ever used. It has helped my skin sooo much and is one of my favourite skincare products ever!!! This is literally my 5th bottle. I wish they (The Ordinary) made a bigger size bc I go through the bottle so fast since I use it everyday. The best Face Oil !!!
