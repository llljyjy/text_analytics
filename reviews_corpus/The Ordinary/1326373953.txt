Bought this as a face moisturizer but it didn’t absorb well. The product just sat on my face and I felt like I was just smearing it around the surface of my skin. However it’s an AMAZING hand moisturizer! It doesn’t have fragrance and is more moisturizing than the average hand cream. Plus it’s super affordable. AMAZING for hands, not so much for face
