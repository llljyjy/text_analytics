I started using Differin and Caudalie Vinoperfect Serum in March of this year, and I’ve definitely noticed some positive changes in my skin, but it was subtle, and my pores still looked huge. Then I added The Buffet to my skincare routine maybe about 2 weeks ago, and I’m astonished. My pores look so much tighter and my skin feels incredible! This was apparently the missing piece that I wish I’d started using sooner. I don’t usually write reviews, but I’m shoooook. Amazing!
