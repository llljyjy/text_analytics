I have been using this product with hyaluronic acid 2%+B5 from the Ordinary. The combination got rid of the milia under my eye (I’ve tried other things before but they never worked!). I would 100% recommend this product if you’re looking for something to keep the hydration in. Bought the mini size to try it out but will now be buying the full size! A must have in my nighttime skincare routine
