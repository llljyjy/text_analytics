I don’t use this on my face because I use retinol at night and vitamin c in the morning. I use this on my body, as recommended by lab muffin (phd cosmetic chemist). You can use amlactin to get AHA for dark spots on your body, or you can use this which is stronger and more affordable. Also works great on the face for dry and normal skin types because it has a strong concentration of Glycolic acid (AHA). The youth to the people make a slightly stronger toner but it’s almost 4 times the price compared to this. Get this one instead, and save your money :) nan
