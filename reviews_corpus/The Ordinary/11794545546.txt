This is a really good product but I find that consistent use is the best for this product as you won’t see results right away I have VERY bad hyperpigmentation and nearing the end of this product I seen some visible changes but not an extreme major difference. it also a very cheap price so I can’t complain I’m sadly not gonna repurchase as I’m trying the topicals faded but I would recommend this product especially for a beginner or someone with not as harsh hyperpigmentation as me consistency is key
