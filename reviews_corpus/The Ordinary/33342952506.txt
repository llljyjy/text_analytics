I love argan oil as a face moisturizer.  It absorbs well if applied to damp skin, I find, and leaves my normally dry skin very soft and supple. I only apply it once per day. I discovered this brand in the fall; normally I have to slather heavy moisturizers on my face twice per day during the winter, but this year I haven’t. I’ve used argan oil for years, and for whatever reason, this brand is superior (and far less expensive) then any other I’ve used.  I find it nearly scent-free, and my skin drinks it up. Better than others
