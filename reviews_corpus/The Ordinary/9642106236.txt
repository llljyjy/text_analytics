2-3 days in with this and two other products from this line ( see post for niacinamide/zinc) i love what my face looks like after using these products; glowy and soft. A little goes a long way  as it takes a long time to get into the skin so you can either spend more time rubbing it into your skin or i like to spread it on my face lightly and let it soak in on its own like a thin mask. Depends how you like your moisturizer
