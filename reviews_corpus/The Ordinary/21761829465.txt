This is THE oil for combination skin! It really moisturizes deeply, not sitting atop the skin like some face oils. But it doesn’t cause breakouts of any kind for me (the cold pressed rosehip seed oil does, sadly) and it gives the best kind of glow to my skin. It does have a strong smell because it’s REAL Argan oil, not scented stuff for your hair, although it works wonders for frizz and flyaways.And you can’t beat the price. 10/10 will always recommend!
