This moisturizes really well, but it takes AGES to soak into my skin. For the first half hour after I apply, my fave sweats no matter what the temperature is. This makes is difficult to apply makeup on top right away, not to mention it’s just unpleasant. So maybe a great night cream, or great for someone who doesn’t wear makeup every day, but I’m going to move on to something else. nan
