I can’t believe how versatile this is, I found after using the glycolic toner, mixing a 2-3 drops with Buffet Anti-Aging Serum and applying the mixture over my skin after the Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 Hydrating Serum worked so incredibly well for me….only after a few days I never saw my skin look it’s best like this, I always had deep cystic acne in my teens and twenties…now I’m 35 and my skin looks it’s better then ever, ALWAYS use a good spf to keep your skin protected Like nothing I’ve ever used
