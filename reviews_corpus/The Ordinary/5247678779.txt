For the longest time since this brand became more well known, I wasn’t interested in them. To be honest it was probably a combination of the packaging and branding, as shallow as it seems I guess I got the impression that it would not be “user friendly“. After hearing from a friend of how much she loved the caffeine serum for her wrinkles on her skin, and also watching a video from Hyram about chemical exfoliation, I wanted to give this a try. I am so glad I did because it has helped so much with the break outs I used to get in my t-zone occasionally, and with evening out my skin texture. I personally don’t use this during the day, I use this as part of my night skincare routine, around 4 times a week. Not everyday as I can feel it might be a bit too much for my skin. New skincare love
