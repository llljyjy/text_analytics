As written in the headline, this product works wonder and is budget friendly. I use it every night before applying my serum and night cream, and Iâ€™ve noticed that my skin texture has dramatically improved. My acne is under control and my scars are healing! I would combined this with the B5 serum for better effect. Works wonder and budget friendly!
