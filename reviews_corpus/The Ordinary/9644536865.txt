Loved this! It is very strong so if it’s your first time using, try getting a smaller concentration of lactic acid, they sell a 5% version as well. I mix a few drops in with my ordinary alpha arbutin, and WOW. It has done wonders for my skin. It has taken care of my whiteheads, acne and also faded away my discolouration. ONLY USE AT NIGHT, and store it in a cool dark place. the bottle says u can use it daily but don’t do that. I would recommend only using it a few days a week and building up your tolerance and seeing how ur skin reacts to it. I use it 2-3 times a week and it’s lovely Whiteheads, acne and discolouration fighter
