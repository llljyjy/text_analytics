I use this for my scalp at least once a week. Twice if I have time. I’ll section out my hair and apply directly to scalp and massage it in, let it marinate for about 20-30 minutes and then go in with an oil treatment to let that sit for a couple hours. I’ve been using the Vegamour growth serum to give it a try but I think it causes breakouts on my scalp so I feel like the Glycolic acid is a helpful item. Not sure I would buy it again because I have nothing else to compare it to and I haven’t been using it long enough to notice a difference. Good for detox hair days
