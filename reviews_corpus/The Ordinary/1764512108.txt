This baby works! I have combo skin, dehydrated skin with a few fine lines. I get the occasional pimple on my chin depending on my hormones. I have been using this product morning & night all over my face, eyes, neck & décolleté. My skin looks great. Doesn’t get crazy shiny. The serum repairs the skin when stressed and heals the breakouts sooner. I also used it on my mom’s skin and she has rosacea. A few minutes later, the redness calmed down. I really suggest this product. Automatic repurchase - it works!
