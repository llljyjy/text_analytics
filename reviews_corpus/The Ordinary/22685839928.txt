I was recommended this due to some skin tags I had under my eyes. I used it every day for 2 weeks and noticed my skin broke out within that time. I then went to using it every other day/3 times a week at night for a month. My skin tags have gone away and my skin has not broke out. Just be mindful how often you use it because it will dry out your skin but helps with skin tags if you have those! nan
