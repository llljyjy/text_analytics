Love this product, mostly because itâ€™s a great product with good ingredients that is not harsh on my bank account lol. it really works wonders for dry skin caused acne or environmental acne. just apply it on cleansed hydrated skin before retinol and collagen treatments. Personally, for me it made my skin balance out and look bouncy again. Great for Dry Skin Acne or Environmental Acne!
