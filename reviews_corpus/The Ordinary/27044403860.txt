I absolutely love this product. I recently (a year ago) decided to get into an ACTUAL face routine and this acid definitely doesn’t let you down. I already had pretty much clear skin, but this basically purged my skin and now it’s spotless. It’s amazing for pimples and helps to control pH. Just make sure that you don’t use another acid with it because it can dry out your skin. phenomenal
