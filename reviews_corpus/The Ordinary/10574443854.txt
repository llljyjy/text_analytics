I love love this.  I wear it during winter before leaving on walks ( -30 in Quebec so this is a must ).  I also wear it before going swimming and I find the chlorine doesn’t dry up my skin as much . It’s really such a great simple product . Whenever u need some extra hydration I put it on and sleep with it . nan
