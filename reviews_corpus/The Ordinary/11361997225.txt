It leaves my faces feeling dry. Not moisturizing enough. I have oily/dry skin. I wanted something that I could wear after using the AHA/BHA peel. But this made my face feel dry and left a paste like feeling on my face. I didnâ€™t like it. Will be returning. I wanted to like it so bad! not moisturizing enough
