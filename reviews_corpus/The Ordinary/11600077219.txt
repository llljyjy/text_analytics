the ordinary niacinamide has been my HG for almost 2 years now!! my face suddenly broke out over the course of a year and I had no idea why. then I incorporated niacinamide to my routine and by the third month, my skin has had less breakouts and irritation. a 30mL bottle usually lasts me 4-5 months if Iâ€™m consistent in only using 2-3 drops per night. holy grail
