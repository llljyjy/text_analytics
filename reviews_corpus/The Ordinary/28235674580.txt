I barely leave reviews, but this deserves one! I live in very dry weather and my skin has been so dry and pigmented for months! I had to change up my whole routine! I found this because of a YouTube video, and holy guacamole is it AMAZING!!! Not only had it hydrated my skin, but in 4 days my pigmentation is able becoming even-toned again. Even my sister noticed. All my dry spots have almost gone away. It goes on like SATIN! I thoroughly enjoy putting this stuff one, and I barely feel like this about anything. This is the pure Vitamin C that my skin has been needing. My skin literally drinks it up. I could go on and on, but I will just say, it’s worth a try! I’ll probably never switch! This is now my go to serum. Especially for the price! You can’t beat it! I used to buy Sunday Riley Vitamin C Serum. Never again. You cannot beat this stuff!!! Noticed a Difference in 4 Days!!!
