Definitely a fan of this serum. I bought this due to the anti aging benefits of peptides along with the “buffet” of other beneficial ingredients. I’ve only used this for about a month but I can already say that I’ve noticed a difference in the plumpness of my skin. It is very hydrating. It feels good going on, is not sticky at all although I do top this with a moisturizer to lock it all in. Sits well under makeup too! Excited to see the benefits with more time. plumps! hydrating
