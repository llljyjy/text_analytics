It’s so sad to see the amount of one star reviews that are incorrect information. This product may not completely fill the jar, but like another reviewer said, if you weigh it, it IS 20 grams. This is such a steal especially for the price & very easy to use. I add a quarter scoop to my essence and it melts right in. I noticed results almost immediately. (If you don’t know the ph of your skincare, you should. So important for your skin.) It is a bit odd the scoop isn’t pre-measured, but it’s not a big deal. The Ordinary is such a wonderful brand, giving us what we need, nothing more, and at a price point that is affordable to most. great product!
