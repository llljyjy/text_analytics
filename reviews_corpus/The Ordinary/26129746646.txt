The texture is so grainy it feels like an exfoliant, it also leaves behind a ’sunscreen’ feeling on your face. When applying this, something in it solidifies and leaves what looks like clay or dough on my fingers that I have to scrape off and it rolls up into similar clumps on the face. The texture is bad.
