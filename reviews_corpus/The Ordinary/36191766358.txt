Simple, effective, does its job and nothing more, nothing less. What I love about The Ordinary is that it’s affordable first of all, but that its not trying to be anything that it’s not. This is a clean, lightweight moisturizer that’s a solid staple in my skincare. I have combination skin and find some moisturziers to be too heavy. This one, even on top of three serums, melts into the skin and sits nicely under makeup. Not trying too hard.
