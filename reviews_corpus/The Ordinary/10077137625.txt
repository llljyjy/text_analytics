This stuff definitely works, and roughly a pea size goes a long way! Just be careful since it’s a little drying, but it’s overall not an issue for me because I have oily skin. I apply it at night before bed and the next day my skin looks brighter and calmer. It can be applied over a light serum but I wouldn’t recommend putting any skin care or make up on top of it. nan
