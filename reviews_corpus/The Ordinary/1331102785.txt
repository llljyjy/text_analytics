This line is not for everyone! Don’t let the low price point entice you to abandon your current skincare regimen, like I did. My sensitive skin broke out like a teen’s after a very short period of use and immediately cleared up after cessation. This product and line work great for some - maybe even most - but if you’ve got sensitive skin, this is not for you. I went back to the more costly Sunday Riley products and haven’t looked back. In some instances, price does matter in terms of quality. Don’t do it if you’re sensitive!
