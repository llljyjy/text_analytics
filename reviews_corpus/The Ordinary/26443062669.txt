I always thought my skin was oily but this product seriously dried out my skin so I guess my skin wasn’t oily enough.  It definitely removes the oil, dries out you skin, smooths your skin, and adds shine.  I think I’m going to stop using it because my skin began peeling.  I might have naturally dry skin I think.  I gave it a three because I got more acne, but my skin was smoother.  I’m not sure if that makes sense.  But I totally recommend if you have oily skin.  I do not though.  Also, it is very sticky.  The second you put it on your face dries and it feels gross and sticky.  But, after you put moisturizer and your creams it will feel normal again, so don’t get freaked out if it feels sticky because it goes away. Only if you have oily skin.
