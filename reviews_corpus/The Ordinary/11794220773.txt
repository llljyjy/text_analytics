don’t buy this if your skin is satisfied with the normal squalane oil…i used to use the ordinary’s squalane oil and it was really good except for the fact that it was so oily that sometimes it would smudge my eye makeup. and i found this one, which was supposed to be lighter/thinner than the squalane oil, not to mention cheaper, so i bought it.but my god when i tell you my skin is actually in PAIN because of how little this product moisturises my face… or maybe it’s the combination with the niacinimide? idk but man, i do not recommend this product if you’ve used the squalane oil and are satisfied with it nan
