I love this little magic bottle. This exfoliating peeling solution has done wonders on my dark spot and definitely smooth my texture skin and even my skin tone. But WARNING if you have very sensitive skin this might not be for you. My skin is sensitive but not too sensitive. When you first use this product it’s definitely going to burn, sting and tingle. But for me it’s definitely worth it. nan
