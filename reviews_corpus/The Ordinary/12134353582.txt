i had a massive breakout, which never happens to me. i went to the doctor since i thought it was an allergic reaction. my insurance wouldnt cover azelaic acid so the doctor recommended buying this brand! my face cleared within 4 days. i use it a few times a week now & no issues since! i love it! nan
