this is a great moisturizer especially for the price point but on its own, it’s not hydrating enough for me & can be a little hard to rub in. however, i’ve found a way to avoid these issues & now it’s become my fav moisturizer & best of all it’s only $10!!! i like to mix in a couple drops of an oil (marula is great!) to help mitigate the dryness i get and also to help it rub in better! i definitely think this is a moisturizer everyone should try! simple & affordable, but needs help
