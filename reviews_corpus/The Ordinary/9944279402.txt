I had high hopes for this one but I’m at the end of my bottle & don’t feel confident that this particular serum helped much. I do use several products & never miss my skincare routine day & night so I have had steady improvements. I don’t think I will repurchase this one. I will likely go for the more expensive, more potent similiar one. If I feel I’m missing something after I trade this one out, I will update my thoughts. I do think it’s a nice serum but I might just need something else. I do absolutely love The Ordinary so I will continue trying to perfect my routine with their many affordable & effective options. nan
