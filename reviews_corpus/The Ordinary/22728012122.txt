This is one of the better Vitamin C products I’ve tried. It is very granular and works best if you mix it in with some serum or moisturizer. It doesn’t sting too much and mixes well. I don’t like the film like feeling it leaves on my face, so I’m still on the hunt for my perfect Vitamin C product. I would repurchase in a pinch, but hoping to find something better nan
