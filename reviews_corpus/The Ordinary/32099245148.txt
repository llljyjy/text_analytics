I use this once a month Nd notice a huge difference in my skin when I do. I have oily skin, but it isn’t acne prone so I don’t feel like I need this more than once a month. It leaves me feeling so fresh and clean and like I have shed a month’s worth of excess skin cells, sebum and regulates production nan
