hi there, I went on Accutane a few years back, and my skin was going good up till the pandemic started and I started working in hospital in 2021. I where masks/N95s mostly and my acne came back with a vengeance. I have only been using this for a couple weeks, but so far it has been helping. not with the new acne but with the old scars/dark spots so well see how it goes long-term! (will add more as I get new results) nan
