After using the regular size buffet serum over the last 6 months, i HAD to invest in the bigger bottle! It feels really light on skin, and doesn’t feel sticky at all. Aftera few days, I began to notice that my skin felt soft,hydrated, and healthy. This became consistent withcontinued use, and now I can’t live without it. Noproduct has ever been able to make my skin lookand feel as good as the ordinary buffet serum has. Ilove it!!EDIT Get it!!
