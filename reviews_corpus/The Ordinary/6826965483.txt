i love the ordinary and i have alot of their products incorporated into my skin care routine both morning and night. i thought this serum would be a good addition to my PM routine but i felt as though it made my skin flaky in the mornings and didnt do much for me. i ended up removing it from my routine all together. Not bad not great just meh
