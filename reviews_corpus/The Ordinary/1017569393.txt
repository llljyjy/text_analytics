About a month ago, perhaps a weather change caused it, but my skin dried out horribly and was flaking and I just couldn’t do anything to make it stop. I stumbled upon a Deciem/Ordinary store while in NYC and went in and asked if they had anything for my issue. I’m always happy to try Ordinary products at these prices. They suggested the Amino Acids and from first use, I could feel the hydration boost and the flakiness was completely gone within a few days! I use it morning and night before serums and moisturizer and it keeps my skin silky smooth. My face is as smooth as my kid’s!I slacked off my skincare for a week when I had covid and in that time I could feel the texture change and get bumpy and dry again. Back on the Amino Acids and after a few days it bounced right back. I feel this will be in my regimen until I die. Fixed my dry skin and improved texture immediately
