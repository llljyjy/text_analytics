I bought this serum in hopes it will help and control my acne/bumps (not that severe just tiny breakouts). I’ve been using it for a month and have seen no difference in my skin on that department. I’ve noticed my skin has become more glowy though. I’m not sure if it’s because of this. I am trying to love it and will continue for another few months but the results haven’t been coming as I had hoped. Not sure yet
