I really love this product. I have very sensitive dry skin but this did not irritate or burn me. I leave it on for the full 10 minutes. I use this only once a week because I am about to add in a retinol serum to my skincare routine. My only complaint is with this peeling solution and I don’t know if anyone else experience this, but the day after using it, I wake up to a few tiny white heads in my T zone that pops so easily. But the next day - two days after using this - they are gone. I had a few facial mask that did that to my skin too. It’s like my face has to go through one tiny break out before it gets better. Good stuff
