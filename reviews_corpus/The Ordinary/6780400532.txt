Only purchased this product b/c I saw the tiktok beauty hack of people using it b/c it supposedly worked for dark armpits and replaced deodorant. While I can’t attest of the lightening of the under arms, I can attest that it actually completely deodorizes. I live in a super hot state where it’s typically 90 degrees all day and having been using this for weeks now. I have not had to use deodorant since I started using this and I don’t have any smell at all. I use once a day after my shower and do not have to reapply until the next shower. I’m literally amazed! You will however still sweat if you’re running around outside or working out. I have not had any irritation or bad smell. I am loving this! TikTok Beauty Hack for deodorant replacement works
