I have dry skin and it makes my face peel so I use it for back acne instead. It’s amazing. My back acne problem has been bothering me for years, even salicylic acid doesn’t work. I use the toner after shower every day and there’s no new acne ever since. Scars are still here but they are fading. Will continue using it and 100% recommended. holy grail
