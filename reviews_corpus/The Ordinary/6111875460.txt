I look forward to the days that I use this! I use it 2 times a week for 10 minutes each. One at night, and then 3 days after in the morning (I do a hair mask on this day so it was convenient). It only stings for about minute on my jawline, but it’s not uncommon (with other products as well) because I have hormonal acne that breaks out on and around that area. My face is visibly brighter, redness reduced, and skin a bit firmer after using this! I would recommend if you build your skin tolerance with AHA’s and BHA’s first before using the peel. It was a year of building tolerance for me. nan
