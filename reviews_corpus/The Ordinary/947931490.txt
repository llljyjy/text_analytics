Works beautifully. Make sure to seal this in with moisturizer. Keeps skin supple, works well under makeup, just make sure you have left a few minutes for drying before priming. I use it AM and PM, and my skin has a great luminosity. I only need the smallest amounts of foundation to even out skin tone! Tried and true.
