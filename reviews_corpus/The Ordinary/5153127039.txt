Okay, I personally don’t use this on my face because it’s pretty strong and I already use tretinoin nightly.  That being said, RUB THIS ALL OVER YOUR BODY POST-SHOWER FOR THE *SOFTEST* SKIN OF YOUR LIFE!  For real, It’s better than lotion - it will make you baby-soft, seriously.  No scrub or oil has ever done this for me.  And It’s so cheap for a huge bottle of it, It’ll last me well over a year, I can already tell.  Try it! Body, not Face
