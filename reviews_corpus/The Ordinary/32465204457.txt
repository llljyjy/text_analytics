It works for me! I have dry/combination skin. No major acne, but there’s usually a pimple or two that comes up. This product helped active pimples go away more quickly. A couple of weeks in and my skin is pretty darn clear. I apply a small amount to my whole face which seems to help clear up clogged pores before they can become breakouts. I *think* the oil base helps to gently draw out buildup from clogged pores, but I don’t know if actual science would back me up. The texture of this serum is lightly oily and very runny. I have to spread it right away or it will run right off my face. A little goes a long way - more than a few drops makes my skin feel too oily. If you have oily skin, you might not like it - unless you already know that your skin likes squalene. No added fragrance (as always with The Ordinary). The natural smell of this product is not very strong, maybe a bit like crayons? But only if you really stick it right under your nose. I prefer it to the alcohol smell that usually comes from salicylic acid spot treatments, and I don’t notice any scent after I apply it. Good for Keeping Dry Skin Clear
