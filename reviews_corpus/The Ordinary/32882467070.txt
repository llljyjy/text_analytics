I was so impressed by this product! I have sensitive acne prone skin, so I started by using a couple drops 2 times a week, and after a month of using it, my skin has been so smooth, and I have noticed less black and whiteheads that used to form. I think with slow use, this is good for even sensitive skins. Just make sure to use a repairing moisturizer or balm to make sure youâ€™re not damaging your skin too much, I like the La Roche Posay cicapair balm. If you do have acne too, I recommend not picking your skin before applying this, it will burn, but I promise I see better results without picking my skin, the acne/marks go away quicker! Its super affordable too so I will definitely repurchase. Good for acne prone and sensitive skin!
