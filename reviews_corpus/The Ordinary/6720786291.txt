I really like this product, I’ve been using it for about 2 years now as part of my daily routine. It gives me a lovely glow, it has helped with my pores and pimples. Texture feels nice for my oily skin and a little goes a long way. I doesn’t irritate my skin and I do have sensitive skin.Overall, I would recommend! nan
