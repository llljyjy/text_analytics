originally bought this for someone over a year ago, and it completely cleared up his acne after a couple weeks so i decided to try it for my hormonal acne that has recently popped up. it worked wonders for that, and also significantly helped with my boyfriendâ€™s beard acne. definitely would recommend, if you have more sensitive skin like me, i would use it for less than the recommended time and only once a week rather than twice. such an amazing product for the price :) Amazing for price :)
