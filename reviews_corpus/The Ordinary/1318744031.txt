Personally would never use this on my skin but wonderful for greasy scalps that are prone to build up.  Was using cider vinegar for this purpose but it left a smell even after washing. This has a nice floral scent. Appreciate the nozle cap makes it easy for getting through the scalp. I use this 1-2x week about an hour before washing. Price is certainley right! wonderful for scalp health
