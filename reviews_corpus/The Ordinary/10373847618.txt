I absolutely this Argan Oil by The Ordinary! Along w/all of their other products. I think I own every single one just about, I use this anywhere from hair, to burns, to razor burn, to sooth sensitive irritated skin on face and body, on feet, the list goes on…I highly recommend adding this to your beauty collection! I couldn’t live w/o it! ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED WITH “THE ORDINARY”!
