This serum is so wonderful. I have been using it for almost a month and my skin looks more radiant than ever. Multiple people have commented “you’re glowing!“ I actually notice more suppleness as well which I’ve literally never experienced with other products. I don’t usually write reviews but this has been a total game changer for me and wanted to share. It also gives the appearance of shrinking my pores and evening out my skin tone... like woah. very luminous. try it! you won’t be disappointed. I’m 30, have sensitive oily skin with some scarring and occasional breakouts. This has not been irritating whatsoever. Not recommended to use with exfoliants or retinol. I use it each morning. Never Giving This Up!
