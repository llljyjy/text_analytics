I really wanted to love this product but it gave me a few reasons not to. I honestly didn’t see any difference even after using it consistently for a month. The texture is too liquid-y and oily! I also started getting break outs on my forehead, I’ve never had breakout on my forehead before. Of course every skin is different so yes I’d recommend you try it out yourself. I wanted to love it but.
