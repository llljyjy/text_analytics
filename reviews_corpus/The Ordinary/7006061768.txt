I’ve heard so many good reviews about this brand and product that I gave it a go.I have sensitive + overall dry + combination skin that’s very weak to stress (hormonal pimples & mask pimples). Thankfully, I no longer break out in painful pimples from masks but it left me with a lot of uneven skin tone.I wanted to even out my skin tone with this product but from the first use, I noticed a slight burning sensation on my skin immediately after I tried it on. I thought maybe that’s how it works but it was a bit uncomfortable.I gave it a try for 3-4 days and finally decided I need to trust my gut feeling and acknowledge that this product is just not for me. Not for everyone
