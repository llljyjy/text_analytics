This pills immediately and there is nothing you can do to stop it.  I tried it with a ph 5 balanced toner. Nope.  I tried without anything on my face. Nope.  I tried it over a moisturizer. Nope.  It pills. Period.  If anyone had a solution, please share!  If I paid $50 I would return it but for $8 Iâ€™ll just toss it. PILLS
