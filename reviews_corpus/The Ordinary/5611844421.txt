I have always been using Biossance Squalene oil but wanted try this out because of the great reviews. It caused me to breakout with tiny little pimples and some white heads, something similar other person experienced here in the reviews. The difference I saw in both oil texture is, this is thicker and Biossance is more watery, maybe my combination skin couldnâ€™t handle the oil heaviness which clogged the pores. I use this in the morning to moisturize after waking up. I will have to go back to my earlier brand. Will continue to use for my body instead. Moisturizing but heavy on skin
