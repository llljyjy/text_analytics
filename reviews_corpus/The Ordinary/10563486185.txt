To be honest I don’t know if this works or not. The smell was absolutely awful. It smelled like pennies and the smell stayed on my skin for 1-2 days even after washing my face. When I used it by itself I found it had a really weird texture and rubbed off my face like dead skin. It was so weird. So I mixed it with a serum to see if that helped and it didn’t rub off like before but I just can’t get passed the smell. nan
