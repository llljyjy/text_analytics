Got this for my face, but realize it is best for my upperArms and legs where I have a little bit of KP and minor bumps. I can tell significantly the bumps are either minimized or/and the area is soft. I definitely will buy again. I put it on my arms and thighs and buttocks before my lotions or butters. Wish I took a photo ahead of time to show you! nan
