I am absolutely floored by this product. I am fairly new to acids and have a simple routine for my skincare. My face gets some AHA from a Vichy mask 1-2 times a week, but other than that - no acid facial products. I have fine lines on my forehead that have not been responding to anything else I have tried - but I am noticing a difference in them within a few days of using this!I am prone to breaking out with new products and truly had no reaction with this! Definitely going to be part of my long term regime.I have Absolutely amazing!
