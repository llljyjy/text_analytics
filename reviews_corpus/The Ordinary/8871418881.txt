I freaking love this moisturizer!! I have normal to dry skin and I live in the Midwest so it gets reallllyyy cold here in the winter. I use this daily and it makes my skin feel so nice. I would use this with an oil or thicker moisturizer for any really dry spots during the cold. I use this every day and still have so much left! With the price point too, itâ€™s a must! nan
