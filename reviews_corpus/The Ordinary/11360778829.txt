You get what you pay for. I have dry skin so maybe that’s why I think it under performed so much  because it definitely did not feel like it was hydrating my skin. It also went on super streaky and took forever to soak in. After drying on my skin, it made my face feel tacky like it was a primer. I couldn’t even bring myself to use the whole bottle and gave the rest of it to a friend that likes it. nan
