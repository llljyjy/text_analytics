This is just ok for me. I love The Ordinary and use many of their products religiously and to incredible healing effect. However this moisturizer doesn’t wow me enough to change my brand. I do not care for this packaging, I find it difficult to get anything out of it, especially when it gets down to the dregs. It is a lighter consistency, spreads well and doesn’t pill. I use Purito though for my moisture. Their deep sea water cream is divine, and their Cica Barrier sleeping pack are the best for my skin. nan
