Unfortunately I didn’t realize the texture of the product was tiny granules. I didn’t exactly do my research, but had I read the product information I would’ve realized it is meant to be this way.Sits on the skin weird, doesn’t exactly “melt“ into your skin the way you’d want a face product to do, the grains feel strange. On top of this, when adding a sunscreen on top, makes the product more dry than it was meant to be. Will be returning. Granules feel strange
