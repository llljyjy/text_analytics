At first I didn’t like this because of the graininess but honestly this stuff is NOT bad at all for the price and I have to say I like the results it gives me 10x more other vit c serums and creams. The trick that makes it work for me, is putting it on AS SOON as I’m finished washing my face, barely having patted it dry. The key is putting it on wet/damp skin (the level of dampness is up to you) but I swear that’s what makes the biggest differenceI think the graininess actually gives your skin a light exfoliation each time, which is why I also think my skin improved so much while wearing it. And the glow!!! Love it. A great morning staple piece at an extremely affordable price Give it another try!
