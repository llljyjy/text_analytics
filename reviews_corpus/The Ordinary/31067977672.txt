I really tried to love this. Iâ€™ve purchased and used this on two separate occasions. The first year I tried this once a week and my skin was RUINED for months. I already had clear skin but after this it broke me out with SO many pimples. I had never experienced acne like that in my life. I tried it a second time this year to see if there was any change, but it still broke me out. Luckily I stopped soon enough for me to be able to get my skin back to normal this time. nan
