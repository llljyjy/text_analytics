This is amazing for the price, I’ve only been using it for 3 months but I’ve seen better results from this than a whole year of using Paula’s choice retinol. Dark marks have lighted drastically  with the help of regular exfoliating n sunscreen) but my texture is so nice now! I’m 24 and scarring and congested skin is always been a problem. After switching to Korean skin care and discovering this my face has completely changed. My skin feels amazing now!
