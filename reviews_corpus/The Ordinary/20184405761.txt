I use and try a lot of skin care, I DO NOT LIKE THIS ONE! I gave it 2 stars for the price point, which is the only redeeming quality. The skin does look more glowy, as to be expected from A niacinamide, but when you press it into the skin the texture is yucky and turns milky. Good molecules makes a better niacinamideï¿¼ Try good molecules instead for the same price
