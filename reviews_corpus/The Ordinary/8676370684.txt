I naturally have dark circles around my eyes, and this eye serum - I felt made my skin appear more darker than lighter. I am a big fan of the ordinary but this has to be the 1st product from them that I rate 1/5. The only good thing about the serum is… a little goes a long way. Just didn’t do it’s job
