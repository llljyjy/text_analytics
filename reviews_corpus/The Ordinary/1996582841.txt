I received a full bottle as a gift, so free and I still tossed it. I’ve tried several other hyaluronic acid serums and this one is ridiculously sticky. No clue how people are using this under cream or make up. I kept on over night and made me break out. I never break out and didn’t even have acne as a teen. I have somewhat dry skin- I can’t see this helping people with dry or oily skin. I would invest in something a little more expensive Sticky
