I LOVE this product!!! I recommend it to any and everyone who has acne. I apply 5-7 nights a week, with a retinol the other day or 2 if at all. This has done wonders for my acne around my chin and cheeks - it subdues any painful zits I do get and if I can stop myself from touching my acne this helps shrink it! It is slightly drying so have to make sure you moisturize well but I canâ€™t recommend it enough! Amazing
