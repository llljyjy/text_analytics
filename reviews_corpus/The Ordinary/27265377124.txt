I do like how moisturizing this is although it does take awhile to soak into my skin, as i try and blend it into my skin i feel like i’m just moving the product around, i don’t think i’m using too much either though i could be wrong, i do like how cheap it is though, once i run out i don’t think i’ll get it again though It's nice
