Sis! You need this! It was a little too harsh for my niece. She’s 19 with perfect skin, so she let me try it. I am 45, most people guess about 35… but people who know skin say it’s “dull”. I tried this last night and was absolutely SHOOK! Rinsing it off my skin felt completely different and the glow!! Gurl I almost took a pregnancy test!! Lol!!!! I followed it with their hyaluronic acid (I use it twice a day) and their peptide moisturizer (I use it at night). Also like I do most of my face routine, I pull it down my neck AND always the back in my hands. I was SHOOK! Honest instant glow
