I have never even thought about writing a Sephora review before but I need to because this product literally changed my life. Trust me I have the driest skin EVER. I use the most moisturizing products on the market multiple times a day but I have never achieved my goal of being able to apply concealer or foundation seamlessly without dry patches and crustiness. I rarely even wear makeup at all because the dryness just makes it look terrible. HOWEVER, with this product, my skin is more hydrated than ever before. I can seamlessly apply makeup and my cheeks actually feel soft to the touch after I get out of the shower or wake up in the morning, rather than tight and rough. I apply 1 drop in the morning and 3 drops at night under my moisturizer (FAB Ultra Repair Cream). I only do 1 drop in the morning because I feel like with my sunscreen my face would be a little too oily for my liking. I canâ€™t say how great this product would be for oily skin, but if you have the driest skin ever like me, YOU NEED THIS :) thank me later life changing
