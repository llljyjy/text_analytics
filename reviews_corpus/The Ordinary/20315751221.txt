I was not expecting how good this serum was going to be to my skin, I constantly struggle with chin breakouts and they have been under control since I started using this product. It does feel oily when you apply it but the skin absorbs it quickly and doesnâ€™t feel bad after. I highly recommend to give it a try if you are struggling with acne. my new fav!
