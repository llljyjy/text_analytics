i used glycolic acid for 6+ months exclusively after regular deodorant gave me a chemical burn. worked longer than deodorant and got me through summer. also lighted the dark marks the chemical burns left on my skin, now that skin is lighter than before having the burns (i had darker underarm skin from shaving ) amazing for dark marks
