So I had been using Retinal alone in the PM for about a month and it worked but once I added this to my routine, it cleared my skin so good!! I did go through about 2 weeks of skin purging and let me tell you, it was ROUGH! But I stayed the course and now my skin is clearer than ever. I have not used this product by itself and in my skincare research Retinal and Niacinamide are besties. Definitely  a great product to have in your skincare routine! This kicks some serious acne butt!!
