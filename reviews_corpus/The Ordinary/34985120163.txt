I never leave reviews, but this product has completely transformed my skin so I figured I should. As noted, this product should only be used ~2 times/week and should not be left on skin for more than 10 minutes. I have used this product for a couple of weeks and each time I have been amazed at how soft, moisturized, and glowy my skin is afterwards. I have larger pores on my nose and cheeks and all the other products I’ve used seem to clear my pores, but have never really “shrunk“ them like this product has. Not to mention the fact that I haven’t touched my moisturizer in days because of how moisturized my skin is! After using this product, I use the Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% Oil Control Serum. If you struggle with uneven skin, dull skin, or larger pores, I highly recommend both these products!! Incredible Product!
