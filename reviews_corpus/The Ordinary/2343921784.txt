Product arrived rancid, so can’t give a review of it in it’s proper state. Unfortunately, it sounds like that has happened to quite a few other people.I have purchased/used other brand versions of rose hip seed oil and understand it has an earthy smell (which I don’t mind). This is not that, it is distinctly rancid. I suspect this product has a very short shelf life and has not been kept in ideal conditions. I would suggest checking out other brands. Rancid Oil
