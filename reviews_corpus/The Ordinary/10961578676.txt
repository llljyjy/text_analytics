I like this moisturizer. I will admit, I am a bit uneducated when it comes to prepping and priming the skin before foundation, however, I do use this moisturizer (and no primer) before I do my makeup and it comes out looking great. So I’d say this is a pretty good moisturizer. Feels a bit tacky when applying it but melts into skin right after It’s good
