Wow, this product helped with ingrown hairs and keratosis pilaris I was experiencing on the backs of my thighs very soon into using it (like within a week), and I noticed another positive review about it helping with deodorant, true. I use it under my arms (without additional product mind you) and there is no smell, all day and night, I’m guessing the acid prevents it but I don’t know. The only downside is if you have freshly shaved skin or any irritation it will probably sting like crazy, and lowkey I feel the results on my body have been more noticeable than those on my face, but to be fair I was already big on exfoliating my face so there isn’t much dead skin to remove. Anyway it’s $10, and works, I would highly recommend it unless your skin is sensitive. A new staple!
