i buy 3 of these at a time! it has become such a staple in my regimen. i have naturally oily skin so i was always staying away from oily serums but this really changed my mind about that! my skin was lacking hydration so it was overproducing oils and this has kept my oily skin under control. i mainly use this at night with my moisturizer and other serum and it works perfectly. it’s more of a water based serum so if you have oily skin like i do, it’s worth the try! worth the try!
