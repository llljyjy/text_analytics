If you have dry and/or sensitive skin this shouldnt be for you. This cleanser has dried my skin so much that I ended up throwing the item away. Days of moisturizing has not help restore my skin. Also, careful of the end of the tube, it opened up when I received it. It claims to be a makeup remover but thatâ€™s not the case. Not for me
