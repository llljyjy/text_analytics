I use this a few times a week (I alternate between this and my azelaic acid for my acne). I feel that the nights I use this my skin looks and feels great the next morning! I donâ€™t believe Iv been using this long enough (still on my first bottle but almost done) to notice the long-term side effects. However, I do feel like short-term it is doing something. I suffer from acne scars and feel as if my skin has become more smooth overall with this. Worth a try! Give it a Try!
