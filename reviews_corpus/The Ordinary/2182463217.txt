I love this product! It is super hydrating, feels good and smells good. I find that my skin, which is dry, takes in the oil really well and feels hydrated and supple after application. I also love using this for gua sha and facial massage, as it helps to glide the tool over my skin and itâ€™s easier to massage my face with my hands after applying this oil. nan
