I don’t write many reviews- And this review is not based on results as of yet-I have such trouble with eye creams I always feel they are heavy, and they migrate which then irritates my eyes even when I estimate for the migration of product! Some how it always migrates into my eyes.  This product is serum consistency, 1 drop for each eye is PLENTY so this bottle will last forever but the application glides on, with no tugging which I experience with some heavier eye creams. This product does not migrate, sting or irritate my eyes. It is cooling on application and I think it would provide further puff reduction if refrigerated. It’s not sticky unless you use to much.  I’ve been using it a few days and I apply heavier at night then I do in the am. I do see a reduction in puffiness after application but as far as reduction in discoloration or wrinkles it is to soon. It just feels so hydrating that even if I see minimal results I will use it as a base for another eye cream if needed. As far as pilling I don’t wear makeup on the daily so I don’t know how it reacts under makeup but I find letting your skincare settle into pores for 20 min before makeup application generally prevents that. I have fair sensitive maturing skin so this was also super gentle on my 42yo skin. Hydrating, eye serum! No more tugging!
