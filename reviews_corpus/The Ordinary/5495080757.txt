This was the first product I’ve purchased by The Ordinary and I was a bit nervous about using it just because my skin can be a bit sensitive. I had no issues with this mask whatsoever. It does sting a bit but it’s tolerable and it has made a notable difference in the texture and brightness of my skin. It has also improved the appearance of some older scars from acne. I loved this mask so much, I bought it for my best friend as well. I don’t know too much about all the different exfoliators but I did know enough to know not to use this with any other acids. I use a hydrating serum and moisturizer afterwards and definitely make sure to wear sunscreen when going outdoors. 10/10 will be purchasing this again. I love it. nan
