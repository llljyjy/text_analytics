So far I used once and there was a noticeable difference. My face was smooth. I did see pimples start surfacing..I have a very oily t zone with the rest of my skin being normal.  I used it early afternoon and by the time I woke up the next day I literally had about 1/3 of the oiliness I would have had This that ishhh
