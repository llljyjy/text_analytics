dry, sensitive skin approved!! just a few months ago, i had a cystic acne flare that left a few scars (as seen in first photo) which led me to trying this product out. i’ve been using this product daily for almost a month now and i am extremely impressed with the results :) it does leave a slightly tacky feeling upon application but it isn’t anything too bothersome as it goes away once i moisturize i will definitely continue using this and will purchase again in the future!!also, don’t forget to use spf with this product :) noticeable difference in weeks!
