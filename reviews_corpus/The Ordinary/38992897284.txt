i wear a lot of mascara and this takes it all off. i find the best way to apply it is to put some on your fingers, and tap your whole face to get the product everywhere and THEN start to actually rub it around. the product will be all over your face making it easier to spread and take off your makeup. however, just be careful when using it to clean your eye makeup as sometimes it can irritate your eyes if you get it in them. however, i love it so much that i donâ€™t even care about that. 100% recommend.
