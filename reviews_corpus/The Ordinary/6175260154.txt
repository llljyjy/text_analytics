I use this before I put my tretinoin on at night, or in the morning underneath my moisturizer and sunscreen. Dries fast, doesn’t cause pilling or breakouts and the skin looks plump. It doesn’t feel luxurious but it does its job well and for this price you can’t beat it. So if you’re on a budget and you need some HA for your skin, this does the job well!! great simple addition to your skincare routine
