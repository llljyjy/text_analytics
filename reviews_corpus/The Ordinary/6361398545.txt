This works really well for acne marks right after I pop a pimple and it leaves a mark. It’ll literally get rid of it within a week. That being said,  it’s not very effective on hyperpigmentation. I noticed my skin tone looking slightly more even after long term use but did not get rid of or noticeably lighten dark spots/sunspots/etc. Good only for acne marks
