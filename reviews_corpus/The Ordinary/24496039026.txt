Let me start by saying Iâ€™ve never been clinically diagnosed with acne rosacea but based on reading I believe I have it - But I do have noticeable redness that fits the description.I started using this product a few months ago. While I saw some noticeable improvement in my skin immediately, the best result for me is now months in where my redness is significantly lower, texture is much improved, and I am beginning to see some fading in dark spots (note I do use other products that help fade these though).Sure the product is a bit drying, but just be sure to use other moisturizing and hydrating products in your routine. I also say give this a good 5-10 minutes to absorb into the skin before applying your next product - it prevents pilling and makes for a better overall experience.After months of trying to find a product to help with my self-diagnosed acne rosacea, this was finally the one that made a big difference.
