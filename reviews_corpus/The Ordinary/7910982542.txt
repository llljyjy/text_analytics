I used this maybe 2-3 times within the last week and a half. Im aware it is important to slowly incorporate new skincare so I was being careful and didn’t introduce anything else into my skincare during this time. After a few days it started to break me out ! I’ve heard niacinamide is generally more effective in smaller amounts, 2-5% and 10% is just too concentrated for my skin I think. I would incorporate this carefully and watch how your skin reacts. Works well for some but not for all unfortunately Made me breakout
