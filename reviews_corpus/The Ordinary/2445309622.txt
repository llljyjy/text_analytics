I have mixed feelings about this cleanser. It doesn’t get the job done on it’s own. I’m first using an oil cleanser to take off my make up and then using this to clean my skin. I like the way my skin feels after. It doesn’t feel overly greasy, nor does it strip my skin. I will continue to look for cleansers similar to this, but with a little more oomph. OK
