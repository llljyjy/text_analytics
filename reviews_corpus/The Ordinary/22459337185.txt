I hit 49 and was suddenly faced with peri menopause and all it’s glorious side effects. The worst one is a complete change in my complexion. For the first time, I experienced significant breakouts, blotchy redness and very dry, itchy, flaky skin. The squalane cleanser is my lifesaver. From day one, my skin started to return to normal. And the Azelaic Acid Suspension is the perfect finish. The occasional pimple, patch of dryness, or broken blood vessel are completely gone by morning. I can’t live without this cleanser!!!! Lifesaver for peri menopause skin!
