I’ve tried many different moisturizers and this one is definitely one of my favorites. Skin feels so fresh and I’ve noticed it makes my face look so clean. Although when you first apply, there is some white cast similar to how sunscreen looks, but it absorbs into your skin and takes no longer than a minute for that effect to disappear. I’ve gone through at least four 100mL bottles and have no indentions to stop. Very lightweight and hydrating, plus it has a lovely smell to it. ANDD its affordable!!!! The ordinary does it again!!
