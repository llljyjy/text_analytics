I’m someone who suffers from dry flaky skin in the winter / my forehead and nose especially. I pat squalane on now every night after rinsing my face / before my night mask and I haven’t had ANY flakiness since! Been using for about 3 months now and my face has never been more moisturized. I wash it off in the morning & This is the first winter in my adult life that I don’t have brittle dry skin ♥️ amazing for winter dryness
