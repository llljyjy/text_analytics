I use this cleanser daily as it does not strip my skin and always leaves it feeling soft and hydrated. This product took time for me to fall in love with as I did not read the directions and did not realize the product needed to be warmed up for it to work. I usually rub the product between my hands for about 30-50 seconds to loosen the oils. I have nit tried this product to remove heavy makeup as I typically wear lighter makeup, filling in my brows lightly and mascara. Favourite Cleanser
