It works great!! it burns a bit when you first put it on until you get used to it. it has a gritty texture. if either of those bother you Sephora offers a less intense vitamin c cream and it isnâ€™t gritty. this one has the best effect though as it is stronger. watching the video about it here is VERY informative and I absolutely recommend. I put it on my face twice a week at night before bed. and then wash it off in the morning. start off doing it once a week until your face gets used to it. it does have a bit of a smell like old pennies but you get used to it. Works AMAZING
