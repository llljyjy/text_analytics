I did not find this to be anything out of the ordinary (no pun intended). I had just finished using up a 1oz bottle this evening and these are my thoughts on it: 1. the formula is sticky and leaves your face and hands feeling that way after apply 2. I noticed no increase of temporary or long term hydration. However, I’m not knocking off points for that because it is water based and as a person with balanced to dry skin I tend to need things that are oil based. 3. Lastly, I noticed a price increase. When I purchased this bottle it was $12 and now it’s $16 but the formula and packaging is the same. Overall, I think it’s okay if you’re on a budget and have oily skin. Sticky and not hydrating
