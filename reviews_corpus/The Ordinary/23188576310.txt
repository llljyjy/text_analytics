it’s an oil good for hair and skin, it does what it is intended to do. i would recommend for anyone with less dry skin to save this oil for the colder months as it could be heavy for warm weather but in general it’s pretty lightweight for a basic formula. it is moisturizing and greater for dry patches on the skin. i apply a drop or two by rubbing my palms together and patting it into my skin. it’s worth the price for how long it can last. i see people talking about the ’scent’ it has and i think that’s dramatic. it’s an oil, it smells like oil i don’t know what else to say. it goes away the second it’s applied and is completely unnoticeable. overall good product. it does what it is supposed to
