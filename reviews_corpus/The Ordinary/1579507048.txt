I really love this product. I’m 45 and have a lot of issues with bumpy facial skin and severe redness/rosacea on one side of my face. I wanted a simplified skincare routine so AM has been the Ordinary HA serum followed by the natural moisturizing factors then Cerave sunscreen.  PM has been The Ordinary squalane cleanser after a cleansing balm followed by this azelaic acid treatment. By far my fave product from this line I’ve tried. My skin has never felt so smooth and there is no irritation on my super sensitive skin. Texture and dark spots have been improving. Definitely purchasing more. Skin feels SO smooth
