I’ve had on and off acne problems for 10+ years, I bought this because I needed some targeted acne skincare after having some breakouts emerge. I can’t tell if it’s really making a difference with my acne areas but my face as a whole looks less congested. I think I’ll keep looking for a spot treatment but will use this up and maybe repurchase. Decent for decongesting skin
