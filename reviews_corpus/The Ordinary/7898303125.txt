I have only been using this product for three days, but I already noticed a huge decrease in the amount of blackheads I had before starting this product. I bought this product specifically to tackle the problematic blackheads on my nose, and it definitely met expectations. I did not try using it for acne yet, so Iâ€™m not really sure how how effective it is for acne, but I can say that it works wonders for blackheads. I have oily skin that gets dryer during winter. Keep in mind that this product is an oil, and it does sit on your face. I only use it at night before bed. Great for blackheads!
