This is way less irritating on my face than The Ordinary’s Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2%.  Goes on easy and absorbs nicely.  I do still sometimes sandwich it between two applications of moisturizer depending on how my skin is feeling.  I’ve incorporated it into my morning routine to add an extra layer of protection underneath my chemical sunscreen.  Very affordable to begin with plus now I don’t have to purchase a separate container of Alpha Arbutin 2%, which is another cost saver. Applies nicey, less irritating, and 2-in-1 perk
