I have been using this product for a few months and I like it. I have been using different VitC products for years and switched to this one to save money. I have used vitamin C serums that I much prefer but for the price this one is good. I have dry sensitive skin and find this product non-irritating. I also like the way my skin looks after application, it is mildly greasy but gives the dewey effect. I am considering switching to a higher potency product to see if I have better results. Good for the price
