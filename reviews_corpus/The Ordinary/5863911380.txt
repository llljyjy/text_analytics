This is advertised as a hydrating product, but my face started to burn right after application. Upon reviewing the ingredients more closely, I noticed that it has salicylic acid and citric acid in it. Itâ€™s my fault for not reviewing ingredients as closely as I typically do, but it seems weird to market this as a hyaluronic marine serum and discuss the hydration aspect of it on the bottle, without mentioning the other non hydrating acids that are in it. Be careful!
