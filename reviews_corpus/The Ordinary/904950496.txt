Another excellent product from The Ordinary. I absolutely love this. I use it every morning before my moisturizer and SPF. I know there are a lot of reviews saying it smells disgusting etc and I just don’t see that. I actually enjoy the scent. It smells like an outdoor fire in the fall. I know that must sound weird to many but I love it. If only I could find a candle that could smell just like it. Anyways I digress, I have dry, sensitive skin with rosacea and it is extremely reactive and I had no issues at all with this. I also saw other reviews that said it doesn’t sink in at all and that is not the case for me. You don’t need to use an entire dropper. Start out with a couple drops and add from there till you find how many you can use that will sink in the way you would like it to. For me I use 4-5 drops but if I go over that it’s too much. But even at that point my skin still feels wonderful and I can add moisturizer & SPF on top without any issues. I would definitely recommend. It is definitely a must have for me. Will not go without this in my routine!
