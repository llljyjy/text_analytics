I really like this serum! I have been looking for a serum for al long time and this one does the trick for me. The price is pretty accessible and it is good value for the money because it does last. When I use it my skin instantly becomes more radiant and it feels more soft, I am not sure how is working for the aging part because I am on my 20â€™s, but it does reduce a little the expression marks which is what I was looking for mostly. nan
