I’ve seen dramatic results with only two uses. I have dryer skin on the sensitive side and I picked this up to help with old acne scarring and blackheads on the nose. I’ve only used this twice so far and I’ve seen amazing results. This stuff is magic. It is VERY strong, so keep in mind that it will sting while it’s on the skin. I use this for 10 minutes and follow up with the summer fridays jet lag mask. This is my perfect combination and it really helps moisturize the skin after this harsh peel. I use this every 4-5 days and in between I make sure to make sure my skin is always moisturized and I use SPF if I’m going to be in the sun. the hype is real
