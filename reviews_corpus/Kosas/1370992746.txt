The Kosas Lip Collagen Booster is awesome.  First impression is a pretty pink and peach tube with a matte end for product delivery.  Then it smooths on in a heavy, buttery, slick of moisture full of collagen boosting actives like hyaluronic acid (attracts water), jojoba (locks in hydration), peptides (firm and smooth) and concentrated fatty acids.  All this adds up to smooth, strong, plump lips and who can argue with that?  I’ve used it as a night treatment, which it is perfect for, and also just for everyday bare makeup looks.  It’s a little heavy to do with lipstick and I feel like the color would slide right off but it did OK with a little bit of liner to just give it a little oomph if you insist on using it as makeup (I did that too).  And frankly, oomph is the perfect word for this stuff - not tacky or sticky or sting-y, just plush and amazingly comforting and smells like a lemon-vanilla cookie.  It’s the perfect night time fix or mask and even OK as a daytime treatment.  All of the good stuff and none of the yucky stuff (Kosas is a fantastic clean makeup product formulated to EU standards and the tube is even made of bio plastic) so you can feel good about putting it on your face. Lips looking great in the morning!
