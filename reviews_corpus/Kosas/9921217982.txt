I have been using spray on serum for a few weeks now and it has become a staple in my skincare repertoire. The ease of use and the amount of hydration I get from this serum have been amazing. I have been using it before my other serums and moisturizers and even on my back and other areas of my body that need extra hydration and firming. The bottle itself is very large and you get a lot of product for your money as well as it being cute to look at..I love that it has collagen and probiotics that really protect the skin barrier. I noticed my skin felt way less irritated as well when using this spray on serum and way less red. I also noticed plumping and my skin felt dewy and radiant after use. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a super easy to use serum that provides second to none skin benefits. An amazing spray on serum
