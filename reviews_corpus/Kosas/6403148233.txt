So the Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum is a serum spray that I now know I NEED IN MY LIFE!!! Off the bat, packaging is A1 as with all their products. The ombré colors are so aesthetically pleasing. That’s just the beginning though…let’s get into how great the product is. The mist comes out very finely and disbursed easily and nicely onto my skin. One thing I hate with some sprays is when you spray it and it’s just splotches on your face …but not this one! I’m in love with the mister. After I cleanse my face and it’s still a little wet…the minute before it fully dries (aka the golden minute)… I spray the plump and juicy serum so that it can fully penetrate into my skin and give me the most benefit. It smells so unbelievably good. To me it kind of smells like honey…it’s a similar scent to their grow lash and brow product. This product contains vegan collagen and probiotics. The ingredients are great packed with proteins and amino acids, hyaluronic acid, peptides, artemisia flower extract and more. I can say that my face felt more hydrated over time with this serum. My skin felt firmer so I will continue to use this product. I really enjoyed what this did for my face. The great part is that it’s safe for sensitive skin as well. This did not give me any type of irritation. I would recommend this product as a great serum spray to plump and hydrate your skin. Great product!! Yummy Plump and Juicy Skin
