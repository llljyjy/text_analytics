Muah! Muah! Muah! The Kosas Plump & Juicy Lip Booster Buttery Lip Buttery Treatment is TO DIE FOR! I am a total junkie for chapstick, lip balm, lip ointment, anything that smooths and softens my lips, and this one TAKES THE CAKE! In fact, it takes the whole bakery! The words ‘plump, juicy and buttery’ are perfect descriptive adjectives for this glorious lip treatment. It has been crazy hot this summer and I’ve been spending a lot of time in the sun, and as with all other areas of the skin, sun can be very drying. In order to counteract the drying effects, hydration becomes all that much more important. The Kosas Plump & Juicy Lip Booster Buttery Lip Buttery Treatment keeps them feeling SO SOFT, and hydrated. It smells DELICIOUS, it reminds me of Vanilla Buttercream Frosting. It combines the perfect amount of moisturizer and plumper to leave your lips feeling more kissable and luxurious than ever! Xoxo! Muah!
