I truly hope they never discontinue this product. I don’t know how or why, but it’s transformed my skin after half a bottle. The fact that it’s a spray makes it so convenient to put on more than you might with a regular serum. It’s just a little quicker and because it’s so lightweight, I definitely apply it more than others since I can just spray it and go. It’s so lightweight and beautiful and absorbs into the skin quickly. I’ve been spraying on my bare face, neck, and chest at any opportunity and my skin is so soft, even, I’ve had less break outs, and my 39 year old skin feels plump and beautiful. My chest is discolored due to years of swimming and sun exposure from living in the desert for many years and this has transformed my skin. I’m writing this review as I come to the app to pre purchase a second bottle. I completely recommend this product to add into your skincare regimen. Kosas, please don’t ever discontinue this! Absolutely beautiful
