As a licensed cosmetologist and educator for many years, skincare and hydration are a few of my top concerns. I have used a couple Kosas products in the past so needless to say I was down to try this. I really like the Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum. This spray-on serum is vegan and contains collagen + probiotics. It also can be used day or night and works with all skin types. Itâ€™s lightweight, unscented and quickly absorbs into your skin. After four weeks, I noticed that my skin is more hydrated and visibly firm. On average I used it about 2-3 times per day and most days I did not wear makeup. If you struggle with loss of plumpness and dehydration like myself, this is the go to for that as well. Being a lover of clean beauty products as well as one that lives for the natural girl next door look, these type of products make my day. I would definitely recommend giving it a try. nan
