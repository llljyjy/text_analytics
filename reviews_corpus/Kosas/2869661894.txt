I would describe this as lip chap in a bottle. It is very thick to the point that itâ€™s hard to get out (you have to squeeze quite hard). It is not glossy or oily in texture but thick like the lip chap you would get in a tin/tub. Sadly I will be returning this as I was hoping for a more liquid texture. Good lip chap
