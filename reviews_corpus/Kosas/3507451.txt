As a 6 year verified beauty expert, I love clean products that are easy to apply, comfy to last the day, and highly deliver results. and this ;ip treatment does this and more. It contains a buttery lip treatment, with rich fatty acids, and lip boosting actives that leave you with full, smooth and cushiony lips. It can be used as a night treatment or can be applied as you get ready. It adds a shimmery smear if you apply it on top of colour. Lips appear fuller and smooth after each and every application. Its active ingredients contain shea butter, jojoba seed oil, sunflower seed oil, castor oil and collagen. It feels fantastic on the lips and lasts all day/night. it has a light scent and a slightly sweet taste that reminds you of summer! nan
