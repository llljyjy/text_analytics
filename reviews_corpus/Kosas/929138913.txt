I am in love with Kosas’s Plump and Juicy Spray on Serum. It is a genius idea for the category. The spray pump allows the product to gently get onto your skin in minimal or maximum amounts. My favorite thing about it is how it is perfect for layering serums. I have tried it as a first layer and second layer with serums and it combines beautifully. You should wait at least two minutes between layers to allow each product to absorb. There was no pilling under my makeup. It can also be layered throughout the day as a pick me up and hydrator. It even works over makeup. I would avoid the eyes, depending the mascara you use. There is no scent and it is vegan. Kosas is clean beauty you can be excited about. The bottle is glass, it’s very barbiecore and looks great on my shelf. spray it on
