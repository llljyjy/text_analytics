Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum! What worked? I loved the glass bottle and the weightedness of the bottle. Kosas paid attention to the type of spray that left a lovely experience. I did not feel attacked by the spray, and the nozzle never clogged. The spritz from the bottle stayed consistent, and I love that they used a spray vs. a dropper. I feel I often waste product when it drips down my hand or between my fingertips when using a dropper. The spray is a fantastic addition. I noticed overall hydration on my skin, and I loved that since it came in a spray, I could easily spray dry areas on my body before applying a body lotion. I loved it for my legs. Did I notice any firming properties? No. I also didnâ€™t notice any lifting properties. If I had noticed these two changes, I might feel more comfortable with a $48.00 price point. When I think of Kosas, I think of some interesting, fun, forward-thinking items, and this falls into that and feels very on-brand. My only caveat is that I am not sure I saw enough of the claims for me to pay the asking price. I liked this item so I looked up the price to consider purchasing and adding it to my repertoire, but I think it may be a bit high (for me) for the benefits that I experienced. Absolutely Juicy
