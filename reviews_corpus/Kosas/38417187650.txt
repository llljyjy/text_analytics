The kosas plump juicy lip collagen lip booster lip treatment is a must buy. I didn’t know kosas made lip products but I recently tried a few and they are great! This lip booster lip treatment is a hydrating product that goes on clear and makes lips look fuller. It’s very moisturizing and repairs the lip. It comes in an easy to use tube with an applicator that allows the product to glide on smoothly. This lip treatment doesn’t make my lips feel tingly but it does make them look nicely plump and juicy . It’s like a gloss with the benefits of a lip treatment that hydrates the lips . It has beautiful light color that I wear under my other lip products . This lip treatment goes on so buttery and beautiful. I even wear it alone. It also wears well under lip liners and lip sticks. This treatment has been keeping my lips plump and hydrated without the discomfort of a plumper. My lips look and feel great. If you want something within tingle but still gives you a beautiful lift and fullness definitely purchase. Kosas Plump & Juicy Lip Booster Buttery Lip Butter
