I’m personally a lip gloss aficionado. I think I have a million in my makeup kit. I’m always intrigued to purchase the latest and greatest. So the KosasPlump & Juicy Lip Collagen Booster is a must in your makeup bag. I love like the name says it “Juicy Plump” looking lips especially something that I can layer on top of lipstick (I occasionally wear) or just alone. To enhance my natural lip color and making them look healthy, and plump. Kosas definitely delivered. I wish the texture wasn’t as gooey, but maybe it’s just me. I love that it comes in a squeezy tube and it comes super handy if you want to squeeze a little bit on your finger and top it off on your lips if you’re wearing a certain lipstick and you don’t want to dirty the top part of it. This product does give your lips a natural plump look, it’s super hydrating and it instantly makes lips look healthy! I would definitely recommend to someone who’s looking for a product that plumps your lips makes them look healthy without the stinging. nan
