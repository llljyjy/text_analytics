This is my favorite kosas product! As a skincare junkie and Esthetician I am the #1 fan of anything that can add an anti-aging boost of hydration and soothe my dry and sometimes irritated skin. What I really enjoy about the plump and juicy spray is that unlike most face mists this one actually delivers active ingredients into the skin and reveals supple healthier looking skin. To be 100% honest I donâ€™t use facial toner or facial mists in general. I think a lot of them are a waste of money but this one is an exception because of the formulation and the active ingredients it contains (my favorite being artemisia flower extract). It really is more of serum than a facial mist because of the way it delivers these clean active ingredients into the skin and I definitely noticed that my skin looked plumper and more hydrated after I applied this. Although there is no fragrance added to this product It has such a lovely floral scent that is very light and refreshing and I always look forword to misting it on. I absolutely love this product!
