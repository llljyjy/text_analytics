This Kosas Spray - on Serum is nourishing, hydrating, anti-aging, soothing, and microbiome balancing.  I like to follow up with this product after my cleansing step.  I find that this is the best time to apply the product because as an esthetician, I know that when skin is cleansed, the pores are not only clean, but also open and susceptible to receiving anything that we apply to it.  Therefore, after cleansing is the perfect moment to infuse all the goodness of the product into my skin.  It contains vegan collagen, anti-aging peptides, hyaluronic acid, and lactobacillus ferment.  The latter ingredient stands out for me the most as an esthetician.  Most of us know we need healthy bacteria in our gut for a well-balanced and healthy immune system.  The same goes for the skin.  Skin also needs healthy bacteria to function properly.  Having a well-balanced microbiome equates to achieving healthy and beautiful skin.The spray is light and refreshing.  A few spritzes and my skin feels amazing.  It coats my skin with intense hydration.  The scent smells fresh and natural from the plant extract ingredients.  The product does not leave a sticky residue.  Absorbs quickly, in a matter of seconds.  My skin feels soft, smooth, and surprisingly a bit firm.  But the firmness is only superficial, not deep depth like cosmetic surgery can do.  It feels extremely comforting on my dry and sensitive skin.  I have a plump and hydrated look.  The product is so gentle and the proof is it doesn’t sting my eyes even when some of the product gets into my eye area.  One pro tip I would recommend is to angle the spray far away from the face.  I found that spraying the product too close is a bit uncomfortable because the nozzle spray is strong and intense.  Far away gives a more pleasant experience.  It’s also very versatile.  It can be a toner, a quick treatment serum, and throughout the day, if I need a quick refresher, this does the job well. A quick and easy way to infuse probiotic!
