this is by far one of my most favorite collagen lip treatments for a couple of reasons but I’ll get what I didn’t like about it out the way... The TASTE! It is absolutely gross to me, it tastes super bitter and I’m not a fan of it’s going on my lips how can I not taste it. I’m sure it’s the collagen but it’s smells nice so I thought.... Either way I LOVED what it does for lips, I tend to have very dry lips so I stack treatments at night especially. I really liked that this product does well but night and day at hydrating pumping and protecting. This lip treatment helps my lips during the day before I applied any matte lipsticks it really does plump and smooth lips and at night it helps protect my lips from overdrawing I also noticed at the pigmentation of my lips stays the same I know that that sounds weird but there’s some products that I’ve used before that are overnight treatments that actually make my lips dryer so when I wake up in the morning especially if I haven’t been drinking water my lips darken, this lip treatment helped keep my lips the healthy shade I have (drinking my water too of course) but also helped with fine lines and wrinkles. I use it daily and have seen a huge improvement in dehydration lines! Plus using this in the day gives my lips a really pretty high shine and plump. I recommend this for anyone! nan
