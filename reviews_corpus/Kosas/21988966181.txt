As an esthetician and a makeup artist for over 6 years, i have to say that kosas has become one of my favorite brands. I had the chance to try this amazing product from beautytap called kosas plump and juicy lip booster buttery lip treatment. I strongly believe and support brands that work hard to put something out on the market with great quality for everyone to enjoy. No matter what skin type or concerns you have, their products do wonders, and this is exactly what kosas has done. This lip booster/treatment is extremely hydrating and lightweight. The shine and finish that it gives is totallydifferentfrom all the other lip products i have tried. Itâ€™s suttle but makes the lips look juicy and plump without being sticky or oily which is much appreciated. I highly recommend this prpduvts to everyone. nan
