She is juicyyyy and buttery! I love the classic squeeze tube it gives such 90s vibes not to mention how glossy the product is itself! This is not sticky at all. You would think with how glossy it is it would be a mess but not at all. It actually hydrates and plumps them so by the time the gloss comes off your lips are so supple and soft not dry or crusty at all. This is a very universal color since the color is very sheer. This does have a sweet scent to it but not overly sweet since this is a clean brand. This is a new staple for sure! nan
