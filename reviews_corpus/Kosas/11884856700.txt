Hello, I’m going to give a little back ground information about myself before starting my review to help others when contemplating the purchase of Kosas. I have work experience as a beauty advisor, beauty consultant and makeup artist. I’m continuing to educate myself in cosmetology school. Altogether I’ve severed seven years in the beauty industry.  Kosas encourages you to feel comfortable in your skin and to be the favorite version of yourself everyday. This brand is next level clean! They go beyond Sephora’s clean beauty standards. I have tried Kosas’ Wet lip oil, Plump and Juicy Lip Collagen Booster and Air Brow.      The Plump and Juicy Lip Collagen Booster claims to have 7x more plumping actives for lush and pillows lips. It does a good job at softening and hydrating my lips. There is not stinging sensation. It’s super comfortable to wear. I like to use both lip plumpers together for long lasting gloss. Make sure the hydrating products are fully absorbed before adding anything else. It feels so good on my lips
