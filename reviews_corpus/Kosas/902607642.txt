I just started using it, so I’m not scoring on the benefits. It’s the smell! I looked in the ingredients to see if there was honey in it, because products with honey in it, to me, smell like ...cat pee. I’m sorry! But the person that commented it smelled like a “ladies’ bathroom“, was pretty close. It was a Christmas gift, so I will finish it. Hopefully, it does something good to my skin. I just have to hold my breath for a little bit, til the smell dissipates. Smells!
