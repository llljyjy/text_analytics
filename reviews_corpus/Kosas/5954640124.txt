Ok so I’ll admit, at first I was very skeptical about this item because of the spray form. In general, I’m not impressed by misting products but I was very open to trying this because I love serums. I love the size of the bottle. You’re definitely getting enough. Also the bottle is cute. It does feel nice when you spray so the claim that it’s soothing is accurate. It is hydrating but I think it’s more targeted towards normal, oily, or combination skin types. I have very dry skin so I’m always looking for moisture over hydration but I can admit this product does what it claims. I’m not so sure about the lifting and firming but I can say my skin did look healthy after use. I used the spray by itself which wasn’t enough to use alone for my dry skin but works great in collaboration with other products. A serum spray
