I love a mist! A hydrating mist, a makeup setting spray, a sunscreen mist! After 20+ years in beauty it has been inspiring to see this category evolve if only for the convenience of it. Kosas Plump and Juice Spray on Serum, is my first spray on serum and I have to say, I have enjoyed using this product and maintained day and night application, for my full 3 weeks of using it. I can’t really speak plumping in the time frame, but I did like how my skin looked and I love that it incorporates vegan collagen and probiotics. This product stays true to the Kosas ethos of “next-level clean beauty “by incorporating new technologies and making products super easy to use. The only note I have is that the 100% liquid formula is not as instantly hydrating as some other serums I have used so I needed to add my moisturizer immediately to alleviate any tightness in the skin. nan
