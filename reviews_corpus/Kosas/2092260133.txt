As per usual, Kosas packaging is always aesthetically pleasing and this Plump and Juicy Spray Serum is no different in its pretty in pink and purple ombré bottle. The nozzle dispenses the spray in an even fine mist, it’s very lightweight and leaves my skin glowy but nowhere near greasy or oily. I will say that even though it’s unscented in that there’s no artificial fragrance added, the scent reminded me of nasal spray, which I didn’t like at all. As a pro makeup artist, a product with this many benefits in one that’s suitable for all skin types is a major score. Kosas created this collagen and probiotic spray serum as a means to promote healthier skin by using active ingredients to hydrate, plump, soothe and firm the skin. I tried using this product a few different ways to test results and effects; after cleansed/toned skin prep, before or after moisturizing for an added touch of hydration or throughout the day to give my skin a subtle dewy and refreshing boost. My opinion is this product is versatile, works any time of the day and great for any skin type. Versatile product use
