OOPS, Kosas really did it again with the Kosas Plump + Juicy Serum, when I say “they did it again” I mean Kosas created ANOTHER fantastic product that really changes skincare. I am a huge fan of this new Plump + Juicy Serum, this simple yet rich spray really cuts down time in my daily skincare routine where I really have no excuse to not do my daily self-care. I use this Plump + Juicy Serum after the shower, and I use about 4-5 pumps to give moisture to my face while I blow-dry my hair, so I don’t feel like I dried out my skin along with my hair. After spraying on the Plump + Juicy Serum, I brush my hair and then BAM the serum is dry, and I can move on to my moisturizer. I love this product and how I can apply this without my fingers to really help me move on quicker to the next step in my process. Aside from the time-saving benefits, I really experienced some wonderful skin benefits along with saving time. I must brag about the brightness and added hydration in my skin since using the Kosas Plump + Juice Serum, I am GLOWING, and my face looks so supple I noticed these signs in less than two weeks! With my naturally dry skin when I feel my skin is finally moisturized, I usually get an oily sheen along with the hydrating feeling but not with Kosas spray-on serum!! Thank the skin gods for the Hyaluronic Acid and Artemisia Flower Extract to give my skin a soothing feel along with the moisture my skin needs without an oily sheen or a slick feeling to my skin. I highly recommend this product to my friends looking for a refresh with their skin without breaking the bank. I really believe in Kosas’ products and formulas because this product is 95% naturally derived and truly gentle on all skin types, this is one product I’ll continue to tell everyone about! ABSOLUTELY NEED
