As a professional makeup artist and skincare expert, I am very pleased with the Kosas spray on probiotic serum. It has been the perfect addition to my daily skincare routine and is very easy to use. I use it in place of my serum and the spray has everything I need to keep my skin nourished. It leaves my skin feeling;  soft, smooth, plump, lifted and adds essential ingredients like probiotics for healthier skin. I have been using it both day and night and I feel that it has made it work even better on my skin. I also want to add that the smell is so nice.  It smells like a soft jasmine . If you are looking to try a new and innovative serum that will not only nourish your skin but will also leave your skin feeling plump, soft and radiant, then this product would the perfect for your daily skincare routine. I really look forward to using it more and seeing further results down the road. Such a beautiful spray on serum!
