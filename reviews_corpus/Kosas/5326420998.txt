This lip treatment is nice as it hydrates your lips. I use it more as an overnight treatment. I wake up with soft, plush lips. I also love the vanilla scent! The applicator and formula are also a plus! The only thing I didn’t like is how there’s no plumping whatsoever, considering that the tocopherol nicotinate ingredient is supposed to help with plumping I thought. I expected more of that plump feeling you get with other lip plumpers but without the tingling. What I got was pretty similar to the Wet Lip Oil as in there was no plumping at all. So disappointing. I might continue to purchase though bc I do love Kosas products and the clean ingredients. Hoping to see results in the long term. It’s good lip treatment, but not a lip plumper…
