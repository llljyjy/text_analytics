As a skincare expert who also has dry, dry skin, I’m always looking for amazing products like this plump + juicy vegan Collagen spray on serum!!! Its an all in one and time saving step for me!!! Its jam packed with Vegan Collagen, Plumping Peptides, Probiotics, protein,  amino acids, and hyaluronic acid!! Just wow!!! So many amazing ingredients and bennifits for the skin!! I love the super fine mist it sprays and my skin sucks it right up almost immediately!! I like to do 4 to 5 sprays for a nice glowing feel!! It’s not sticky and i haven’t seen any piling. I could literally apply it all day long Its so refreshing!! I also love that it’s hypoallergenic and won’t clog my pores! I definitely recommend this spray on serum from Kosas for anyone who wants hydrated skin Amazing serum
