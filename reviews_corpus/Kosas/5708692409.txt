My name is Jessica and I have been in the beauty Industry as a cosmetologist for almost five years now.So I got the Kosas Plump  and have been using this for a few weeks, I really enjoying using it. It does not feel waxy when applying  and it has no taste which is great! I always tried staying away from plumping lip products because of the tingling feeling it gives. I have never enjoyed it.That’s why I really enjoyed using this one because I have never once got that feeling with this.Some of the traits I consider in purchasing a good plumping gloss is that it does not give an irritating feeling or that it is sticky.I do not believe any makeup product should be uncomfortable to wear. That’s why  decided give this 5 stars.I would recommend this to anyone at really any age and skin type.The reason being since it is colorless, fragrance free, comfortable, tasteless ,non sticky and just fun to put on!
