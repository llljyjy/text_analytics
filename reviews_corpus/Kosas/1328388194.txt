When you first mist yourself you a smell a light floral scent. It smells like you are in a rose garden. The spray is very light so if you aren’t a fan of thick serums this product would be great for you. The product absorbed quickly in to my skin. I noticed my skin felt hydrated and plumb. I have normal to dry skin. Today I used an exfoliating mask and had a little redness. Which is common for me when using lactic acid on my face. My redness went down after applying the sprat serum. I would use this morning and night after washing my face or anytime throughout the day that I need a quick refresh. The bottle feels heavy and high quality. I love the colors it looks like a summer sunset. Super cute. Overall it’s a good product for all skin types. nan
