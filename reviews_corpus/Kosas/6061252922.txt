If you’re looking for a lip treatment that delivers a buttery, hydrating, and soothing effect you have to try this one! I have been using this product for the past three weeks and I have to say I have visibly seen my lips transform, they’ve become smoother and more firm. I have tried many lip treatments and this one has made it to the top of my list. It is very hydrating that I not only use it as a night lip treatment, but I use it religiously during the day as well. It is soothing and makes your lips soft, be it that I use a lot of matte lip products so this lip treatment definitely gives my lips the much needed moisture. I do also love the fact that it’s non -sticky and that plumping effect does not come with the harsh sting sensation, this is sting free! It soothed my chapped lips!
