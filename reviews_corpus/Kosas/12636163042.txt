Iâ€™m going to start by saying that I have been in the beauty industry for about 4-5 years and I am constantly learning about new skincare and makeup products every day. I have tried a lot of products as well. I was so excited about trying Kosas. Kosas was one of the brands that I always wanted to explore a little bit more because I have tried this skin oil and I did like it, but never had the opportunity to try more products when I worked at Sephora. I love that his does not burn my lips and makes my lips feel soft. I also likes that goes on smoothly. It is clear, which is another thing I love. It is so natural and looks natural. So far I really like it. nan
