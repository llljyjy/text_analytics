Thank you so much for reading my review. I have over ten years in the beauty industry and thank you so much to Beautytap for sending me this product for my honest review and opinion. The idea of an all in one serum that you can spray on?! YES PLEASE! I love the idea of a spray on serum. No messy formulas that get all over the place. No squeezing out or pumping from one hand to another and hoping the product doesn’t spill over while trying to replace the lid with the other hand. You just spray and go. Wellllllll the idea is still amazing but this product, unfortunately, is not. Let’s start off with the scent. I will say that the scent was very pleasant. It has a faint floral, rose scent. The results of continued use, day and night, of the product did not change my skin in the least, however. I will also say that I did love how nice it was to use it during these last few weeks of very hot LA days, but I would have gotten the same results with water. I would not recommend spending your money on this product. It's a no for me
