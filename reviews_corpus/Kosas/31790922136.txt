As a beauty expert for the past 8 year, Im always excited to try out products from clean beauty and Kosas is one of those brands that just doesn’t disappoint. And Kosas’ Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum is exactly that. First thing I like to mention is that I use this product after cleansing my skin, on that magical moment when my skin is absorbing all that moisture. The product itself is not a setting spray so it wont help with you makeup, in fact it may loosen it up a bit.Kosas’ Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum is so refreshing on the skin containing firming vegan collagen, lifting and plumping peptides, microbiome balancing plant probiotics, strengthening proteins and amino acids, soothing Artemisia flower extract and you just cant go wrong with hydrating hyaluronic acid in every spray.Not just a bottle packed with everything you need before any routine! Beautiful Spray Before Routine
