I love a facial spray especially ones with good skin loving ingredients like Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum! I was really excited to try this spray serum from Kosas, I love their products and this one did not disappoint! I used this serum immediately after cleansing at night before my serums and moisturizer. I did find it to be a little tacky-er than I prefer for daytime wear, but I like to really spray it on, so that could have been because of the overaaturation of product on my skin. I felt my skin was super hydrated and plump after a few days of using the serum and it was easy to incorporate into my regular routine. The smell of this was light, “undcented“, and it didn’t irritate my skin at all. While I might not use this in my makeup kit for clients because of the tackiness, I would definately recommend it for added moisture, especially in the drier months. Plump and juicy
