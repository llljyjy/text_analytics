Kosas is the next-level clean skincare that in the last few months became staples on my beauty care vanity. I’m obsessed with the lip oil and plump + juicy lip treatment (I can’t get enough of it), and now I have a new obsession…this collagen spray-on serum by this brand! I love the eye-catching bubblegum pink and orange colorful packaging that adds a pop of color to my collection…giving me a delightful and refreshing feel. It is a great way to effortlessly add this into my daily skincare routine. I like that I can keep my morning routine simple with this mist serum to prime my face and then move to apply my makeup. It is super clean and infused with vegan-firming collagen, plumping peptides, microbiome-balancing probiotics, HA (hyaluronic acid), amino acids, and the soothing Artemisia Flower Extract.With the super powerful ingredients, I instantly noticed my skin feeling extremely hydrated, firmer, and plumper (looking radiant underneath my makeup). This product is gentle enough for all skin types, including very sensitive skin. This light, alcohol, and oil-free mist is going to be a great addition since the weather is changing and the air will be getting colder and will help leave my skin looking dewy. Now, I highly recommend this for ones looking to give an instant boost to the skin for a youthful glow. Great to fit in a bag to take on the go for a quick reset throughout the day, too! My Skin was Missing This!!
