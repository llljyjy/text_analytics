Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum has been a great product to test out this month and I’m so grateful for the opportunity, the Kosas spray on serum is a game changer in my morning and evening routine, it’s so easy to use and I love how I don’t have to use a dropper, just spray. So clean. This product really does what it claims, my skin felt hydrated and plump. I also occasionally used it throughout the day on days where my skin needed some extra hydration. It works great under makeup. Since my skin is very dry naturally and sensitive I really appreciate that this product is unscented. It’s very sensitive skin friendly. nan
