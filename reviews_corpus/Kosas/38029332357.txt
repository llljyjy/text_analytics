I am an aesthetician and skincare junkie that always has a smattering of sprays, mists, and the like scattered across my bathroom countertops and I am forever reaching into my purse to grab hold of one of them for a quick-fix, or touch-up throughout the day. After using this vegan collagen spray daily (sometimes 3-4 times a day), I can share that my skin is bouncier and super supple. I have come to crave applying this product, as it instantly plumps my skin, and the scent is unique and dare I say healthy! I particularly love applying it to my already moistened skin, as it beautifully and seamlessly integrates with my other skincare topicals... serums, emulsions, lotions and creams. This baby pink & baby orange serum spray is all about that #magicminute (the 60 seconds right after you wash your face and before you begin layering on your products) … this is where the magic starts to happen … with the application of this spray serum, my skin is unequivocally more juicy, bouncy and truly happy. Spritzing this gorgeous product on my skin, feels indulgent and delicious and I am here for it! I have peppered a handful of Kosas products into my stash over the past 6 months and I intend to stay the course - they embody a uniquely smart, innovative, holistically healthy, and yet fun approach to beauty, and I can get down with that. It's all @ the 'magic minute' & I'm here for it!
