I’ve had the opportunity to try some Kosas products in the past and there hasn’t been one I haven’t liked yet! The Kosas Hotliner Hyaluronic Acid Contouring Lip Liner is so much better then I anticipated! This retractable lip liner is so soft and glides on so smooth. It contains Hyaluronic Acid, Jojoba Oil and Konjac Root. I didn’t see any plumping effect with this liner as it claims but let me just say, this is still one of the best liners I’ve ever used. The way it glides in and moisturizes is just incredible. You can even use it alone and fill in your lips with it if you don’t want to use a gloss or lipstick with it. I love this!! love this!!
