As a freelance makeup artist for over 10 years and a person who has been obsessing about skincare and makeup, I only use high quality with nutritious ingredients skincare products. I highly recommend Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum. As I’m in my forties, I can feel that my skin is not as plumped as before and I notice some fine lines on my eye areas and forehead, I believe it’s due to loss of collagen as ageing. I tried many different anti-aging serums. Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum is my favourite anti-aging serum. First, it’s the first spray on serum I have, it is a very interesting product. All the traditional serum is not a mist form, this serum mist produces fine mist, it has a light scent of fruit. It’s easy to spray on the face evenly and gives you a refreshing feeling. For the ingredients, it contains Vegan Collagen, Peptides and Hyaluronic Acid. It helps fighting the appearance of lines and wrinkles. And the collagen will plump up your skin while you are sleeping. When I started to use it, I am obsessed with the spraying method, and it’s so light and without any stickiness which I hate. The serum is fast to be absorbed. It is suitable for any skin type even for sensitive skin. After applying this serum for two weeks I feel my face plumped, tightened and firmed. And the fine lines on my forehead becomes less noticeable. I’m so thrilled about it. nan
