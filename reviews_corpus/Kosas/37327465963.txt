I’m in love with this product! From the cute color scheme of cotton candy blue and pink of the packaging to the buttery smooth feeling it give my lips. Which the color scheme is fitting since it smells like cotton candy, to me at least, as well. I did experience a little plumping action from it. The buttery texture isn’t sticky at all and glides on smooth then leaves your lips soft, shiny, and smelling fantastic. Honestly I’d probably even use this in place of a lip gloss since it does give you that shine and looks devine. Soft smooth and stupendous lips
