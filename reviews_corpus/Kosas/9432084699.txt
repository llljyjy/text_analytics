KOSAS has been a brand that I have been very intrigued with recently. They have amazing products. Their packaging also is very appealing on all their products and their sustainable! Something unique is always brought to the table when it comes to them.I am happy I had the opportunity to get my hands on KOSAS new Plump and Juicy Serum Spray. The name simply speaks for itself. It’s a serum spray, allowing an even mist onto the face. It gives off a light spritz, which feels great on the skin and gives my face that nice, nourished feeling. It also absorbs well into the skin. And locks in moisture. As someone who always suffered with eczema and dry skin, I could say that I appreciate this product. It delivers hydration and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. KOSAS went out their way to find the best water to put into this serum. It’s nice knowing that your product comes from somewhere good. This serum spray contains hyaluronic acid and hibiscus extract. It also contains vegan collagen and probiotics, which worked to keep my skin firm. After trying this serum a few times, I did notice that it helped reduce inflammation and redness in my face. This serum also lifts the skin and reduces aging. One cool thing is that it helps protect the skin against blue light damage. As an experienced beauty influencer, I definitely recommend this product! A new must have
