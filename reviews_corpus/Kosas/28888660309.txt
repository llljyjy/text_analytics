Mature beauty blogger here! I love this stuff esp since I am experiencing menopause and you know what happens to your skin at that point! This serum made with vegan collagen and probiotics plumps my skin immediately. I used this after my opus laser plasma treatment and it was so gentle and felt amazing on my skin.  As I continued to use it I noticed my skin just looking plumper and more glowy. The day I took the attached photo was the day after my procedure.  The second pic is how my skin is looking now.  I really do believe this product helps and isnâ€™t just some craze. I use this product immediately after washing my face as my first step before adding any other products and I let it soak into the skin for a few minutes. I do not smell and scents and it is fragrance free. I love that this makes you feel like you given your skin a tall glass of water. I am 52, have normal skin no acne or breakouts. During the winter months I am drier so this is very handy for the upcoming months. I will continue to use and highly recommend to anyone who has dry skin. This is a Vegan brand & I love the Kosas line.  All their products are made with active botanicals.  It is a clean beauty product. In my opinion my skin looks plumper, radiant and smooth with this add on serum. Follow me Pazminoonfire on IG A must have collagen serum for mature skin
