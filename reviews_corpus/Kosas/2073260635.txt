I was intrigued to try Kosas’ new and innovative plump + juicy vegan collagen spray on serum. To my knowledge there’s no product on the market quite similar to this. This new innovative product is marketed to improve the skins hydration, anti-aging, and balance the skins micro biome with its formulation. Using this product daily day and night my skin has been more supple and hydrated. However, I haven’t seen any changes in my skins collagen and elasticity. Continuing the use of this spray I’m hoping to see some improvement in the anti-aging aspect. This product is marketed as “unscented” which is one of my take aways from this product. Even though this all inclusive formula is safe for sensitive skin, hyperallergenic, and non comedogenic this unscented spray has an unsavory smell to it. Even though I’m not a chemist. There are plenty of ways this could have been formulated with a natural pleasant scent. Over all, as a makeup artist and esthetician, this product is good for personal use. I would continue to use for 3-6 months to see the optimal results. nan
