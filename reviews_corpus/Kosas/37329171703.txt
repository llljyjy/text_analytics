After the first time I used this product I fell in love I seen how hydrated it had my skin even after the product dried . The mist sprays very well. I use about three pumps. The smell is little to none. You get a nice amount in the beautiful glass bottle that it comes in. I will recommend this for everyone . If you have oily skin you can use it once a day. I used it twice a day 3xâ€™s a week because I have combination skin. nan
