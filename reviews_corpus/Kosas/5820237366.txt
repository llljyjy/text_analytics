As a beauty expert, I love using products with aesthetic packaging. Since I have been using products by Kosas, I have been very pleased with their packaging. Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum is no different. It comes in a beautiful orange and pink spray bottle. As per instructions, I used the serum on my dry and clean skin morning and night time. Just shake the bottle and spray on. The serum has a rose like scent to it. I applied it liberally and my dry skin absorbed it all up. After only using the serum for a few days, I noticed my skin to become more plump and firm. I also noticed my skin to be hydrated and smooth. The product is mess-free and it’s easy to use. It’s also very convenient. I really enjoy using this serum everyday not only because of its multiple benefits but also because it’s a quick application. I like that it is made using vegan collagen. A must product to have for all the beauty queens out there. Quick and convenient serum
