I have some mixed reviews about this product! Pros: it’s lightweight ,it’s hydrating ,it sprays on easily ,it has a cute packaging, also gives my skin a dewy look , and it’s clean ingredients. Cons: it gave my skin a reaction but that could be just of my hormones, also I didn’t see any results of the plumping part the only thing I saw was just  hydration. Overall it’s not a bad product it was just experience with product! Try It Out!
