i love kosas but iâ€™m on the fence on this one still. i love the subtle sheen and it deff plumps the lips without the classic plumping feeling but if you apply too much, it kinda goops off your lips. it also tastes a little bitter. not a deal breaker but not recommending it to everyone i know i'm on the fence still
