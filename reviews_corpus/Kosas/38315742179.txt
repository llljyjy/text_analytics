This lip treatment comes in beautifully orange-pink ombre-colored packaging. The lip treatment is easy to apply from the tube it comes in. After application, which can be done at night or during the day, instant hydration is felt. The scent is a fruity orange sherbet. The look of my lips were smooth, shiny, and fuller. The feel of my lips were smooth with no stickiness. This was a great lip treatment that I know is beneficial to use. About me:I grew up in a salon where I helped in basically all operations (except for providing the beauty service) many family members are in the industry where I frequently can stay up to date with new trends. I went to college (for biochemistry) where during that time I worked as a receptionist in a beauty salon boutique in a busy area in Hillcrest- San Diego, California (needed to learn all product we carried inside out). During college and a year following I worked as a cosmetic chemist where I formulated big and small brand productsâ€”during that time I also had the opportunity to work in all departments of the product lifecycle (R&D, QC testing, manufacturing, and fill and finish). Together collectively I have around 10 years in the industry.Follow me on IG to see my feed thoughts on products @DollyLena nan
