This serum spray is so refreshing, hydrating, and makes my skin feel so plump and smooth! The packaging is high quality and durable. It’s easy to spray and releases a fine mist. It definitely feels thicker than a toner/essence which gives it it’s serum name. I love the way it smells; it has a sweet fruity scent like candy! When incorporating this product into my routine I use it after my toner and before my usual serum as layering products thinnest to thickest allows for optimal product penetration. I would love to have a travel size to keep in my bag as this bottle is quite large (which is awesome!) as I would enjoy this to refresh my skin throughout the day. I’ve been using this for a few weeks now and my skin texture feels so smooth! I definitely recommend! In love!
