I recieved this product complimentary from beautytap in exchange for an honest review. I will not let the way I recieved the product affect my thoughts or color my review at all.I have loved the brand Kosas for a LONG time now. I knew the owner back when she was making products in her garage! I’m pleased to say that the plump and juicy lip treatment didn’t disappoint! I have chronically dry lips that are prone to flakiness so when something says it’s “plumping“, that usually is code word for “irritating“. But this feels so soft and cushiony, easy and comfortable to wear. I haven’t used it in the PM yet, just no no-makeup makeup days. I’m excited to try it once I use up the night time product I am currently using (strivectin). I definitely recommend, this is a beautiful addition to the line! nan
