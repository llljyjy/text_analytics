What a beautiful product, from the packaging to the ingredients!  I love this spray serum from Kosas!  Who would’ve thought you could spray on a serum?!?  After cleansing my skin, I spray a few pumps on my dry skin.  The skin is the most receptive when the pores are open and before the moisture evaporates from them… this is known as the “Magic Minute”…. This is also the best time to spray this serum on the skin.   The collagen used in this spray serum is vegan, so you can feel good about using clean products from Kosas, that make you feel comfy in your skin!     The glass packaging and sprayer are from Italy and specially developed to give you the softest cloud like spray mist.  It’s super refreshing and relaxing to use!   I love that this spray helped improve the firmness of my skin, while helping to reduce inflammation! Beautiful inside and out!
