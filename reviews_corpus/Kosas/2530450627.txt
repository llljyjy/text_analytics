I think this is a great option for people on the go - Kosas has been a favorite brand of mine to review - their packaging is beautiful, their products are clean and deliver the best ingredients and they also always FEEL amazing on the skin. This spray on serum delivers a fine mist packed with peptides, hyaluronic acid and vegan collagen to help skin feel healthy, hydrated and firmer while protecting the ever so important PH balance of the skin. What I liked most is the instant gratification of this product when it comes to hydration - I leave the bottle out and often just spray it on whenever my skin needs a little “pick me up“ throughout the day - Please note it is NOT a makeup setting mist, however when my skin needed a little love and I was bare faced it was an easy way to add a little glow on  the go - I rated it 3 stars as the hydration was really the only difference I noticed while using this spray every morning - I was hoping to see a little more firmness or “lift“ but unfortunately for me - they hydration was is it. I still think this is a great option for the person who wants to take great care of their skin, but may not like the time it can sometimes take to do an entire routine. Good for those "on the go"!
