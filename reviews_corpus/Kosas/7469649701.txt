I like to keep a tube of this on my nightstand to apply before bed and wake up with hydrated, moisturized lips. What I like about nighttime use is that it really gives the formula time to stay in place and do its work while I sleep. I also like it for daytime use for its glossy, juicy effect. The dense texture of the formula makes it feel like such a luxurious treatment, even though it’s quite affordable. It has a lightly sweet scent and such a glossy look that I almost feel like I’m using a “grown-up” version of Lip Smackers. I also love that it plumps my lips without any stinging or burning. As a licensed esthetician, I’m always both fascinated and wary of ingredients, and collagen is one of those. While topical collagen can give a boost while using, I haven’t seen enough science on it actually helping the body to produce more collagen, so be sure to manage your expectations on what this product can do. The benefits of this product, for me, are moisturized and hydrated lips that appear juicy and plump when I have the treatment on. I haven’t seen significant improvements or long-term effects. nan
