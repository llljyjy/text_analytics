I tried this moisturizer before and loved it but tried some other moisturizer.  Nothing compared to Tarte!  I have dry, sensitive skin and this moisturizer is the only one that checks all the boxes and is also a great price.  I use it day and night- no allergic reactions and it actually worked on patches of dryness I haven’t been able to get rid of.  I’m not going to try other products, this one is the best! Fantastic cream
