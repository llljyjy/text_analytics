I would give this 0 stars but it was not an option.The foam was pure green goo and it took rubbing alcohol to get the color green off my hand and clorox for the counter it dripped on.  I thought it might be the correct formula but it did absolutely not change to a bronze or any tan like color on my arm. Green out of the bottle
