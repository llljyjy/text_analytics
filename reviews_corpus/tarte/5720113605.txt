Unfortunately, like other reviews have stated, this moisturizer is not hydrating at all. I have dry skin and my skin felt worse after putting this on. Itâ€™s cooling initially and feels nice but after a minute it disappeared and left a sticky residue. My skin felt very tight and uncomfortable. This would be a great moisturizer for the oiliest skin. not hydrating
