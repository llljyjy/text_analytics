I’m addicted to this stuff. I’ve used it for about 5 years now and tried a lot of similar products along the way, and none have the same exfoliation abilities as this. It’s not painfully gritty, but just enough to really get dead winter skin off. I dont use it daily, that would dry me out.  but as a 2x a week product this stuff is fantastic. I’m very dry. Not oily whatsoever. This is a good balance for my skin. My only gripe is that I feel like I’m always running out. More product for the price would be an improvement. All I can use
