I don’t really get buying this kind of skincare or cleansers that don’t do the job. This one just feels like a slimy gel. it does not lather or cleanse or do anything it is supposed to do. it obviously does not even remove makeup.I bought it in the mini kit, and won’t be repurchasing again. Doesn't cleanse
