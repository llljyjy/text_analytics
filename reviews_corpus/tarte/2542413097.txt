To preface, I will admit that I have weakened enamel and do have sensitive teeth to begin with. I haven’t used teeth whitening product in years so I wanted to give it a go. My teeth had a soreness to them for about a day or 2 afterwards. Tarte themselves are awesome in their clean & vegan stance on everything so maybe they’ll work for others but not on me :( nan
