I love this pen. So I believe an instant whitening product doesn’t really exist. However, of all the clear gel like substances that are out there for whitening, this one brushes on more white than clear because the peroxide will start to foam up a little and makes your teeth look noticeably whiter right away. Over time it actually does gradually whiten teeth. I ran out over a month ago and my teeth are still a bit whiter than before I started using this product. Time to get another one tho. If you’re a smoker DONT smoke immediately after you use this or it will absorb the stain even more. Smoke before you use it and give yourself at the very least an hour after. Realistically 1-2 shades whiter, so I’m happy
