I use a whitening toothpaste with this product and I’m pleased with the results. I think it adds just a little more boost in whiteness. I think using it four times a day is pretty ridiculous, but I’ve noticed if I use it twice a day after brushing, I get good results. It still has a little bit of that bitter, icky whitening treatment flavor, but it goes away very fast. Impulse Buy, Pleasant Surprise
