IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream really nice product but not for all types of skin. If you have oily or acne-prone skin then this is not for you. This cream has a light texture but still feels heavy. Maybe that’s why it calls a Super Cream. The product melts on the skin fast without the sticky or oily feeling. I was trying to use it twice a day but my skin doesn’t like it, looks like too much. So I use it only at night. Much better and I like how my skin looks in the morning. This cream really moisturizes and leaves my skin soft, fresh, and ready for all day. I can see improvements and the disappearance of some fine lines. This cream will be perfect for winter. Also will be a favorite for people with dry skin. I wish it fragrance-free. For me the scent is strong. Perfect for dry skin.
