This 3 in 1 makeup melting balm is amazing. Iâ€™ve never used anything like it. I put it on fingers and rubbed them together. Gently wiped all over my face. No rubbing or hard wiping needed. Not even on mascara. I took a cloth and wiped my face off. It left my face smooth and very clean. No oily residue. Fresh Faced
