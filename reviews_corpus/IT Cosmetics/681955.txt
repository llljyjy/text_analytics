Every product I try from ﻿IT Cosmetics makes me love this brand more, and Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm is one of my all-time favorite It Cosmetics product! It does everything right when it comes to removing makeup while soothing and moisturizing my skin. This generously-sized tub of balm has the most lovely, barely-there rose scent. The fragrance is so light that I think even people who prefer unscented products would be fine with it. Just of touch of balm is all it takes to melt away my makeup— even waterproof mascara. I wipe my face with a damp cloth, then rinse off; my face is clean, while the balm leaves a soothing touch of moisture. This balm does triple duty as a makeup remover; an overall cleanser; and a moisturizing mask. I love the “spa treatment” of a 10-minute mask, which leaves my skin so soft after I wipe off the balm and give my face a quick rinse. I’ve never used a creamy makeup remover I loved more. nan
