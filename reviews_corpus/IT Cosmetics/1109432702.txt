As someone with hypersensitive skin, rosacea, and psoriasis (even on my face), I’ve learned the hard way that I just can’t use a lot of skin products, even higher end and ones specifically for sensitive skin. I have found some IT Cosmetics were okay on my skin, so I really wanted to try this cream now that I’m in my mid-forties and starting to really notice age-related changes in my skin. The texture of this is gorgeous. I was afraid it would be like a heavy night cream, but it’s lovely, and my skin seemed to absorb it pretty much right away, which isn’t always the case. Although I’ve gotten a little bumpiness from my rosacea, this hasn’t made me fully flare, and I’m hoping that my skin adjusts because I love how this makes my skin feel. I haven’t noticed wrinkles disappearing yet, but it’s only been a month, and it’s summer, so my skin isn’t as dry as it will be in a months. My skin definitely feels softer and more plump, and I’m excited to see what happens as I keep using it, now that I know my skin doesn’t completely freak out from it the way it does nearly all other lotions, cleansers, makeup, etc. Better than I was expecting
