I received IT Cosmetics “Confidence in a Cream” as a trial product. I applied this product as directed for the last two weeks and I can definitely see the difference in my skin (face). While using this product, I have noticed an appearance in the health of my skin (face). My skin looks rejuvenated and my noticeable skin (face) pores has started to reduce. Unlike the previous facial skin moisturizing products, this one actually delivers results in which I can definitely tell a difference in my skin (face) overall appearance. Also, other products of such, have left my skin feeling more oily and also wasn’t suitable for my very sensitive skin. I would definitely recommend IT Cosmetics, “Confidence in a Cream” to anyone who is interested in a moisturizing facial cream that yields excellent results! HAVE CONFIDENCE AGAIN!
