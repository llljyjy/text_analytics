I received this product gratis in exchange for my honest review. The cream is a lovely pale yellow color. Itâ€™s rich and creamy, and deeply moisturizing. Unlike other rich products, Confidence in A Cream absorbs completely and dries down well, making it a good choice to use under makeup. I found it hydrates all day and night. Excellent day *and* night moisturizer
