First off, I’m an oily girl. So, I’m pretty picky when it comes to moisturizers.With that said, it was just too greasy for my skin. Maybe it would work as a winter time moisturizer. But even using it at night, I wake up to an oily pillowcase. Eww!The scent is wonderful! Like a light citrus, but it doesn’t linger. I didn’t notice any changes in my complexion. For the price point I kinda expected some change. Too greasy!
