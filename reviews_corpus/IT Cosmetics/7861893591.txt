Due to the name I started using this with high expectations and it is not often a product lives up to the hype. However, this is now a must have in my routine and I refuse to live with out it. With that being said, I normally struggle with occasional dry skin due to the seasons and weather being hot and dry. Since I started using this I noticed that not only did I not break out due to introducing a new product to my skin routine, but it also does not pill when mixed with my other products. The consistency is thick and creamy but it is not heavy on the face and my skin drinks it right up. Since using this I have not had a single issue with dry skin. My skin feels more youthful,  plump and HYDRATED. I cannot stress it enough that this is the best moisturizer I have come across, and I thought I had found the one. The price is a little steep, but itâ€™s cheaper than a lot of popular moisturizers and it really does work. I appreciate that there is no fragrance, and that it is not heavy on the skin. I apply it at night before bed and sometimes in the morning before I start my day. I wish I could apply it to my entire body because the difference I have noticed in my skin has been amazing. Confidence on my face
