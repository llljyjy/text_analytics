Nice medium weight moisturizer. A little goes a long way , spreads well leaving a thin layer of product on your skin. I have areas of my skin that are more prone to dryness then others and I definitely felt like my dryer areas didnâ€™t feel as hydrated as other areas. For me it felt like an average moisturizer nothing that I probably would go out and purchase. I got this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. nan
