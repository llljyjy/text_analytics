I love this product so much! The IT Cosmetics confidence in a cream moisturizer is smoothing and hydrating. My skin was dry and oily and my pores are larger but with this cream, my skin has felt soft and supple and shiny in a good way since I started using it. The price is right and the results speak for themselves. I would recommend this to anyone young or old as a preventative and altering product. Also good for all skin types as well. Hydrating for all ages!
