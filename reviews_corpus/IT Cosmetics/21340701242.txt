Everything about this moisturizer is wonderful! I have fair skin that is sensitive and mature. It works well as a moisturizer. This product has been incredibly successful on its own, unlike most others that give me breakouts or donâ€™t work. Since I started using this day and night, my skin has undergone a significant improvement. My skin has received so much hydration from this cream that I can actually tell a difference in how supple, moisturized, and vibrant my face feels and looks. nan
