I’ve been using this moisturizer for about 2 weeks now and absolutely love it!  It has a very pleasant and light citrusy fragrance.  It goes on very nicely and doesn’t feel oily or greasy.  Most of all, it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin.  A little goes a long way.  I use it as the last step in my night time routine to seal everything in. Great Moisturizer
