I have been using this wonderful cream for a little over 2 weeks now. I use it every morning before my makeup and every evening before bed. It is rich and creamy with a really pleasant scent. It absorbs really well into my skin and doesnâ€™t leave my skin feeling greasy or tacky. My skin broke out a little bit after the first two days, but after that it worked wonders for my skin! My skin is glowing and bright. It feels so smooth and my pores are visibly smaller. I use this on my neck too and have noticed that my skin looks smoother and a little tighter in that area. I am thrilled with the results and would definitely buy this again. I use many IT cosmetic products and this one is just another in their great line of products! Love this cream!
