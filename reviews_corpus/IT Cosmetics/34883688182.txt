I’ve tried a wide variety of anti-aging creams over the years. This cream- WOW! I love it! It is super rich and creamy with no greasy or tacky feeling. It absorbs quickly and works well under makeup. I’ve used it morning and night for 2 weeks. It immediately softens and smooths my skin. It works especially well in my neck and décolleté, which appear firmer with a more even overall tone. I’m excited to see the results with continued use, and plan to keep it in my usual skin care routine. WOW!!!
