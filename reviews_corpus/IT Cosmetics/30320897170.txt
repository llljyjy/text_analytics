This is my first time using an IT product and it has impressed me. It does a great job keeping my skin from drying and flaking after washing. This does have a slightly stronger scent than I would have liked.  It’s not overwhelming, but I am sensitive to smells.  You may think it’s just the right amount.  The cream goes on clean and smooth right away. My skin gets very oily soon after washing, but my nose will start to flake. Using this cream stops the flaking and doesn’t make my skin look oily. Does it stop aging? I don’t think we will ever know that. This cream by IT is definitely worth a try if you’re in the market for this type of product. Great moisturizing cream
