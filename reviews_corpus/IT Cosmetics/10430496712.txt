I received this product in exchange for my honest review and I’m so glad that I did! Immediately after applying I noticed more radiant and healthy looking skin. After 14 days of using it twice daily I notice my skin tone is more even, glowing, fine lines are gone. I have melasma and my husband has even complimented me on my skin. And I’ve felt confident enough to go make up free this summer! I just wish it wasn’t missing the spf. holy grail
