I have been using this product every day since I received it. As you can see from the photo, my jar is getting low. :) I absolutely love it. I like the feel of the cream when I am applying it. It is slightly cooling and nicely moisturizing without being greasy. The fragrance is pleasant, light, and does not trigger my frequent migraines. I notice a tightening and smoothing effect immediately on my face and neck when using it. I use this as part of my face moisturizer and primer before applying my liquid foundation makeup. I like how it contains NIACINAMIDE, SQUALANE, PEPTIDE-LIPID COMPLEX, COLLOIDAL OATMEAL, and SHEA BUTTER. I like that it is in a jar. IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream is a fantastic product and I recommend it highly. IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream
