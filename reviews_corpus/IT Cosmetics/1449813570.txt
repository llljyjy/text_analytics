Simply amazing, you can actually see results after just 14 days, especially  if you are post menopause, have dry skin that somehow starts to lack glow , plumpness , uneven texture . I love It ‘s Confidence in a Cream line , but this  one , supercharged Anti Aging Armor is special. I noticed that it is for all skin types, I have very dry skin and it gave me a glow I haven’t seen with creams costing 4-5 times as much . After my husband of 27 years asked me why I look so fresh I took the time to really check my skin out snd noticed that even the deep nose to mouth lines seemed to be less deep, the vertical lines on my lips are now less noticeable and since I was testing this new product I also didn’t exfoliate for 2 weeks and still, the fine lines on my forehead got plumped up and did not show . Plump and Glow ! Wow
