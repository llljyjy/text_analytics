Love using this moisturizer in combination with my other skincare regiment. It absorbs really nicely into my skin and provides plenty of moister without feeling greasy or oily. I wake up with a nice glowing skin in the morning that feels and looks healthy. It works well with my serum and eye cream. I highly recommend. Cult Favorite
