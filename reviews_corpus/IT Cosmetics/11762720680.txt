I don’t hate it but I also don’t love it. I have really oily skin and applying this in the morning or evening before makeup really made my makeup melt right off my face in a matter of minutes. It’s a really heavy thick cream. I loved it using it as a night cream. It’s really hydrating. night cream for oily people like me !!!!
