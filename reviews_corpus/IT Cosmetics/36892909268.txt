I typically have a hard time getting off my makeup. I love glitter what can I say? I also suffer from rosacea and dry skin. I was a bit skeptical about trying the IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm. but I am hooked. Not only does it get all of my makeup off but it leaves my skin feeling soft, clean and refreshed. I had no irritation, no greasy feel and the product did not have an overwhelming fragrance. This glitter chick is happy! nan
