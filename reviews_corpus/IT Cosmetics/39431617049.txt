Excellent facial cream!I recently started using this Confidence in a cream and I absolutely love it! I love how creamy and silky it feels on my face and I really like the delicate herbal scent it has. It  reminds me of calming lavender. It absorbs quickly and is made with quality ingredients by dermatologists and surgeons so I know it is safe and effective. I  usually have to watch what I apply to my face, do to breakouts, but I  don’t have any issues with using this day and night , applied to my face and neck and chest areas. I  have noticed a radiant glow and super soft skin from this cream! I  absolutely love it and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a super fabulous complexion!! I now see why they call it Confidence in a cream, because I don’t need to wear any cover up or foundation....and still have great, clear skin!! Fantastic product!! Excellent facial cream!
