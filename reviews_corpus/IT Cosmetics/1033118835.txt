Iâ€™m very disappointed in this product. I have mildly sensitive skin but I felt good giving this cream a try. It has a good combination of ingredients that are usually nurturing to skin. However this stuff inflamed my skin and made it read and stinging. Definitely will not be using this again. Irritating
