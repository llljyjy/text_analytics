This product was complimentary from BzzAgent. I was very excited to try a new moisturizer since my #1 is from Origin’s. I wasn’t a fan of this one unfortunately. It’s way too thick for me, feels heavy on the face, feels oily, I didn’t like it. What is good though you only need a little and it covers your whole face. I put this on alone & I went to work in this heat and it just made my face sweat so much. I’m going to stick with origin’s though but it was nice to try a different one. nan
