I’m almost 56 years old so I’ve tried quite a few moisturizer’s over the years from Olay to Drunk Elephant… this is by far my favorite! I will continue using this morning and night. My rosacea is improved and my skin stays hydrated all day. A little goes a long way. It’s like custard consistency, it works well under my makeup. It does have fragrance, but it’s very very light (and pleasant) and dissipates very quickly. I really like everything about this moisturizer and will continue to use. It’s worth it!
