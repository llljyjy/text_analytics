To start, ever other product that has claimed too moisturize, has either not done so or has only lasted a little time. This is an ALL day moisturizer. It is thick, but it is super light at the same time. I really love how hydrating it is as well. The scent is not bad. I can see a huge difference in my skin and also can feel it too. A little goes a long way. I really wanted to buy this product, but I am not paying that amount. moisturizer
