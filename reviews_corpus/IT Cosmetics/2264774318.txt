I started using the IT Cosmetics Confidence in a cream and was amazed at the results. I have been using the cream for about two weeks now and the results are visible. I apply the cream in the morning and evening. I have no irritations from the cream. A little goes a long way, no need to slather on. The IT cosmetics is an effective moisturizer. I have fine lines between my eye browns and so far, the cream has improved those lines. My skins overall brightness, fine lines, pores and leaves my face moisturized and looking great. The cream feels lightweight on your skin, but effective. Has tons of anti-aging ingredients. I call it my miracle cream in a jar. I am incredibly happy with the texture and weight of the cream. It feels very luxurious, not pasty, or watery. This has been the best cream to truly even out my skin tone. The cream has my skin hydrated, looking more supple and moisturized. I highly recommend you give the IT Confidence in a cream a try. Miracle In A Jar!
