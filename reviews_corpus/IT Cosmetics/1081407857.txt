I tried the IT Confidence in a Cream and I  used up the whole jar before I wrote this review. I found it to be a bit heavier on my face than my usual moisturizer. That being said I do like how my skin feels and looks. I didnâ€™t notice any reduction in wrinkles but, I feel like my face looks brighter and healthy looking. I would but this again. Moisturizer
