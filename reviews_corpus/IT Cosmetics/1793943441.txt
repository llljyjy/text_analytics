CONS: I bought this to mask some redness on my acne scarring, but unfortunately it wasn’t potent enough to spot-cover. Also, I’m at my winter palest, which is only a touch darker than medium, and it was definitely not a matchPROS: good if you’re light medium and have oily skin - it’s very mattifying and covers flushed skin well (i.e. rosacea NOT acne) Not for acne or anyone darker than light-medium
