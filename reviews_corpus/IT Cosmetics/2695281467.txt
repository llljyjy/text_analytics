I really liked this moisturizer. It’s super hydrating and absorbs well. I also like that I’m able to wear it at night and in the morning. It doesn’t not make my face look too shiny or oily like some other products do. I feel like it’s made some of my fine lines start to fade after just using it for a few weeks. I’m exciting to see the long term effects. Great moisturizer
