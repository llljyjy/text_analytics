As a big fan of IT cosmetics I was thrilled to get a chance to try this product. I’ve tried other cleansing palms in the past and they’ve been too greasy or hard to scoop out of the jar. This is not the case with this product. I also must say that it smells lovely. It is a super gentle remover of make up. I had a little difficulty removing some eyebrow gel and mascara but a second swipe with the bomb and rubbing a little bit more took everything off just fine. The only drawback to this product, for me personally, is my skin is combination skin and this product is just a little too greasy for my complexion. I would definitely recommend it to my friends who will have a dryer skin. It didn’t make me break out , it just made my skin a little more oily and shiny than I like. But again a strong quality product from the people at IT cosmetics. A gentle remover with lots of quality
