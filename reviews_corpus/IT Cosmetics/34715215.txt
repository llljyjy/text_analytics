i was excited to try this cream as I am a huge fan of IT Cosmetics. I have always used their BB and CC creams so I was intrigued to test out their moisturizer. It definitely does not disappoint. It glides on smooth and absorbs fairly quickly into the skin. It is no greasy at all which is nice. It doesnt feel heavy either when i want to wear it under makeup or before going to bed. I saw an improvement in my fine lines throughout several weeks of use. I would definitely incorporate this into my everyday skin regime! Brings Back the Confidence
