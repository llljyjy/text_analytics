I received this product to test for my honest opinion. Honestly this is one of the best revamps of a product I have experienced. Originally I was not a big fan of the first formula but this new super charged is a whole new experience. I cannot believe how hydrated, soft, smooth, and glowing my skin looks after just a few weeks of use. The fact that the ingredients were tweaked to be clean makes it even more amazing! I have been telling everyone about this updated product and you really need to give it a try if you haven’t found a face cream that makes you happy. It doesn’t have a super strong scent which is awesome and I am over the moon at the fact that I wake up and my skin feels as soft as it did when I went to bed. If you’re questioning the product, get the travel size and give it a few weeks. You will be happy you did! Brilliance in a jar
