I have had the opportunity to use this product IT Cosmetics: Confidence in a Cream. What a awesome cream. I have been using it for weeks now and I noticed a huge difference in the texture, glow and moisture it provides when applying it to my face and neck area. So much so in only using it a few weeks now this will be the replacement of my current moisturizer. Confidence in a cream goes on very smoothly and does not feel like it is lumped on my skin. It soaks in my skin immediately which shows how dry my skin really is after using my old moisturizer. I love the fresh scent as well.  Not overpowering; just right. Confidence in a cream really does the job that I have been searching for and minimized some small lines around my eyes and forehead.  I appreciate being given the opportunity to try it and have told my close friends after their comments/mentions “your skin looks so smooth what are you doing differently?” Surprisingly, even my husband mentioned how soft my face is. Well since he never notices little things like that that for me is a sign I need a change! Awesome Cream
