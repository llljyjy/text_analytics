I like this cream very much!  It is extremely thick and rich, and has so many beneficial ingredients.  It contains ceramides, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, peptides and squalane.  Such a powerful combo!  The cream has a very light scent, and I only need a small dab to cover my whole face.  It is quite heavy, so itâ€™s perfect for nighttime use because my skin drinks it in all night.  I think it would be too heavy for me for daytime. Anti-aging power!
