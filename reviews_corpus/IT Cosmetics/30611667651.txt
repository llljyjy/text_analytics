This Confidence Cream is probably one of the most amazing products I’ve used in a long time. The way it feels melting into my skin and it’s effects are long lasting. My face feels soft and healthy. I didn’t get any breakouts or irritation. The texture is like silk and magic in a jar. It’s totally worth the money. I’m sure with continued use my skin will look even better Magic in a Jar!
