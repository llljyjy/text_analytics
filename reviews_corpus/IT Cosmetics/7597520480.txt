I really like this cream. The anti aging benefits and stuff it helps with is amazing! Its kept my skin hydrated and plump and supple. My pores look smaller. And my fine lines look smoothed out. I really enjoy using this cream because it actually work I can see the results after just 2 weeks of using. My skin is loving it. It is a bit on the heavier cream side but your skin just soaks it in. I use it on my face and neck and chest and its just helped so much. I feel like you can really tell the difference its made because even my mom asked what I was using and she was surprised and it cosmetic cream was doing all this for me. I really do recommend! If you can tolerate the thicker cream this is for you!!! Especially if you want younger looking skin that looks and feels amazing!!! Magic in a bottle
