I did like the product overall. It did have a nice moisturizing effect with a somewhat matte finish. It had semi-long lasting wear, and my skin felt hydrated for several hours. My skin though did not show any substantial difference as compared to other similar products. I do not have many wrinkles, and the wrinkles I do have are not remotely different than before using this product. I would continue to use this product as a moisturizer, but I did not see the anti-aging benefits as advertised. I would most likely stick to my normal arsenal of products at hand, but this would be a great replacement while I restock my normal moisturizers. Handy when in a Pinch
