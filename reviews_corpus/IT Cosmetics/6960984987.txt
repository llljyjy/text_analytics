This is my new favorite cleansing balm, and I’ve tried them all. You only need a tiny bit to remove a day’s makeup and SPF. It emulsifies well and rinses cleanly without a trace of residue, to the point where I don’t think I need a second cleanse but do it anyway out of habit. The texture is silky, the kind of solid balm-to-oil I prefer in a cleansing product—nothing creamy or gritty, which either feel gross going on or never seem to rinse away fully. It smells absolutely fantastic. Like a citrusy rose, but fresh and uncomplicated enough to want on your face.It leaves my skin feeling like skin. I can’t stress this enough: the IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm does not leave an oily, creamy mask of residue behind. It remove every single trace of makeup and SPF fully. This is the most important thing in a cleansing product for me, and it is just one of the ways this balm excels. nan
