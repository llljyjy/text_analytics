I like everything about it. The presentation, the subtle scent, the texture, and most of all my skin feels like silk after application. You definitely do not need more than a dime size amount each time. I rubbed into my face, forehead & neck. No sticky or greasy feeling! Your skin will soak it right in quickly! Highly recommended. Fantastic product!
