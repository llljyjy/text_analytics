Love love love this product! It is an excellent cleansing balm and makes it easy to remove my makeup. The fact that it doubles as a face mask makes it even better! I love to incorporate Vitamin C into my skincare products, and this cleanser does just that. I have tried cleansing balms in the past - the size and texture/quality of this It Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup balm is far superior! nan
