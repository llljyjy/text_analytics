Confidence in a Cream is the best moisturizer I have used. I am absolutely blown away by how wonderful and luxurious this face cream is. I started using this day and night and my skin has completely changed for the good. I have dry skin and this cream has brought so much hydration to my skin and now I can actually feel that my face feels and looks more supple, moisturized, and full of life. When you apply this, it doesn’t feel too thin or too thick. It’s perfect! I would recommend this to people of all ages and all skin types. nan
