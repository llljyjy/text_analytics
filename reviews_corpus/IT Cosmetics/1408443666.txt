This IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream is a nice face cream. I love the way it feels on my skin. It adds moisture to my skin while offering anti-aging benefits. This updated formula is supercharged with Ceramides, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, and Niacinamide. I love that this cream absorbs well because I have combination skin and sometimes face cream can make me oily. Since I have been using this my skin is softer and smoother. I have had great results. My only complaint is that the scent. While I like the way it smells, it is a bit too strong. Overall, I like this cream and recommend it. Nice Face Cream
