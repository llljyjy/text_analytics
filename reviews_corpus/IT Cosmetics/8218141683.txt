This is a really nice moisturizer! The package of this moisturizer is lux. The jar itself is heavy. This is my first time using a moisturizer from this brand. It smells really nice, but isn’t too overpowering. The smell reminds me of Belif’s Aqua Bomb. It has a creamy texture. Once I messaged some product on my face, it is so lightweight. My face stays moisturized all day and night. I didn’t see any significant reduction of wrinkles, but I will continue using to see more results. I will definitely purshase this moisturizer again. I received this product as a free sample box at the bottom of the review form. Awesome moisturizer!
