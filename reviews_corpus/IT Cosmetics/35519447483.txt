The texture of this cream is just decadent. Powerhouse ingredients and rich texture make it a pleasure to use. I’m 52 and definitely have expectedly 52 year old skin concerns. This cream addresses them, while not causing breakout. I can only use it at night, as it’s currently a hot and humid Michigan summer and my combination oily skin doesn’t allow more. However, come fall, it’s on, day and night! I look forward to seeing the results continued use will bring. Luxe cream
