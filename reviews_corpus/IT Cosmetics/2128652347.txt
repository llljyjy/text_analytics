I was gifted this product by Bzzagent & It Cosmetics for my honest review.Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer by IT Cosmetics is a dream cream. With dermatologists & surgeon’s alike partnering with IT Cosmetics to formulate clinically tested & cruelty-free products. One can be rest assured lots of special ops went into this bad boy of a moisturizer.Packed with spectacular ingredients like Niacinamide, Squalane, & A Peptide-Lipid Complex, this cream is FIRED UP to combat 10 signs of aging. All proven with real life results. The hydration is insane. I used this for several weeks & noticed my skins transformation. Day by day I started seeing improvements in the stubborn lines & wrinkles I had. The tone & bumpy texture smoothed out which was HUGE for me & a relief! My skin felt firm & my face glowed. The overall quality as a WHOLE of my skin up to this point is why I can confidentially stamp a 100 on this guy & with no hesitation say: “It’s Gooooood!“ "It's Gooooood!"
