The IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream is just as it says. It has given me more confidence in my appearance. My skin type is combination. I was a little hesitant about this at first when I applied it. It felt a little bit on the greasy side, however it went a way within a few moments after it was massaged into my skin. My skin felt so fresh, and hydrated not to mention soft. I use this every morning and every night like it recommends. I have been using this for a couple of weeks already. Some of my fine lines have already “melted“ away. I really like using this in the morning before I put my makeup on. It helps to keep my skin nice and hydrated all day. Also once I clean my face at night this is my go to after my retinol cream. I have found that they really helps to calm my face down at night  and gives my face a chance to renew all night. I will tell you there is a faint scent, to me it smells like a fresh clean scent. I like that it is NOT over powering at all. The cream is nice in the jar. The only thing I am not a fan of is when I sometimes get it under my finger nail when my nails are longer. AMAZING Cream
