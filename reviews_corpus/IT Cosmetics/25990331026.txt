I was finally able to try this moisturizer which I was crazy to try. The texture feels richly buttery on the skin leaving it very smooth and soft. By using it in the first two weeks I could see remarkable changes in the reduction of my pores and how healthy and hydrated my skin looks with a glowy appearance. I have not noticed a decrease in fine lines, but with the level of hydration that it is giving to my skin, its possible that with the use they decrease. I use it by day and night and it doesnt feel sticky with the sweat and it is quite durable also I have applied makeup on top of it and it hasn’t cracked which is perfect. I have sensitive skin and rosacea and hasn’t caused any breakouts. Its fragrance isn’t very noticeable which I appreciate because I don’t like very strong scents. The bottle is very nice, minimalist but with a luxury finish that looks beautiful in my collection. I love it definetly will buy again, very recommended. The Moisturizer for the perfect glowy skin
