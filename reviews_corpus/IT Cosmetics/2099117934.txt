I am a fan of Confidence in a Cream, and expected this to be at least as moisturizing as that one. Unfortunately, I wake up with dry skin. It does not have the same thick, luxurious texture as the Confidence in a Cream. I like the lavender smell, but otherwise it is nothing special. Not as good as Confidence in a Cream
