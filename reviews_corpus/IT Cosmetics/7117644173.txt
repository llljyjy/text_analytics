First this is an amazing cleansing balm and leaves my skin so soft and glowy It’s a lot better now that they improved it and I would recommend because this is one of my top 3 favorite balms but I only gave this 4 stars because they should’ve left the original product packaging like it was before. My issue is there isn’t enough product in the package, that being said the cleansing balm is still amazing and one of my favorites ever. It leaves your skin so hydrated and glowy from the rosehip and vitamin c but for the price and making the package so small I don’t see me running to purchase this cleansing Balm like before sadly. Again because not enough product and this is just my opinion. I really love this balm I just want a bigger jar at this price If they make it bigger I will definitely start back on repurchasing. At this time there is more brands with larger packaging which means more product at the same price or lower. For example Glow Recipe. IT Cosmetics please make bigger  packaging!! LOVVVVVE BUT
