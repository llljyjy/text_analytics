VERY nice and gentle cream. Not watery at all! gives a nice load of moisture. I’ve been using it mostly at night, as i do prefer some SPF in the morning, all though on days i dont plan on going out right away, i do mornings as well. After applying at night, the face feels great in the morning. p.s. don’t forget the neck! put it all over! get that moisture in! great!
