Worked well. The retinol was gentle on my skin. The packaging is interesting. At one point no product was coming out and I thought it was done. But then a few pumps later more product came out. So it’s hard to know when it’s finished. But I do like the individually metered doses that come out with this style of packaging. Just takes a bit of getting used to. nan
