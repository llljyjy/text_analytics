This moisturizer is truly amazing. It applies so smoothly and it smells great. It is very hydrating and moisturizing but doesn’t feel heavy on the skin at all. It fully absorbs and doesn’t leave a residue or film on the skin. I love using this as a night cream to lock in the moisture before bed. I love how supple and soft the Confidence in a Cream left my skin. IT Cosmetics has outdone itself yet again, well done! Definitely a new staple in my skincare regimen. truly amazing!!!
