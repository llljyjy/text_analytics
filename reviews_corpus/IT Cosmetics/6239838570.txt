I’ve been using this for about 3 months along with a vitamin c serum alternating days. I love how it doesn’t sting or irritate my skin. Other niacinamide serums tend to irritate my face and leave red bumps but so far it’s good. I haven’t seen a difference in acne scars or break outs but it helps clear up a blemish I’d use it as a spot treatment. nan
