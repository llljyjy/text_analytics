I received this product to complete a product testing review. I was very pleasantly pleased. The first thing I noticed was the wonderful scent, very fresh and herbal. The texture of the cream was  great too. It was thick enough to spread evenly and smoothly. The use of this left my skin very moisturized and the anti-aging components of the cream seemed to work very well. The texture of my skin has improved and the color looks more even. The wrinkles seem to be a bit reduced also, even after just a couple of weeks. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for anti-aging features in a wonderful cream. nan
