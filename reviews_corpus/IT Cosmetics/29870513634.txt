The It Confidence in a Cream has worked beautifully on my combination mature skin .After using the product morning and night for 3 weeks I have gotten amazing results .My skin clearly looks more vibrant and healthy .I have smoother skin and less fine lines around my eyes.The product does have a light scent , but I find it to be pleasant .The hydration this product gives is incredible, however be very careful when using it under makeup.The key is to only use a small amount when you plan to apply makeup on top.Because if you go on too heavy , it will not work as it becomes thick and balls up underneath your makeup.Now when I do my skincare at night , thatâ€™s when I go in a little heavy handed . The next morning you will definitely see results and your face will feel so smooth .Overall , for me , Confidence in a Cream truly did what it claims .Therefore , I do highly recommend!! Great for Mature Skin !
