I’m always hesitant to try a new moisturizer, as my forehead gets super greasy and it’s rare I find a product that doesn’t add to it, but I’m actually so impressed with this! Even in the super hot heat wave we had, my skin didn’t feel like an oil slick! Will definitely be using this as my go-to AM cream from now on. Not greasy, love it!
