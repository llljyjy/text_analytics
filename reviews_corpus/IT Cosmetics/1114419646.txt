I used this product for over two weeks. Used it twice a day after morning and evening showers. Yes, I’m one of those men who care about my skin and who own more facial products than my wife. I’m 47 years old and shooting for looking 42ish. :) This product is thick and creamy. It absorbs well and leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized. I like that it contains Hyaluronic acid to help fight the signs of aging skin. It smells fresh and clean and a little goes a long way. My wife stole some of it to and also used it for two weeks. She only used it at night because it’s pretty thick and creamy giving her face time to absorb the benefits overnight. She said she didn’t use in the morning because it didn’t have an SPF.  OVerall we both felt it benefited our aging skin and would recommend. We are both 47 Works good on Man Skin
