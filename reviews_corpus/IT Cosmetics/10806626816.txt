I love Confidence In A Cream. The texture is amazing and I love the light scent. A little goes a long way and it works for both day and night. I have to admit that I rarely used a night cream because the thought of putting my greasy face on my pillow was too unpleasant, but this cream sinks in quickly. I have used other moisturizers that felt thick and greasy when applying but Confidence was light but very creamy and it glides on. My face feels so soft after application and my fine lines are less noticeable. I like the name because I feel confident that I look good when I walk our the door. I will definitely buy this produce and I have already recommended it to friends when they tell me that I look great. i feel confident wearing Confidence in a Cream
