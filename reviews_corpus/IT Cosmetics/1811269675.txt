I was really excited about this product but it is not for me. It feels great on the skin and a nice healthy glow but after 3 days it gave me a breakout. I thought it would go away eventually but after a week it was just getting worse. I can see this working for someone with a different skin type. It goes on nice and smooth and has a very light scent and great consistency. Sadly not for oily combo skin
