Confidence in a Cream noticeably improved my skin texture.  I use it night and morning and wake up with smoother brighter skin!  It is a nice creamy product going on and I mix it with my sunscreen which creates a great base for my makeup.  I especially notice the positive changes with the fine lines around my eyes and the pores on my nose. Smoother skin texture
