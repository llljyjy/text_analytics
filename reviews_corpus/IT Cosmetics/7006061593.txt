I received confidence in a cream hydrating moisturizer as a complimentary. It’s really good moisturizer you just need a tiny bit. You won’t feel you have anything on your face very light good for lines pores. I would recommend using it in 30s, I use it as a primer and as a moisterzier. I see scars fading but it will take time. It feels very light in your face not greasy as I have oily skin. Very light weight moisturizer you won’t even feel
