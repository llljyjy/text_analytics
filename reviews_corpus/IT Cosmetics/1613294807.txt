This cream is very thick and hydrating. I have normal skin and while this worked great, after about 2 weeks I did start seeing some clogged pores. I think because it’s summer I don’t need as much hydration. I’ll definitely try it out again in the winter. It has a nice subtle scent and a little goes a long way. nan
