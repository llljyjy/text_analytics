This makeup removing balm is definitely one of the best I’ve tried. It glided easily on my skin and removed my makeup well. It left my skin feeling very moisturized after use - maybe a little too moisturized. You have to use a light hand with this product or you’ll wind up greasy. I do prefer cleansers or makeup removing wipes but I’ll definitely keep it in my rotation. nan
