Although this product looks satisfyingly smooth in the jar and smells pleasant, I would not recommend it. I usually use face wipes to remove my makeup. This product removed most of the makeup on my face, but it did not remove the washable mascara. It also made my face feel very dry. I would not recommend this product to people I know and will not be using the rest of this jar unfortunately. nan
