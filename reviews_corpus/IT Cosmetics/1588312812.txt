I was gifted this product,  Confidence In A Cream, by bzzagent, “it“ cosmetics, and Sephora in exchange with my honest review.This product is a Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream and Anti Aging Armour Rejuvenating Concentrate+. It’s the #1 anti-aging cream-now supercharged! And it’s suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin, and it’s non-comedogenic.My honest review:I have been using this product for two weeks, morning and evening on my face and neck. This time, I skipped using serum, I use this cream right after I get out of  shower on my clean face. The cream has a silky creamy texture and I have to wait a little bit to make sure it dries before I can put on my make up but once it dries, it didn’t leave a greasy feeling and it keeps my skin hydrated all day. This cream has a very different scent than other creams I have ever used, it’s like combinations of shea butter and citrus. After using this cream for two weeks, my skin feels smoother and more moist. This cream repaired the tone of my skin and reduced my fine lines especially on my neck, forehead and around my eyes. I will definitely add this into my skin care routine. Awesome moisturizer cream!
