I love the fact that you only need a tiny bit of this, so a little goes a long way. I have oily skin most of the time (drier in the winter) and it hasn’t caused me any issues. I tend to have trouble with finding creams that don’t make my face shiny or feel greasy. This stuff is wonderful and makes my skin so soft! In love!
