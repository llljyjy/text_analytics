I have oily skin and this moisturizer made my skin feel hydrated and firm. It has a lot of benefits and it lasts for a long time. I felt that it lasted me all day and I didnâ€™t need a lot. It prevented me from a shiny oily face which I hate from moisturizers. This was definitely nice to see in this cream. Definitely recommended. Amazing for oily skin!
