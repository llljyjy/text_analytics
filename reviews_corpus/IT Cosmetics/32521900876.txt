The IT Cosmetics Secret Sauce Anti-Aging moisturizer is delightful.  I love the slight iridescent look, and while it feels slightly heavy when you put it on your face it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and happy.  I can’t necessarily say I’ve seen any change in overall skin texture in the 2 weeks I’ve been using, but my skin does feel more moisturized in general which is a huge plus in this dry winter weather!
