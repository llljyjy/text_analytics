I received a full size It Cosmetics Anti-aging Confidence In a Cream in exchange for my honest opinion & review. It is a very nice feeling cream, goes on smooth. I saw no instant improvement, and to be honest I used it twice a day for at least a month. I did not see a difference, as I still have fine lines and dark spots that have not lightened. It is a very nice skin cream, but I cannot see myself buying this for the price point it is, especially when I didn’t see any significant skin improvements. May be helpful for younger skin that doesn’t have fine lines or sunspots yet and is trying to protect it. However, I’m 41, so it’s a little too late for me, unfortunately. nan
