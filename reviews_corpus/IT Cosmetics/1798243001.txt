Confidence in a Cream is rich and creamy and manages to instantly moisturize my dry skin. The color and consistency resembles banana pudding. It melts into the skin, is fast absorbing, but does leave a slightly greasy layer on top of my skin. Even though I have dry skin, Confidence in a Cream is a little too much for me during daytime especially in the hotter summer month. Instead, I prefer to use it as part of my nighttime routine. It is packed with superstar ingredients including some of my favorite ingredients Squalene & Niacinamide, but unfortunately also contains fragrance. The scent is a little too strong and perfumy for my liking but thankfully I donâ€™t have sensitive skin and do not experience any irritation when using fragranced skincare products.  nan
