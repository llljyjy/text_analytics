I’ve been using this moisturizer every morning and evening after my serums for over a week now. A couple things I liked:No scent but also no weird fragrance-free scent! Just smells like nothingThis gets absorbed very quickly into the skin and does not leave a greasy residueI do notice my skin looks smoother and more plump (specifically, my forehead wrinkles are smoother, I’m in my ears 30’s for reference)I didn’t love the packaging, it felt cheap. BUT, I would rather pay for a great formula over paying for a mediocre formula and great packaging. Also, for the winter I would prefer something more moisturizing. This is perfect for summer/spring, but some winter days I need to layer on another moisturizer. nan
