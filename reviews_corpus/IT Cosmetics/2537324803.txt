This is my first time using a melting cleansing balm and I’m still in the fences. It’s a work in progress. Sometimes when I use it to remove some makeup it works, sometime not so much. I have to figure out the best way to use to maximize its use. I do like that it is a balm so application is easy. I just need to find a mild medium. First time I used too much, the second time I not enough to achieve my goals, but I am determined to figure it out. I receive a free sample to use in exchange for my honest opinion. Interesting
