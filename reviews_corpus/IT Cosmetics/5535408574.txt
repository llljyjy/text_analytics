I’m 43 with combination, and sensitive skin. I’ve been using IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream for about a month now. It’s really moisturizing, my skin feels so soft , my skin looks brighter and it has help reduce some of my fine line’s. What I don’t love is the scent of the cream, which does fade away after awhile. I don’t mind scented products , I just really didn’t like the way this smelled and it’s the only reason I gave the 4 stars. It didn’t irritate my sensitive skin so that’s a bonus. I still would recommend this to family and friend’s. My skin looks brighter…
