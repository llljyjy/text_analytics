As someone turning 40 this year, my skin is changing. It’s drier, less firm, starting to show lines and is more prone to redness. But I also still get breakouts. My skin is extremely sensitive and not happy with changes in routine. I’ll admit, the first couple days my skin protested in breakout but then I noticed my skin wasn’t dry and tight feeling anymore, not even after I got out of the shower. My skin was actually holding moisture. Over the course of a couple weeks, my skin was more supple and even toned. It really made a noticeable improvement in the texture of my neck.The consistency is a bit thicker and richer than what would normally use and wasn’t the greatest under makeup but what a wonderful night time moisturizer!It has a light, slightly herbal scent (maybe clary sage or chamomile) that I found pleasant and the fragrance didn’t bother my skin which is rare.While I’ve yet to be disappointed in an It cosmetics item, this is definitely something I would say is worth while for those of us that need something more than the drugstore moisturizer but not quite ready for the high end stuff.I received this product free of charge on. exchange for my honest review and experience and for once I loved it and would highly recommend! Perfect for just starting to need anti aging skin
