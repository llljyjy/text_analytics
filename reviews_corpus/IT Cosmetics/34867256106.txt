The IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream was a good face cream that I used faithfully in my skincare routine morning and night for two weeks as directed, and had replaced it with all of the other products I use because it contains many of the ingredients (niacinimide, hyaluronic acid, etc) that I would use separately.  Although my skin is used to using higher concentrations of niacinimide, this cream did irritate my skin a little, and it did not moisturize as well as expected.  I have combination skin; my skin is dry on my forehead and nose, more oily on my cheeks, and I still felt a dryness on my forehead after application, so I had to reapply.  I havenâ€™t yet noticed any great benefits of the cream, and I hope with more time of use I will see a difference.  I recommend for anyone with really sensitive skin to start with this product just at night and to use a regular moisturizer in the morning. Good Face Cream
