IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream smells awesome, however it’s a light scent without being overpowering as compared to some other creams I’ve used in the past. This is a game changer for my dry/combination skin. It moisturizes my face and keeps it from getting dry. It didn’t clog my pores or break me out. It didn’t irritate my sensitive skin. It really plumps up my skin and gives it a healthy glow without being greasy looking. A little goes a long way and ingredients list is impressive which is even better. I can go to bed looking all tired like my skin has really been through something and wake up smooth and glowy. My wrinkles are not deep so I can’t speak of them. I will definitely buy and recommend IT to my friends and family! WOW
