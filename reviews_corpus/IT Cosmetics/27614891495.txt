I have been using Confidence in a Cream by IT Cosmetics for over two weeks now, and I’m shocked with results I’m already seeing! I’ve struggled with dull skin and aged looking skin for years. I drink plenty of water and have used countless other products throughout the years, and nothing has provided me with these kind of results. I’m noticing my skin stays moisturized and radiant all-day after my morning application and already noticing way less fine lines around my eyes. My t-zone redness is slowly lessening! I can’t get over how soft my skin feels now all day from just one product!! My makeup looks so much better on my skin. Love that my skin is now soft to the touch and not greasy feeling at all. The healthy shine and glow of my skin now is obvious and happened so quickly.My only wish, the container was a little bigger. I’ve gone through most of my jar after just 2 1/2 weeks of morning and night applications.If you are the fence, jump off and give this anti-aging moisturizer a try. You won’t regret it!!! Not a product you will regret buying - I PROMISE!
