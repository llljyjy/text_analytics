This is a thick moisturizer but melts right into your skin!  I have dry skin and this is great for the day, it works great under sunscreen and make up. For night time, at first my skin was dry when I woke up, but with daily use my skin is super hydrated and I don’t have that issue anymore. However I’m pretty sure this will not work for me during winter.  So far (2 weeks in) my skin tone is more even and I feel like my neck lines are less noticeable. Overall I’m enjoying this product. nan
