I have been a big fan of the It Cosmetics CC cream for years: So, it was no surprise that this product is equally amazing. I am approaching 30 and have decided I need to step up my skincare regimen. I’ve used a variety of creams in the past with just okay results. The Confidence in a Cream has given me amazing results. My dull, tired skin is gone. My skin is glowing! It looks hydrated and healthy and my fine lines and pores have basically vanished. I have been getting compliments left and right. I’m a believer of this product and moving it will be my go to! nan
