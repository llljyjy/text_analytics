This is a great moisturizing cream. It has a light scent and doesnâ€™t feel greasy or heavy on my skin like other anti-aging creams tend to do. Since using this cream my skin looks smoother and my wrinkles less noticable overall. I also like that this cream comes in a glass jar.  I will continue to use Confidence in a Cream because I like the anti-aging effects it has on my skin while still feeling comfortable to use. nan
