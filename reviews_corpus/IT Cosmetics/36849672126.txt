Confidence in a Cream goes on like butter. Itâ€™s smooth and creamy. It feels cool going on too. I apply it to my face in the morning and at bed time. It lasts for hours. It works for all skin types. My skin is in between dry and oily depending on the temperature. It makes my skin feel great and I would recommend it to people of all age groups. I will be purchasing more once I run out.
