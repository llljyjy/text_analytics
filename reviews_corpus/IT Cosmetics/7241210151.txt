I WILL RAVE ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME.As soon as I got this in the mail, I opened it and applied it. I’ve been waiting FOREVER for a restock of my shade, and as soon as I saw it back in stock, I swiped it up. It evened out my skin tone soooo nicely and it went on so smoothly. It’s very light and perfect for summer, and I’m so happy with the way it wears! Definitely Worth It!
