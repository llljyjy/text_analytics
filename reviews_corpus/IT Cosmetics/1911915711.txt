it’s hard to find products that hydrate without leaving your face feeling greasy, and this one does the trick. Living in Texas, I have combination skin and with the heat, it’s hard for products to absorb into my skin, but this IT Confidence in a Cream absorbed beautifully, and hydrated without the greasy residue (enough grease with the hot temps!) Definitely recommend. non-greasy hydration!
