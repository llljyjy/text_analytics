I have been using this product for 3 weeks.  It seems to be a heavy cream with an overpowering smell, that does not absorb into the skin very well.  It does seem to moisturize the skin.  I have not seen any blurring of pores or diminishing of fine lines and wrinkles.  Currently, I would not repurchase at the price point.  To be fair, I would like to finish the product, before I totally write it off. Confidence in a Cream
