I was a big fan of this IT cosmetics cream. It was so smooth going on and it didnâ€™t feel too heavy on my face. I used it mostly overnight. The scent was light and pleasant which was just perfect for me. The product is somewhat expensive but a little goes a long way. Overall, this was a win for me. Great cream!
