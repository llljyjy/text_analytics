This moisturizer is great for day & night use. It makes the skin soft, smooth & moisturized without being greasy. It is light & just soaks into the skin. I also like to use it right before I put on my long-wear foundation and it makes it go on so much smoother. I have acne prone skin that can be finicky to some moisturizers but this has not caused any breakouts. Also, this product will lastâ€¦a little goes a long way. I like a little more on my forehead as that is a really dry/problem area for me but the rest of my face only needs a small dab. Excellent Moisturizer- Does NOT Cause Breakouts
