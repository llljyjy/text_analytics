Lightweight yet potent, this cream does it all. It moisturizes, brightens, and makes my skin look and feel soooo good! It’s texture is creamy but doesn’t leave my skin feeling oily. I have normal skin and this feels fabulous! I wear it daily under sunscreen and makeup and it’s the last thing I put on my face at night. It’s my new go-to moisturizer! It’s a yes from me!!
