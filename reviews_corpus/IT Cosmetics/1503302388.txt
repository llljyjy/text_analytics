I received this product free to try from BzzAgent.  I am really enjoying it.  I am not a huge fan of It Cosmetics makeup line for myself so I was unsure how I would feel about this cream, but I really like it!  I concentrate usage of it specifically where I have some minor fine lines around my eleven line area, forhead, and marionette lines.  It has really softened the appearance of the eleven line as well as my marionette lines.  I actually can’t believe how smooth my skin looks around the marionette line area.  Again, the lines were fine to begin with, but I didn’t expect much change since I don’t have that deep of wrinkles in this area.  I am really excited to see how well it works over time with continued use.  #bzzzagent #freeproduct Really Surprised and Loving It!
