I love this cream! It’s a great texture and consistency. It feels wonderful on the skin. I feel soft and hydrated. My skin looks smooth and supple. It isn’t greasy or super thick and I find it works well morning or night and under makeup. It helps fill in fine lines and I think I look a little younger. Woohoo! There isn’t an overpowering scent, it’s light and fresh, but reminds me of a med spa. Everyone should try this!! The Best!
