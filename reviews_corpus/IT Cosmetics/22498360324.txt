I just love it!  As I get older I notice my skin needs more hydration in certain areas.  This cream has a lovely creamy texture but is a bit thicker of a cream so I like to use it at night and let it really soak into my skin.  It has a pleasant light fragrance which is nice (if you like fragrance).  I notice my skin is more even balanced moisture wise and the fine lines by my eyes look better. Loving confidence in a cream
