I’ve been using this moisturizer for two weeks now, and am beginning to notice improvements in my skin such as diminished fine lines, firmness, and hydration.  It has now become a staple in my morning and night skincare routine.  I use it on my face and neck daily and it doesn’t take much to get the coverage needed, which saves product.  It has a nice thick and creamy feel to it and absorbs quickly into the skin.  It has a scent to it when first applied, but it quickly disappears and doesn’t irritate my skin.  I love that this moisturizer works for all skin types and has multiple benefits in one jar so I don’t have to use multiple products to get the results I want.  It’s also clean and vegan which is great and is dermatologist tested as well.  I highly recommend it. A skincare routine must-have
