This moisturizing cream has it all - it hydrates, moisturizes and plumps my skin making it look and feel more supple and smooth. I love how the formula is rich, but not too thick. It absorbs quickly and easily and doesn’t clog up my pores. I wear this at night time and always wake up each morning with glowing skin! My fine lines are less noticeable and any hyperpigmentation I had is fading much faster than usual. I’m obsessed! Skin is more supple and hydrated!
