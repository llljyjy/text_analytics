I love IT cosmetics. I have used many different moisturizers from many brands. Most recently I used Clinique. I like the IT cosmetics much better. It is lightweight and feels good on my face. I donâ€™t like greasy feeling moisturizer cream. This one is not. It settles well into the skin. It does not have a fragrance that is overwhelming. It made my skin feel smooth. I am very happy with this product. Lightweight
