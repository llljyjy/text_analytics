I actually use ALL the products in the It Cosmetics Confidence line and I have ALWAYS adored my It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream moisturizer. I didn’t think it could get any better but I have fallen in love all over again with the New SuperCharged Confidence in a Cream moisturizer! It feels so lush and even more creamy and luxurious than before and yet doesn’t feel a bit heavier or greasy at all. It absorbs immediainto the skin as always but now is even more deeply hydrating with twice the hyaluronic acid. I can tell the difference in the softness of my skin too which I know right away is the squalene. It’s beautiful and not the least bit oily feeling. The ceramides + lipids plump my skin for days! It feels fuller and looks lush and dewy. The benefits of this moisturizer just go on and on with twice more of all the good stuff like niacinamide and 36+ hours of constant hydrating all without the bad stuff like parabens, dyes, or alcohol. There are most definitely twice as many reasons to update your tried and true favorite It Cosmetics moisturizer to the your new forever favorite SuperCharged It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream! Mt tried and & true fave is now my twice as new fa
