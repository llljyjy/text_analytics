I’m 47 and I was always looking for something with a light cover that does not settle in my creases under my eyes. It amazes me with such very little product how it helps cover the broken capillaries in my face and cover uneven skin tone. I would very much like if the product was in a different container like a pump!For users,it’s very important to have Exfoliated skin and good moisturizer underneath. Also use a nice brush applying in circular motion. 47 and loving this product
