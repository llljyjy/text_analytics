I just moved to a much colder climate than from what my skin is used to and was excited to try this moisturizer. I’ve used it for two weeks straight and it feels wonderful when it’s on, but after a few hours I feel like I need to moisturize my skin again. I think it’s a good product, but I don’t think it’s moisturizing enough. It does not really have a scent and the texture is really nice, would be wonderful if your only looking for a lighter moisturizer. Nice, but not enough for a cold dry climate.
