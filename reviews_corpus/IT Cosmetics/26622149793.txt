Received this sample for free in exchange of my honest review. I am 39, mine is dry skin. Lately I see dry patches, uneven skin tone and dull skin and more. It could be a indication of early aging. I feel all these comes under aging issues. Now that it’s time to start concentrating more on my skin care routine habits. Using good Moisturizer is the first thing to start with. First thing I was looking for a good moisturizer that gently cares my skin and help not to damaged more. This IT cosmetics confidence  anti aging hydrating moisturizer works wonders. After using it over 3 weeks I feel it is helping my skin keeping it moisturized for hours. It’s creamy texture spreads evenly to cover most of it. I see visible change in my appearance. It keeps skin hydrated and gives smooth feel by touch. It is very gentle on skin. No over powering scents in it. Just small amount of cream is enough. Very light in weight and not greasy at all. This is exactly what I was looking for. Since then I started using this cream my face looks fresh and healthy than before. I would definitely recommend this. Must try anti aging cream
