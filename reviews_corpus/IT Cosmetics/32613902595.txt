This is a really good cream, my favorite thing about it is how soft and moisturized my skin feels after I use it. A small amount is all I need to use and the consistency of the cream is just right. It has good ingredients for my skin and with consistent use I think it will make a big difference so Iâ€™d recommend it A cream with multiple benefits
