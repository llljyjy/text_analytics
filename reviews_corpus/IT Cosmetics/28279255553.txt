This is a great moisturizer.  It does not make my face feel oily or greasy.  But I can definitely tell my skin has the moisturizer on.  It makes the skin feel good.  I actually found it very useful after my vacation in FL, where I got sunburn and skin was peeling.  So I started using this cream it helped me soothe the pain.  Makes the skin look glowy and youthful.Best thing is it’s very light and does not irritate my skin.  I’d recommend. Smooth and light
