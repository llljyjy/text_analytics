I applied this IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream to my clean skin. I found the texture to be rich but it actually doesn’t feel heavy on the skin. It is very moisturizing. A little bit goes a long way. If it’s generously used, it can take a little longer to make it fully absorb into the skin. It gives a light glow. It reduces my fine lines and makes my skin look more plump. I like the packaging that it comes in. nan
