This cream has a great texture and is medium-weight, I mix it with sunscreen for day & layer it over various serums at night. It has paired with my other products beautifully, I have sensitive skin that can be reactive/can get breakouts from heavier moisturizer so I appreciate that I can rely on this cream without issue! Great everyday moisturizer
