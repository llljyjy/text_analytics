I used it for a week. It felt so smooth going on and my make up melted away. It is so hydrating and my skin feels so smooth applying it. It easily comes off with a damp warm cloth. And leaves your shin feeling so soft for hours. I also used it with just sunscreen on. I love how easy and nice it is to use. I would recommend Bye Bye Cleansing Balm and will continue using it. Bye Bye makeup, Hello hydration.
