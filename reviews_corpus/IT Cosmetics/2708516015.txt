I am obsessed with this cream! I received it to try out for free but I will definitely be purchasing it again.I am always weary about thicker creams, because my skin can be temperamental. However, this absorbs nicely, and the smell is very nice and refreshing.After using for 3 weeks every evening, my skin feels very rejuvenated. My skin feels so quenched, and I notice that my makeup goes on smoother as well. I feel like some of the really tiny fine lines around my eyes and mouth are more smooth and less noticeable.You donâ€™t need very much, a little goes a long way. It glides on easily and it does not pill or leave weird clumps on your skin like so many other really thick creams seem to do on my skin.I am very impressed with this moisturizer and I cant wait to see how it works come the really harsh winter weather! That will be another true test! Gotta Try It!
