This moisturizer made my face really greasy and didn’t do a lick of removing any kind of wrinkles. I don’t suggest this product to anyone. It just wasn’t what I thought it would turn out to be like. The moisturizer sits on top of the skin rather than soaking into the skin. It feels so heavy on the face as if you have Vaseline on. I just don’t like that oily feeling on my face. It caused me to break out more and just wasn’t my kind of moisturizer. I have combination skin as well. Made my face greasy
