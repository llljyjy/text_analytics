There’s nothing quite like a good moisturizer that works well with your skin like the It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Moisturizer does. Being in my mid-thirties and having combo skin, I appreciate the rich, yet light gel-like formula that doesn’t overwhelm or leave my skin feeling greasy. Plus, it’s been cooperating with my skin during the hot summer days, and if it can handle this, I think it’d be great no matter the season. I love how cooling and nourishing it feels once applied, too. I don’t mind the light, pleasant scent either, since it fades quickly once the moisturizer is absorbed. Along with my face, I love applying this to my neck and decolletage area and my skin is left feeling smooth, hydrated with a soft, healthy glow. I have seen improvement with firmness, smoother texture and plumper skin, so I hope with continued use to see some improvement in my fine lines like the one on my forehead as well.
