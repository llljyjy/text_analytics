Confidence in a Cream was OKAY in my opinion. Definitely left my face smoother than a few other products that I have tried. I was hoping it would make my fine lines a little bit less noticeable. Compared to other products I have tried, it was average. I consider myself a skincare snob being in my mid-30s and trying lots of different products. I would recommend this to someone looking for a thicker product to moisturize with. The smell was not overbearing and it disappeared as soon as I applied it. It did not my my skin greasy, nor did it make it look oily after a few hours. Good for a thicker moisturizer
