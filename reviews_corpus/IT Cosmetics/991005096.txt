While I am very familiar with It Cosmetics make up products, this is the first time I have tried one of their skin care products. Personally, I found this to be an average moisturizer. I could detect little, if any, fragrance and the cream is much thicker than products I am used to using. It also feels slippery, if that makes any sense.The list of ingredients is impressive. One of the claims by It Cosmetics states: “Patented Anti-Aging Armour Rejuvenating Concentrate contains higher concentrations of niacinamide, squalane and peptide-lipid complex to reverse 10 signs of aging skin in just 2 weeks!“ Ceramides and Hyaluronic Acid are also in the mix to strengthen and repair skin’s moisture barrier with consistent use.This formula is for all skin types. I have combination skin. It didn’t feel like a Holy Grail moisturizer to me, but everybody’s skin is different. I definitely don’t dislike it, and won’t be buying more, but you may just find it to be perfect for you if you decide to give it a try. It sells for $78 for 4 oz, $52 for 2 oz and $20 for 0.5 oz on itcosmetics.com. Average Moisturizer
