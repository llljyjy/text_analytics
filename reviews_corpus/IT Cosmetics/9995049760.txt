While I liked the star ingredients in this cream, I hardly noticed a difference in my skins appearance even with all it’s claims. Its a thicker cream consistency, though did not feel heavy on my oily skin. It does a good job at moisturizing my skin and leaving it soft afterwards but that’s as much as I got from this. Feels like just another basic thick moisturizer IMO. For those that mind, this does contain fragrance, though at the very bottom of the inci list. Pros: Spreads and absorbs nicely and quickly without any residue or tackinessFeels lightweight once absorbedCons:Contains fragrance.This contains some esters as well, so those with fungal acne may want to steer clear! nan
