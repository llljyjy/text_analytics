I received a free jar of the Confidence In A Cream from Bzzagent to use and review. I’ve been using for a couple of weeks and have noticed that my fine lines are less visible. It has a creamy smooth texture and is easy to apply. A little bit goes a long way. It has a very nice light scent. I found that it absorbed quite well into my skin. I would recommend giving it a try. It’s luxury in a jar. Luxury in a Jar
