This cream feels thick upon first applying but absorbs into the skin quickly and very nicely. My skin is left feeling soft and smooth after. It doesn’t break me out, it has improved the texture of my skin, and it’s great at hydrating and gives a kind of a radiant look to my skin. To me the price tag is worth it because there are great ingredients, it’s effective, and you get quite a bit of product and a little goes a long way. Great cream, I’m definitely repurchasing once it’s gone. New fave
