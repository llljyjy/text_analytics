I am 55 yo and have combination skin. I had dry patches on my cheeks that were rough and oily around nose and forehead. Not anymore! This sauce goes on smooth and easy. It  has made my face soft and smooth with no oiliness in sight! I have used many name brand moisturizers and this one has worked better than others. It does have a light scent but it doesn’t linger after application. I would buy and recommend to friends and family. Best moisturizer I’ve used!
