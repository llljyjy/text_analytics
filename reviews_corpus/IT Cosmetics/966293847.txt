Love this cleansing balm. Donâ€™t expect it to lather much when you use it. It does an efficient job of getting every little spec of makeup and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. Also, it smells divine - slight floral but not too heavy. Will absolutely continue to use this on makeup days. Cleans great and smells amazing!
