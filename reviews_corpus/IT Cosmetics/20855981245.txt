I really enjoyed using the Confidence in a Cream. I had gotten it one time a long time ago and was so sad when I ran out. I love the fresh scent when you first open the heavy glass jar that it comes in. It goes on smooth and soaks in the skin well. It is a thick consistency so it really is better if you  use it at night. I used day and night and it kept my skin nice and silky to the touch. Creamy
