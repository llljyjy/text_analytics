I tried IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Anti-Aging Armour Rejuvenating Concentrate. It comes in a 2oz/60ml jar. It has a scent but it’s not overwhelming.  Just a thicker Cream then most, but you don’t need much to apply. It’s quick absorbing, and contains ceramides, niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, Peptides, and Squalane. It help diminish fine lines , pores and discoloration. Apply to clean dry skin, morning and night. I did both, morning and night, also my neck area. Though it says all skin types, being It’s a thicker Cream, I found personally,  I prefer it at night time. My pores look reduced, but I really haven’t notice diminished fine lines, as of yet. Again it’s a nice cream I would say for a dryer skin type.OneADay_US, @influenster and #OneADayGratitudeProject#ITCosmetics Nice cream
