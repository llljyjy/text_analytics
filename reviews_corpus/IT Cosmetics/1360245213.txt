I like this product and i find it easy to use.  I have Combo/rosacea and it covers well and doesnâ€™t leave me dry or shiny.  It is extremely matte.  I wish it was a little less matte but i can live with it. I wonder what it will be like in winter when its dryer.  I hope it is not too drying.  My biggest complaint is the shade.  Im thinking it needs to be of a certain shade to really cover the red but i am so fair and would really love to see a fair shade. Need more shades!!!
