I received this product compliments of BzzAgent. I was so excited to learn that it is clean. I have switched to clean, non-toxic skincare/cosmetic regimen, so this was perfect for me. There is not a heavy perfume scent, it has a light lavender aroma. The consistency is a silky smooth cream that is not greasy and sinks into the skin immediately. I have used this product morning and night for 2 weeks. I immediately noticed how luminous my skin looked. I am in my 50s and my skin can look sallow and dull, this product was a huge help. In just 2 weeks, I have noticed that my dark spots are starting to lighten a bit. I have tried topical skin lighteners and so no results. I am optimistic about this cream continuing to fade the spots. I use a serum under my moisturizer in the am and the pm. I typically use a Vitamin C serum in the morning and a firming serum in the evening. This cream sinks into my skin immediately and leaves no residue. My liquid foundation blends out nicely over the cream, as well. I am very happy with the results so far. I look forward to seeing further anti aging improvements in the coming weeks. I appreciate that I can use this product morning and night. I have used a mineral based sunscreen on top and it doesnâ€™t feel heavy or thick. I will definitely purchase this product in the future. The packaging has been redesigned and is more sustainable. I am appreciative of the changes and added aging improvements. I will share my experience and results with my friends, they will want the same positive outcome. Effective and "clean"
