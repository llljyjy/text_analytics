So, the creams feels very soft and almost fluffy to my fingers, however once on my face it just feels like a balm. It did not seem to soak in with my summertime skin, even when clean. I tried to use as minimal of an amount as possible too. I may have to reserve this cream to be used in the winter when my skin dries out some, but even then it might not like my combo skin. The scent smells like medicine and is not the most pleasant. I did have to discontinue use, so I can not fully comment on the effectiveness. That being said, if your skin is dry, I have the utmost confidence this moisturizer would work well for you. Maybe in the winter for me
