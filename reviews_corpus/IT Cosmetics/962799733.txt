This truly has a melting consistency and feels so good on your skin. My makeup came right off and my skin felt moisturized after using. I like that thereâ€™s no funky scent to it and that a little bit goes a long way! Great way to take your stubborn make up off and add some hydration to your skin! Works great and feels nice on skin!
