I used this daily for two weeks.  Itâ€™s a small jar but you only need a tiny bit each use.  It will last a long time!  At first it made my eyes and contacts a little irritated but only the initial day or two.  It does help with the dark circles under my eyes for the most part although my usual product did a better job.  For the price and the bc the jar would last a long time, I would still recommend it nan
