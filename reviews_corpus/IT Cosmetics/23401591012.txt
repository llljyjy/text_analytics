I have been using this product for about two weeks now. At first I was a bit nervous because it does have a light citrus scent and I usually donâ€™t you sent it products on my face but so far I have not broken out which is a good sign. A little definitely goes along way my skin feels nice and moisturized. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family. And I can use this product before I use my make up without any problems. I would definitely recommend! Nice and light
