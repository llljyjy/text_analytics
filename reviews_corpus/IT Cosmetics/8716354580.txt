This is a fantastic moisturizer! It leaves my skin very soft. It is a bit on the heavier side so I tend to only apply at night. It has a nice spa-like scent that is not too overpowering. I like the packaging and i think the portion is quite generous for the price as a little goes a long way. Highly recommend! nan
