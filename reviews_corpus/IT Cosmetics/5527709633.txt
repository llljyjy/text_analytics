I really like how this cream makes my skin look and feel. It goes on super smooth and keeps me hydrated and feeling soft. I think with continued use I will grow to love this product even more. Right now I don’t have a lot of wrinkles, but this seems like a great product to help keep them reduced and my skin feeling plump. The only complaint I have is it makes my fingers feel a little sticky right after so I make sure to wash or wipe them off immediately, but it doesn’t make my face feel sticky and seems to soak in fairly quickly. I would definitely recommend this product. Good Stuff
