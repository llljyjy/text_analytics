So far this is a great cream. I haven’t used it long enough to comment on the benefits for wrinkles but it’s very moisturizing and hasn’t broken me out at all! Which is great because I have acne prone skin. I would recommend this more for people with dry skin unless you’re going to use it at night. It does absorb... just takes a min. nan
