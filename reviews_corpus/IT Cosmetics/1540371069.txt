I’m really happy with this product.  I have combination skin that leans to the dryer side.  This moisturizer is a perfect texture- really smooth and creamy and it absorbs really well.  The scent is light and pleasant and I really like how bouncy and bright my skin looks after I use it.  I use a little extra overnight and my skin is really happy in the morning.  I’m looking forward to having this in my arsenal to battle the dry winter months! Bouncy happy skin
