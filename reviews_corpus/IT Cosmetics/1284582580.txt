I decided to try this on just one eye. That way I knew I could really discover any kind of results.I applied this eye cream to my right eye twice a day for 14 days.There was absolutely no difference from the treated eye versus the untreated eye.The only thing it did do was left my eye feeling moisturized.In my honest opinion itâ€™s just a glorified moisturizer with nothing special to it. Not worth the money
