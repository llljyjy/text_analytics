I really wanted to love this cream. When I applied it, I really liked the texture and scent, and loved how it seemingly melted into my skin without leaving any uncomfortable residue. Unfortunately, it did not give me enough moisture for my dry skin. This was particularly pronounced after my morning applications, as it made my makeup feel dry and cakey, and accentuated any fine lines. nan
