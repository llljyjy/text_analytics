I have never used anything like this before. I was really expecting a nice strong but soft scent when I first opened it. I smelt nothing. It feels really greasy. I used it to take my make up off. It works to get any waterproof makeup off. But I still was able to get makeup off with a face wipe. I may not have circled enough in my skin or I needed more. My skin does feel good but I’m having an issue putting it on my face with my fingers and then sticking my fingers back on it again to get more. I’ll probably use it more for a hydrating mask. I’d recommend it. Very hydrating
