One of my favorite moisturizers ever! This cream is so luxurious and perfect for the winter because it is very hydrating. I love using it in the morning and at night. It hydrates my face but it does not feel heavy. Also, I am obsessed with how it smells. It is pricey but in my opinion, it is worth it. Favorite!
