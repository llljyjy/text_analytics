I love this moisturizer. When I received it, the first thing I noticed was the sleek, high quality packaging. Upon using the moisturizer I was very pleased. I have combination skin, dry around my nose and eyes but oily on my T-zone. This moisturizer is nice and creamy, and soaks into your skin nicely. Itâ€™s not greasy or slimy, and has not made my skin break out, despite the fact that I have relatively sensitive skin and often have minor allergic reactions to some cosmetics. After using it for about 3 weeks at night and most mornings, my skin feels very hydrated and looks clear. The cream itself has a slight lavender-like scent, which is very pleasant and not overpowering at all. I would definitely recommend. nan
