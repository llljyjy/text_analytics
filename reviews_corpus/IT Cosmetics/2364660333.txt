The IT Cosmetics confidence in a cream is amazing. I love the packaging. The top being able to screw on and off is great. A little bit of the cream really does go a long way as well. The cream is super moisturizing. My skin is super dry so it has helped give me back some plump skin. The cream does not make my skin greasy or sticky. I would a 100% purchase this cream. nan
