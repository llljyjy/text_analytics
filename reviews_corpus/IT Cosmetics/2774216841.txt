I’m really liking this confidence in a cream moisturizer. It’s different then others and the results are real. There’s no scent and it doesn’t leave any sticky feeling. I’ve been using this everyday for about two weeks. I’ve noticed a decrease in fine lines around my eyes. My skin has smoothed out and has almost a youthful appearance. It’s hydrating and makes my skin soft and vibrant. I’m impressed with this and would recommend to anyone. This goes beyond just being a moisturizer. The actual look of my skin is firmer and overall healthy. Real Results
