I wanted to like this! I use makeup from It and was excited to try their anti-aging moisturizer. I have acne prone skin and hoped 4% niacinamide, third in the ingredients list, would offset any potential breakouts from using a heavier moisturizer with shea butter. Unfortunately, that was not the case. But I keep this next to my desk and use it as a glamorous hand cream and it really works! I have a tendency to bite my fingers while staring at the computer screen working from home, and it really does make a difference in the atrocious effects on my finger pads. I also prefer the lighter scent. Not every face cream works for every face, but this combination has a lot going for i t. nan
