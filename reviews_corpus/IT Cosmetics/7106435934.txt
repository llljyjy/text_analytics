I am absolutely obsessed with IT Cosmetics. I have never tried a product from them that I didn’t think was THE best product and the holy grail of makeup. When I saw the title of this, I expected the same outcome. Sadly that wasn’t the case. My current nighttime routine includes eye makeup remover, a makeup remover wipe for my face, face wash, toner, and then skincare products. I really thought this 3-in-1 cleansing balm was going to get rid of half those steps. I tried it alone the first night...no such luck. I had to go back and do my nighttime routine directly after using. I have to just use it as face wash. I still have to use my eye makeup remover, makeup remover wipe, this as my wash, and then my toner-which still shows evidence of makeup after this routine. I still love IT cosmetics and the rest of my products but the name of this one mislead me into thinking it was a miracle product like the rest of the ones I own. My drugstore face wash cleanses my face better than this one. Not what I expected
