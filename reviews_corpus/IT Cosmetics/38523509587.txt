This cream really stands up to itâ€™s name. I was skeptical at first when I opened the jar and felt the heavy cream but once I applied it to my face, it was absorbed like a thin cream. It absorbed quickly and I could feel it working right away. I was amazed at how it made my aged face start to feel youthful again. It was soft and supple, with fewer lines and shagginess. It is going to be part of my new beauty regimen. Really stands up to it's name
