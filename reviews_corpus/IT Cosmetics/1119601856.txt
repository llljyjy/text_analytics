This is a decent daytime moisturizer. It is easy to apply and absorbs quickly. I wouldn’t use it as a nighttime moisturizer, I prefer something thicker. I didn’t see a noticeable difference in my skin after using but i have been using a skincare routine for years so maybe that’s why. I wouldn’t switch from my current brand to this but it is a decent moisturizer. nan
