I have always heard good things about this cream and always wondered but now I get it!! It absorbs quickly and keeps my skin hydrated without making it oily. I could probably get away with using a bit lighter of a moisturizer during the summer months but either way, it has been great for me! I also love that it works well under makeup. Overall, my skin looks happier and healthier after I started using it so I will definitely continue using this and repurchasing!! nan
