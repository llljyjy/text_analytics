For anyone looking for a moisturizer that hydrates, doesn’t feel heavy and improves the appearance of the signs of aging that are the result of dryness, then this might be a product that addresses those issues. Although it has a dense and buttery texture, it sets to give skin a softly plump finish that I didn’t find too rich for my combo/oily skin.If you’re more concerned about improving the actual health of your skin though, this is a definite skip. The most glaringly obvious con is that this cream comes in jar packaging, which defeats the purpose of the claim that this cream is “SUPERCHARGED“ “anti-aging armour“ since any active ingredients will lose their effectiveness over the course of use. Constantly having to dip into a product isn’t what I consider “clean“ either. Then there’s the noticeable (but not unbearable) lemon-lavender scent: fragrance is never good for skin except for triggering potential reactions. After using this product for a couple of weeks, I can’t wouldn’t recommend it when there are other moisturizers that don’t have so many downsides as this new Confidence in a Cream. nan
