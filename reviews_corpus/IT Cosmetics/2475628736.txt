I love this cream so much! It has an amazing scent of oranges.  In a couple days it has made a visible (surprisingly visible) difference in the appearance of the creases at the bottom of my neck and top of my chest. Little goes long ways, so this will last me a while! Definitely worth the money!! Amazing!
