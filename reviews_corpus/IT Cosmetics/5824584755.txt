When you first open the jar it looks like a hard waxy balm but as soon as you touch the product it melts luxuriously onto your skin. It can be used as a makeup remover, cleanser or face mask. I tried all three and my preference was definitely as a cleanser. I removed my makeup and then used it afterwards by applying and washing off and found my face felt far cleaner than it did with just the previous makeup remover alone. It has a lovely scent without being overpowering. It goes on well and washes off quickly. My skin felt lovely and soft afterwards. It is definitely one of my favourite products I have reviewed and will for sure be adding it as part of my regular skincare routine. Luxurious.
