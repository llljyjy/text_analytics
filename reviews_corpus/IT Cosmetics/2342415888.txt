I have very dry skin, so I am all about cleansing balms, oils and any products that contain hydrating ingredients. I have been using the IT Cosmetics Cleansing Balm for a little over a week now and it has quickly replaced all the other cleansing balms & oils I had been rotating between in my skincare routine. My favorite thing about this cleansing balm is that it is a 3-in-1 product. Not only does it effectively remove my makeup, it also works as a brightening cleanser, and can be used as a hydrating mask, as well. Regardless of how I use it, it always leaves my skin feeling clean, replenished and incredibly hydrated, without leaving behind a greasy residue that requires a double cleanse. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product. nan
