Confidence in a cream? More like zero confidence. I am so disappointed I really wanted to love this cream but the only results I had after using this antiaging cream were huge cystic acne breakouts on my face. I disliked that my skin never absorbed this antiaging cream. I applied as directed morning and night. Sadly, my skin did not fare well. I had to stop applying this cream after I stopped the cystic acne started to heal. Everyone’s experience is different but for me it’s definitely a No and I would not recommend. Zero Confidence!
