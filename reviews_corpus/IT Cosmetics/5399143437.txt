The it cosmetics bye bye makeup 3 in 1 makeup melting cleansing balm is a great product. You just scoop about a pea size out. This product will melt waterproof makeup right off. It can also be used as an hydrating mask. I really like that this product is sulfate free, alcohol free, and paraben free. The ingredients are so good for your skin as well. There is rosehip oil, vitamin c, shea butter. I would highly recommend this product. Great Product
