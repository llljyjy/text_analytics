I normally don’t see a noticeable difference after using a skincare product, even after a couple of weeks, but this was the exception.  My skin looked plumper, smoother, and more healthy looking very soon after I began using this product twice daily.  I also liked the creamy texture of the product.  I haven’t seen any anti-aging yet, but I’m hoping that will come with further use.  Unfortunately, the only downside is that it’s a bit too much for my oily skin in the summer, so it was bad timing.  I definitely noticed an increase in breakouts.  However, they weren’t too bad, and I suspect my skin will be able to handle it in cooler weather, so I will discontinue use until the fall and restart my regimen then. I’m impressed
