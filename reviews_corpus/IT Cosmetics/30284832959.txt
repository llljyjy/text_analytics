I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks. Initially, I was concerned, because this cream felt slightly thick on my skin and wasn’t absorbing as well as my Origins cream. But, I thought maybe it was because it’s summer and this cream is possibly too thick for the summer weather. My skin can be oily when out in the heat. I decided to stop applying my serum before applying Confidence in a Cream after a few days, so I could get a more accurate reading of its effectiveness. I’m not sure if it was from stopping my serum or if it was just my skin getting used to this cream, but it absorbed better than it did the first couple days.I noticed a few improvements so far. My most noticeable lines are in my forehead, and those seem to be slightly smoother. My skin tone seems to be slightly more even, especially on my temple where I had a couple of blemishes. And, my skin seems to be a little tighter…in a good way. I can’t tell if it’s from being plumper or if it’s making my skin more taut.All-in-all, I’m pretty happy with how Confidence in a Cream is working, and would recommend it as of now. Considering I’ve only been using for a couple of weeks, the results have been good. So far, so good
