This moisturizer is great. I was a little worried when I first opened it, because it’s a thick cream and I’m not a fan of super heavy facial moisturizers. However once I rubbed it in my hands a bit, it became much more thin. The cream absorbed very nicely into my skin and didn’t leave my face shiny or greasy looking which is a HUGE plus for me. The fragrance is my favorite, but for how good the cream feels, I don’t mind the scent at all. I can’t wait to see the long term results with this. Amazing!
