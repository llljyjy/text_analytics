This is an amazing product! It makes my skin feel smooth and soft, it’s so easy to apply too. I use it 2 times a day, morning and night. I saw a difference in my skin within 3 days of using it. I will definitely be buying this again! The only downside is it has a strong strange smell, but it’s not a bad smell, just an off smell. You get used to it very easily! Beautiful skin!
