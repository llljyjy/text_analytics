I received the following IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream from BzzAgent.  I enjoyed the light scent it had, can’t place it but something you would smell at a spa. I enjoyed how it wasn’t too thick and easy to smooth onto my face. I liked that it had a bunch of great ingredients like niacinamide and cermides.  Even though I enjoyed the feel and scent, I don’t know if I would get it anytime soon as I enjoy what I am currently using as I haven’t seen much difference. I would recommend this to someone who wants to try something new. nan
