I apsolutley love Confidence in a Cream by It Cosmetics. Iâ€™ve seen amazing results in less than 2 weeks. My skin is dry and very dull looking and in less than 2 weeks my skin looks and feels very hydrated and more plump. The cream it self is very thick and I love it, it feels great putting it on and it has a great smell. Not greasy at all. I definitely recommend it.. Love this
