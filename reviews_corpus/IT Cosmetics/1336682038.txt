I like the coverage, I think it goes on nicely, but I’m not in love with it. I thought the consistency would be a little thinner, it’s quite thick. However it doesn’t sit on your face thick at all. Blends nicely, I do find it to be a little darker than expected though. I’ll use it while I have it but I don’t think I’d re purchase. nan
