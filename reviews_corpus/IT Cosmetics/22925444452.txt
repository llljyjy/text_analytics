I’m a big fan of It cosmetics. Always high quality products. Everything I’ve tried from them I’ve loved. This product is no different. This is a nice luxe feeling cream. Fantastic ingredients like concentrations of niacinamide, squalane and peptide-lipid complex. Has a light floral scent. Not to over powering. Absorbs nicely. Leaves the skin feeling radiant, soft, hydrated and plump. I’ve been using it for a little over two weeks now and I’ve noticed my skin is much firmer. The texture of my skin even feels better. Excited to see what even longer use does. I would definitely recommend this product. nan
