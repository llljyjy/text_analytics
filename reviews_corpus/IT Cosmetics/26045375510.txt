Confidence in a Cream by IT Cosmetics sure lives up to itâ€™s name. After only 3 weeks of use, I have noticed a significant difference in the hydration and complexion of my skin. As someone who constantly struggles with dry skin, this quick-absorbing moisturizing cream works wonders at leaving my skin hydrated and resilient. I love that this product incorporates a vegan formula that is tested by dermatolgists to be safe and suitable for sensitive skin. This is the #1 anti-aging cream on the market and boasts that it solves 10 signs of aging, such as fine lines and wrinkles. I would highly recommend this product and it is now a staple of my skin care routine. My skin has never looked better!
