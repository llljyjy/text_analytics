I have sensitive skin, and this didn’t bother me at all! I also loved the slight scent :) It feels great, goes on light and even though a cream does not feel heavy or greasy after using but very hydrating. Once absorbed makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. I would buy this in the future and highly recommend it! I also have somewhat oily skin and this didn’t make it worse, great for all skin types I’d say. I love this cream moisturizer!
