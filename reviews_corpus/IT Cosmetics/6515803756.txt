I was so pleasantly surprised with how much my skin loved it. I didn’t need to use a lot for it to make such a big difference. Before using it my face had some dry spots that other moisturizers weren’t helping with. Once I started using Confidence in a cream my face felt and looked so hydrated. It melts in without pilling like other moisturizers and really just made my skin look so much brighter and better. Its definitely a keeper and I’ve already recommended it to everyone. Great for dry skin
