Iâ€™ve tried samples of this cream in the past and enjoyed them, but using it twice daily in my skincare routine has been game changing. My skin is so supple, bouncy and bright, and it works so well under my makeup, and plays well with my SPFs and primers! This may be my new favorite face cream, I definitely feel more confident! nan
