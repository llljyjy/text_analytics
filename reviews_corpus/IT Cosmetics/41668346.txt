The Confidence in a Cream is an absolute dream! It is so rich but doesn’t give a greasy or heavy feel to the skin. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling really soft. I haven’t noticed much in terms of softening wrinkles but it’s w improved my overall tone and hydration. It’s also light enough to wear in morning and evening. I’d highly recommend if you have dry or combo skin. amazing cream!
