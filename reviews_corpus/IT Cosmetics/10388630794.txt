I like how effective this is without drying out my skin. The lovely light fragrance melts instantly on my face and pulls up even the most stubborn waterproof and long wear products. I LOVE how wide the jar is and a little really does go a long way. No breakouts, no irritation!It leaves my skin clean yet still moisturized with a natural sheen, it rinses well and leaves my skin ready for the next product. I sometimes use of as part of my double cleanse or just rinse and finish my routine. Even works on Waterproof
