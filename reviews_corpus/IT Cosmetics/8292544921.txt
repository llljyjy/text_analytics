Confidence in a Cream is great for normal and sensitive skin. The formula is all vegan and the scent is light and fresh. The texture of this moisturizer is super thick and creamy. It’s not full of perfume, chemicals and smells absolutely wonderful. The moisture and hydration last up to 48 hours. You only need a very small dime size amount and the cream smooths into the skin effortlessly. In just a few week I’ve noticed my eye wrinkles, face and smile lines have visibly diminished. My face looks and feels younger and healthier than before using this cream. This container is very large and has a generous amount of product. I use this cream after washing my face every morning and night before bed. When I wake-up, my face looks glamorous and ready for the day! This product gives me the confidence to go outside without makeup! I’ve had many compliments on the beautiful look of my mature skin! I’m extremely satisfied and so happy I tried this product. I am definitely going to buy this cream before I run out! It’s a must have! Amazing rich luxurious face cream!
