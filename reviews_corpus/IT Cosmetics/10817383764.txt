I received this incredible product in exchange for my honest review. I am already an IT Cosmetics Customer but had not tried this moisturizer...but I can promise I will be purchasing this. This creamy thick, but not to thick, moisturizer goes on smooth and silky without leaving a greasy residue. My skin soaked it right up. I have mature skin and it definitely gave me the hydration my skin craves. There is also not a whole lot of fragrance to this product which is a huge plus for me. I definitely recommend this product. Must Try!
