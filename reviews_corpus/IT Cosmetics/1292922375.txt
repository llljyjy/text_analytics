I bought this from IT directly because Sephora was out at the time. I really liked it to begin with but then for some reason after the 2nd time I used it I began to have pinhead sized whiteheads all over my face. I have no idea how or why? So I thought I would try it again just to make sure that was the product that was causing it so I used it alone-and sure enough that’s the culprit. It’s unfortunate because other than that, I liked all the other benefits that did for my skin. It Minimized my pores, brightens my skin and it felt pretty clean it even kept it matteI. But I can continue to keep causing these little whiteheads. I’ll try to a few more times just to make sure it’s not just purging my skin, only to eventually quit. Otherwise it will too bad cause I can’t return it to IT without paying, whereas Sephora it would be free, or I could go to store directly. Tiny whiteheads
