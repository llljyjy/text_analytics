I’m new to It cosmetics creams. I found this to be comparable to cold cream.  It felt smooth and absorbed quickly into my skin.  It didn’t feel heavy or greasy which I prefer. It came in a jar and gave you a full portion. I felt the cream left my skin smooth compared to my old cream and a little went a long way. Overall I’m satisfied with the performance and feel this cream leaves me with. Smooth cream smooth results
