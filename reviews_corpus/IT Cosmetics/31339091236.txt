I used MILK MAKEUP Blur Liquid Matte Foundation and can no longer buy it in my shade something about not being able to purchase it due to it being a product outside the US (something like that). I replaced it with this product and the coverage is not even close to the same :/ now I’m stuck with a $40 product I don’t like :( Not as good as MILK MAKEUP Blur Liquid Matte Found
