I’ve been using this for a few weeks and I love it. I’ve been using it most mornings and night. Word of warning, it stings if you have any breaks in the skin! It keeps my skin moisturized without being too greasy. I put it on at least 15-20 minutes before I put my makeup on to give my skin time to absorb it. I’ve applied makeup sooner and it doesn’t stay as well. nan
