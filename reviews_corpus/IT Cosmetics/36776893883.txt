This comes in a heavy glass jar and is very sturdy packaging. I’ve been using this and I like it a lot. It’s moisturizing without being greasy. I wake up and my skin feels hydrated. I do have dry skin and this works so well. It doesn’t break me out. Didn’t irritate my skin at all. It does have a light almost citrus scent to me. But nothing too overpowering. This is a solid moisturizer. It works well so far and I’ll continue using it. IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream
