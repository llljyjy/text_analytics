I can see why this cream can boost confidence. It is really rich and keeps my skin moisturized all night. I have found that it makes the lower part of my face burn really bad. I only use it on my upper cheeks, under eye, nose and forehead now. It is slowly improving the texture. I just wish I could use it on my entire face for a more even complexion. Very moisturizing
