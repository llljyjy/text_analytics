The IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream blew me away. I added this super cream to my morning and evening routine and the difference was astounding! I got plump, hydrated skin that was silky to touch. The fragrance was light, pleasant and added to the spa quality this cream has. I noticed that I had a natural glow after two weeks of using this product. I love that it’s for all skin types and the price isn’t bad for the quality. A little goes a long way, so you can indulge in buying this product. I’ll be purchasing this again and highly recommend Miracle in a jar!
