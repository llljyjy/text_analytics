I have been using the IT Cosmetics confidence in a cream now for about 2 weeks and can already see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and forehead. I love that it’s not overly fragrant as well.  I’ll be excited to see how this continues to work after around 4 weeks as that is really the defining timeline for me and trying a new product for my skin. So far I love it! Love it! Noticing less fine lines!
