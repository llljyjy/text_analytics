I always seek out good quality makeup removers because I use waterproof mascara and gel eyeliners that stick all day. So far my fav is the Clinique one but recently I tried the Bye Bye 3 in 1 Cleansing Balm by @itcosmetics. It removed my waterproof makeup with ease and was gentle on my skin, provided good hydration with a light rose scent!  Even my budgeproof  eyeliner went away with just a little bit of cream. I take a tiny amount and massage it for a couple mins , then either wipe of with a washcloth or double cleanse depending on how my day was. Itâ€™s a big tub so will last me for a while. Little bit takes away everything
