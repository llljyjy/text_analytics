It confidence in a cream just provides enough moisture my skin needs. The cream works well on my oily skin and I’m glad that it doesn’t cause any breakout. The cream it self it lightweight and it absorbs quickly into the skin providing a soft, smooth effect as well it helps reduce the pores around my cheeks area. What I just don’t like about this cream, it’s the scent, I love fragrance on products but this cream have a scent I just don’t like at all and it does take some times for the scent to go; so if you don’t like scent on creams be aware of it, other than that, I love how this cream works on my skin. nan
