I received a free IT cosmetics Confidence in a Cream to review for my honest opinion from Bzzagent. Is perfect for all skin types, even the sensitive and dry skin. I love that the key ingredientsare: Ceramides ,Glycerin,Niacin,Antioxidants,Peptides,Collagen,Hyaluronic Acid,Shea Butter ,Squalane and Vitamin E. The moisturizer cream is thick so a little goes a long way. Also it has subtle scent of citrus like lemon but it doesn’t linger after you applied. It’s not over powering, it smells great in my opinion.  The cream is indeed hydrating, nourishing and soothing.Leaves my skin feeling so hydrated and plump that last all day. I love how my face feels so I also  put some in my neck to don’t forget to put some on yours too.I apply sunscreen after my It confidence in a cream moisturizer It sits wonderfully under makeup it works like wonderful primer. I will purchase some for my mom too, I highly recommended is been a week and I half and my skin loves it. Moisturizing and hydrating
