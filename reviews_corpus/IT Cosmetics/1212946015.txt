I have only been using this cream for about 2 weeks and loving it.This cream has a silky consistency, very moisturizing, not too thick but not too thin either.When applying on my face, it goes on very smooth and although, it has a sticky feeling after applying, it does go away in about 5 min. Since I have only been using it for 2 weeks, there’s not much effect or real changes just yet, however, my skin feels very moisturizing and soft, which of course, soften my creases.In addition, I love the ceramides, squalane, hyaluronic acid, collagen, peptides, niacin in this cream.  Perect for antiaging!One thing, this cream has a very slight cense but I’m ok with it.Bottom line: YES! I love it and I’m 58 Nice
