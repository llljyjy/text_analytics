This is a very good face cream but not for every season in my opinion. I live in a state with hot and humid summers.  When I applied for the first time, I used a lot and it felt sticky and heavy. But also realized, it absorbed very nicely in few minutes. Subsequent times, I used little and it was nice on the skin and felt hydrating even at end of day.  It has nice subtle citrusy/herby smell to it. The jar is big and would last long time if little bit needed at every application.I would recommend using this cream when itâ€™s not humid or if your skin tends to be on drier side all year Excellent cream but heavy. Use little.
