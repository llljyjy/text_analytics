I have sensitive, dry skin so moisturizing is a very important part of my daily skincare routine.  This cream is really thick and rich - it feels incredible on my skin and helps it feel very moisturized. I use it only at night though as it is very very thick but itâ€™s incredibly hydrating. Overall, I am impressed with this cream and will continue to use it every night - especially during these hot Texas summers! nan
