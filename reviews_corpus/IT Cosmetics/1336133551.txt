This balm is so good! I use it as my first cleanse after removing make up, and it works beautifully. Thereâ€™s no stinging of the eyes, it rinses cleanly, a my skin feels hydrated, not tight, after using. The price is good too for how little you actually need for it to be effective.  I love it! Great cleansing balm
