First off, I love this hydrating cream by IT Cosmetics! I received a sample and I loved how silky smooth the cream feels on my skin , doesn’t leave a oily or sticky feeling, it also doesn’t have a scent which I loved I can’t stand a lotion for the face smelling of cologne or musky smells. I did notice a change in the freckle/age spots on my face they seemed to be getting lighter within 2 weeks of applying the cream morning and at night. Another perk was that I didn’t break out! Usually when a cream has peptides I’ve noticed I get little red bumps, but didn’t when using this cream which I’m thankful for. I will be buying an bottle of this when I’m almost out and I would recommend. Totally hydrating for my 43 yr young skin! 43yrs young
