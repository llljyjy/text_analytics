I was so skeptical to use this because it is a cream base when my face is on the oily side but man..I was proven wrong.  Although it’s a cream it is so light weight. It calms my redness, and I have noticed my skin feels smoother. Even when I put makeup on I don’t notice as much texture as I had two weeks ago.  I don’t use it twice a day, I only use it once in the morning before applying my makeup. I’m hoping it helps with age spots too the longer I use it. I did not get any before and after pictures but man I can see and feel the difference with just two weeks use. Seriously. I received this as a free sample but will definitely be buying this and continue using it. Surprisingly proven wrong
