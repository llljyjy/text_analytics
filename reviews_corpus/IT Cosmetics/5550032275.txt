This stuff is awesome. It goes on super smooth and it feels like a lip balm but for your face. I felt like it definitely cleansed my skin without irritation, but something I wasnâ€™t a fan of was the texture on my face afterwards. I think it did a good job hydrating and removing makeup but it felt so waxy on my skin, which kind of defeated the purpose of it being a cleanser for me. It took a while to actually wash it off given the residue. Cleanses but strange residue left on film
