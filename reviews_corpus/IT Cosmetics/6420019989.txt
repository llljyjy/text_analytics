This moisturizer is just *chefâ€™s kiss* I was hesitant about trying this cream because I have oily acne prone skin and I thought that my skin would break out. When using skincare, I still like to make sure my skin is hydrated. I really like this cream because it is not heavy, and hydrates my skin while not breaking me out. The IT cream!
