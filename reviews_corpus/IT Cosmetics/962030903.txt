I have used other products from IT Cosmetics before including their Confidence eye cream and have always been pleased. This moisturizer has the same light but pleasant fragrance as that eye cream and the packaging is similar other than the larger size.   This is an anti-aging moisturizer and I need a few weeks to evaluate the claims fully but for now I can say it is very hydrating from the initial use. I place it on my neck and chest as well as my face and have had no negative effects from daily / nightly use. I have been applying it after my serums but have noted to use different ones and so far it has worked well with all of the major ingredients like HA, vitamin C, Niacinamide (vitamin B) and various other retinoids. This is a moisturizer I will buy for my rotation and if the results show more efficacy in a few weeks Iâ€™ll use it every day! I Love IT!!!
