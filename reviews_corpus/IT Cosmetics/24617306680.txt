I don’t have to search anymore: after trying IT “Confidence in a Cream“  I found my go-to moisturizer. I faithfully applied Confidence in a Cream every morning and night for the last two weeks. Finding a good face cream hasn’t been easy: other products under-delivered on what they promised and caused me to break out. At 53 years old, my entire skincare routine needed to be revamped to meet the changes in my skin. Confidence in a Cream has made a noticeable improvement in the overall appearance of my skin. It’s about as close to hitting “rewind“ on the hands of time as you can get! The fine lines and larger pores that have plagued me are much less noticeable. Using Confidence in a Cream makes my skin feel instantly hydrated. Makeup application is a lot smoother after I let my skin drink this product in. A little of this cream goes a long way, too, so you don’t need to apply a lot of product. I found the scent to be a little strong, but it dissipates quickly. The instructions tell you not to get this product near your eyes, and wow, they were right! The ingredients that benefit your skin are not the greatest when they’re in your eyes. That said, those were the only two “faults“ I could find. You really CAN feel confident in ITs Confidence in a Cream. I would recommend this to anyone and will continue to use it myself. Stop Looking, I Found IT!
