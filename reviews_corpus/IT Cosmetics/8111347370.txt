I wear makeup daily and sometimes my mascara or eyeliner are a bit harder for me to remove. Since I began using this IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm I’ve noticed a big difference in the way my skin feels after using it and it also removes ALL of my makeup whether it’s waterproof or not. I use twice daily, once in morning and once at night before bed. It leaves my skin feeling soft and subtle and TOTALLY makeup free! Removes waterproof makeup like a charm!
