This facial cleansing balm removes makeup and is great at deep cleansing and down to the pores and making my skin look and feel so smooth. It has a faint scent of a rose. It didnâ€™t leave any residue and a little of this cleansing balm goes a long ways and is multi purpose for using as a makeup remover or for just a cleansing product and I am so thrilled at the results after using this cleansing product and I have recommended it to my friends and family. nan
