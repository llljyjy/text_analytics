As much as I try to be consistent with my skin care routine, I always seem to miss a day here and there.  I found that with this cream, my skin just feels better when I use it so it has helped me with being consistent.   The smell is light and pleasant and I do feel I am getting benefits beyond just feeling better when I use it.  I would recommend this to anyone. Good results, feels great on my skin
