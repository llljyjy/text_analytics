I have been using the It Cosmetic “Confidence in a“ line for several years now so I was excited to try their anti-aging formula! This formula addresses multiple signs of aging in a way with excellent ingredients. It combines several ingredients that I apply separately so I love having them in one product!Niacinimide is a potent ingredient for evening skin tone but it is still gentle unlike Retinol or many Vitamin Cs. Squalene mimics the natural oil of the skin so it keeps my face smooth and hydrated. And the Peptide-Lipid Complex gets to work on fine lines!It also has Colloidal Oatmeal to soothe the skin.It has the same light citrus scent as the rest of the line. I tend to pick fragrance-free products but I love this light scent. A Multi Tasking Anti-Aging Cream
