This balm has the texture of a thin petroleum jelly, but is water soluble, rinses cleanly, and doesn’t make my eyes sting or cloud. A little goes a long way, and I adopt the “less is more” approach. Using less provides a little friction to break down makeup and sunscreen. As a cleanser, it’s surprisingly effective, and I love the clean rinse formula. As a mask, it does a good job of sealing in and adding hydration without feeling super heavy. It feels occlusive, but lets my skin breathe at the same time.  I like using this balm all three ways, and it makes my skin soft no matter how I use it. As an overnight mask, though, it makes my skin softest, and I especially reach for it on acid or retinol nights. I love my balm cleansers, but this one just might take the cake.   I can’t think of anything bad to say but that using too much balm creates too much slip and a silicone slickness, but that’s strictly user error…and a definite plus that I don’t need so much. This balm is everything it claims, did not disappoint, and I’m impressed. A multitasking workhorse…
