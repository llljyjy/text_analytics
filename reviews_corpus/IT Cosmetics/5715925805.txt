Luxurious cream!!I have dry, sensitive skin. I have used other products in the morning and by the afternoon my skin showed signs of dryness. Some really burn my eyes badly when I sweat and it drips into my eye so I try to avoid those. But, all of them claim to provide miracle results while none of them do. I’m very happy with the texture and the weight of this cream. It does feel very luxurious, definitely not watery or pasty.  When I use this product in the morning it works all day and NO dry skin appears!  Not lightweight but not at all greasy…super moisturizing and doesn’t make me break out! It has a wonderful non-perfume smelling scent to it that instantly goes away when you rub it on your face and neck.Helps with some fine lines I’ve been noticing too ! Highly recommend! Luxurious cream!
