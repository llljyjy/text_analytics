I am a huge fan of it cosmetics. A couple of their products are staples in my beauty regime. And Confidence in a Cream does not disappoint.This is my favorite new cream! Itâ€™s so rich without being greasy. I love the thick consistency & quick absorption. It really hydrates my skin and makes my fine lines dissapear. I HIGHLY recommend it. Several of my friends have already purchased it since I have shared it with them. 100% Confidence
