I received a free IT cosmetics Confidence in a Cream to review for my honest opinion from Bzzagent. Is perfect for all skin types, even the sensitive and dry skin that i have. I love that the key ingredients are: Ceramides, Glycerin, Niacin,Antioxidants, Peptides, Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Shea Butter, Squalane and Vitamin E. The moisturizer cream is thick so a little goes a long way. Also it has subtle scent of citrus like lemon but it doesn’t linger after you applied. It’s not over powering, it smells great in my opinion.  The cream is indeed hydrating, nourishing and soothing.Leaves my skin feeling so hydrated and plump that last all day. I love how my face feels, I’ve used it on my neck in places as well. You will absolutely love this cream, I’ve used several brands and this is the winner. This cream is so incredible
