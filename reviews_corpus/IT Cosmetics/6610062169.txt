I received this product to try it and review.  I’ve been using the IT Confidence In A Cream for around 2 weeks now. First, I’d like to say, I love the fragrance of the cream. When you put it on it absorbs quickly. It isn’t oily on my skin, which I really like. It seems like it has been working,my fine lines are not so noticeable. I also love that it is Paraben free and it a vegan formula. I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends. I Love It!
