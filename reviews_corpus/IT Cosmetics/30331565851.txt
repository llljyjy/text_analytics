I go hot and cold with this brand. I was looking for something that was lightweight but gave decent coverage, as I was working as a personal assistant with running around to vendors and stores, but also setting up an art studio at night, and creating. So it was important that I didn’t have to worry about my makeup sweating or smearing, as well as quick and easy for my hectic schedule. I have t zone oily combo skin and it’s very sensitive. Upon getting this, I was legit WOWed! After applying moisturizer and primer to sit, I dab a tiny bit of this on each cheek, blend outwards, a dot on the nose and blend up to forehead, and if needed add a wee bit more to forehead and blend with my fingers. Then I do my brows and mascara, and ready to go! It gives an almost flawless appearance—but looks EXTREMELY natural. Evens out skin tone, takes away redness, helps dark under eye, diminishes scars, and my favorite—doesn’t leave my nose in that bizarre pore extreme effect even after hours of wear! You can wear under makeup as well, just wait about 10 minutes to prevent caking. I have had it for almost 2 months and it looks like I barely touched the jar, a little goes a long way! I’d highly recommend. This should also work wonders in summer if you stayed out too long in the sun. Now one of my favorite products! new favorite
