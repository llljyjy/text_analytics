I just started using a new makeup stick that looks amazing and lasts all day, but has been difficult to wash off with my regular cleanser. The IT cometics bye bye makeup cream dissolved my eye makeup in seconds and I was able to easily wipe it off to reveal and clean face. This is good stuff! Gets off every speck of makeup!
