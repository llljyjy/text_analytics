This makeup remover works  great! It takes off  waterproof mascara and leaves my skin feeling super moisturized. I have sensitive skin, so I also like that the chemicals arenâ€™t harsh on my skin! And a bonus is not getting a workout rubbing or scrubbing so hard after applying this remover! Highly recommended! nan
