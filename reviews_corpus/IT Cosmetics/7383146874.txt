I absolutely love this moisturizer! I have very dry skin, even in the summer, and this cream did a great job of hydrating my skin without feeling heavy. I do think it would be fine for oily skin too, though.I only needed a small amount to cover my face. I do notice that if you apply too much, it can pill under makeup, so I apply in two small layers to ensure that I’m super moisturized. Looks great under makeup as a day cream and just as a night cream as well.It appears to be fragrance-free, and didn’t irritate my sensitive skin or break me out. I’ll definitely be adding this to my regular routine. Great for dry skin
