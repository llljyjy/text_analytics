The price point for this can’t be beat! The texture is like a thick gel but it’s so easy to smooth onto my skin and absorbs instantly. At first, I did have minor stinging but my skin got used to this and I have very sensitive skin. I use this daily at night. I’m looking to pair this serum with another one by IT Cosmetics. nan
