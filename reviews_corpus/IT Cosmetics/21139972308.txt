I was pleasantly surprised by this! I had used IT cosmetics brand products in the past and wasn’t wowed by them after continued use. The smell of this was floral but not over powering. Also, a little product goes a long way. Since quality skincare products can be expensive, I liked that I didn’t need to use a lot of it. It also wasn’t sticky and soaked into my skin right away! I liked it a lot. It was my first time trying an anti-aging type of product. Smells great! Good quality skincare product!
