Overall, I think this is a great moisturizer! It has a nice, thick consistency and a good smell. I wore it twice daily for the first week, but unfortunately, I think it’s too thick to use as a day moisturizer / in the morning. I typically don’t break out except for product usage, and that happened to me after about 7 days of use. I will probably switch to a different moisturizer for the daytime moving forward, but this is probably going to work its way into my regular rotation as an evening moisturizer!I didn’t necessarily notice a difference in the firmness of my face or reduction in wrinkles, but I’m also only 33 and typically have fairly firm / wrinkle-free skin. I can say that the skin on my face feels great, and it did not irritate my skin or exacerbate my rosacea, so win-win-win! :)Outside of the moisturizer itself, the bottle itself has a nice weight and overall good design. nan
