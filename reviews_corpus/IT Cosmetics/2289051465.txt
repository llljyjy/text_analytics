Let’s start with the pros: It is very moisturizing. A little goes a long way,  at least for someone with combination skin.  It gets absorbed into the skin very rapidly, without leaving it greasy. Skin feels nicely hydrated, with good elasticity. Cons: It has a smell that reminds me of my grandmother’s creams. It also feels slightly minted and for someone with sensitive skin,  it will burn a bit for a few seconds until it gets absorbed. Rich moisturizer
