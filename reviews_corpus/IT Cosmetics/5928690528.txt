I’m 42 and serious about my skincare routine. Typically I use 4 creams/serums each night. I tried it cosmetics secret sauce anti aging moisturizer and it’s left my skin looking healthy and moisturized during these cool months. It has simplified my skincare routine as it has most of the individual products I was using all in this one. It’s worth the money to me as I would normally spend a lot on each individual item. I’d recommend this if you want healthy glowing skin! All in one wonder
