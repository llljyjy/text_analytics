I am all about active ingredients so I was pleased to see that this product contained some superstar ingredients. I don’t love when a product comes in a jar but this is so creamy and thick that there’s no way a pump applicator would work. A little (pea sized amount) definitely goes a long way so this will last a while.  The cream is definitely hydrating and melted quickly into my dry skin. What most surprised me is that I have a small dark spot on my forehead (guessing sun related). I was previously using a cream specifically to fade it but it didn’t work. The Confidence in a Cream visibly has reduced this spot in a matter of days. Will definitely continue to use. I also like mixing it with a retinol at night to create a buffer and prevent dryness. Also - niacinamide, peptides (two active in confidence in a cream) and retinols actually work very well together so no need to worry about interactions! Definitely recommend this cream! nan
