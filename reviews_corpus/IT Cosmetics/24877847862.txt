I received a free sample of IT Confidence in a Cream from Bzzagent. Compared to Olay, which is what I am currently using, I would say that the consistency is thicker, but somehow it seems to glide on more smoothly. I find myself using half as much product as well, with better results. When using Olay, sometimes it clumps as it dries and the white clumps are visible, but I’ve had no issues with odd unwanted textures with the Confidence in a Cream. It dries sheer, and there’s no sticky residue to be seen anywhere. My skin feels soft, smooth, and hydrated, and I have some stubborn fine lines on my neck that seemed to have softened up a bit after a few days. No breakouts or sensitivity issues either on my end. Scent wise I would say it is pleasant, but I do wish it were a bit lighter. Overall, I would recommend this product, and can see myself switching to this one over the cream that I’m currently using. Very smooth!
