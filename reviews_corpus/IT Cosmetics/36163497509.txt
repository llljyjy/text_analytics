So disappointed with this product.I suffer with perioral dermatitis, and was excited when I found this product as it claims to correct redness on the skin.First, this is a very expensive product, and the jar is minuscule. They claim that you only need a tiny amount to cover redness, however I found myself having to apply multiple layers to cover redness and even still, it wasn’t completely gone. I also found it was pretty drying, and due to having applied multiple layers to try and conceal the redness, my skin appeared cakey.Lastly, the colour is way off. I purchased “transforming porcelain beige” however there’s nothing porcelain about it. Super orange. Disappointed
