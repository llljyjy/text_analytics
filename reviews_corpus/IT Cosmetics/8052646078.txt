I’ve been loving this cream! It works great as a thicker night time moisturizer but I was also able to thin it out and use it under my makeup. It didn’t separate my foundation or cause it to look funny. I’ve gone through a whole jar of the OG cream but I like this one more because it has anti-aging benefits and at 36 I’m loving all the anti-aging products! The only con is I don’t love the smell but it’s the typical moisturizer scent and the smell dissipates quickly. The packaging is quite heavy so it wouldn’t be something I’d travel with.I’d have to put a small amount in a smaller lighter jar but I usually do that anyways when I travel.  It’s very comparable to my tulu cream. I’ve only been using it for about two weeks so I can’t tell u if it really improves fine lines yet. I will say it makes my skin look super healthy and youthful. It’s not heavy or greasy. It cosmetics really makes great products so I do recommend it. I have combo skin and it works great at moisturizing but sinks in quick to not leave my skin greasy or uncomfortable. Overall if u like the original it cosmetics cream…I think you’d like this one a little more. Highly recommend trying it out. I got it free for review but when it’s gone I’m definitely repurchasing it Great everyday cream
