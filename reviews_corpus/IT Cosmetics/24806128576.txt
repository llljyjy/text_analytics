I have been using IT Confidence in a Cream for a little over 3 weeks now, and let me say... This cream is a skin game changer!! I have had a hard time finding a face lotion that doesnâ€™t make my skin super oily or break it out. IT Confidence Cream provides the right amount of moisture and has actually kept my skin clear. I think I have fin ally found the face lotion for me!! Amazing!!
