I’ve been using this cream for a few weeks now and I do see some differences in my face where I have some lines or dark spots so that’s really nice. There really isn’t a scent which is good, the only thing I didn’t like about this cream was that it made my face really oily and greasy. Overall I thought it was a nice product from this brand! nan
