I really liked this product. It was rich and thick and extra moisturizing. It also smells great! I liked using it at night more than in the daytime. I live in south Florida where everyday is hot and humid, so when I sweat, it melts off a little. It worked well under my makeup and I will definitely continue using this, especially when it cools off a little. Super Hydration!
