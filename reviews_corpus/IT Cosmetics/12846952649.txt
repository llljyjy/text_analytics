I love this but at the same time I don’t I have combination skin mostly on the oily side and this made it worse it makes my skin more oily but once the effect of the cream goes away it leaves ur skin so good but that’s the only thing o don’t like of this it makes ur skin so much more oily 24/7 I wash my face before bed abs wakeup with oily skin and through tall day too overall if you don’t mind that I do recommend this product I’ve seen improvement on my face. nan
