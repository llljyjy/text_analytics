This cream is really nice. It has a nice light scent while applying, but immediately goes away. Because it is a cream and it is summer, I have only been using at night. During colder seasons I would think I could use this in the morning as well since I have dry skin. I think it is too soon for me to say that I’ve had the full benefits from it (I believe that takes about 4 weeks to really see some noticeable changes), but I do feel like my face looks a bit more radiant and very moisturized. It didn’t break me out, my face adapted to this quickly. I would buy and recommend this product for dry skin (not sure how it would do on oily skin). The only thing I wish, was that it was non-comedogenic. Most products are for this line, but this one doesn’t appear to be. Good stuff
