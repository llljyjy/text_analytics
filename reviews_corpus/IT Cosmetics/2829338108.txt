I Love Confidence in a Cream.  It really works -fills in those fine lines etc , yet goes on lightly and smooth. It feels so good on your face-- just the right consistency And it lasts on your face and in the jar. I have been and will continue to tell all my friends! This is well worth it. I seriously canâ€™t wait to try this product for eyes!! I Love Confidence in a Cream!
