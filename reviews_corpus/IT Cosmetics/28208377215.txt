This is a great moisturizing cream. A little goes a long way, it absorbs nicely (doesn’t feel heavy or greasy on my skin), leaves my skin soft and smooth. The scent is strong in the bottle but goes on much lighter but just not light enough for my allergies. I don’t know what the fragrance is but it sets off a sneezing fit and makes my nose twitch. This would be the perfect cream if I could get it fragrance free! nan
