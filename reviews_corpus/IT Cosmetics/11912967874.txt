Confidence in a cream is a great skincare product especially if you are looking for anti-aging products. The scent is pleasant and doesnâ€™t irritate my contacts. I only use a little bit as my skin is on the oily side in some areas. It makes my forehead fine lines less noticeable. Leaves my skin looking more youthful. It also is a great overall moisturizer. I will continue to purchase this item. Great anti-aging skincare product
