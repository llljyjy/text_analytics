This product is really neat because it melts when you touch it. It has a decent scent that isn’t too strong or overbearing. It does clean off all your makeup pretty easily. The only thing I didn’t like was you have to rub your fingers in it quite a few times to get enough product to get all your eye makeup off. You could dig your nails in it to get more product I guess but I don’t like that. Other then that I really like the concept. Cleansing Balm
