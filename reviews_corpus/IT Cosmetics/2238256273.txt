The It Confidence in A Cream is a new favorite! I have been using it as my only moisturizer for 2 weeks, once in the morning and once before bed. A couple of times I have forgotten to use it and my skin did not get tight in between like it usually does if I forget to moisturize. It’sa thicker consistency but not as thick as Shiseido’s moisturizer and does not feel like it is melting off when I get hot or sweaty. It’s moisture is comparable with GlamGlow Waterburst. I have noticed a slight decrease in my fine lines since starting use and think it should be helpful in preventing wrinkles of used long term. It soaks in quickly and I have not had any flakey skin since starting to use it which I do get with most other moisturizer except glam glow, so I think this will be a great one to add to my rotation, I also noticed that any zits I’ve gotten have gone away quickly and not been as deep as they typically are, I did not break out with this, I just tend to get zits here and there in general. Overall this is a great cream! Wonderful multitasking moisture, long  lasting!
