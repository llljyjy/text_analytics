This product is so lightweight! It has a very light citrus/rose scent to it. I used a small amount. The amount I scraped up in the pics. I did not follow up with cleanser. Just warm water & a rag. It did remove all my makeup very easily! Notes for next time: probably do lips first & wipe off as to not spread red lipstick all over face. Also it says to avoid getting in eyes, but I feel thats most of the stubborn makeup I need off. I did get it in my eyes. It doesn’t burn or sting but it definitely makes your eyes slightly blurry for a little bit. I’m assuming because it’s a balm. Not sure how to get around that. I won’t open my eyes at all next time & see if that helps. Or maybe just use it on my eyes with a rag & rinse immediately. Either way this is a very great way to remove makeup & I like that it can be used as a hydration mask as well! My dry skin needs all the help it can get. Melts off makeup!
