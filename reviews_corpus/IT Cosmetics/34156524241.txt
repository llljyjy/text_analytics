Confidence cream from IT Cosmetics is my first time trying it and I must say I noticed the difference in the fist week. I have combination skin with some very dry areas, and this cream make my skin look very smoother, and my fine lines look so much better and soft . I have not yet noticed a difference in skin tone but I have only used for two weeks. I have used other creams from recognized brands and this one works much better for me. I definitely recommend it. Good cream
