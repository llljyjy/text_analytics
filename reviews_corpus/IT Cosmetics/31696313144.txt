Right from the jar, I was surprised by how thick this is. It’s so solid it feels like a balm in the jar. However, once I spread it out it became a very creamy texture that quickly melted into the skin. There is a spa-like scent to it, but it’s not too strong. It dries down to a velvet-y finish, and my skin feels super soft as a result. It’s a bit much for my dry skin in the summer, but perfect for the fall/ winter. nan
