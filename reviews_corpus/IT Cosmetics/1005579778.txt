I kind of love all of the IT cosmetics products I’ve tried in the past and this Confidence in a Cream is no exception! It’s very hydrating, absorbs well and keeps my skin plump. I especially love how it holds up under my foundation. On going I definitely see a difference in my skin and it’s texture. I’ll repurpose and I really want the neck cream too! Great addition to my routine
