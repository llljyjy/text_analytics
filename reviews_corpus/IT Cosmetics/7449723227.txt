When it comes to moisturizer, I want something light for the morning that absorbs well and isn’t greasy. For nighttime, I want something that feels substantial enough to moisturize my skin all night long. I don’t know how they did it, but this Secret Sauce Anti-Aging Moisturizer does both! It goes on easily, isn’t greasy, and leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized. It has a super light smell, too. I was really happy with this moisturizer and would definitely consider adding it to my day and night rituals. Great all-around moisturizer
