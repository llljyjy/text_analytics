I am a sun worshiper every summer, which means I am aging faster than my peers. I will take any help I can get to get that copper glow but remove/reduce the wrinkles cause by it! I started using the Confidence in a Cream Anti-Aging Armour for a week, and I’m already starting to see results. It’s still too soon to tell on more defined wrinkles, but many of the fine lines have reduced or completely disappeared. I also love this because it doesn’t leave my face looking shiny or oily, and it smells good (not perfumey) I put it on every night while watching TV before bed, and I wake up moisturized and revitalized. I HIGHLY recommend. Will keep this as part of my regime moving forward. Undoing the Sun's Damage
