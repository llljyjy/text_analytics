Holy Wow! I usually use micellar water to remove make up and to cleanse my pores. I even get the hydrating rose water kind. However, it also over dries my skin. I tried this product and was shocked at how well it removes make up, cleanses pores, and leaves my face feeling hydrated! It works wonders and will definitely be my go-to product for make up removal from here on out! It’s a soft product in a tub, so I used a make up cleansing round and put some of the product on the round. I rubbed the make up across my face, and then the make up just melts away. I rinsed the cream off my face and was left with a smooth and clean surface! It will obviously last a long time too since you don’t need much to clean your face. Make-Up Removes Like Magic
