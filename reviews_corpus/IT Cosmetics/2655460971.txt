I tried this for two weeks. It worked great as a moisturizer. I didn’t notice any noticeable difference with it helping the wrinkles. I never applied it close to my eyes, but it always ended up in my eyes even though I wasn’t sweating. Definitely burned. I would not recommend this product and would not buy it. Don’t recommend
