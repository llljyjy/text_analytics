I like this cream it goes on smooth. It is a little heavy so I used less. My skin feels smooth and itâ€™s not tacky or sticky feeling and absorbs nicely into skin. It took the redness out of my skin. I will continue to use it to see better results. It smells nice and clean no harsh chemicals. I would recommend to family and friends. Nice cream
