It absorbs nicely and fairly quickly. I’ve been using it every morning and night. Morning I wash my face pat it semi dry, put on the moisturizer and sunscreen. At night I was my face, pat it semi dry, put on the moisture (let it fully absorb) and put on Differin. I’ll say that it is moisturizing enough that the Differin didn’t irritate my face which is something other moisturizer couldn’t do. As for the anti aging benefits, I personally haven’t noticed any major differences. nan
