I’m 41 and I’ve experimented with so many products that nothing seems new anymore to me but this was a nice twist. It applys beautifully and works great with my combination skin to sometimes oliy skin with a shine that is never ending. I’m big on presentation so I’m glad to see that this is diplayed beautifully along with a decent amount of product. I usually layer products but for testing purposes I only applied this and it felt like multiple products in one.  So it’s extremely multitasking and a time saver which makes It even more Intriguing to me. I applied it right before bed and I only used four dime size dots which covered my entire face and to my surprise it melted In my skin within seconds. The slight color almost acts as a camouflage giving you a boost of confidence before you go to bed. I tend to deal with redness occasionally and this seemed to calm it down a bit. A very soft light scent that I actually enjoyed and made it not boring but instead one that stands out instead of one you would put aside and forget about. I look forward to applying this night after night especially after my bath and here lately as soon as I wake up in the a.m I can skip my makeup all together except for my mascara. My skin still feels moisturized so overall I think this is a winner and I’m glad I didn’t give up. Could I see myself continuously using a product like this well yes and it makes my skin look like my skin but a better version! Perfect for all skin tones especially mature skin!
