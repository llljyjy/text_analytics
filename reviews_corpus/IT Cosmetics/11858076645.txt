I know how hard it is to find good skincare products, so I want to share my experience and hope that this helps others! I think that we all relate that we go through seasons of life where our skin is suffering and we need to switch up our skincare routine. My 40-something year old skin has been suffering from dryness, dulness, uneven skin tone, fine lines, and lack of firmness. It was also irritated because I went overboard on trying different products in attempt to “fix“ problems.  Really, what my skin seemed to need was a more soothing cream. This IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream was a game changer. Not only did it help to transform my skin, but it also felt soothing and lightweight. The formula was advertised to contain higher concentrations of niacinamide, squalane and peptide-lipid complex to reverse 10 signs of aging skin in just 2 weeks. The ceramides and hyaluronic acid are supposed to help the skin barrier and soothe skin. I gave it a try and felt that it was a game changer that really worked for my skin.  Another great thing about this cream is that I work long days. This formula provides 48HR hydration which more than covers my hectic lifestyle. I’ll continue to use this IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream and buy it in the future! My 40-something skin LOVES this Vegan Moisturizer!
