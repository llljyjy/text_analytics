This moisturizer has a mild citrusy aroma that I found rather pleasing. However, if you’re not a fan of fragrance this may not be for you. It is a thicker cream with a dreamy texture that I applied over my serum. It glides comfortably against my skin making it feel incredibly soft. I was very pleased with the instant hydration that’s long-lasting. Another visible benefit was the reduction in pore size. Unfortunately, I didn’t see any difference in wrinkles or elasticity but to be fair I’ve only been using it for two weeks. I’m pretty sure it would require long-term use to possibly observe that type of result. What I can say, is my skin is looking more hydrated, radiant and rejuvenated. I highly recommend this cream if have dry or aging skin though it’s also recommended to prevent signs of aging. Fantastic for Dry Skin
