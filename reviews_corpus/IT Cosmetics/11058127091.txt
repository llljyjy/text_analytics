I used my Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm and LOVED the results. I am 41 and always looking for ways to help my skin stay hydrated and supple. I used it both as a makeup remover and also left it on longer sometimes to use as a mask. My skin feels very hydrated after use and sooo soft and smooth. My skin underneath my makeup feels radiant!! It takes off my waterproof mascara in a jiffy! works great for me
