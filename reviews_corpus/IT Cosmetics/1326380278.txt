I have dry skin and I am always looking for new moisturizer that work well for my skin. I love how it doesn’t feel too thick on my face and it absorbs really well leaving my skin soft and supple. I’ve noticed the fine lines around my eyes were getting better after the 3 week mark. It def does a great job providing moisture and making your skin feel it’s best. nan
