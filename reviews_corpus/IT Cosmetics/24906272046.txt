it Confidence in a Cream is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. I love how the consistency of the cream is thick but light. I can feel it working on and beneath the surface of my skin. This cream has a nice scent to it (the scent does not linger). This cream is really for ALL skin types. I have combination skin, and my dry areas were adequately moisturized without overstimulating my oily areas. My skin has become softer and more vibrant. nan
