I have started noticing lines especially in my forehead over the last few years. I was able to try IT Cosmetics Confidence in a cream. I saw a difference within two weeks. My skin is firmer, with less noticeable lines on my forehead. My skin tone appears healthier and more even. I had a lot of discoloration on my forehead that has become lighter in just two weeks. The cream has a nice scent. Quick absorption. There is still a lot left in the jar, so it lasts a while. Would definitely recommend this product. nan
