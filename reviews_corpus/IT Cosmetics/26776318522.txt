I really enjoyed this updated version of Confidence in a cream. I have tried the original and this definitely is better. I find it creamier, more moisturizerising and the scent is subtle and doesnâ€™t bother me but my fiance said I smelled like Ben gay. Cant say anything about anti-aging benifits as ive only used it for 2 weeks.I definitely would buy this when this runs out. Better than before!!
