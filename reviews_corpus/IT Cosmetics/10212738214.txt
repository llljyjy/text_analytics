I have aging skin and I focus on caring for it. Iâ€™ve never heard of Confidence before, but this cream really moisturizes without feeling heavy. I love putting in on first thing in the morning, at night, and sometimes through the day, especially since I am outside quite a bit. My skin feels moisturized and hydrated, never greasy. I love it! The fact that it is vegan is a super plus for me and I would recommend it to others. Love this Vegan Non-Greasy Moisturizer!
