If you need a cream that gives you visible results this is the one for you! I’m in my mid 30’s and have been religiously getting into a better skin care routine morning and night to keep my skin looking and feeling youthful while using a product to minimize the aging affects. The environment in which we live can be detrimental to our skin issues. Where I live in Florida, my skin is either too oily due to sweat or too dry due to dehydration. I get the combination. This cream has helped to minimize my fine lines around the eyes aka “crows feet.” I love drinking from straws and with that comes the lip lines too. So I’ve been applying this cream in those areas prone to fine lines and I’ve noticed an incredible difference and improvement! This is a staple in both my nighttime and morning routines! I use a finger dab amount and it spreads evenly over my face then I drag down the excess onto my neck and under chin. It’s not a heavy formula which I like and it’s very lightly scented which is nice. It’s also fast absorbing giving you quicker time to apply makeup or lay down depending on when you apply it. Before certain creams I used were too heavy and thick and it prevented me from applying my makeup soon after or getting confit for bed at night. This hasn’t irritated my skin at all. I have sensitive skin around the eyes but no issues there while using. If you use a separate eye cream, you can save your money and just buy this! It works for it all! Definitely recommend!! I previously was using a sample size of the previous product before it was new and improved…I’m so glad I had the opportunity to try this! I like that it comes in a nice glass durable jar too! Magic in a jar
