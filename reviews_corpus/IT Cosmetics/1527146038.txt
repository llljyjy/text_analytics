I used this cream for 2+ weeks so I could gage if I saw a real difference in my skin. The cream is very thick and a little goes a long way. When I first started using the cream I did break out on the third/forth day of use because my skin wasn’t use to such a heavy product. However, after a few more days my skin began to clear and I kept using the cream. I do like that it is very moisturizing and if you have dry skin it probably works very well. Unfortunately for me it just made my skin more oily. Also, I did not care for the scent, it’s got a slightly floral, mature scent that was unpleasant. The scent did dissipate after 5-10 mins so it did not last too long. I did not notice any difference in the fine lines on my skin so it didn’t seem to plump up my skin in any kind of way. Overall, I didn’t notice any change in the texture, tone, or radiance of my skin. I think this cream would work better for someone with dryer, more mature skin. nan
