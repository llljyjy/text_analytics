I am NOT a fan of moat things IT but this cream definitely has my vote! I’m over 40 and have super dry skin. I apply this to a damp face 2x a day and have felt a difference. My face feels smoother. I did try applying one night without washing my face ( I know, I know, cardinal sin) and it didn’t help. So wash and apply for great skin! Love this one from IT
