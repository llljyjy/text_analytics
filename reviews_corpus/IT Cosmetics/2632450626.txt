This newly enhanced Confidence in a Cream is Excellent! At first glance- This moisturizer comes in a lidded glass jar. A little can go a long way as this is a thick cream. It glides across the skin nicely, and has a faintly botanical spa-like scent but it is not overpowering. After using a full jar- I feel like this cream is great for everyday use and helped my face retain moisture throughout it’s wear. I definitely felt it improve the strength of my skin and helped to firm it up. I also saw that it helped soften out some of the finer lines on my neck. Overall this is a great product and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new moisturizer! Previously I had tried Confidence in a Cream before this formula and it didn’t impress me because it left me greasy but rest assured- this new formula is an awesome improvement! nan
