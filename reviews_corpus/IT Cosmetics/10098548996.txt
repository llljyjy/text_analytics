IT Cosmetics is generally one of my favorite brands when it comes to makeup and skincare, so I was excited to try out the Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm. I think this product did a great job of removing most of my makeup while leaving my skin feeling moisturized unlike other makeup removers that leave my skin super tight and dry. The only struggle the cleansing balm had was in removing my waterproof mascara, but apart from that, I really enjoyed this product. nan
