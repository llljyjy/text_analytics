I have been using a variety of exfoliating products and while they all help my skin this is the first that had a noticeable effect on my pores!! I have large pores on my nose and the cheeks surrounding it. The pores on my cheeks are almost invisible and the massive ones on my nose are way smaller and less crater-like (lol) I was really shocked at the impact of this relatively affordable serum. can’t recommend enough! 10/10Also, a little goes a long way, especially if you notice stinging…most days I just do two drops of my facd and focus on problem areas, one night a week I do 4-5 drops and cover my whole face and neck Really surprised at huge success with this
