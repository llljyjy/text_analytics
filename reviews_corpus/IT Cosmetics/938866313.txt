I’m in my mid-30s and pay a lot of attention to my skincare routine. I’ve noticed that over the years, it can be difficult to add new products into my routine, but I had no issues with this one. I was able to seamlessly replace my previous moisturizer with no adverse reactions anywhere on my face. Confidence in a Cream is extremely thick, kind of like buttercream icing, and I think it works beautifully as a nighttime or winter moisturizer, and because of that, I wouldn’t recommend it for daytime. Some side notes: it is non-greasy, not sticky, no fragrance and sinks right in. Thumbs up from me and definitely recommend for those that have dry skin!
