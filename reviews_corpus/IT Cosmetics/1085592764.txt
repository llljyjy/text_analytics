I have tried many cleansing balms over the years, and this has been my fave so far. I am one who likes a bit of fragrance in their product, and enjoy the light rose scent that this has. A little goes a long way, and I can tell that this tub will last me awhile. It leaves my skin soft and supple after using. This will become a regular part of my beauty regimen. Love love love!
