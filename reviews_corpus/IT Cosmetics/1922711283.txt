As a makeup wearer, I understand the importance of double cleansing. I may not have been first to this party, but now that I’m here, I’ll never go back. It Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Butter is exactly what it sounds like. It can be used as a makeup melting balm, a brightening cleanser or a ultra-hydrating concentrated mask. I’ve only used it as a cleansing balm because I tend to have acne prone skin and the thought of leaving this on my skin for an extended period of time made me nervous. However, I’m loving it to double cleanse. Upon first glance, I love the pretty pink jar. It looks like there won’t be a lot of product in the short, wide jar, but there is and you don’t need a lot of product when double cleansing. As I scooped my first scoop, I smelled the unmistakable scent of roses. The two ingredients that are listed on the front of the jar are Vitamin C and Rose Hip Oil. After reading the ingredients, I found it also contains jojoba oil, Shea butter and hydrogenated castor seed oil. This is a beautiful combination to remove stubborn waterproof makeup and as a first step in a skincare routine. In gentle circles, I start with my cheeks and forehead, then move to my chin and finally my eyes. Then I use a clean cloth to wipe it all off and I follow with a daily cleanser. I love that It Cosmetics is cruelty free and will continue using this!! Smell the Roses!!!
