Product goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely. There’s no heavy scent which is a good thing! I’ve tried different products for aging skin, to help with discoloration and fine line and wrinkles. It may be too soon to tell but I haven’t noticed a huge difference yet. I’ve been using IT cream for about 3 weeks now and will give it another month or so to see if it really makes any changes to my skin. So far, so good
