A good addition to your skin care routine. A small amount works, too much and I leaves your face greasy. It does stay tacky for a bit so I had to wait to finish my routine. Itâ€™s says use morning and night but I barley have time to wake up let alone wash my face again so I use it with my nighttime routine. Did I see instant results? No. Did I see results over time? Yes about two weeks. The texture on my skin is less defined, sunspots lightened. Do I look in my 20s again? No, but at 40 my skin feels fresh and healthy. A good addition to your skin care routine
