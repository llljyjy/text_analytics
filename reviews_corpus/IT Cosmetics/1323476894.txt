Big fan of this cream! Perfect for day and night time use. It feels really gentle yet super hydrating. It makes my skin look like I’m wearing makeup when I’m not. After using it for a month, my esthetician complimented me on my skin, saying it looks so much healthier all around. I think it’s unscented yet still smells nice, which is good for people who are sensitive to smells. The container is huge and a little bit goes a long way so it lasts a long time. luxurious and easy to use
