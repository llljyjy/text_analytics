Great product. It is thick and creamy, so rich and deeply moisturizing. It’s become part of my daily routine. A little goes a long way to cover face and neck area. The product absorbs quickly and it leaves my face feeling soft, not oily. The reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because I didn’t care for the scent. Deeply Moisturizing!
