I mean my title! Iâ€™m so happy to steer away from using makeup remover wipes, I officially love the concept of a cleansing balm. I will admit, it took tow applications to truly get the makeup off however I was wearing a lot (lashes, mascara, foundation!). I love the texture and it smells very good. No more using makeup remover wipes from this point
