I was extremely happy with this cleansing balm from my first use.  I love that I can use this balm as a makeup remover, facial cleanser, and face mask.  It has a very creamy texture and applies to my skin gently and smoothly.  It effectively removes makeup and leaves my skin feeling moisturized all day long.  My skin looks so healthy and radiant after only a few days of use! My skin looks so healthy!
