Iâ€™ve had this moisturizer for a few weeks now and have been using it daily. It absorbs well into my skin and leaves it feeling moisturized and smooth. Although I have not yet seen the benefits of helping with fine lines and wrinkles, I am looking forward to seeing if this helps. I do notice that my makeup is looking better when applied. It has a nice scent and a little bit goes along way.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend. Creamy, smooth, absorbs easily and smells fresh
