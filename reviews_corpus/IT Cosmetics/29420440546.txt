I’ve been using IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye Brightening Eye Cream for about two weeks now. Right away, I loved the blue tint and the consistency of the cream, which has a very luxe feel that feels like a cross between a cream and a salve. It somewhat reminds me of Kiehl’s Avocado Eye Cream and the skin under my eyes feels noticeably moisturized after applying it.I do agree with the product’s claim that it layers well under makeup. I’ve tried other eye creams that pill when I apply concealer but not this one. I also love its “skin-loving” ingredients (hyaluronic acid is one of my favorites). However, at a price point of $49.50 for 0.5 ounces, I’m expecting more.I can’t give this product a full five stars, as its heralded blue tint has not improved the dark circles under my eyes, as claimed. I’m going to give it a fair shot and continue using it until it’s gone. Whether I’d continue to want it depends on how that goes because my dark circles are legend and if this changes that, it truly would be a game changer for me! Until then, I can give it a solid 3 stars. I’ll update my review with a glowing recommendation for this product, pending added effectiveness! A Good Effort but Not Worth the Money
