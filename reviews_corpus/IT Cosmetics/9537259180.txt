I was so excited to use and review this product, and can honestly say that while the reviews are mixed, for my aging dry skin, and fine lines, it has lived up to the hype-so much even my husband noticed!  I apply it in the AM, and it provides a dewy glow thatâ€™s visible even with the additional application of foundation and blush. I use a small amount at night before bed and wake up with fresher looking skin. I love that it contains hyaluronic acid, vitamin E and collagen and with continued use, expect the benefits to continue-especially the reduction of visible fine lines.  I would definitely recommend it as a staple for mature skin! This is IT!
