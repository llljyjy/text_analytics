the IT confidence moisturizer is easy to absorb in my skin, not thick or dried out on my face at all. It feels moisturized, but not oily. The cream helps to make my skin glow, and firm my fine lines around the corner of my eyes and mouth. I have been using it for weeks, and I think it is good for summer, for it does not feel sticky in the hot days. The cream does make my face light up and even my skin tone a little bit. I like IT brand skin care
