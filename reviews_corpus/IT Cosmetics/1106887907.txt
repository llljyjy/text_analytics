I love Confidence in a Cream! It is a rich, creamy moisturizer that, even in the middle of a hot summer, is refreshing and doesnâ€™t feel too thick on my skin. I love the clean, fresh smell, and I really think it is making my skin look plumper and less crepey. The ingredients are all ideal for my aging dry skin, and the price point is amazing. I would highly recommend it! Thick, Rich, and Plumping
