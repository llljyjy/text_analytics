For having mature skin this is a wonderful product that also works as a primer.  Most makeup products fall into fine lines but this product  I’m left with a fresh and flawless look when applying makeup after.   I use this morning and night and have noticed some trouble spots are gone and refreshed.   Wish I had this years ago but I’m so happy I’ve tried it today.  It’s a game changer for my makeup routine that’s fir sure Absolute dream in a jar
