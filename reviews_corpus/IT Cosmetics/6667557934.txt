I’ve been using this for about two weeks, day and night. My skin is really hydrated. The cream I feels light weight and absorbs quickly, but it really packs in a ton of moisture. I have noticed some improvement in fine lines, but not much difference in my more prominent wrinkles. My skin does look more radiant and softer though, just always looking for a magic age reversing tool, so I can’t give it 5 stars. The smell is really light and pretty as well. nan
