After being gifted this wonderful cream, I used it for 2 weeks, and my skin looks absolutely wonderful. Lines are softened, skin looks smooth, and feels silky. I’m mainly used the confidence in a cream at night, because it is very rich, and took a decent amount of time to fully absorb. I found out very early that a little bit goes a long way. If you’re looking for a very intense hydrating cream, you are going to love this one. Excellent Hydration!
