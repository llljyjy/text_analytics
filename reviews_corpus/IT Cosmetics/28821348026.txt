After coming back from being on vacation in gorgeous RI in 99 degree weather it was great having this baby along to quench the thirst on my skin.  OMG it was so harsh that it was nice to come to the room and take a cool shower and apply this beautiful formula on my dryed skin.  Thanks to @ItCosmetics and @BzzAgent  both!!.  This itâ€™s absolutely a staple in my skin care... Quenching to my face...
