This cream feels lux. I have very dry skin and this melts into my face. It has a subtle scent but it doesn’t linger. I wear it under makeup and it helps with the creasing around my eyes. It hasn’t made a difference to my face overall though. Maybe I just need to use it a little longer. Thick and moisturizing
