The it Confidence in a Cream Anti-Aging Armour has a really unique formula.  It’s super thick; you can turn it upside down and it won’t run out!  Being so thick, you only need a little dab to moisturize your entire face and neck.  Even though the price is a little on the high side, the product should last quite long since you only need such a small amount.  I’ve had no skin reactions to using this, and I even put it around my eyes as well.I only use the moisturizer at night.  While it does eventually absorb nicely into my skin overnight, I don’t think I’d want to wear it underneath my makeup.  I’m 34, and try to avoid the sun, so I don’t have a lot of skin problems.  I can’t say that I’ve seen any improvement in fine lines, but it does provide excellent hydration.  I’ve only used the moisturizer for a few weeks now, so I’m hoping to see more results with continued use! Creamy Confidence
