This is my new holy grail! I cannot believe that I have not found this sooner. I seriously struggle with removing my waterproof mascara and eyeliners. I have been using products that I can clearly tell how many chemicals are in it by how badly my eyes burn when I open them. This product does not make my eyes burn at all and that is truly incredible to me! I thought it was going to be like a lotion but it ended up being like a legitimate balm. A little goes a long way. Honestly thus container could last me the entire year! My only criticism would be that there needs to be an application spatula. Packaging is great. Smells very clean without any strong perfumes. A 10/10 for sure. Removed my sunscreen CC cream easily. Very hydrating without feeling oily. I love that it has natural ingredients like Vitamin C and Rosehip. Reusable packaging as well which makes me happy! Incredibalm
