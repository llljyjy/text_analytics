my thoughts on this hydrating cream are simple. it’s one of the best moisturizers I’ve used in a good while and the reason being is that it is a product that means what it states it will do for your skin. as a 43 year old woman with maturing skin, I have noticed in the two weeks of using this moisturizer that my skin is more taunt and firm, less fine lines and wrinkles and my complexion is flawless looking. Having combination skin, I was a little reluctant that it would make my t-zone area oily, but that is not at all the case, I’m absolutely amazed with this product. It also has a pleasant smell that isn’t too overwhelming and not irritating to my skin. with that said, I recommend this product and will aquire a future purchase. IT has done it again!...
