I had the opportunity to try this cream out and it has helped maintain the moisture in my skin. When I have dry skin it causes it to get itchy and textured and irritated. Outside of that I have super sensitive skin. Well can I just say I didn’t experience any of that. My skin was the softest and glowiest it has been in some time. I didn’t feel texture or irritation and it felt super hydrated. I also noticed that some of my fine lines were a little less visible.  Definitely recommend this. Super Moisturizing
