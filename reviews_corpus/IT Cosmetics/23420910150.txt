I received this product free to review. I have used the original moisturizer in the past but it was always little sample size but it was always one of my favorites! I used a lighter moisturizer during the day but this is a fabulous night time moisturizer! It smells amazing! A little goes a long way so for the price it will last awhile! I would definitely recommend this product! I haven’t used it long so I can’t say much about the anti-aging but we will see! I love this moisturizer!
