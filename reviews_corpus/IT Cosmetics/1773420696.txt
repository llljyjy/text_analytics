As a soon to be 60 year old who doesn’t use any Botox or fillers, I am willing to splurge on skin products that nourish my face and keep it youthful. This jar of CONFIDENCE IN A CREAM had me from the moment I opened the jar and applied it to my skin. It glided onto my face like the silkiest balm, it isn’t heavy like some creams I have, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized in the perfect way. And the scent is probably my favorite of all my face products! I have for quite a while been using separate hyaluronic acid serum on my face, with great results, so was so happy that this cream included it. After two weeks of using this product, I feel that I have firmer skin with fewer fine lines around my eyes and in the neck area as well. I will definitely continue using this cream, and also will continue sharing it with my husband - after all, it’s for all skin types :) Loving this Cream!
