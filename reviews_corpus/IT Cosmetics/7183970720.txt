This product actually works well to moisturize and smooth my skin.  HOWEVER, the scent?!  It’s so strong that it makes my eyes water for an hour after application.  It’s not a bad scent and I usually don’t mind added fragrance but this one sooo strong that my eyes can’t even handle it.  This makes it unusable for me. I’m so sad because it really was a nice nighttime cream.  Remove the overwhelming scent and it’s a perfect product. Why would they ruin such a good thing with an unnecessary fragrance? overwhelming scent ruins it
