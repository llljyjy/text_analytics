I received this little jar of goodness for free from Influenster, in exchange for my honest opinions. All views expressed are my own! No one likes a liar!I’ve been using It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer for about two weeks now. Though I know that this isn’t truly enough time to see the full benefits or downfalls of a skincare product, I’ll tell you what I’ve experienced so far!First, its claim that it is ultra hydrating and quick absorbing, I would totally agree with! I used it both in the AM and the PM, and my skin always felt sufficiently moisturized. I have combo skin, so I never know if my face is going to be a desert or slicker than a mechanics floor! This cream, thankfully, didn’t have an issue with either situation. I never felt greasy, or like my face might crack from the lack of moisture. They also assert that this cream primes the face for makeup, and that it’ll prolong the wear of the makeup. I didn’t have any issues applying my makeup after using this product. It didn’t cause my foundation to slip or to transfer throughout the day. I’m honestly not sure if it prolonged my wear time, or if that was just my setting spray. But it did make my face look bright, smooth, and even under my makeup.Here are a few of their other claimed benefits, and my opinion:Reduces Look of Fine Lines: I don’t think I’ve been using it long enough to really see the benefits of this particular assertion. (Though I’ve got my fingers crossed!)Smooths Skin: Check! My skin definitely appeared smoother with use. The backsides of babies everywhere would be jealous!Visibly Evens Tone and Visibly Minimizes Pores: I have a few sunspots and uneven areas. I do feel like this did a little in that area, but I don’t believe 2 weeks is enough to enjoy this benefit. As for the pores, I didn’t really have high hopes. I really believe it’s more of a blurring effect. My pores weren’t magically gone, but they didn’t seem to be as noticeable. I’m feeling pretty confident!
