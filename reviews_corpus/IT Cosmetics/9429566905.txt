It Confidence in a Cream is utterly amazing! From the moment it touches your skin the hydration is just so soothing! I’ve tried other products in the past that claim to offer some of the same benefits Confidence in a Cream offers but this product actually produces results. I always worry about the lines on my forehead. They are not bad but I know with time they will get worse. I am confident using this product will help diminish the look of those lines because of the results I’ve already seen. I would absolutely recommend this product to everyone I know!  I will be buying this product again. nan
