I’m not surprised that this magical cream has sold out!! It’s rich & luxurious. Very thick, so I use it only at night. It’spacked with skin loving ingredients like ceramides, Hyaluronic acid, etc. It has a very light pleasant fragrance that doesn’t trigger my allergies at all. I’ve been using this for several weeks and I am seeing amazing results- bright, glowy skin, less fine lines, smoother texture. Totally recommend!!! Good stuff!
