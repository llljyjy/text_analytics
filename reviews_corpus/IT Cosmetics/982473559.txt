I love the IT Cosmetics brand but this product seemed to miss the mark for me. It is a thick cream but the downside is that I didn’t feel like it absorbed well at all. It might be better in cooler weather months but in the warm summer, it was heavier than I would like. It’s nothing I could layer with other face products. I also didn’t love the slight scent to it. nan
