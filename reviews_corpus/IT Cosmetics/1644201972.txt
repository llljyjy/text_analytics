I’ve been using this for just over 2 weeks, morning & night, and I am at amazed I already see a difference. Not only has it diminished the fine lines I have around the edges of my lips, but I also see an improvement in the firmness of the skin on my neck. I have used other products for these issues, but none has made this difference in this short a period of time. It’s very moisturizing, but not heavy or greasy. I also noticed my skin is plump and glowing in the morning. I wish I had found this years ago. I highly recommend. Amazing!
