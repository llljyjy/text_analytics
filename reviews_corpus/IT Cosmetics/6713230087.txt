I have dry skin and am always on the lookout for a great hydrating moisturizer. I really like this cream because although it’s a thicker consistency, it absorbs quickly by melting into my skin as I lightly rub it in. Unlike most thicker cream, this isn’t greasy or tacky afterwards. The scent is pleasant, and it’s very hydrating. I use this morning and night, and my skin feels plump and looks dewy fresh. Super Hydrating
