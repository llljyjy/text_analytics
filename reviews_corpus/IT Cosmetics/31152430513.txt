I have been struggling to find a good foundation for oily skin that doesn’t break me out. This has been just amazing. Not a single breakout from it. It isn’t as matte as I hoped it would be and is a little thick. It does feel like it sits on the skin vs melting into the skin. But I will say this is a beautiful foundation. My skin looks beautiful with it. Great coverage too. Great for oily skin
