This is my go to cleanser - especially during drier months. Paired with an oil cleanser to get off makeup, this stuff works like an absolute charm, and doesn’t leave my face feeling stripped afterwards. I love that it doesn’t dry my skin out, but also doesn’t leave an awkward film on my face (or leaves me feeling like there’s still dirt on my skin) like other cleansers. Perfect hydrating cleanser!
