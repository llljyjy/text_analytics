Confidence in a cream is great for those with all skin types (except super oily). It moisturizes well, it’s not greasy, it doesn’t clog pores, and the texture is nice! Plus, there’s tons of product compared to how much you actually use daily! After a few weeks, my skin is clearer and there’s less fine lines. I have noticed though that after a few hours, my skin does get quite oily. But after that, it’s fine. Overall, I do recommend this cream! I can see it doing wonders for people with dry skin. Great moisturizer with tons of pros!
