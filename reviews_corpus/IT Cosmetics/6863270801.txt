Confidence in a Cream works like a dream! I love this supercharged anti-aging hydrating moisturizer. I like the rich, silky feel of this moisturizer. Super quick absorbing after application. I noticed plumper and firmer skin within the first few days of use. Within 2 weeks I noticed less visible wrinkles around my eyes and a more even skin tone. Along with less visible neck lines and more radiant, hydrated skin. Confidence in a Cream contains good for your skin ingredients: Niacinamide, Peptide Lipid Complex and Squalane. I completely recommend Confidence in a Cream for real results you can see. Works like a dream
