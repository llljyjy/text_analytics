This stuff really works! I’ve never used anything like this before to remove makeup so I wasn’t sure how it would work. Usually I use liquid makeup remover. This is like a wax and it sort of melts when you rub it in. It removes every trace of makeup quickly and easily, way better than any other makeup remover I’ve ever used. It is a bit messy compared to what I’m used to but it’s not a huge problem. It rinsed off very easily. I also like that it’s unscented and doesn’t have a ton of weird ingredients. I will definitly buy this again in the future and I’ve been recommending it to many people. Really Works
