My first time using this cream and I have been loving how it has worked so far. The texture is not too heavy or greasy and it works for the summer time. A little amount goes a long way. I have been using it as a base for my makeup, love it more for the night time before bed. It makes my skin feels so moisturized the next morning. nan
