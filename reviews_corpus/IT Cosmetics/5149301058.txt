I am in my mid 30â€™s and love this moisturizer! It helps my skin appear glowy and refreshed while also helping with fine lines. It is lightweight and blends into skin seamlessly without and greasiness left behind. It is great under make up or on its own. This product is worth it and works just as well or better than similar products in the high end range. New Favorite Moisturizer!
