I’ve really enjoyed using IT cosmetics make up, but this is the first time I’ve tried anything from their skincare line. Right off the bat- I was glad to see it’s paraben free/vegan. Also, I’ve been using a regular moisturizing cream for a while now and knew it was time to get something anti-aging (I’m now in my 30s). The cream is thick so a little goes a long way and has a slight scent which was a little strong for a face cream. I would have preferred it to be unscented personally. It goes on the skin like butter and get absorbed quickly too. I have dry skin and I only use it before bed and my face stayed moisturized all night long! I may try it for day time, but usually like my daytime fave creams to have some kind of SPF. I definitely have noticed my skin tone looks smoother and softer from only a couple weeks. Also, have noticed a very slight reduction in my fine lines which I was very happy about! Highly recommend and willPurchase when I run out for sure! nan
