This is an honest review of the IT Confidence In A Cream that I received and have used it for a week.. The Confidence In A Cream does an amazing job of providing my facial and neck area moisture compared to a few brands I’ve used for moisturizing the IT brand works so much better. I’ve used it for only a week and have had great moisture since my skin is dry. Some benefits  of using this product are: it provides moisture,  lightweight and  my skin is smooth. I will continue to use this product to see if it will help with anti-aging.  I would definitely purchase the IT Confidence In A Cream and recommend it to family and friends. Great moisturizing cream for lunch skin types
