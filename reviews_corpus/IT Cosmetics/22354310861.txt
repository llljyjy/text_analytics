It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream is hands down my favorite moisturizer! It works on all skin types and I think that’s important for combination skin like mine. The formula is so creamy and it absorbs into my skin quickly. It’s great for fighting fine lines and wrinkles. I love how my skin feels after I use it. In the two weeks I’ve been using it I feel like it has transformed my skin. I now have softer, smoother, and younger-looking skin. I will definitely purchase this product again and again. My favorite moisturizer!
