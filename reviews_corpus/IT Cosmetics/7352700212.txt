I thought I was an Olay faithful for life until I had gotten a sample. The IT confidence in a cream is fast absorbing and feels light on the skin. My skin is somewhat sensitive but I haven’t experienced any issues or breakouts. Since the formula isn’t oily I think it makes for a great makeup base. I’ve noticed my skin has taken on a slightly more radiant glow too! This is IT!
