I have been using Confidence in a Cream by IT Cosmetics for a couple weeks now.  I like that it goes on smooth and absorbs in my skin very well. You don’t have to use lots of it so this jar will last you a long time. I was a little afraid to to try at as my skin is so sensitive but I am happy to report that I did not break out at all! Makes my skin feel so soft and I have even noticed that the fine lines around my eyes are fading. And that’s after only a few weeks I can’t wait to see what it does in the future! A Little Goes A Long Way!
