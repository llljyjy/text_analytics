I got this product gifted to me and it’s not the first time I’ve had it! This is my third jar I’ve gotten. It’s a very thick cream, which makes it a really nice, night cream for me. I have normal skin and I’m 52 years old. It feels amazing and so luxe putting it on! I can see a person with dry skin really loving this as their daytime moisturizer. Even if you have oily skin, I think you would enjoy it for a night moisturizer. I love the thickness it has and you don’t need a ton of product to spread it all over your face, neck & decollete’. I will continue to use it  as long as I can. It’s a bit pricey but worth looking into during a sale or deal. I really like it a lot! Great Moisturizer!
