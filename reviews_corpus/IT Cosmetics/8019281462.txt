A little pricy, but you get what you pay for! When I use this cream as a finisher to my skincare routine.. I can tell that it really gets deep down into my skin and hydrates for a full 24 hours. This doesnâ€™t leave my skin with an oily residue, so I can use it in the morning before applying my makeup, as well as at night before I go to sleep. Highly recommend to anyone looking to up their skincare game! Wow!
