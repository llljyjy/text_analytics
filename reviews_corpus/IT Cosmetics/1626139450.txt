IT Cosmetics has done big things over the years, but I’ve primarily indulged in the makeup side of the product line, and this was my first time trying the skincare line. First off, the packaging is nice. It’s sleek and secure with no chances of leaking or losing product. It has a very faint scent which I’m a big fan of because it doesn’t compete with other skin care or give me a headache. It’s a very think buttery kind of moisturizer that I was afraid may break me out, but luckily it doesn’t. It will fully absorb in a fairly short amount of time. I’ve worn both under makeup and as part of my nighttime routine and found that it works best at night because it’s so thick and creamy. It is super moisturizing and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and supple which is probably my favorite part. Because it’s so thick it does make me greasy faster under makeup, so I prefer use as a last step at night. Overall for the amount of product you get for the price, it’s definitely worth the purchase. Best as a Night Cream
