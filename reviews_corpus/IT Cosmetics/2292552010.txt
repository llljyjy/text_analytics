I have always had dry skin, and so the search for a cream that actually works without being too heavy is never ending. This cream adds tons of moisture while still being light enough to wear under make up. I love how I can wear a heavier layer as a nighttime cream as well. It keeps my skin glowing and I will definitely be repurchasing. Confidence indeed
