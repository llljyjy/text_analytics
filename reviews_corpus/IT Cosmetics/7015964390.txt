I have been using ITâ€™s Confidence in a Cream for about a week now and I can really feel the difference it is making on my face and neck. It has a very light scent and goes on very light. I have used near my eyes for those stubborn fine lines and it does not seem to bother my eye sensitivity at all. It is an affordable answer for a reliable product that helps smooth the skin and hide those fine lines us ladies tend to get around the eyes, mouth, neck and forehead. I am loving the results I have been seeing from it. The only thing I will say is that even though the product is very light it does go on a bit sticky and will stay that way until it absorbs all the way into the skin, usually about 30-45 mins. I would definitely recommend and plan on buying more when I run out. Light scent and smooth skin
