I really liked this product. IT Cosmetics Confidence in a cream is super easy to use and apply. It comes packaged in a jar, so you can use your fingers to apply and once it’s empty, you can clean it out and reuse it for something else. Goes on smooth and dries fast, not greasy at all and leaves my face feeling soft. It’s anti aging and works great for fine lines and wrinkles,moisturizes and brightens skin, feeling refreshed all day long. I applied in the morning and loved the way my skin felt all day long. If you have dry skin, this cream is perfect. Goes on smooth
