I’ve tried many types/brands of makeup removers with minimal amount of expectations met.I LOVE this product. It goes over&beyond in product performance.A little smear of this product truly melts away your makeup especially the stubborn-hard to wash off mascara. It doesn’t leave any mascara on the lashes and doesn’t take any lashes off.It leaves your skin feeling cleaned and moisturized simultaneously, no matter your skin type. I have extremely dry facial skin in fall/winter and annoyingly oily skin in the summer. I love it
