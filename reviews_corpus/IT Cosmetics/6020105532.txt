Love this cream! It’s a nice rich cream with a pleasant smell that’s not overwhelming. My skin definitely feels more hydrated, more plumped and supple. I rub the cream in on my fingers and massage it all over my face. I prefer to use it at night to replenish my skin and wake up fresh. Great Moisturizing Cream
