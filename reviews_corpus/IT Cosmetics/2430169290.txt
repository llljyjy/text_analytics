This is the first cleansing balm I’ve tried, and so far I love it. This is a very unique product. The balm texture is something to get used to. It’s very thick. I almost feel like I’m digging into lip balm. Upon massaging it into my face, I was immediately hit with a lovely rose scent. It does a great job at removing makeup. Nothing was left on my skin. If you decide to use it as a cleanser, then don’t be surprised when it doesn’t lather. It still does a great job of cleaning and moisturizing. The first time I tried it I only used it on half of my face, and found the side I used it on to feel much softer than the other. I can’t even imagine how soft it would make my skin as a mask. I’d definitely recommend this cleansing balm. nan
