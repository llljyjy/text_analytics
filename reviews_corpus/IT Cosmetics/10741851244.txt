First the positives: smell is faint and pleasant, it is hydrating, the quantity is decent.Negatives: did nothing for my under eye bags, did nothing for dark circles, barely had effect on wrinkles, I’d say it is 5% better since I’ve been using this for a month, the cost is way too high for such quality you can get 20$ eye cream that will have same effects, when I wash it off I can tell, it kinda sits on the skin . I’ve been using it pretty regularly day and night for 5 weeks. wouldn’t recommend
