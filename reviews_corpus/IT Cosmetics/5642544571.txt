’ve only been using this Confidence in a Cream/Supercharge for about a week, and it feels nice on my skin after I have applied it and let it sink into my skin. It’s not overly fragrant; I like the scent of this cream; smells clean and fresh.  It has the perfect texture that glides on and absorbs nicely into the skin. It has what my other products were lacking, like getting multiple products into one.  I’m looking forward to seeing how my skin looks in a few weeks. I’ll be adding this one along with my regular skincare routine. Still, now I will be replacing my old moisturizer with the new Confidence in a Cream, it’s been updated, and it’s now supercharged, with added ingredients that help combat aging skin. I usually use a different moisturizer underneath my eyes at night, but I decided to try this under my eyes, and I love it. I have slightly mature skin, so this will be good for me. I use it every morning and night and can’t wait to see what the results will be a few weeks from now. My skin now feels soft, smooth, and hydrated. Light but powerful moisturizer
