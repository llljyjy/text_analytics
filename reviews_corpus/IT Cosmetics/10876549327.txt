I am in love with this cleansing balm! It is super easy to use and feels so good on my skin. It makes my skin super soft and I love how easy it is to use. Great for removing makeup and the spf cream I use. Compared to other products I used, this is one of my favorites. It doesnâ€™t leave my skin dry or sticky at all. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to try it. I love this cleansing balm!
