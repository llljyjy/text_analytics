I absolutely loved the IT Cosmetics Secret Sauce Anti-Aging Moisturizer.  It comes in a very classy looking box and when you open it up the moisturizer has an iridescent color to it which is appealing to the eyes.  It is thick when you apply it but donâ€™t let that scare you off as it absorbs into your skin quickly and will leave your skin feeling refreshed and hydrated in a matter of seconds. Absolutely Great Product!
