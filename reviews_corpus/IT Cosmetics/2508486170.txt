As a moisturizer, I thought that this cream was very nice. It feels good on the skin and definitely helps with that post wash dry sensation that I always get when I wash my face. The only issue I had with this product is that it is very heavily scented. I usually like an unscented moisturizer for my face, and while my skin is not sensitive to fragrance, I don’t like anything too strong. Its not unpleasant by any means, more of a citrus, but if you don’t like scented moisturizers, this may not be for you nan
