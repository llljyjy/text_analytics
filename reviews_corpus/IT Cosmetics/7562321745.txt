Loved it!!!I liked the color, texture, and how soft this moisturizer  is. Once I applied it didn’t feel sticky or heavy at all. The next day my skin was smooth and I’m definitely keep on and joining this moisturizer until I get a new one! I also love that there was no fraggs and it has only a small nice very smooth scent. nan
