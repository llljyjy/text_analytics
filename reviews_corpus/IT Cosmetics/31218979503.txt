I have used this Confidence In A Cream for the last 14 days and my skin feels amazing! The texture of the cream is a little thick and buttery but soft as smooth. The scent isn’t bad either. I love the way my skin feels after using this by It Cosmetics. Other products feel watery or leaves my skin feeling greasy whereas this one leaves me feeling smooth and healthy. I am so glad I’ve discovered this product. True to its name
