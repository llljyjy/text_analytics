I enjoyed this cream, it’s very nice! It’s a little thick and doesn’t absorb very fast but it’s ultra hydrating and deeply saturating. The scent is light and pleasant. I didn’t notice any difference in my fine lines and wrinkles...yet! Maybe I need to use it longer before I can see a difference. Deeply hydrating
