I have been using this cream for a few weeks now and so far I have been extremely pleased with my experience. The cream is very smooth and melts into your skin effortlessly. I use a very small amount, which is all thats necessary because the cream is very easy to massage into your skin and spread around. I typically struggle with lotions and creams that feel heavy on my skin during the day, but this cream does not feel heavy at all, very happy so far and I will continue to use it. I love the way it makes my skin feel
