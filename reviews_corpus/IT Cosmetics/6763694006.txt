I absolutely love this cream. It’s very thick & you don’t need much to cover your face/neck. It is very hydrating- love the texture. I have combination skin and was worried that cream will be to heavy, but this is perfect even for the summer. It also has a light scent which I actually like. I am considering purchasing a second jar, thank you bzzagent for giving me the opportunity to try this amazing product! Very confident!
