This IT Confidence in a cream Anti-Aging Armour has been everything I wanted and more.  I have normal to dry skin that is prone to eczema. I have been using this product for a few weeks and am very happy with the results. Packaging and container are ok product inside is creamy and has this very fresh and clean subtle scent to it. It goes on my skin smoothly and absorbs fast doesnâ€™t leave me with an oily feeling but my skin does feel hydrated. I would recommend for others with my same skin type great quality product for an amazing price in comparison to similar  moisturizers. Amazed
