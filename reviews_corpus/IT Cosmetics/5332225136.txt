Considering this is called a cream, and not just a moisturizer, I expected a thick consistency. I was pleasantly surprise when I first tapped my finger in the jar and it was thicker than other moisturizers I’ve used but quickly melted into my skin. I felt hydrated, smooth, and plumped. Yes, I felt like it plumped and revived my skin! Since trying this cream I’ve been using it day and night and I am loving the results. It’s transforming my dull dry skin! I only wish it had a fragrant scent.I received this product free for review, but all opinions are my own. I plan to repurchase! Wow!
