I received this from BzzAgent and I have to say that I am so happy that they sent this to me. The jar is very pleasing and nice to look at. I also love IT Cosmetics and their products as well. This cream went onto my face very nicely and did not feel tacky at all. It made my face super soft and smooth and I just love this. This is worth the money! Amazing Cream!
