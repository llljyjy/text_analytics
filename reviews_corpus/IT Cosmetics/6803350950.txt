This moisturizer has been so wonderful during this dry winter season for my skin. My skin has been so dry this season that this moisturizer has been one of the few things to really help add the moisture back into my skin thought it was missing. I really love using the staff overnight. Because it keeps my skin feeling hydrated and moisturize even when I wake up the next morning. highly recommend! Dry skin savior
