I have tried a few face creams, and my go-to was OLAY but this has got to be one of my favorites by far.  I received this as a sample, but I think once I run out Iâ€™ll be purchasing.I apply this 1-2 times a day, once in the morning and once at night or after a shower. It leaves my skin soft and silky and, well moisturized without feeling heavy or oily and the scent is light. Also, I might add that my skin can be sensitive to certain products and this did not cause any irritation or reaction afterward. I HIGHLY recommend this! nan
