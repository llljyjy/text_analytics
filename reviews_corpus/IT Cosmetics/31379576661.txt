This cleansing balm is great at removing makeup, even tough waterproof eyeliner and mascara without much effort at all. I really was impressed with how moisturizing this was and how it made my skin super dewy and bright after rinsing it off. I love that this contains vitamin C and ceramides, I have noticed those two ingredients really help to make my skin look good! Overall, I would definitely recommend this cleansing balm if you are looking for something to remove all your makeup AND work like skincare to brighten/moisturize the skin at the same time! Love the skincare benefits of this cleansing balm!
