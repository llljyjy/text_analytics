Nourishing, gentle and hydrating, this cream was easy to use and distribute throughout my face and generally absorbed rather quickly. It made my skin, especially my forehead feel much smoother than usual and kept my entire face feeling well hydrated throughout the day. The only negative I would say, is that the sheen on my face was bit stronger than I typically like. Otherwise, my experience was positive and I liked that it was gentle and did not promote or cause any type of irritation or breakout. A Healthy Shine for Healthy Skin
