This anti-aging cream is really a lifesaver, especially since I’m starting to be self-conscious wearing makeup because my fine lines are getting more visible. The ceramides in this product really helps in keeping my skin moisturized for long periods of time- and the mild scent is a much appreciated plus.I really like the peptides in it, because after just a few weeks of regular use I can see that the appearance of my fine lines are getting less visible! I also apply it on my neck and décolletage and have been seeing the same results. All in all, it truly is a jar full of confidence! A jar full of confidence!
