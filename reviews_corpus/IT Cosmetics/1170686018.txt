I really like this cream.  My skin is somewhat oily, so creams make me a little nervous.  The Confidence in a Cream did not make me super oily.  My skin just felt very moisturized and healthy.  I have noticed a little improvement in fine lines and hope to see more improvement as I use it.  It also has a very nice light fragrance. I use it all over my face and neck at night.  Since it is a hot summer where I live, I have only used it a couple times during the day.  I will use day and night when the weather cools and my skin get drier.Overall, Iâ€™m really happy with this cream and will continue using it. nan
