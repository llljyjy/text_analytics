I tried Confidence in a Cream without changing any other products in my routine. I feel like it refined my skin’s texture and gave my skin more bounce. I have sensitive skin and the cream felt effective without causing irritation. At it’s price point, I think it provides better results than more expensive creams. I’d recommend giving this cream a try! nan
