This is a nice medium-light moisturizer. I would say it’s better for normal skin than dry skin. It is better for me in the summer when my skin is not as dry. I prefer a heavier moisturizer. But if you have normal skin type this would be great. It has a nice light scent and didn’t irritate my skin at all. Nice light-medium moisturizer
