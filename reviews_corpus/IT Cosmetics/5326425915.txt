As a newly minted 40-year-old, I have found myself feeling a bit blue about my overall skin tone and texture. I was delighted to find that I had been selected to receive this particular sample. At the time, I was searching for a new moisturizer but was not having any success. After just a few days I noticed an improvement in the overall tone of my skin.  My complexion seemed brighter and I started feeling as though I could maybe pull back on the amount of makeup that I used. After a couple of weeks, I noticed that when I did wear makeup that it sat better on my skin. There was a noticeable difference in the amount of creasing of my foundation and there was a definite improvement in the suppleness of my skin. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to visibly improve the tone, texture, and moisture tot heir skin. They wouldnâ€™t be disappointed. Completely Confident
