While I won’t say this is a bad product, I will say that it’s just not the product for me. What I liked about it is that it provided a lot of moisture to the skin, but it felt thick on the skin even though you don’t have to use very much of the product. Compared to some other products I’ve used; you didn’t have to use much, and I did appreciate that because that means it’ll last a while. It did feel as if it was clogging my pores though. I did not like that. I did not see much difference when it comes to wrinkles and other skin imperfections, but maybe two weeks was not long enough to see results. Overall, I would not personally use the product, but it may work for others with different skin textures. I do feel that serums work best for me, not creams, so I do not recommend. Not for me
