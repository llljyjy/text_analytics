I definitely enjoyed this moisturizer. I love that a little bit goes a long way. I found that it did tighten my skin decently. The smell is a little over powering and takes some getting used to. I  could tell when applying my skin would feel tighter at that moment. I would buy this product in the future. I would recommend giving the product a try but not for people that are sensitive to scent.  I would describe the cream as a rich thick cream that absorbs into my skin quickly and doesnâ€™t feel greasy and makes my skin feel soft. nan
