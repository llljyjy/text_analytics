I really love using the makeup melting cleansing balm by It cosmetics. My absolute favorite part about it is the scent by far! The rose hip oil makes it smell amazing! It’s a nice light scent that isn’t to overpowering. This is super easy to use. You just take a little on your fingers and then rub it in a circular motion on your face and then use warm water to rinse it off at the end and it takes your makeup right off easily and makes my skin feel smoother and softer. I’m extremely pleased with it and would definitely get it again! I use it in the morning after I wake up and also at night before I go to bed. You can also use it as a face mask if you leave it on for about ten minutes. It’s wonderful!! I would definitely recommend it. Awesome Pruduct!
