Confidence in a jar is very hydration. It’s great on my super dry skin. I have been using it for a little over a week and I have also notice my skin looking smoother, firmer, and plumper. It’s a rich looking cream, but it’s actually light, absorbs well with no greasiness. It makes my skin happy, comfortable.I love it and recommends giving it a try if you have dry skin and other skincare issues.I wil continue to use and would buy again. hydrating
