This cream is almost completely scentless which would be one of my first creams that didn’t have any sense at all. There’s a lot in the package and it’s slides on your skin very easily. My skin absorbs it quite quickly and it doesn’t leave a sticky layer on my face. I’ve been using it for a few weeks and I have noticed that my skin looks and feels a lot smoother Effective
