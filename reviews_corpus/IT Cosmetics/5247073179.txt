This cream smells so good! It reminds me of being at the beach, almost a faint coconut scent to it. The only disadvantage and reason I rated 4/5 stars is because it almost feels sticky/tight (if that makes sense) after it’s set for a few minutes. I got this as a sample to try, but wouldn’t spend the $50+ that Sephora wants for it :-E nan
