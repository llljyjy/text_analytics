I tried this cream with a funny name and was surprised by how it made my skin look after a week of using it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. My skin began to look less blemished and some fine lines seemed to disappear. I would recommend to anyone looking to improve the appearance of their complexion. Good cream to improve complexion
