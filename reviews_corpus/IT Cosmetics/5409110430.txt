I hate that I love this so much! I have already repurchased twice and haven’t found a similar product to replace it with. I love that it’s in a pump, has no fragrance, and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I hate heavy feeling moisturizers and this gel formula is perfection. I just wish it had better ingredients. I know it’s full of silicones and hate the idea of putting it on face. nan
