I usually wear a shade or two above the lightest shade in skin products, but after reading the reviews I opted for the lightest color which was a perfect match (sorry, it is not porcelain skin friendly :( ). It looks very nice when first applied though the finish is more of a velvety natural glow than matte. That’s where the positives end. It starts creasing minutes after applying and shifts and streaks throughout the day. It’s worse with the more moisturizing products I use, but it still happens even if I apply it to totally dry skin. By the end of the day, it has worn off almost completely, even after applying finishing powder and a bit of spray. Letdown
