IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer has made my facial skin look and feel healthier.   I have not been using for long and I have noticed my skin has a more even tone.  Feels much smoother and softer.  Absorbs quickly and feels non-greasy.  I love the scent, you can really notice it.   Fine lines look less noticeable , but I will need to use longer to see if the results better.   My. facial skin is oily and acne prone and I did not have any breakouts using this cream.  No irritation.  I would definitely buy and continue to use.  I highly recommend to those who want an anti-aging moisturizer that gives you positive results. Soft and Moisturized!
