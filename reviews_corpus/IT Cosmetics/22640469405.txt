This is a wonderful face cream! I’m always skeptical about the efficacy of skincare, but in just two weeks I noticed several changes in my mature skin. My fine lines and wrinkles were diminished, the crepey skin on my neck and chest felt and looked firmer, my face looked and felt firmer, my dry skin had improved, and I feel like I appear younger! I’ve tried a lot of skincare and so far this is one of my favorites that you don’t need a prescription to get. You get 2 ounces as opposed to the standard 1.7 ounces in a very weighted glass jar, it does have a sort of medicinal type scent so if you’re sensitive to that be careful or don’t select this product. It’s got a very creamy consistency that absorbs fairly quickly into skin, works beautifully under makeup, and is overall an excellent choice of facial cream. You wouldn’t be disappointed if you choose to pick it up. Great Anti-Aging Face Cream!!!!!!
