I like that this product is able to simplify my skincare routine down to just cleansing and using this product since it’s packed with beneficial ingredients! This makes it great for anyone on the go with little room to bring along a whole 4-5 step routine of products. The product is easy to apply and feels lightweight on the skin. It also doesn’t leave any greasy residue so it’s great for both night and morning routines. One Step Skincare
