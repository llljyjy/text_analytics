This cream is a game changer. I used to use another “prestige“ brand moisturizer cream which was double the price and never had the results I had with confidence in a cream. I have combination dry skin and was very hard to find a product that wasn’t greasy on my skin. Neither one that my skin could absorb so fast but still feel the hydration. Doesn’t really have a smell to me which I person like and the mew package has less plastic.It’s really hard to find a Clean and Vegan cream with all the good ingredients that this has. I will definitely recommend this Perfect hydration for my skin
