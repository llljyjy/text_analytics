7 benefits in one cream!? Wow! I must admit that I was sceptical of the claims on the IT Confidence in a Cream, especially being someone with very oily skin. I can happily report that the moisture gave me no problems under my makeup and left my skin feeling hydrated and renewed. I have large pores and uneven skin tone. I love the pore reduction and plumping of skin that the Confidence in a cream gave! The ceramides and hyaluronic acid help to strengthen and repair the skins moisture barrier all while being a quick absorbing formula. I appreciate the clean formula that is free of artificial dyes and drying alcohols. A great daily moisturizer for all skin types! Amazing moisture!
