I really like this moisturizer. I’ve been using it for 2 weeks, morning and night. It’s super hydrating but not heavy or oily. It absorbs quickly with a smooth and matte finish. It is nourishing and has a great, fresh scent. As far as anti-aging, I can’t really attest to that. It’s only been 2 weeks. But I do really like this cream and I will continue to use it as part of my daily routine. a little goes a long way!
