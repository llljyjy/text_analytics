I have extremely dry skin, this stuff is great.  The moisturizer sinks really well into my skin and does not leave any residue. I can use it at night before bed and in the morning before applying makeup. My nose has always been my trouble area, and while it still is slightly flakey it is much better than it was before. I can’t wait to use this lotion in the winter. I do wish the packaging was different, I do not like having to scoop out product and touch more than what I’m using.  I wish it came in a pump, but I realize that is difficult with a thick cream. My nose is finally not dry!
