received a complimentary it Bye Bye Make Up 3 in 1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm for testing purposes. I love that this offers 3 benefits in one jar. My eye makeup can be a pain to remove and this makes removal an ease. The balm melts in hand with body heat and a little goes a long way. I really like the rose hip in this formula and it smells great. Love that I can quickly apply to dry skin then rinse. I do enjoy using as the hydrating mask a few days a week. Leaves my skin cleanser with a dewy glow and soft. nan
