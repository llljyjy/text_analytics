I have been using Confidence in a Cream for years... but then IT changed the formula and it made my skin break out and cause blemishes! I used to have acne free and blemish free skin until IT changed the formula in their moisturizer. IT, please bring back the old formula. Why would you change it? So many people loved the old formula, it was wonderful!Anyway, I have to return this moisturizer now. It is not doing my skin any good, I do not want to keep having to hide my blemishes with concealer every day (I didn’t used to have to wear makeup daily!). I will try out Tatcha’s moisturizer. New Formula is Not Good!
