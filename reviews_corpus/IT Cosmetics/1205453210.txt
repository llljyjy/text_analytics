I was excited to try this moisturizer after reading many positive reviews.  My skin tends to be dry but breaks out easily and this cream was a perfect fit for me.  It keeps my skin hydrated but not oily and did not contribute to additional breakouts.  Itâ€™s a nice thick consistency but absorbs into my skin well and has a very light scent.  I will definitely repurchase! So hydrating!
