I love this cream. It far out ranks the creams I’ve used before, this one is not tacky or sticky. I had it all day in.and out the heat and humidity, not once did my face feel like I had cracking face mask on. My dry skin loss of fitness but it through the test. I can’t wait to take my friends have a spa makeover night and share this with them YES YES I will recommend this to all the ladies and men I know they love to pamper the skin on the face.
