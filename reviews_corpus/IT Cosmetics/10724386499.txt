I absolutely love this moisturizer! I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks and have definitely noticed an improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles. My skin looks brighter and more even toned since I started using it. The only thing I don’t really like is the rose scent, but it works so good that I’ll deal with it. nan
