I love any skincare product containing hyaluronic acid, and this is no exception. The texture is somewhat heavy but somehow sinks into the skin quickly and without leaving behind a residue or other uncomfortable feeling on the skin. A little of this also goes a long way, so I am confident that this will last a good amount of time. Great for dry skin
