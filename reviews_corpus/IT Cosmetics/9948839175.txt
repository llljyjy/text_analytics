Confidence in a Cream does just that...plus more.  Iâ€™ve tried just about every moisturizer on the market, and this one really does live up to its name.  My skin is super dry, and I have not only age to thank for this condition, but also 1.)the lack of humidity outside  2.) the dry air created by working in air conditioning in the summer and 3.) forced air heating in the winter. This is a total no-win situation, and few moisturizers really helped much.Confidence In A Cream works quickly, sinking in and instantly pumping up the outer layers of my face and neck.  Unlike a lot of other moisturizing creams, it is not heavy.  it goes on quickly and blends into the skin immediately. Its scent is also quite light; not like the cloying scent of many other creams.All in all, this moisturizing cream by IT Cosmetics is my new go-to in my fight against age and the physical environments.
