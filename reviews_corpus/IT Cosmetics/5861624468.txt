The IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer is worthwhile and feels great on skin.  At first glance the cream seems really really thick in the jar but a little goes a long way and when gliding onto skin it is not thick feeling or greasy or heavy.  It feels nice and supple on skin and no overpowering scent.   A good moisturizing cream and works well with my sensitive skin and not being irritating at all but still too early on in the process to really notice anti aging benefits stated. Goes on Smooth and Non Greasy
