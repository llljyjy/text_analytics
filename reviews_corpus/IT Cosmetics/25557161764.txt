This facial cream is thick and creamy that it can moisture my skin without feeling heavy and greasy. I can feel my skin more hydration after couple weeks, but I haven’t used long enough to see the decreasing of my wrinkles and fine lines. that’s why I give 4 stars. Overall, I do recommend this to anymore over 30+ nan
