I got this last June and finished exactly a year later. Just got to the last of it this week by cutting it open from the top and scooping out product with a chopstick. I either use my fingers or a wet sponge to apply. It’s pretty thick and full coverage, and I definitely notice this the most when I come back to it after using other products. For example, I recently started using a clinique foundation serum which is also full coverage but so much lighter. The color range for this is also not great so sometimes I blend it with another cc product to get a better match for undertones. That helps it be less thick too.Idk, it’s probably about the third time I’ve purchased this from Sephora in the last few years and who knows, I might gravitate towards it again even though I don’t absolutely love it. Because it’s a sunscreen product at the end of the day, I don’t care that much and it does a good job at what it’s supposed to do. nan
