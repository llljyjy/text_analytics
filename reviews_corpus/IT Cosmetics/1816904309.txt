The confidence in a cream is thick and creamy. The cream applies to the skin evenly and blends well. I didn’t have any adverse reactions or breakouts. It blended seamlessly into my usual skincare routine. I did notice the cream has a scent to it. It’s a mix of citrus and floral. I felt a slight warming sensation when I first applied the product. It does leave a hydrating layer on the skin without leaving a sticky or tacky feeling. The cream didn’t flake or leave a white cast on my skin either. Due to it’s thick consistency a small amount goes a long way. Thick and creamy
