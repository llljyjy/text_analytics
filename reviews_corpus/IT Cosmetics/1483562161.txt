love the It Cosmetics CC Cream and have used it for several years. I was so happy to get to try the Confidence in a Cream moisturizer. It has a nice, citrusy scent that isn’t overpowering. I have sensitive skin and this hasn’t caused any skin issues for me. In fact, my skin feels very soft and plump after using. The ingredient list is good. Very moisturizing
