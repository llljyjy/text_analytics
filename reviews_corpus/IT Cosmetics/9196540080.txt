Being the person i am, the first thing i did was smell the product. I was pleasantly surprised by the nice, light spa like scent.  The product has a thick creamy texture. Not thick in a bad way. Thick in a luxurious way...kinda like me. The moisturizer applied nicely to my face. It did take about a minute or so for it to fully absorb into my skin. Once absorbed, it felt very hydrating and almost like there was a plumpness to my skin. Although this moisturizer is a bit on the pricey side, hence the four stars, I will purchase it again. For reference, I’m 49 yrs old. I’ve included a photo where I just happen to be at my dermatologist’s office for something totally unrelated,  but he did mention how great my skin looked...coincidence or Confidence in a Cream nan
