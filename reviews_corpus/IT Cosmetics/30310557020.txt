I have oily, dry, sensitive skin. I have used other products in the morning and by the afternoon my skin showed signs of oiliness. When I use this product in the morning it works all day! Been using this for a couple weeks now. No reactions to sensitive skin either. It didn’t help my acne (didn’t expect it to) but nor did it hurt my acne… it might actually be helping my dark spot heal. A little goes a long ways too. You do not need to slather this on go get it to work. Highly recommend this product! a little goes a long way
