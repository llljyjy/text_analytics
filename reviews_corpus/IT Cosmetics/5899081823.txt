Great moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and no residue. For me it doesnt have a strong smell and I like it. It mosturise my skin and it stays whole night and in the morning when I wake up. My skin feels smoother and softer as I continue applying this unlike other products I used, it doesnt stay moisturize that long. I will recommend this to family and friends and will buy.
