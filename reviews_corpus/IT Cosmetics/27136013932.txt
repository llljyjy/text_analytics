I received this product to give my honest review on. It comes in nice, sturdy jar. There’s a light scent that’s not to over powering. A little goes a long ways. It’s thick and creamy but goes on light. I seen a difference in my skin and fine line’s within a weeks time. I can’t wait to see after a months time! A cream made for all skin types
