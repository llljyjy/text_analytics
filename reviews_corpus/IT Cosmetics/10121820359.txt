For me, moisturizing plays a key role in my skin care routine. So I went through many moisturizers to find the right one for my skin, and this time I was very pleased when I tried IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream. It suits my combination skin type, absorbs quickly, doesnâ€™t feel greasy or sticky. The strength that surpasses previous moisturizers I have used is its high moisturizing ability, moreover, it also helps to eliminate signs of aging, reduce wrinkles, smooth skin, and even skin tone, more pores are visibly reduced, skin becomes fuller and brighter. So I understood this moisturizer does exactly what its name suggests as Confidence in a Cream. I will continue to buy this product to use and even recommend to my friends to try it. I love this!
