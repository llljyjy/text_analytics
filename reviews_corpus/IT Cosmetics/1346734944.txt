I am so glad IT Cosmetics reformulated this moisturizer! The original formula smelled horrible and this has a very light scent, nearly unscented. This version seems a little thicker too, which is great for the upcoming cooler weather. A little goes a long way. If you have oily skin I wouldnâ€™t recommend this due to the texture, but fortunately this sinks in quickly. major upgrade from the original version
