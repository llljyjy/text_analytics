This may not be my favorite day cream, but it does have a lot to offer. The ingredients are definitely top notch, and I haven’t technically been able to use it long enough to notice any sort of a major difference in my skin. I would like to shout out that it has a SPF50, so imo that in and of itself takes one less step out of my morning routine. I’d say don’t expect miracles, but definitely try it.
