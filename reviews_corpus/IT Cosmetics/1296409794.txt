This product does a good job removing most of your facial make up. However it says it removes eye makeup, even waterproof. That was not my experience. Just regular mascara would not come off. I had to reapply this product a few times to my eye area to remove all of my mascara. There are other cleansing balms that do exactly the same thing. And oils that will melt it all off. Luckily I do a two step cleansing routine. I felt like this took off a lot of the make up but did not deep clean the skin. Good but not the best
