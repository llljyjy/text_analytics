I liked this moisturizer. It seems like a decent size for the price. I believe it would be a better option for winter. I really like my moisturizers to be formulated for very dry skin but for some reason this feels like it sits on top of my skin, and when I sweat it feels very weird. Other than that feeling it keeps my skin hydrated. No noted differences in skin texture or fine lines though. Good but not Great
