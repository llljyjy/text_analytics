The IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream is very hydrating, and feels very rich on your skin. It applies very well on cleansed skin and even works well with a serum, no piling at all. The scent is very light and perfect for those with sensitive skin and noses. I have given it a few weeks and my skin has responded very well. The hydration has not caused me to have any acne flare ups either. nan
