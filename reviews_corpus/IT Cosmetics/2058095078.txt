I’ve received It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream complimentary from the brand to try and I’m using it twice a day for a few weeks now. I started noticing visible improvement in my skin, as the lines around my forehead and between my brows looks smoother and my skin feels softer and hydrated. In fact, I do recommend this cream for anyone that have dry skin like mine, since it’s very rich and super hydrating. If you have normal/combination skin, it might be a great winter moisturizer. I’m loving it and I’ll definitely stock up! Best cream for thirsty skin!
