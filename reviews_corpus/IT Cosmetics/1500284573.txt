I received this it cosmetics confidence in a cream as a complimentary sample in exchange for my review. This was my first time using anything from this brand so I was very curious and didn’t know what to expect. When it arrived, I was happy with the size of the product. It is in a glass jar with a twist off cap. For a moisturizer, I definitely like to have an ample amount as I like to apply a good amount onto my face. With this cream however I learned pretty quickly less is more. The texture reminds me of a balm. It is thick and creamy, but dense. It does distribute nicely once you get it on your face. You just need to work it in a bit. The scent is pleasant, I can’t honestly put my finger on it but I would say somewhat floral and clean. I noticed my skin really did feel hydrated and my make up also went on nicer. It created a nice smooth base as it is a little thicker in texture. My face did not become oily at all even though I was worried it might! Plus, I really like this as it contains some of my favorite ingredients which hydrate and helps fix the texture of your skin, such as niacin anode and squalane. I’m very satisfied with this and would recommend. nan
