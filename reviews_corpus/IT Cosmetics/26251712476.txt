After using IT Confidence in a cream my face and skin felt and looked beautiful. My skin looked healthier my pores looked smaller and less noticeable. I’m fifty-one years old and I feel that this cream has made my skin look a little younger. Before using IT, I was using a drug store’s favorite brand of lotion. Olay which I still love but the IT Confidence in a jar is even more. I got this to try it was a very generous sample of IT cream and I will continue to use it and plan on buying future jars. I would recommend this to anyone it’s wonderful... Love " IT" Cream
