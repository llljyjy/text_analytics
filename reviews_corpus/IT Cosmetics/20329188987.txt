this rich, luxuriate cream left my skin moisturized and softer than it has been since my youth!  Confidence in a cream also helped the lines around my mouth lessen. it is very moisturizing, I have skin that gets dry in patches on my face and this cream cleared up that situation. With my skin smoother my makeup went on better. I have had people ask what I am using and I highly recommend Confidence in a Cream. Helps skin to look smoother and moisturized.
