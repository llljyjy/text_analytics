As a male I struggle with facial dryness. I have to say that Confidence in a Cream actually worked very well for my skin and my wife loves the product as well. I have tried several other products and never really found anything that worked very well. I was offered a chance to try this and jumped on it as Iâ€™ve been disappointed with other things I have bought so I figured why not. After a few weeks I am pleasantly surprised by the results. Definitely something I will continue to use. nan
