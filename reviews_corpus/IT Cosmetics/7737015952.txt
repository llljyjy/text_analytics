I actually love putting this on my face at night! It has a really nice lavender scent that is relaxing and calming. It is a little heavy, but it doesn’t make my skin feel gross or sticky. It also doesn’t get all over my pillow. When I wake up my face feels nice and hydrated. I have noticed that some of the lines in my forehead are not as pronounced as they were and I can’t wait to see the benefits of this cream after continued use! nan
