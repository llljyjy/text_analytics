One of the best moisturizers I’ve used in years. I have incredibly dry skin and have an extensive skin care routine. This cream plays nice with my other serums and doesn’t  pill when I put sunscreen over it. Within two weeks, my skin was noticeably more hydrated and supple which caused my fine lines to appear diminished. Super a luxurious experience and I will purchase again and again supercharged is right!
