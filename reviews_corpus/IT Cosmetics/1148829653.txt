I have combination skin and this is a great addition to my skincare routine! It’s got a thick consistency & once blended into the skin, feels VERY hydrating (and the hydration lasts all day long)! This cream also doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin! Using this my overall skin improved in terms of plumpness, less dry, and more even! One thing I didn’t like about this though is the fragrance ..other than that, I will continue to use it for its anti-aging benefits! Love the hydration!
