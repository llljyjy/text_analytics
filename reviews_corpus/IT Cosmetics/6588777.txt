I love this cream.  It goes on smooth and itâ€™s a pleasure to use, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated.  I am always looking for products that contain Hyaluronic Acid so this is a winner for me and I expect good long term anti aging results from it.  I will definitely continue to purchase it.  My skin looks and feels smooth and moisturized.  No irritation for me!  I only wish it came with an SPF option as well as a hygienic pump dispenser. nan
