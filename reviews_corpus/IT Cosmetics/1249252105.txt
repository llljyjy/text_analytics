I have been using IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream for at least three weeks  morning and at night. It looks and smells almost the same as the original. It is very moisturizering and has been great for my changing skin I have gone from normal/oily to normal/dry in the past 6 months.  My skin looks a little more plump from being moisturized but I have not noticed the same result that are shown as results from IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream. IMO I do not think I would purchase this again, I think there are better options. Now maybe I will feel differently after I finish what I have left, which is a lot. Skin care does take 3 months to truly show result and everyone’s skin is different. I didn’t have any reactions to the cream. nan
