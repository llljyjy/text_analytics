I’ve tried and used many moisturizers but this 1 is by far the best 1 I’ve used. There’s no scent. It’s soft. Dries fast. It doesn’t make my skin feel sticky or greasy. I’ve been using this moisturizer for over a week and I definitely see a difference on my chest and neck which were showing major signs of early stages of aging. Best moisturizer I've used
