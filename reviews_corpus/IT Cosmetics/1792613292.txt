I love this cream. It goes on like a dream, under makeup or over nighttime skincare routine. It is not too thick or too liquid. It is the perfect consistency. It has a light citrus smell that is not too overwhelming or strong. It feel like it keeps my face hydrated without being greasy. It soaks in but skin still feels bouncy. The only thing that would make it better would be a pump bottle instead of the jar. The jar is nice, but I feel like a pump would be easier. I would recommend this cream to anyone aged 20 to 100. Awesome Cream!!
