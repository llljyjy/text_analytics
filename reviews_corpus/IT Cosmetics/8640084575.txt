So I thought I’d try a new cream as I’m getting older.  I like the smell although I feel like it takes me back to my past a bit, although I can’t quite place the smell.  It’s pretty thick however, and I have oily skin (maybe at some point it will dry out!), so it seems like it takes forever to set.  It’s probably better for someone with less oily skin or someone who doesn’t live in Florida. Nice moisturizer, but heavy for summer
