Moisture that works. I’ve used this for a couple weeks now and I’ve been very happy with the moisturizer. I have combo skin so I was a little concerned it might make me break out but it didn’t. Compared to other high end moisturizer’s I like the feel and scent on my skin about the same. My fine lines and deep forehead wrinkles aren’t getting any worse and my skin is more soft. I’ve used it for 2 weeks and I’m not noticing my fine lines going away so that’s why only 4 out of 5 stars. I’ll continue using this cream as I feel it’s helping my face stay hydrated especially during these hot summer months. nan
