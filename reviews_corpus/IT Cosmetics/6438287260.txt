I’ve been using this cream on my face and neck for a couple weeks now. I still don’t have many wrinkles, but I do have creases on my neck that I am trying to soften and avoid getting worse. So far I am loving this cream, it is think and creamy, but not greasy. It does not have a strong or bad scent like some other creams. It leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day. I use a lot more than I probably should. and I’ve barely made a dent in the amount in the jar, so it will definitely last me a long time. Looking forward to seeing if more use helps soften the lines on my neck, and will post a new review in the future. Great moisturizer for dry mature skin
