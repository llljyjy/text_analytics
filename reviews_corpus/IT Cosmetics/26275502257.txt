I really like this product.  It does an excellent job moisturizing my skin. You don’t need much for it to do the trick. Its very thick but goes on very light and doesn’t leave you feeling “heavy“ or “bogged down“. It soaks in and dries very quickly.  It has a pleasant, fresh scent and has not irritated my skin in any way.  I would definitely recommend this to others. Very Moisturizing
