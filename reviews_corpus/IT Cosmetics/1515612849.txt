It feels very soft on the skin but it’s quite heavy and thick. I would only recommend using it at night before going to bed as it seems too heavy on the skin, probably better for dry skin. However, it goes on smoothly and blends in well and makes the skin feel very soft. Although I haven’t seen any visible improvements to my skin in a few uses, it does make it feel nice and moisturized. Scent is nice and not too strong though. Good night moisturizer
