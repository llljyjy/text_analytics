I really like this face cream! At first I wasn’t sure about it because it’s kind of thick and a little heavy feeling on the skin. It absorbs quickly though and sinks into the skin. This made my skin plump up and feel hydrated, it seemed to fill in the small lines. When I woke up, my skin still looked plumped and hydrated! It has a light fresh scent, kind of citrusy or maybe lemon grass, but not at all overpowering. I wish the cream was a bit lighter so I could use it for daytime. Perhaps in the dryer winter months it would work for daytime. It makes my skin look great! I definitely recommend this stuff! Great face cream, you need to try it!
