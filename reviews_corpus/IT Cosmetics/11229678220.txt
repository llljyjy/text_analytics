I have gone through about four jars of this in the past as it used to be my every day moisturizer several years ago. But when I got a free sample to try again I was quickly reminded why it’s so good. the great thing is now the new formula has even better ingredients and is more creamy, which is perfect for my dry skin. The scent is a little different than the old formula but it’s not too bad or too overpowering. I would say this is best if you have dry skin or if you just use it in the winter as it is very rich which I love. Great for everyday
