Has pretty thick consistency and mild scent which I don’t mind at all. It feels pretty heavy when you first apply it so it’s probably  best when you’re not going anywhere or not in a hurry because it feels like it takes a bit to get absorbed.Overall, I like it…it does the job of moisturizing your skin.If you have sensitive skin, it might sting a bit. Good Moisturizer!
