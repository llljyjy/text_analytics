The IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream is a very moisturizing product. Thanks to the squalane, my face feels hydrated and soft. My skin looks plumped when I use it. It has helped with some of my dark spots in combination with other products. It has a nice, light scent to it. I tried the original product years ago and it didn’t work with my skin so I’m glad they changed up the formula. It’s a pretty hefty price tag but I do like the product and would consider re-purchasing when it is finished. In addition, I think this is a product that my aunt would enjoy so I’d recommend it to her. Solid product
