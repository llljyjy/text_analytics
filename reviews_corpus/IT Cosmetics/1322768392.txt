I’ve never tried this brand before so I wasn’t sure what to do expect but I really like it! I’ve been experiencing really dry skin in my T-zone and nothing I had was working well to remedy it. This really has made a huge difference! I’ve been using it for a month and my dry skin is dramatically better. I use it at night and it feels great going on and absorbs quickly which is important to me. When I wake up in the morning my skin feels soft and moisturized. After washing my face in the morning I apply in again before applying my SPF tinted moisturizer. It keeps my skin moisturized all day without ever getting oily. Previously, my skin was getting so dry and flaky around my nose mid day and this moisturizer really has put a stop to that which I’m thrilled about. Definitely recommend! Serious moisturizer!
