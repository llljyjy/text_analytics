I have given this cream a very generous trial, and I have to admit--I love it!! I think this is a new and improved formula or something, however I have not tried the original as I was skeptical with how many YouTubers really seemed to enjoy this around the same time. That being said, I truly believe all of the claims that IT Cosmetics gives regarding this Confidence in a Cream Anti-Aging Moisturizer! After about a month of use, I can see and feel a noticeable difference in my skin. My skin texture seems smoother, my complexion seems brighter, and I can see a noticeable difference in my fine lines! It also gives great hydration and I can see myself reaching toward this in the winter months too! Iâ€™m very confident that I am going to repurchase this product. I truly love this face cream and highly recommend this to anyone! A new favorite!
