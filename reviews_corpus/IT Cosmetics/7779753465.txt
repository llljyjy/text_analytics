I received this product for review and after using it everyday for 2 weeks, I’ve noticed a difference on my face and neck. I have very dry skin and I had high hopes for this moisturizer and thankfully it met all of my expectations. A lot of my fine lines and wrinkles are diminishing and my face feels so smooth. This moisturizer doesn’t not leave my skin feeling greasy or oily but it absorbs beautifully. I also love that there is no fragrance or scent in this moisturizer. Great Product
