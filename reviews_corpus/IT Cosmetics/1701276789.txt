I am already always excited to try new moisturizers to compare and the IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream was fantastic! The thing is, I’m a nurse and most days I do not wear base or powder to cover any blemishes or to give my face a little life, which in turn makes me feel “pretty” or presentable. Well, after wearing this confidence in a cream, I have seen my skin improve as far as appearing clearer and brighter. I actually feel “confident” going makeup free (and I’m not being cheesy, it really has changed my attitude). In comparison to other moisturizers, this one has definitely shown me results in a shorter period of time and that fact that I have seen any results at all is an improvement! The confidence in a cream also goes on smooth and dries fairly quickly and doesn’t feel greasy or heavy on my skin. Another positive is that it smells great. I have not had any breakouts with this product either. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that asks. The bottle is a large full size and you do not need to much to apply to your face. I will definitely be repurchasing!! Smells amazing
