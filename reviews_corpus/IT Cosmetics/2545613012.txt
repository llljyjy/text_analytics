While I didn’t see any difference in my lines, this serum absorbs well and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. It’s very hydrating and I enjoyed using it. The dropper applicator is very nice and makes dispensing the product easy. My skin does feel smoother and more hydrated, but my fine lines are still there. I use this every night as part of my night time skin care routine. Great product!
