I am in love with the It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream!! This moisturizer feels thick and creamy,almost like butter!! I’m obsessed with using this line of products. It has a light scent,that dissipates after applying to skin. A little goes a long way!! It is lightweight and not greasy. Works well under makeup. I’ve been using this for 2 weeks now and I’ve noticed my skin appears rejuvenated. My crow’s feet and forehead lines are fading!! I love that it lasts all day. I apply in morning and at night with my daily regime. This product is developed with plastic surgeons and has clinical results. Dermatologist tested for safety. Non-comedogenic. Good for all skin types. Vegan. Paraben Free. 10 signs of aging solved..Tone, Texture, Radiance, Elasticity, Firmness, Plumpness, Fine lines, Pores, Wrinkles, Neck lines. I definitely recommend this product!! Thick and decadent
