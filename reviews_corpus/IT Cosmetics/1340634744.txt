I’m honestly really impressed by this. The cream is thick and super moisturizing. The best part about it is that no matter how much I use it absorbs into my skin almost instantly. My skin feel super hydrated and plump after using it. I found that I like to use this most at night. I wake up with amazing feeling skin in the mornings. I’m not a fan of using it during the day. I have combination skin & I felt like it made me feel (AND look) quite oily. But I absolutely love to use it at night. My sister has much dryer skin than I do and could probably wear it day & night. I’ve already recommended it to her! I also have quite sensitive skin, and I haven’t had any sensitivity issues with using this. Super absorbant!
