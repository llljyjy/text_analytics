I have been using Confidence in a cream for more than a week now and already noticing results. My fine lines are smoother and my skin is very well hydrated. The cream has very nice texture and little tint to it. It is lightly scented and just right. I love everything about this product except the packaging. I hate dipping my fingers or a spatula in the jar. It is not sanitary and I wonder why this packaging is still used. I bought my own airless pump from Amazon and filled it with the cream but it is a hassle to have to do that. Great anti-aging tool
