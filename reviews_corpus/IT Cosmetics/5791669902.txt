This IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream is a very nice facial cream. I have been applying it in the morning and in the evening before I go to bed. I has been keeping my face and neck nice and moisturized.I like that I only have to use a very small amount of the face cream because a little bit goes a long way.My skin is nice and hydrated, and it also feels nice and smooth. Keeps my face and neck nice and hydrated.
