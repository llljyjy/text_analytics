Iâ€™m a big fan of the original confidence in a cream so i was definitely excited to try this out. This moisturizer leaves my skin tingly and refreshed. If you found the original confidence in a cream too rich, you might like this one because this cream leaves me more matte and layers well with other face serums and makeup! Great for oily skin!
