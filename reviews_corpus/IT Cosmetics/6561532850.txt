The IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Anti-Aging Hydrating Moisturizer is really hydrating and makes my skin super soft. The consistency is a bit thicker than I thought which is why I use it as a nighttime cream. It has a slight scent I don’t mind. I haven’t noticed a crazy difference in my skin but I will keep using it, it has amazing ingredients. I really recommend it for someone who is looking for an a affordable nighttime cream. An amazing nighttime cream
