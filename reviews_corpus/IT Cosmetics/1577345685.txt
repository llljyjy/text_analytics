This cream actually has been great for my sensitive and acne prone skin! I have been using it now for about 4 weeks and have not had any issues with breakouts or any irritation, I can definitely tell a huge improvement on my skin tone, it is clearly more even and clear! My fine lines around my lines are less pronounced as well. My neck has been improving greatly as well! I will continue to use it and very impressed with it considering price x benefits! Great for my sensitive/acne prone skin!
