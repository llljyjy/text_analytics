I am a 40 year old with dry skin (live in a dry climate too, which makes it worse) and fine lines and wrinkles. I found this cream to be super thick and rich feeling on my skin, but it didnâ€™t feel heavy or oily.  It wore really well under makeup as well. It hydrated my skin quite well overall.  In using it just one week, I found my skin was plumper and more moisturized, and  I had fewer dry spots on my face.  The only two downfalls I found were 1) the jar format, which is an issue for other moisturizers as well, but I use a silicone brush to apply, and 2) the scent is pretty strong, but again, I find this an issue with other moisturizers that I like as well.
