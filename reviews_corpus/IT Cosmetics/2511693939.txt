The cream is white and of a thick density. It is smooth and slightly cool to the touch. It has a light fresh/herbal fragrance.•Results and Verdict• I am impressed with how comfortable this cream is to wear, especially considering the initial thickness of the product. It thins considerably as it is spread and warmed across the skin. The product dries down completely invisibly. My skin feels hydrated but not at all heavy or greasy. The product layers beautifully with my sunscreen and makeup products. My skin type is dry/resilient and really drinks in moisture. I felt my skin was happy and hydrated throughout the day and into the night. Additionally, my skin feels so soft and supple. I have not experienced any irritation or breakouts. I can confidently confirm that this moisturizer is amazing for my skin. nan
