After using this product for a couple of weeks now I can say I like the lightness and what I mean by that is it does not feel so heavy that you feel as if your pores cannot breathe. Having said that, if it is hot and humid outside (or forbid indoors) this product will feel slightly sticky (at least for myself) which is my only real complaint. It does make my skin slightly shiny versus matte as well but if you are one that prefers this then hey you’ll love that!This product has niacinamide and hyaluronic acid. Both my partner and I have been using this product daily as I made the mistake of allowing him to use it one morning and I’ll just say this, for someone like him to remember to use this every day that tells you he really enjoys the effect he is getting from this. This product has been good for someone like me that has combination skin that can also be prone to acne if a product is too heavy. It does make my skin look healthier for sure as it normally does look a bit dull. I would recommend this to family or friends which says a lot as I am picky when it comes to recommending any product that makes contact with the skin. Confidence in a Cream
