I usually wear the regular Confidence In A Cream and love them both - I like the lavender smell, though the lemon is my favourite! I typically use this in the evening because of the scent - I have combination skin and love that this cream doesnâ€™t make me shiny - over time I have noticed a more even skin tone and way fewer fine lines and wrinkles. So time will tell on the anti-aging armour. I love this cream!
