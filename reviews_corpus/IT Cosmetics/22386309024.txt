It’s so lovely. My face is so soft using it every night and still soft when I wake up. It’s so moisturizing so I only use it at night. My skins dry but not after using this for a week. I’m not sure if it would wear well under makeup since I haven’t tried. No scent at all, I do really love it. Love it
