I used this stuff on some stubborn mascara the other day and WOW. It truly ate through that make up like it was nothing! I just rubbed into my skin for a few minutes and then rubbed it off with a soft cloth. My makeup was GONE. This stuff works so much better than other things I’ve tried and is just as great as make up wipes (I know, they’re just so quick and easy too) I highly recommend it! nan
