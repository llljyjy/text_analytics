I liked to use this product as a day cream/moisturizer and not as a night treatment. It is a lightweight cream that moisturizes well and has a mild fragrance. But when it comes to anti-aging I did not see any changes in my fine lines in a month of use . Would recommend this product as a moisturizer. Good as moisturizer
