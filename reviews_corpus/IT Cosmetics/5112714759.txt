I really enjoyed using confidence in a cream. It’s hydrating, non irritating and feels reparative. I enjoyed the light scent as well- I usually experience breakouts when trying moisturizers with scents but not with confidence in a cream! I also enjoyed applying this on my neck/décolletage. I will definitely repurchase this when I finish it! Hydrating, reparative moisturizer
