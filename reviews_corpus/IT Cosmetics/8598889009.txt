Love the way the Bye Bye 3 in 1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm left my skin feeling so smooth and hydrated. It easily removed my makeup. It was just the cleanser I needed during harsh winter weather.  I havenâ€™t tried it as a mask, but using it to remove my makeup left my skin so soft and smooth almost immediately. So soft!
