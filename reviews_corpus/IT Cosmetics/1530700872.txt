This cream really works. I noticed a difference in a short time. I noticed a difference in the texture of my skin and fine lines and wrinkles. There is a light fragrance but it’s not too bad. If I had to choose I would prefer it be unscented. That’s my only complaint. I love how quickly it absorbs and doesn’t leave you feeling greasy. Best ever
