I can see why this is out of stock... This is a great product. The packaging feels substantial - like a fine glass jar as opposed to cheap plastic. When you open the embossed lid, the cream itself is glossy and vanilla colored. There is no overpowering perfume, more like the faintest scent of botanicals. It smells very natural.  This cream is the perfect consistency for evenly spreading on the skin and never feels oily. It soaks in quickly and beautifully, and my face feels soft and hydrated. Iâ€™m really enjoying the lux experience of using Confidence in a Cream. I feel like my skin is perfectly hydrated - which is saying a lot in the middle of a humid Michigan summer. Sometimes creams can feel like too much - too much thickness, too much stickiness, too much oil. Not this cream at all. Finally, I love it that this cream is vegan, which is important to me as an animal lover. I highly recommend! Excellent Choice for Nongreasy Moisture
