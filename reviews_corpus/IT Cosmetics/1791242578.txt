This product is okay, but I prefer my regular cleanser. The product does melt as intended, but I donâ€™t like how greasy it feels. It does wash off easily which I was pleasantly surprised about seeing how greasy I felt that it felt. For me the downfall is the form of the product. I do think it did remove makeup well, but as I mentioned I prefer another form of cleanser. Not my favorite, but not terrible
