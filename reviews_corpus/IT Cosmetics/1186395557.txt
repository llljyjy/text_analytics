Absolutely love confidence in a cream. Lightweight, almost slightly iridescent gel cream hybrid texture. No real scent that I noticed. Applies easily and absorbs well, making it as good for am as pm.The hydration is real though! I love the way my skin cells for hours after using. Plays well with sunscreen and most foundations I tried. I highly recommend! Excellent cream
