I struggleee finding a nice cream/moisturizer with anti aging benefits that don’t: smell off/leave me oily/pump bottles that stop pumping/to thick/not thick enough…these are usually my top problems. This cream is my favorite! No problem putting makeup over it/doesn’t clump up. The smell, it smells natural and refreshing. I am really in love with this stuff. I am most definitely someone who tries a lot of products as well, especially when it comes to everyday creams/moisturizer’s  with anti aging benefits. I really believe I have found the perfect match with this cream and my skin. I have combination skin/hormonal acne and my skin has not been triggered at all by this product and has looked/felt amazing. (I used this product for a month before giving it my honest review) This is IT
