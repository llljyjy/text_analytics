I am very happy and thank Bzzagent and IT Cosmetics for giving me such a good product for me to review.  This is a face cream that I am not familiar with. Compared with several face creams I used before, it is not inferior, and it is even more cost-effective. I think I will repurchase it in the future.  Its fragrance is not very strong, the texture of the cream is like a crame, it is moist but not heavy, it absorbs quickly without rubbing mud, and the face does not dry out in an air-conditioned room for a day. It is a very good product. Good product
