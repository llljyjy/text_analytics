This cream was nice and thick without being too greasy. I found it hydrated my normal/ dry skin and left my face feeling soft and smooth. Even though it’s summer right now where I live, I didn’t find it too heavy to wear during the day and it didn’t cause any breakouts. It’s a nice, gentle, everyday moisturizer- definitely recommend! nan
