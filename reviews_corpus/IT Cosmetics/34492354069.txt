I have been using this IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream for the last few weeks and my skin looks and feels absolutely amazing! I’ve been using it once a day, at night on a freshly cleaned face. My sensitive and acne-prone skin has had great results with this formula. My face and neck are SUPER soft with no dry patches at all. The wrinkle lines on my neck are less noticeable. The skin around my eyes is more plump and moisturized so my fine lines look smoothed out. I’ve been rubbing any extra product left on my palms onto the tops of my hands... and they look younger somehow! I’m really impressed and will continue using this cream with hopes of additional improvement. My skin feels amazing!
