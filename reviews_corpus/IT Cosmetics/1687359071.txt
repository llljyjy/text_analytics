This moisturizer is soothing, hydrating and leaves your skin with a subtle glow. The consistency is on the thick side, but still sank right in to my combination, leaning oily skin, and my makeup applied beautifully over this moisturizer.  The only reason Iâ€™m knocking off a star is because the fragrance is a little strong for my liking. nan
