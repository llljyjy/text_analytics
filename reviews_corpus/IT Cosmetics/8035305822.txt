I love this product as a night cream! Itâ€™s a thicker cream which I tend to prefer at night as I often use a gel moisturizer during the day, but this product is SO HYDRATING! My skin looks and feels so smooth in the morning! I feel like it also does an excellent job at keeping my redness at bay. As for the anti aging aspect of this product, I am not quite sure at how well it reduces the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines as I am only 23, but overall I love the way this products looks and feels on my skin! Would definitely recommend it! Great night cream!
