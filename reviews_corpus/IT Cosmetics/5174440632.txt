This is a great moisturizer. I love the benefits that this product features. The consistency is nice and creamy but not oily. Im using this at night only right now because my skin is a little more oily in the summer so I feel like it might be slightly heavy for summer but perfect for fall and winter. The only thing I don’t care for is the scent… it has an old lady type of fragrance but not a big deal. I received this for free to give my honest review. Good moisturizer
