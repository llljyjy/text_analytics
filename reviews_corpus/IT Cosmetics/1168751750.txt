I am often scared to try new makeup removers because they have stung my eyes in the past. However, I am pleased to report that this is the first one I’ve tried that doesn’t sting! I am also very happy at how easily it removes eye makeup as I have some stubborn eyeliner that can be difficult to remove. This balm removed all of my makeup without any rubbing or tugging! This is a thick balm that feels moisturizing, which is new for a makeup remover. This is definitely my new favorite way to remove makeup! Great Makeup Remover
