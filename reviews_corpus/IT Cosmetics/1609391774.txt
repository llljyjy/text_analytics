This is a great moisturizer for a range of skin types, including sensitive. Itâ€™s thick and hydrating so it might work better for people in winter or as a night cream, but it still absorbs into the skin nicely. I received this cream as part of a promotion but would definitely consider buying it when I finish my jar. Great nourishing cream
