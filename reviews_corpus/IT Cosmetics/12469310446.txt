The confidence in a cream moisturizer is meant to work over time, so Iâ€™ll come back for a final review. For now, first impressions are great! The packaging is sturdy, and a nice neutral color. The consistency of the cream is very smooth, light, and not sticky at all. I do feel a tingly sensation when first applied. I attribute that to the peptides and anti wrinkle ingredients. Cream does not leave a film or residue on skin. High hopes!
