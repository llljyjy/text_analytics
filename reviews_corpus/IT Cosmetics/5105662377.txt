As others mention this product has a strong floral/rose scent. I personally love scented skincare so this was a plus for me. I have used it for over a month and have not noticed any change in any dark spots but I have noticeably less blackheads.If you’re not sensitive to scents and like florals, this product is definitely worth trying at it’s price point. Great, especially for the price
