My combination oily and dry skin is pretty sensitive. I can only use certain creams; otherwise, I’ll break out with a rash. My skin is a big fan of this cream, so I plan on buying more. It is very moisturizing but not heavy. It contains tons of anti-aging and skin-nourishing ingredients (e.g., niacinamide, peptides, collagen, and hyaluronic acid). It also has lots of naturally beneficial ingredients like turmeric, licorice root, aloe, and shea. I tried this cream as part of a free sample initiative. I used about a pea size or less each night before going to bed. That surprisingly covered my entire face and neck. It’s so rich that a little bit goes such a long way. I have used cheaper creams from the drug store, but I usually go through those a lot more quickly. This is a very economical cream, and you will see noticeable results instantly. I definitely recommend trying it out! Magic in a jar!
