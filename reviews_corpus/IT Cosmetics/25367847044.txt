While it won’t replace my favorite cream, if I didn’t have a preferred product already, this would become my choice.   I liked that my complexion seemed more even from it, the thickness was a blessing without being sticky or overbearing.  It absorbed well into my skin and left my skin smooth and supple.  Really no complaints.  The only thing to keep in mind is if you use it daytime you’ll still need an spf afterward to protect your skin from sun. A great skincare!
