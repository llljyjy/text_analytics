I’m in love with this moisturizer. My skin is super dry and very dull. I have noticed a change in my skin while using this cream. I love the packaging, it looks aesthetically pleasing and feels very luxurious. The cream itself does not have a strong fragrance which is a plus for me. The cream is very thick so a little goes a long way. Even though the cream is thick it does melt into the skin very smoothly and doesn’t leave your skin oily or greasy. The cream gets absorbed very nicely and your skin will feel very hydrated and smooth. My skin is also getting firmer and I noticed less fine lines on my skin. This cream does everything it claims. I will keep  this in my skincare routine and will repurchase again and again!! Hydrated glowing skin
