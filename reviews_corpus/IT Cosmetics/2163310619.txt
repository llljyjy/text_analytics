I’m getting that that age where things like smooth and supple skin is very important. Twenty years ago I wouldn’t have paid attention to a product like this but now it has my full attention. It felt very hydrating. It didn’t irritate my skin however it does have a scent that reminds me of something else. I couldn’t quite figure it out. Nevertheless, it was certainly a nice surprise of a product. With continued use I could see this cream doing major things for me for years to come. Powerful jar
