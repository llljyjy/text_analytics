I really enjoyed this moisturizer. It is a nice thick moisturizer that is great as a night cream. I would consider it a bit too thick for day use, particularly in summer - but I have oily skin so I generally gravitate towards a light moisturizer during the day. However, it is amazing to make my skin moisturized and glowy when I wake up after using it the night before! nan
