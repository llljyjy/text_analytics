As much as I wanted to love this moisturizer, it ended up sensitizing my skin (redness and small bumps around the corners of my eyes). I even tried applying it without my usually toner and serum a 2nd time, and unfortunately had the exact same issue.I have dry/sensitive skin, and am very sensitive to smells. This cream has a very intense floral detergent-like smell that does not smell natural to me. Even when washed off, that fragrance lingers.One positive quality about this product though is that it is great at moisturizing bone-dry skin. Itâ€™s very rich/heavy, so I cannot see this being an optimal choice for oily and/or combination skin types. As an alternative, this does make for an excellent hand + cuticle cream particularly if you enjoy scented skincare products! Too Scented For My Liking
