This is a decent cleansing balm for light makeup. I found the scent pleasant, and my skin felt clean after use. However I had worn waterproof mascara and it did not remove much at all. If you are just wearing very light makeup, it will probably be great. Anything heavier though you are going to need additional products/cleaners. nan
