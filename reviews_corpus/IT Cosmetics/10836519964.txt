Since turning 40, I decided that I really needed to start taking better care of my skin if I hope to retain a more youthful appearance.  I have combination skin with the oily areas being concentrated on my forehead and nose - these areas are also prone to the occasional pimple and blackheads. After reading reviews, I hoped that Confidence in a Cream would provide all the benefits I currently need. I immediately noticed the soft creamy texture and subtle and pleasant citrus scent. It’s very light and fresh which I didn’t expect because I’m used to unscented moisturizers (although I prefer scented products). I applied a small amount to start off since I didn’t know how my skin would react. I applied to my face, neck and decollette to start. After about a week, while I did notice my skin was glowing, I also experienced small breakouts on my cheeks, jawline and forehead. The only thing I can attribute it too is this moisturizer unfortunately. I’m a believer in that you need to give products several weeks to see an outcome so I’ll keep using it and see if my skin improves. If not, then I guess I’ll be on the hunt for a new moisturizer. I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion. Just OK
