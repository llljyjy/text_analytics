I already have oily skin but this moisturizer makes my face extremely oily & causes breakouts fast. I’m super disappointed in this product & I don’t recommend. I recently turned to Bliss brand products & love their skincare line, their moisturizer is great & doesn’t cost as much. I also have not had any breakouts since using & it controls the oiliness Don't waste your money
