I rounded the review up but it really is a 4.2 for me. A little goes a long way. I tried this during the heat wave of NYC and it didn’t run in my eyes or burn me so I had to give it props! The face was definitely feeling smooth, soft, supple, and beautiful. ( I wish I could have found a synonym so I could keep the s words going ). I did have an issue when I used this product under makeup, under my eye. It was a mess. A whole stinkin mess. The way my under eyes creased?!? Never seen that in my life. It didn’t not play well with those products. But overall did what it claimed it was. nan
