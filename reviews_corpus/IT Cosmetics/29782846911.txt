I was so excited to finally have the opportunity to try the cream that everyone raves about.  It has a very rich creamy texture that has an extremely light citrus scent.  It absorbs fairly quickly and the residual tackiness fades within minutes.  While I prefer a lighter moisturizer during the hot summer months, I love using this product at night.  My skin feels so soft, smooth and hydrated when waking up.  I did end up using it twice daily for a month to see the results, and they were impressive.  I noticed fewer lines and wrinkles, as well as plumper, firmer, brighter looking skin.  Iâ€™ll probably go back to using this nightly until the cooler fall weather arrives.  This moisturizer is a must for those of us with dry, mature skin! A Must For Mature, Dry Skin!
