I got this as a sample from a Sephora Favourites box. I threw it on one night not expecting much more than a layer of moisture. However, the next day I was in for a surprise. It was just a regular morning for me which consists of dragging myself into my bathroom and getting ready for the day in my usual lackluster fashion. But the image that greeted me in the mirror was different that morning. All dullness had been removed from my face, leaving a brightened, hydrated, nourished visage in its place. This is now my 2nd Holy Grail. Get some any way you can…. Bare Skin Goals….
