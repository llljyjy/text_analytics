Obsessed with this serum, on my third full sized bottle now.The product glides on with out feeling greasy, feels so nice and moisturizing and is packed full of Niacinamide which is amazing for inflammation, redness and controlling sebum production (which is great because I have acne prone dry skin). When I first bought this I had a damaged skin barrier from a cerave cleanser that destroyed my skin. This bare minerals serum and their Butter Drench ceramide moisturizer completely repaired my damaged moisturizer barrier. My pores are also smaller, my skin appears more plump and I have this really healthy glow from using this serum!!! Itâ€™s also amazing to use as a base for makeup. Also worth noting is my skin is beyond sensitive and it loves loves this stuff. The eye cream from this line is also out of this world btw. favourite serum ever
