I have been using these peels on and off for over a decade now. When I am using them regularly my skin is amazing and I truly have no complaints. Sometimes I canâ€™t afford to replace them when I run out and then I forget about them for a while but I keep coming back and I think I always will. If you're on the fence just DO IT!
