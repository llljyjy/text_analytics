This vitamin c serum is incredibly potent and you really only need about a dime sized amount. The serum is lightweight but contains a light oil. The formula absorbs into the skin really well, leaving a light veil of oil on the skin but it doesn’t feel greasy or heavy. This vitamin c serum really is a great blend of vitamin c and an anti-aging serum! It really brightens the skin and gives it a glow but it also plumps, smooths, and softens the skin. I feel my skin is renewed and rejuvenated! It gives my skin and instant glow but it also gives you more of a glow I’ve time and with prolonged use. This serum is very impressive and I really love it! I have tried many vitamin c serums but non quite like this one. I highly recommend this formula and I will be repurchasing it! Brightening and Anti-aging
