Dr Dennis Retinol serum has changed my aging 45 y/o skin (with nightly use) in less than a month - sun spots have reduced, pores are smaller, and fine lines and wrinkles have reduced. My makeup applies smooth since using this nightly, and I also feel more confident with bare skin. Along with the Lancer Lime Peel, these are my top two favorite beauty products, ever.
