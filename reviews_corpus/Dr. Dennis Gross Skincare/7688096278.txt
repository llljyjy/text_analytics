I love my DDG skincare and was happy to get my hands on this vitamin C. I love that this is 15% L-ascorbic acid plus lactic acid as it’s powerful enough to brighten my face and lighten any dark spots. It also has helped with firmness and elasticity in just the three weeks I’ve been using it. Being it’s oil free it plays well with my other skincare products. It has what I think is a mild hot dog smell that dissipates quickly. I can’t wait to see my results in 12 weeks! my new favorite vitamin c
