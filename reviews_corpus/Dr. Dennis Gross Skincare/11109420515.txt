The DDG Dewy Deep Cream may work for a night time routine only. I find the cream to be a bit too oily and it leaves my skin feeling tacky even hours after applying it. I also do not care for the smell at all. It is a bit fishy to me, though thankfully I can’t smell it after applying it and putting the jar away. I’ve tried vitamin c products worse than this, but I’ve also found some that work better for me so I would put this one somewhere in the middle. not for me, but not the worst either
