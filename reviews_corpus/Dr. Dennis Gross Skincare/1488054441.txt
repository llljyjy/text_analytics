This fragrance-free serum has unique watery, yet somewhat oily consistency. The non greasy formula sinks into the skin, giving it an instantly plumper and dewy appearance. It feels nourishing, and layers well under my moisturizer. I still need to finish up this bottle to see how well it tackles my hyperpigmentation, but for now, I can vouch that this leaves me with an overall brighter complexion. Gentle daily brightening serum!
