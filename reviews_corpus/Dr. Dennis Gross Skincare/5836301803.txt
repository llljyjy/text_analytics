The Alpha Beta line is my favorite from the brand, and the most popular as well as far as I know. There’s good reason for that. This particular moisturizer is very hydrating (ceramides + squalane) for everyday use, while also providing some exfoliating properties (AHA + BHA). It’s gentle enough to be used every day,  day or night (although I prefer to use it at night). If you do wear it during the day, please follow up with sunscreen. Great everyday exfoliation
