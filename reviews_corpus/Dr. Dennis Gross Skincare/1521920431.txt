I’m a big fan of Dr Dennis Gross products and so was excited to try this new Alpha Beta Daily moisturizer. The cream itself is lightweight, and absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling oily or leaving a sticky residue. Even thought it’s lightweight in texture it does leave the skin nicely hydrated and supple. I have been using it for over a week straight now and i highly recommend this product. nan
