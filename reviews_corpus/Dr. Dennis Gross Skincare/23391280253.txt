I absolutely loveeee this cleanser. I swearrrrrrrr by itttttt. I am an esthetician so i have tried so many brands so many different products. I went into sephora not planning on buying skincare but i always end up in that section. A employee actually told me her favorite skincare brands and when i picked this up and read the ingredients i was like “yeah this mustttt be good” ITS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. i have not had breakout in months. It makes me face feel so clean but not stripping. A big bottle lasts me months and a little goes a long way. I cannot stress how good this cleanser is i have bought this 5 times and I can not see myself using any other cleanser. You definitely should try it!!!! YOUR FACE NEEDS THIS…YOU NEED THIS!!
