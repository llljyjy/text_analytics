Three forms of Vitamin C, Lactic Acid, Tranexamic Acid, Ceramides, and Centella Asiatica…I can’t think of a better ingredient list !! This powerful little bottle of antioxidants packs a punch! It has everything needed to fight hyperpigmentation, fine lines, and wrinkles… while simultaneously replenishing the skins moisture barrier.  The texture is extremely lightweight and silky. It absorbs like a dream. One pump is enough for both eyes. I haven’t experienced any irritation or sensitivities with this product. I am already seeing a brighter, less puffy undereye area in a short amount of time. No more “tired mom” eyes. I am excited to see long term use results with this product. I haven’t been this excited about an eye treatment in a very long time!! Dr. Dennis Gross has really impressed me with this one! Incredible ingredients
