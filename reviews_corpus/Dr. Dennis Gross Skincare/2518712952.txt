This powerful vitamin c serum packs a punch! I have noticed that my overall complexion looks brighter and more Glowy. With consistent use I hope it continues to lighten some of my sun spots as well as help with the dark circles under my eyes. The formula is not sticky and absorbs beautifully into the skin. It does have a potent scent but it doesnâ€™t bother me at all. Overall this has been a lovely serum! Hello brightening!
