I was so pumped to use this product since my pores feel like they’ve gotten larger over the last year. I’ve used this twice a day almost every day for close to two months now and have seen 0 improvement. The texture of the product is silky, goes on nicely, dries quickly and I find it to be odorless. Would be great if it worked. I don’t plan to give it another try. Was Excited… Super Disappointed
