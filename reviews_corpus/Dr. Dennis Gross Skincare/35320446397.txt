ITS A GOOD MOISTURIZER BUT After trying this product for a significant period of time I can confidently say that I will not be purchasing this one. not because of the performance but of the pricepoint. The product is very good donâ€™t get me wrong. but it did not do anything amazing to my skin. I would recommend this if you have extra money to spend! BTW THIS WAS GIFTED nan
