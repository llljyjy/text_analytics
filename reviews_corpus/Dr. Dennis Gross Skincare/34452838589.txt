Vitamin C has become a very important part in my skin care routine now that I’m 30 I use a vitamin C after cleansing my face every morning followed by sunscreen I have been trying a few different brands and so far I am really impressed with Dr. Dennis gross vitamin C cream I actually like that it’s a cream and not a runny liquid it feels very nice and moisturizing but not too heavy on my skin will keep using love it so far nan
