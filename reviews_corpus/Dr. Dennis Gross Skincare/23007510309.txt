This serum leaves my skin feeling so smooth, soft, and supple! I love using it at night to wake up with a glow. I also prefer using it at night because It is a bit heavier (almost like an oil) upon initial application, but my skin drinks it right up, so it doesn’t leave a layer on my face. The smell caught me off guard initially, because it is rather strong, but I have gotten used to it. And it’s worth it for the results that I am seeing! This is one is a keeper! Noticeable results!
