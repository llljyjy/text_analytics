I’m in love with the way my skin looks and feels after using. This is perfect for my dry skin. It gives my face a dewy look that I love. It’s on the thicker but melts into the skin instantly. It also has a light floral scent. I haven’t used it long enough to say if there will be any long term benefits from the vitamin C but I’m excited to keep using. Wow
