The best thing I have ever come across. Been using it for the past 5 plus years. I love it can’t be without it! Amazing if you have acne prone skin that is oily. I use it once a week every week and it’s kept my skin looking and feeling amazing. My take away advice would be to start slow and increase usage with time until you find the right amount of usage that will work best for you. Saved my skin from breakouts my holy grail product!
