I absolute LOVE this product.  Dr. Dennis Gross kills it with their antioxidants and their interesting formulations.  I love the serum consistency- it is easy to apply and sinks in super quickly.As for the comments about the “bad smell“ that I keep reading. Seriously I’m rolling my eyes. No offense but you have to be a hardcore skincare newb to be bothered by a fragrance free product.  This product doesn’t even smell bad.  It has a slight ferulic acid smell (the “hotdog“ smell that people describe) and kind of gingery.  It is NOT BAD AT ALL I promise.I accidentally got the wrong product before I got this one.  I accidentally got the Overnight Wrinkle Treatment by DDG and it has similar ingredients to this one but also contains fragrance ingredients like bergamot and lavender- I love that product as well but I always prefer fragrance free products.I absolutely love the antioxidants in this product (retinol, rambutan leaf, Bakuchiol, ubiquinone, soy isoflavones, quercetin, morus alba, and ferulic acid). Expensive but worth it- and I rarely say that
