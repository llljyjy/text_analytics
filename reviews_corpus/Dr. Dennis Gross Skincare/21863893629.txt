I have really enjoyed this eye serum. It actually is brightening and firming. It’s gentle enough to use twice a day, good for sensitive skin, and not over drying at all. I have mature dry skin so this has been a wonderful product for me. It’s also a great preventative/maintenance product against signs of aging. Wonderful eye product
