When I saw the word “Lactic“ in the name, I knew I absolutely needed to try this... And I am so glad I did. Vitamin C and I have a love hate relationship- so going in I was a bit worried. I enjoy using this serum and have found zero irritation of my sensitive skin. The texture is light and thin. It absorbs into the skin perfectly and leaves no stickiness behind. Over my use this far, I am seeing a more natural glow to my skin. I absolutely love this serum!!! Grab it?l!!
