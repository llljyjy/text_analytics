I don’t understand why I can’t post this on the question section but Ive been using the matching moisturizer to this eye cream for about week and it’s ok but I need eye help. And Of 6 reviewers that actually paid for this product 3 hated it. Every one of the 50 people who got it free LOVED it-I don’t know what to believe anymore? Thoughts? QUESTIONS
