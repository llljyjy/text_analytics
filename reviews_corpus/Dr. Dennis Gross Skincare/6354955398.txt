At the time when I started using Dr Dennis Gross Dewy Deep Cream, my skin was in a bad state - solid comedones, pigment spots in the middle of my cheeks.After a little more than a 7 days my skin has changed significantly. This cream is non-greasy, non sticky with a beautiful light smell.  Absorbes instantly.  Doesnâ€™t make skin oily at all.  I have aging skin and I live in a hot climate, the cream came up perfectly. This cream is amazing for aging skin
