I’ve been using this on and off for a couple of years now and I cannot say I love it, but don’t not like it either (since there have been gaps in between uses) I did notice it brightened and reduced the appearance of my blotchy looking skin, but one has to be consistent with this. The moment you stop using it, your skin goes back to square one- guess that’s how it is with most products. It is quite an investment too, not something that’s easily affordable for many nan
