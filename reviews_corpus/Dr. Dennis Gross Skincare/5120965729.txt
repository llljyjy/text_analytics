This is a lovely lightweight moisturizer that absorbs beautifully on my oily but dehydrated skin type.   It has a slight medicinal scent to it, but that is due to the vitamin C & lactic acid.  The trifecta of antioxidant, collagen boosting & skin brightening vitamin C, exfoliating & hydrating lactic acid & antioxidant skin brightening, pore care niacinamide is  genius!  This addresses all of my concerns: hyperpigmentation, enlarged pores & dull skin.  I find that this doesnâ€™t break me out, plays well with makeup (no pilling) and it has helped so far with pore care & giving my skin a nice glow!  Looking forward to longer term results Addresses the common skincare concerns!
