I  have been enjoying this Dewy Deep cream. It is a thicker consistency yet goes on lightly and melts into the skin. There is a very faint citrusy scent. I like that it plays well with other skin care and does not pill.  Vitamin C and lactic acid are two of my favorite ingredients so I love knowing that Iâ€™m getting a dose of them in this moisturizer. My dry skin really loves it. Nourishing and Hydrating
