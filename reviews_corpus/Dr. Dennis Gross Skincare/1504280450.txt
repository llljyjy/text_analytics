I received a sample of this and while it may provide good results, the other reviewers talking about the smell are correct. I’ve never had a product smell so bad unless it had actually gone bad. It’s very strong and no, it doesn’t go away within minutes. It smells like you slathered a camp fire on your face. This sample is going in the trash. Like slathering a camp fire on your face
