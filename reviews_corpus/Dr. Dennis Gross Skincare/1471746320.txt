What makes this serum so great is that it gives you the benefits of retinol without being irritating at all. Since using the texture renewal serum every other night in my skincare routine for about 2 months now I have defiantly seen a big difference in the smoothness and brightness of my skin (and I have a lot of skin issues). This serum has helped take away a lot of little bumps and rough texture and also has fade dark spots & discolouration a fair bit. Two things to be mindful of is this does have a strange somewhat strong smell when first applying, however this scent fades quickly for me and is not bothersome afterwards. Also it does dry down a little sticky/tacky but I find putting a moisturizer on top with take care of that. Highly recommend! Delivers Results!
