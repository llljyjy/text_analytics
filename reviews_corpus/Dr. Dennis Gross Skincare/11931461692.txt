I love how easy it is to apply as it is super light and the absorption was delightful on the lower lid area. I love the feeling of freshness it brings and how it lights up the area. The applicator is great because you donâ€™t touch the product you just take the amount you need and the packaging is beautiful. I definitely recommend this eye cream especially if you suffer from dryness, feel the area irritated, see darkness. Very good product Must to have to under eye care concerns
