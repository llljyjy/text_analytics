I’ve been thoroughly enjoying this new moisturizer from Dr. Dennis Gross! It’s a vitamin C and lactic acid cream so it’s formulated to give you brighter and more even skin. The jar is very generous and I love the texture of it - it’s a thick watery cream that goes on nicely. It spreads really easily and feels extremely hydrating all day long! There’s a light scent to it that’s enjoyable as well. I’m looking forward to seeing results but it’s too early to tell right now if it’ll live up to the promises of brighter skin. nan
