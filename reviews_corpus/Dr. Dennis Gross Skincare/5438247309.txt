I’ve been using these peel pads for the past few weeks and ever since I have not had one breakout and my skin gets smoother after every use. I haven’t worked up to using it nightly but I do use them every other night and still have seen amazing results . I do have sensitive/ acne prone skin and a lot of products that work for others usually does not work for me. This product is worth the spend and will always be a staple in my skincare. skincare Must!
