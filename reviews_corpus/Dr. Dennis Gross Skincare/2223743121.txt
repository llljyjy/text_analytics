If you have dry skin THIS IS A GOOD ONE!! I absolutely love the ingredients- Vitamin C and Lactic Acid works so well for my skin so Iâ€™m very excited that I can found these two ingredients in one moisturizer. The consistency is creamy but not heavy and it just sinks into my skin. It leaves my skin dewy, hydrated. It works great when I layer it with sunscreen or foundation, I did not experience any pilling. Truly great moisturizer. Incredibly wonderful
