I honestly love all Dennis Gross products and this is no exception. It goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely – a little bit goes a long way. As with all good vitamin C products there is a smell but it fades quickly. I’m not quite sure I would use this on its own as a moisturizer, though. Maybe if my skin was oilier. But I prefer to use a separate moisturizer as well as this product. Thumbs up
