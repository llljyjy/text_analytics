This serum with vitamin c is really amazing i love it so much. I use it at night on my clean face and leave it overnight i love that my skin looks radiant and hydrated. It is perfect for my dry skin because it is very moisturizing. Itâ€™s lightweight texture but my skin feel little sticky but in few minutes sticky feeling goes away. Overall I am loving the results because my skin looks brighter and youthful. I will continue to use and will buy after i finish this bottle. I love the packaging and dropper makes it easy to use. I will definitely recommend to others. Leaves my skin radiant
