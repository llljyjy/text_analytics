I received a giftcard to select a product of my choice to review, and this product caught my eye the most!  I’ve been using this serum for over 4 weeks and have noticed positive changes with regard to the texture of my skin.  The smell is a little unique/earthy but it didn’t bother me too much.  The gel blends in seamlessly on top of my moisturizer that I use every night.  I used this product every other night and have noticed that previous acne blemishes seem to resolve quicker, leaving my overall texture more even.  I really like the product and have added it to my regular regimen. Great Product!
