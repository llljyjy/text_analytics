I really wanted to love this. My skin responds pretty well to products, and I’m familiar with what it likes/needs. The only thing this helped with was not being as oily. Barely. I’m so sad. I really thought after a month this would help give me a natural glow like other brands and less expensive products. Maybe I need to use it longer, but as I mentioned I’ve used far less expensive brands for better results not what I expected
