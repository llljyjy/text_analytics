As a longtime fan of Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare, I’ve been looking forward to trying the new Vitamin C Lactic Firm & Bright Eye Treatment. With a blend of Three Forms of Vitamin C, Lactic Acid, and Tranexamic Acid this eye treatment is PACKED with incredible ingredients. After 2 weeks of use I’ve noticed my under eye area is brighter, smoother and just has an overall more youthful appearance.  I do have sensitive eyes and haven’t noticed any issues with this eye cream. Great for dull, maturing skin types! Glow Up Time
