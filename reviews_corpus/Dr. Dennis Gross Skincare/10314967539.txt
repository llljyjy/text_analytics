I wanted to love this product but it was not for me (I have sensitive skin). I have been using TLC FRAMBOOS AHA/BHA (drunk elephant) so I thought I was going to tolerate this one but my face was BURNING, super red I had to wash my face to take the product of, Iâ€™m going to stick to Drunk elephant one. NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN
