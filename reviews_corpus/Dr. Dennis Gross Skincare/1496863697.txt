If I could give more than 5 stars I would! Changed my sensitive, acne scarred and textured skin! Pictured is after one bottle of this serum (makeup/filter free besides lash extensions). My favorite thing about this serum is that it tackles existing breakouts while helping to heal scarring without drying out my skin. Was hesitant to try at first because of the price, but seriously it has been game changer for my skin and SO worth it in my opinion! nan
