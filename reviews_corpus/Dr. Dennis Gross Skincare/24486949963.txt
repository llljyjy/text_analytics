Where has this been my whole life?! I have never tried an eye treatment of any kind that worked as well as this does. The puffiness and dark circles around my eyes are so much better already, I can’t wait to see how much change there is after the whole bottle. Plus a little goes a long way so this product will last for quite a while. I apply 1 small pump onto my hand and lightly tap it into my skin with my pinky finger and it absorbs beautifully and brightens up my skin so much! The fine lines around my eyes also look filled in and smooth for most of the day! It’s great under makeup to help keep product from settling in the lines around my eyes. I will be keeping this in my routine forever - my sensitive skin loves it! Actually Works!
