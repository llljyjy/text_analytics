Just in time for summer! I’ve been looking for a good vitamin C eye cream and this delivered!I’ve been struggling with sleep with the warmer weather plus extra sun exposure so the area around my eyes have looked dull and dry. Just reading the ingredients list alone, I knew this was going to be a winner. It contains vitamin C, lactic acid, tranexamic acid, and ceramides! In just a few days, I look refreshed and the areas look visibly brighter. Its lightweight and absorbs quickly and I use it both in the morning and night. I love waking up looking more refreshed and this wears well under makeup and its very hydrating. Brightening & hydrating!
