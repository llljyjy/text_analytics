I use this serum during my AM routine daily and I’ve seen changes in the 3 weeks I’ve used it so far. My skin is definitely looking brighter and dark spots from a previous breakout have faded slightly. I’m impressed with the improvement in texture which is due to the addition of lactic acid in the formula. And you know DDG does acids well! One thing to note though is that there’s a tacky feeling after application. I don’t mind it too much since moisturizer will fix that anyway. Overall a great vitamin c serum to add to your routine. nan
