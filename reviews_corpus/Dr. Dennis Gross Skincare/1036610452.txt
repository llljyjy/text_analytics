Great product - non-irritating for area around my eyes; other retinol eye creams have left my eye area dry, peeling and irritated. I had used this awhile ago and then tried some others but happy to be using it again so far about 5 weeks. Skin around my eyes feels smooth, soft, and fine lines/puffiness are not as apparent. I use it only at night, sometimes with a tiny amount of Bobbi Brown Intense Eye Repair Cream for extra moisture. It is quickly absorbed and not sticky. The only thing I don’t like about the “new“ version of this is the packaging - same amount of product in a bulkier plastic pump bottle that is not going into my handbag or 3-1-1 carry on. See photo, slim former packaging on the left - bring back the old bottle!!! Silky retinol treatment for the eye area
