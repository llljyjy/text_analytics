This is a really nice light moisturizer. I thought it would be a gel cream but it’s a more traditional lotion texture. It’s quite light but also moisturizing and hydrating and layers well over and under lofs of other skincare products.  I do usually like a little more oomph to my moisturizer but this is quite nice for under heavier SPF. nan
