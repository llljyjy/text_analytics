This serum is ideal for individuals with uneven texture, dullness, stiffness loss, and dark spots. It’s a lightweight product that’s easy to apply even in the heat. I have acne-prone skin, so I’m particular about what I put on it has to feel light and not cause any irritation, and it should not block pores other than all of the benefits it claims. While I haven’t seen any firming effects yet because it takes longer for these effects to appear, my complexion does seem brighter after applying it! nan
