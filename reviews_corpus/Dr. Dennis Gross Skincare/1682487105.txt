I had tried product after product to get rid of my cystic acne. I tried Tretinoin, but the purge was so bad and lasted so long that I gave up. After MANY different products, I tried these. I purged for about two weeks (before pictures), but after that, it started clearing my skin and making acne scars more subtle. I’m not sure if it will entirely get rid of the scars, but I’m going to buy my second large box. Absolute miracle product!! Before and after shown in pictures. No more cystic acne!
