is it too early to say i’m absolutely obsessed with this moisturizer, i was skeptical about using it however the texture is very light which makes me love it even more because is hydrating and i feel like i didn’t attacked my face with many products, and i like that it doesn’t leave my skin greasy, it absorbs fast and leaves my skin looking smooth holy grail alert
