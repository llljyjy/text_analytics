I have tried many products from this amazing brand and it never dissapointed me.  I consider Dennis Gross one of the most effective and reliable brands out there. This eye treatment  is not an exception. This is a great quality product that is very effective.  This product is very potent.  You really only need about dime sized. Little bit goes a long way. It’s a lightweight serum. Absorbs very fast.  After application my undereye  is brightened and plumped. I have way less wrinkles now! It feels very soft and I am really happy with how it feels on my face. My dark circles are gone within minutes. I look well rested, eventhough I am usually always tired.  I am usually not a big fan of vitamin C products but I am obsessed with this one. I will definitely repurchase. It should be noted that my skin is very sensitive and I experienced no irriation what so ever. Eventhough this product is potent, it doesn’t cause any irritation or any kind of discomfort. Can’t wait to see the results after couple months of use.  So far, I am in love with this product. nan
