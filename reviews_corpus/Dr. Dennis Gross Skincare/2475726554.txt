I’m really enjoying this eye cream! The consistency is really nice, not too thick or heavy but still very hydrating & it absorbs into the skin quickly.  It does a great job of brightening my under eye area but I haven’t notice much change to my fine lines yet. I’m really hoping I see those results after using it a bit longer. All in all it’s a great eye cream! nan
