Great cleanser. Used 2 pumps every night, lathered with a net it lasted me about 4.5 months. I donâ€™t have sensitive skin, but I could feel the gentle effectiveness of the product. Unfortunately, I will not be repeating it, as I have a preference to a solid cleansing bar, but I would recommend it to anyone who is curious. Gentle effective cleanser
