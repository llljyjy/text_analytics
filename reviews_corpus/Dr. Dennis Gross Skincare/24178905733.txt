This is fantastic for oily skin because it’s so light and disappears quickly after applying. If you give this 2 full weeks of consistent use it does help brighten skin. And I did also notice a balancing effect as well. My skin feels and looks hydrated but doesn’t feel smothered. I had some issues with the pump but other than that I’m actually crazy about this stuff. I think the lactic acidosis is also helping smooth out my bumpy chin too. Twice daily use = brighter skin
