This serum has become an immediate staple in my skin care routine. I started using this serum every other day about two weeks ago. So far I have noticed an improvement in not only the texture of my skin, but also the feel. From the first use my skin began to appear brighter and more radiant. I don’t wake up with the dull and dry face anymore that I used to. The fine lines around my lips are appearing to minimize and my forehead looks firmer as well. I’m hoping that with even more continued use that my dark spots will noticeably fade as well. Just a word to the wise, if you are new to using acidic serums you might want to start out using this once a day twice a week, don’t over do it if your skin is sensitive. Skincare Staple
