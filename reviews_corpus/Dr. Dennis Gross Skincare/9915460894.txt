I am obsessed with the Dr. Dennis Gross  Vitamin C Lactic Dewy Deep Cream I love that this contains vitamin C and lactic acid it’s so hydrating and has helped my dry dull skin so much! I’ve only been using this a short time but have already seen improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles being soften and less noticeable with visibly firmer skin. So hydrating to my dull dry skin
