I started using Dr Dennis’ serum and moisturizer a few months ago. It’s the first skin care line I can honestly say I love and absolutely see and feel results. I had these daily peels in my drawer for a while and I was afraid to try them. I have fairly sensitive skin, so I’m always reluctant. I used one last night though.  My face immediately looked a little brighter. Felt a little smother. But this morning I looked at myself and took a double take!  My skin hasn’t glowed this much since I was in my 20’s!  I absolutely love this product line and will always keep these daily peel pass in stock. Amazing!
