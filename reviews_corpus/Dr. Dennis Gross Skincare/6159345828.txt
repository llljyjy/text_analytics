Is it possible?   My 56 yrs old eyes are so much brighter and my lines have smoothed a bit. Granted I was using the Olay retinol eye cream for a while but Iâ€™ve really noticed a difference with this eye serum after 2 weeks. I never had dark circles but with age you will develop some discolouration , which in my case has virtually disappeared. Maybe 4 stars is premature but I am very impressed. I will report back . Impressive
