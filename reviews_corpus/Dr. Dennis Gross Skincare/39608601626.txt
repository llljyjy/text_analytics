My issue is cystic acne and adult acne. Those that struggle with it know how painful and itchy it can be. I began to use it in July and seen dramatic change in 3 days. My acne began to go away and dark spots. Once I ran out of the wipes, my adult acne came back. This product is a yes!  I’ve been to the dermatologist, antibiotics didn’t work, bought acne face wash and it didn’t work, I would put face creams/ sunblock and automatically break out, but this works! Adult/Cystic acne and dark spots are minimal.
