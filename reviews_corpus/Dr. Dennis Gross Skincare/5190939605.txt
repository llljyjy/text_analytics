Been using for about a month and skin feels smoother. I haven’t noticed a huge difference in wrinkles but really helped with texture. Not drying at all. Only issue is it smells awful. Even after putting a face lotion on top, my boyfriend commented on the ‘not so good’ smell on my face. Wish they could do something about that and would be 6 stars! nan
