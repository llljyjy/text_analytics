This is my favorite AM cleanser. I have normal skin and only have issues with it being too drying if I use it as a second cleanse at night (it doesn’t remove makeup especially well on its own... that’s not what it’s designed to do). Value for money: DDG puts this in gift sets so it’s not too hard to find a freebie to try, but I’ve happily paid full price for the 7.5oz because it’s a great maintenance acid treatment: I accidentally discovered that it makes a great flash mask. Sometimes I let it rest on my face for a few minutes while brushing teeth or getting ready, and for me it’s near the same results as the “gentle“ AB peels.Lasts for ages because you only need half a pump each time. It’s very viscous/thick, which takes some getting used to... if you are finding it hard to spread evenly, try lathering it in your hands a bit more before applying. I use it with an ultrasonic device about half the time, but it’s fine on its own too. Great daily wash and 5-minute mask
