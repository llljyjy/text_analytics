There’s literally no product in this pump bottle. I bought this eye cream a month ago and it’s somehow empty even though I used 1/2 a pump every night. That isn’t possible. I really want to go get my money back for this. I’m not sure if I just got a half empty bottle or if this is how it always is. I will not buy again. Stupid bottle or bad product?
