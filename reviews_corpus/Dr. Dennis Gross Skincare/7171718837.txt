No for me. Extremely sticky feels just like an acid peel in terms of stickiness. Also the immediate brightening effect I saw in many reviews might be a little misleading as the actual serum is thick and orange. I didn’t see immediate results after washing it off , and it’s too sticky for me to want to use again long term. Also smells very bad. Very sticky, acid peel texture
