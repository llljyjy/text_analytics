I really liked this product and am down to the last 25% of the bottle, but the gel is stuck to the sides of the glass and I can’t get it out. I’ve had it turned upside down for weeks hoping the gel would fall so I can take off the lid and use it, but it hasn’t. It’s a huge bummer because this is an expensive product and I was only able to use 75% of it. It looks like they’ve repackaged since I last purchased, so hopefully it’ll work better. Currently though, I feel like I’m so much is going to waste nan
