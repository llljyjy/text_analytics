A sephora worker convinced me to try this moisturizer. I had no intention of spending this much but I was hopeful it’d make my skin feel hydrated enough. It is a good moisturizer, but I found that I need a lot of it to do a little. I also have to put at least two layers on for my skin to feel “quenched.” I have sensitive combination skin with lots of redness. nan
