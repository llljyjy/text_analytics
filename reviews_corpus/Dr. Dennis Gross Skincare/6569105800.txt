I’ve finally come to realize that no matter how much a product may claim to reduce fine lines or wrinkles it simply is not true or possible. I think this product like every product for wrinkles and fine lines may “work “ for people who are young as they don’t have any fine lines yet but if you have them already this isn’t going to magically make them disappear or be reduced. I’ve used 2 bottles of this now and have zero difference , have noticed no reduction or any change at all. I will say that it sinks in quickly and didn’t irritate my skin which is good but at the end of the day I wasted my money on a product that really does nothing. There’s only one thing that can reduce fine lines and wrinkles and you can’t buy it at Sephora. Save your money if you actually have fine lines you want to reduce and make a dr appt, it’s actually worth the money. Don't expect anything if you have fine lines.
