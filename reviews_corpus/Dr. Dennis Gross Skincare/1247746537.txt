I bought this during the Sephora sale. I had read the reviews and was really excited to try it. Unfortunately it did not hydrate my dry skin enough, and left my skin feeling sticky. I was unable to use my primer over top as it pilled. I will be returning the product. Did not work well, left my skin sticky
