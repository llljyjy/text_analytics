I have dry skin with sun damage so I’m always love to try products to help improve my skin tone and texture.  Formulated with lactic acid and vitamin C, this combination helps improve sun damage along with hydrating my dry skin.  Apply as the last step of my skincare routine, cream glides easily on my skin without any tackiness.  Once it fully absorb, it leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.  In the morning is when I feel and see the most difference in that skin feels incredibly soft and looks slightly brighter.  I think it’s due to skin recovery overnight.  I can’t wait to see more results over time. nan
