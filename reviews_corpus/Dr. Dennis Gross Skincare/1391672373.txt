It looks like most of the other reviews were part of a promotion by Dr. Dennis Gross. However, I purchased this product on my own with no strings attached. Itâ€™s a definite upgrade from their deep c cream which I have been using for years. It feels thicker and more luxurious. I wish the product was given in a pump form. It was just released on Sephora site so I have only been using it for a few days yet I must say my face feels softer and firmer. YES!
