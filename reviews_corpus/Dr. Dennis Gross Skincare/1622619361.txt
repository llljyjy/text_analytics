An oil-free, non-comedogenic moisturizer that doubles as a serum. Love multipurpose products so much. Three forms of vitamin C combined with lactic acid enhance performance to improve visible signs of aging, dramatically brighten, and hydrate skin.I love that it instantly hydrates and moisturizes my skin. It absorbs so quickly. The only issue I have with this is the smell of the product. Wish it was unscented or smelled better. Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing results with continual use. Easily absorbs
