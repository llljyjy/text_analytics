It’s so strange because the newly-reformulated vitamin c moisturizer in the DDG line I find to be completely non-irritating + amazing at hydrating + brightening my dry/sensitive skin. As much as I wanted to love this eye treatment as I do so many other products in the DDG line, this one was just not for me. It cause the corners of my eye + bottom of my upper eyelids to turn red/inflamed with little tiny bumps. I can use it anywhere else though (like my neck or hands without any irritation whatsoever - just not specifically around my eyes). They’re insanely sensitive to most vitamin c products anyway, so I am not surprised. All in all, if you’re not sensitive to ascorbic acid/vitamin c, I bet this would be a great eye cream. I am still giving this 4/5 stars simply because the ingredient list is top notch + my partner loves it and hasn’t experienced any irritation using it whatsoever. Not For Me, But Husband Loves It
