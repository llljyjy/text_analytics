While this is pricey, the bottle I purchased lasted nearly 5 months, and I can actually see results! I am 36 and was starting to get a few lines and noticing changes in my skin’s overall look. I use this on my face and the eye serum around the eye area usually every other day, and after about 2 months or so could really see the difference. It takes some time, but the effectiveness honestly surprised me! I feel like I have used so many products that promise great results and just don’t deliver. I just got my 2nd bottle and this is a must-have product for my nightime routine now. Just do be aware - overuse can be irritating, and it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun so wearing sunscreen is really important (I learned this the hard way after I accidentally got a little sunburn one day). I also suggest taking before pictures so that you can compare after a few months of use. Tbh tho, the changes I saw were noticeable enough without even needing to compare photos! Worth every penny!
