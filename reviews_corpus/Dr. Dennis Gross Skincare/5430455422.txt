I have dry and sensitive skin and even in the summer my skin and face is really dry so I need a product that has a lot of moisture to it. This is definitely a product for me and may not be suitable for combination or oily skin. There is a little bit of tackiness to it and it takes a little while to sit in but my skin in the morning is extremely moisturized and I feel like my make up during the day sits on my skin better because it is more moisturized from this cream. nan
