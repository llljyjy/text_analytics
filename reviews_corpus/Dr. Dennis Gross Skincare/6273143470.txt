I’m excited to have received this amazing oil-free moisturizing serum complementary of Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare. This serum is rich in quality ingredients and leaves my face looking and feeling smooth and refreshed.  It comes in a nice dispenser and has a light creamy texture.  It doesn’t leave my skin grainy or conflicts with other skincare products I layer with it.  After about a week of use, I can tell that my skin looks more hydrated and radiant.  Looking forward to improved results over time.  Give this moisturizer a try. Great Hydration & Radiance
