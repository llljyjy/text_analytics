Amazing steamer! I love the shape of the top piece because it spreads out the stream evenly across your face.  I got a barstool to sit on and with it placed on the counter, it is a good height for me. It does recommend distilled water and the reservoir keeps enough water for the 8 minute recommended use time. Cord wears nicely around and has a snug fit so fit doesnâ€™t take up much room on the counter. New Favorite For Skincare Routine!
