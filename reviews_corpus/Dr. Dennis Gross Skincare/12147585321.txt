I wanted to love this product so much because of all the rave reviews, but I skim said ABSOLUTELY NOT! The first time I tried it I wasn’t sure if this is what broke me out because I was using other products at the same time but the second time I made sure tink my use the wipes and I got those same little bumps all over my face. I’m kind of upset I wasted like  $80 and only used maybe 4… I wish I had tried the mini first but I was so confident based off all of the reviews I had read! BROKE MY FACE OUT!!!
