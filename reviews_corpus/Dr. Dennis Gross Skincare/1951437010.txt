I have seen a big improvement in my skin’s hydration, brightness, and softness since I’ve been using this moisturizer. I like to use this just once every few days since I have sensitive skin, and I use it at night. On the nights I use this, I wake up to glowing skin that is so clear and soft and supple! The moisturizer has a nice luxuriously silky texture that doesn’t feel heavy in my skin and sinks right in, and makes my skin look super glowy! I love both lactic acid and vitamin c in skincare and I will continue to use this. I can’t wait to see long term results! Gives that glass skin look!
