I bought this on a whim because at 48 I am determined to do what I need to for my skin. I didnâ€™t think I had a dark circle issue, but in one application my under-eye area was not only smoother and firmer, but brighter. Unbelievable results quickly. I thought my usual eye cream was a good one, but I am now a believer in Dr. Dennis Gross. Absorbs quickly and not greasy at all. I will continue to purchase, and I also appreciate the fact that it is clean and comes in a hygienic pump. I definitely recommend this. Best eye cream ever
