Over a short time, my skin has changed tremendously. My skin has much less texture and my malasma has faded. My face looks younger=more bright and “glowy”. This serum is easy to layer because it’s lightweight and quick absorbing. I use it in conjunction with the Dr. Dennis Gross Vitamin C Lactic Dewy Deep Cream (which is also lightweight). The scent is really nice too. Smoother skin and evened out tone!
