Most formulas are a waste of money because they don’t actually get absorbed into the skin. Except this one IS worth the money absolutely ( I am also a cystic acne sufferer).  I have used alot of “ Medical grade“ skincare along with OTC brands and I don’t find alot of irritation or acne with this one- unlike Zo Medical C Bright but I do feel some tingle upon application - unlike YTTP C and caffiene. Some Vitamin C tips: With quality vitamin C products you will get the smoked meat smell you can’t avoid this. If this product feels sticky your using way too much of it ! Keep your Vitamin C in the fridge to prevent oxidization of the product once opening and best used within 3 months. “ Stable“ Vitamin C products are a waste of your money - Dr Dray. I didn’t get this product from promotion and not a sephora employee. I someone who has struggled with severe cystic acne and want to spend my money on products that work and like to know the science behind skincare. one of my holy grails
