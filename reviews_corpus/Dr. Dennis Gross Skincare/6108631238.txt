I love Dr Dennis Gross Retinol line especially their eye serum is one of my HG! The vitamin C serum is lovely too! The texture is lightweight and it gets absorbed immediately. Aboslutely no irritation like traditional vitamin c serums and it layers beautifully well with other products. I have been using it for about 2 weeks but I am hoping it will help to brighten the skin overall. Good
