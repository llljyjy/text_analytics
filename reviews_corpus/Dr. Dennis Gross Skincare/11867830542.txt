I’ve been using this on my dry skin and wow it feels incredible!! I have tried many moisturizers and this one really sinks into the skin to help repair the dryness. I love how it doesn’t have any noticeable fragrance it just smells fresh and the texture is so nice!! It’s a very large jar with product where a little goes a long way- I highly recommend. I was **gifted this product by the brand but my review stays the same! nan
