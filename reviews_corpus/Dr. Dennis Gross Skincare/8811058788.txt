I rarely repurchase thing because I am always getting things in subscription boxes and usually don’t see much difference between products. This serum is different. It is so good that I am on my third bottle. I have hormonal acne and this helps keep my skin as clear as possible. While I still have some breakouts related to hormonal changes, this has significantly reduced the severity. I notice when I run out that my skin isn’t as nice and my breakouts are more severe. I would highly recommend. My pores look reduced as well. Would definitely recommend. On my third bottle!
