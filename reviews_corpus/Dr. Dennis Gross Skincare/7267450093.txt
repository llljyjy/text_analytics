Hydration + vitamin c - what else could you want in a product. I loooove this moisturizer more than I have any other moisturizer in a minute. I have oily skin so I need to be careful to not congest my skin but this moisturizer is perfect. It packs a punch of hydration without being greasy or heavy. I’ve been using this every day for three weeks and I honestly do notice a different in my skin’s radiance. I’m currently prepping for my wedding and this product will be staying in my routine. Definitely pick this up if you are a vitamin C junkie like me. Win-win product!
