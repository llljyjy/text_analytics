Black women with oily skin here. I had actually stopped using for for reasons I can’t remember. I think I just ran out and somehow forgot to re order. I’ve been struggling with some acne scars on my forehead for years. Started using this every other day and worked up to every day. I noticed my scars fading when I was putting on makeup one day and realized I didn’t need as much concealer after my foundation. Bite the bullet and buy this. I’m a sucker for luxury skin care. You won’t be disappointed in this. I do recommend using every other day and working up to every day even if you have normal non sensitive skin. My skin craves this.
