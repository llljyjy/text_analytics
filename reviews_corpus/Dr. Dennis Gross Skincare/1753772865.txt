I have dry to combination skin, and I had been wanting to find a chemical exfoliant so that 32 years old I wouldn’t have to worry about baclava skin (where the oil gets stuck under the dead skin and you get breaks outs and oil). This product is the ultimate solution. My skin isn’t sensitive and loved this product. I’ve noticed that it helps my skin better absorb the products I use after, and getting rid of the dead skin has helped better eliminate my wrinkles :) love using my hyaluronic acid serum after this and get all of my anti aging products deep into the skin after a good exfoliation with the product ever morning. Love love love and have consistently used this product for one year. 10/10 worth the money! nan
