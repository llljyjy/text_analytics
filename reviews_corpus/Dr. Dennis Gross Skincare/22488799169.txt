The scent is strong but it does fade after time, it has deep hydration and a dewy gel-like formula. I typically use it at night and tends to keep me moisturized until morning.  So far I have found no irritation with my skin and the vitamin c lactic acid combination. For the first few uses, I did not remember that there was even lactic acid in it cause I had no irritation at all. smells good
