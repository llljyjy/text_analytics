I’m so thankful that I was gifted this product for my honest review, because I will truly be using the entire bottle. Less than a full pump is enough for both eyes, which I love. I have stopped using both a vitamin c serum and hydrating eye cream in the morning by replacing it with this one product. It’s incredibly hydrating and a mix between a serum and a cream. Absolutely perfect! Keeps my under eyes bright and hydrated all day. So hydrating!
