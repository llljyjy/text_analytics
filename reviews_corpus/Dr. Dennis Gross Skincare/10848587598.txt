My skin absolutely loves both lactic acid and vitamin C, so I was super excited to try this serum. That being said, I do have pretty sensitive skin so I always worry when adding new products to my routine with high concentrations. This caused no irritation on sensitivity and worked really well with the rest of my routine. The texture is very interesting, it lies between a serum and an oil that absorbs really quickly and leaves a lovely glowy finish. The smell is not my cup of tea, but it is similar to other high concentration Vitamin Cs and dissipates in no time. My skin tone and texture look great, so Iâ€™m really looking forward to the long term effects on my hyperpigmentation! nan
