This 3-piece daily regimen set includes everything you need to achieve clearer and smoother skin. The kit consists of a full-size pack of Universal Daily Peels, AHA/BHA Daily Cleansing Gel, and a NEW Daily Moisturizer.I already use the daily peel pads and they work so well. I use them a maximum of twice a week to avoid irritation. The cleansing gel has a pleasant texture, it lathers well and removes all the impurities without stripping the barrier of the skin. I have combination skin and the Alpha Beta Daily Moisturizer provides a great hydrating while gently exfoliating the skin. It’s formulated with squalane and ceramides which are so good for the skin. I used the cleanser and the moisturizer for over a week now and I can see my pores being less clogged. I can’t wait to see long-term results. Great kit for combo/oily skin
