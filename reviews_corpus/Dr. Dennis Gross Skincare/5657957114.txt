let me start by saying, i have INCREDIBLY acne prone skin. i’ve tried 50+ moisturizers & they all either make me break out in acne or milia, or they do 0 for my skin. this product is incredibly light & gentle while giving me the feeling of being deeply moisturized. i’m only 24 so i don’t really have wrinkles, but after 2 weeks of using this, my mom asked me if i got botox lol. that made her start using it, & her wrinkles are basically gone in only 2ish months. i’ve told so many people about this moisturizer & they all have switched to using it & say it’s their holy grail. i never write reviews but this is a slam dunk. i will never ever use another moisturizer. the scent is almost like a verrryyyyy light lemon meringue. it smells incredible but the smell doesn’t linger or affect me at all (im very sensitive to fragrance). is it expensive? sure! but you know what’s way more expensive? botox. if you’re on the fence, try it for a couple weeks & it’ll change your life. i’ve never had more beautiful skin (even while having my period) please never stop making this moisturizer!!!! THIS WILL FOREVER CHANGE YOUR SKIN!
