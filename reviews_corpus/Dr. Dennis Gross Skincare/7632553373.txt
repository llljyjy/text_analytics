The DG peel is a staple in my routine so I was thrilled to try their new vit c + lactic serum.  This has become part of my PM routine applied on a clean face with a hyaluronic booster layered under my night cream. I’m loving the added glow and have noticed a reduction in the time it takes for skin turnover on dark spots. I’m sensitive to the smell of this (medicinal? herbal? ) would suggest trying in store before buying since it’s rather expensive. Overall would recommend though. nan
