A friend of mine had raved about this product (the original full strength daily peel) so I was intrigued to try it. My skin is extremely sensitive so when I saw this ultra gentle type, I immediately bought it. I’ve tried 3 of the 5 treatments and while my face has shown a little improvement, it doesn’t justify the price for this item. I do appreciate, though, that it didn’t hurt my skin (though it stinged for a couple seconds until it dried) and the smell wasn’t intense. nan
