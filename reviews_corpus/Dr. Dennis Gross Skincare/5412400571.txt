I confess I was a little scared of using this because my skin is very sensitive to Vitamin C and AHAs, and Iâ€™ve had bad reactions in the past.  But I did not experience any irritation with this product!  I did start slow at first, just 2x/week and am trying to build up.  I love the blend of Vitamin Cs for brightening (3-oethyl ascorbic acid, tetraheyldecyl ascorbate and ascorbic acid), lactic acid to exfoliate the top layer of skin and niacinamide and centella asiatica is one of my favorite products!  It feels a bit more like a serum than a moisturizer.  I was expecting a bit of a smell, because many Vitamin C products have one, but did not notice any smell with this. Great Vitamin C for sensitve skin
