I use these religiously. They were recommended to me after a high end facial and serve to cleanse my skin and exfoliate daily. They are easy, great for sensitive skin and Iâ€™ve seen in a significant reduction in blackheads plus my skins texture has improved. Highly recommend. A must have in my routine!
