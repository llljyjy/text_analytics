My skin is extremely sensitive. That paired with rosacea, acne, and combination skin type makes it hard for me to find products that cater to all those needs. After starting this my pores have looked better than ever. My skin looks smoother and acne has reduced. HOWEVER, if you have sensitive skin, rosacea, or dryness I would only recommend using this product once a week or every two weeks cause as “gentle“ as it supposed to be it can cause irritation. Still a great product and totally worth it. Obviously it’s not perfect, but it’s worth giving a shot. Worth a Try
