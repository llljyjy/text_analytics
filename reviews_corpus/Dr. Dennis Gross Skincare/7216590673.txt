I’ve been using this for about a month and I have noticed gradual improvement in my skin. I still get some breakouts, but they don’t stick around as long as they used to. I also noticed my skin felt more smooth and acne scars have gone away. These are expensive, but I also cut them in half to save some $ and the wipes have plenty of product. Will continue to use for sure. Seeing improvements each week
