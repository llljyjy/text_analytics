So far so good! I’m not a fan of the scent as it almost smells like something is burning (like smoke). I haven’t had any issue with tingling on my skin and I use 4-6 drops all over in the morning before my moisturizer. I’m familiar with vitamin C serums and this one seems very consistent with most I’ve used. Hoping this one will give firming and brightening results but only more time will tell. Nice serum
