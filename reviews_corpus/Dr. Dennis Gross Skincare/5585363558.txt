This moisturizer is everything!! I have very dry skin and usually I have to use a face mist 1-2x throughout the day for added hydration but with this dewy deep cream, I don’t need it!! I use it morning and night and it leaves me hydrated with a beautiful healthy glow and my skin is bright and more even. It’s a thick cream (so a little goes a long way) but absorbs so quickly and it even has a pleasant but ever so slight cooling feeling. If you struggle with dryness, this cream is a life changer!! The best cream for dry skin!
