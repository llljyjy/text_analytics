I like the combination of brightening and exfoliating and I love how my skin feels after exfoliating so I was happy to try this. Smells great! Not like citrus, but a very light, fresh scent. Sticky at first but then it dries down. It gives you that beautiful glass skin glow and you have a gently exfoliated face in the morning without redness! It’s expensive but it’s really nice so hopefully you get the chance to try it if it’s on your wishlist! Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Vitamin C Lactic Dewy De
