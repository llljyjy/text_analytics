I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I didn’t see much of a difference in my overall skin. I did notice my skin seemed not quite as dry but as far as improved texture, smaller pores, reduced fine lines, etc I didn’t see a change. I used it twice a day for the last quite a few weeks before making this review. The product has a nice scent (kind of calming) and was easy to apply. I just rubbed multiple drops into the skin. I would not purchase this product on my own. Didn’t notice a change besides less dry
