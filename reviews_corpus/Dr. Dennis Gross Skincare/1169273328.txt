Took about a month of using this before I noticed any difference but I definitely see diminished puffiness and brightness, I’m actually quite surprised because I was expecting same old minor results I’ve experienced from numerous other creams, maybe that’s part of the past problems..creams, whereas this is a serum.  Only need very small amount for both eyes, so that helps some with the higher price point.  Definitely will keep using and will purchase again.  I think it says to use twice a day but I only used at my nighttime skin care routine. nan
