I received a 5 pack sample of this and after using my skin had never been so clear. I had to go for it and buy the box. I usually have some hormonal acne and I’m terrible for picking at it and leaving scars. This product not only prevented the acne but cleared up all the scars so quickly. When I went to repurchase I was told this is a product you should use for 1 month straight just 2 times a year. It’s like a facial that resurfaces your skin. It’s expensive but if that’s the price I have to pay for clear glowing skin then it’s soooo worth it. Will be buying again in a few months for another round. Miracle Product!
