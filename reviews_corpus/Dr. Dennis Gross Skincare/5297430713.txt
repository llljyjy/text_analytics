This moisturizer is magic! The lactic + vitamin c combo is so effective and brightening without being irritating for my sensitive skin. I love the texture and how nourishing & hydrating it is (also have dry skin). Only downside is that I feel like there’s a tiny bit of residue / oil that doesn’t quite play well with my makeup routine A winner!
