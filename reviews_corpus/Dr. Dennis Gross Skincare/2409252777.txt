I bought this wanting to start seriously incorporating a retinol into my routine, as I’m approaching my 30’s and trying to prevent wrinkles before they come. I’ve been using this serum for about 2 months now, and so far I’m happy! There was the initial purging stage, as to be expected with a retinol but I’ve noticed my skin is clearer and my texture has seriously improved! Keep in mind that with retinol you’re playing the long game to see results. You’re NOT going to see a difference in two weeks or even a month. Retinol can take 6 months to see real results. Give it a chance to work. That being said, the smell is pretty bad, but I can forgive that because I’m seeing great results! Great Addition to my Routine
