I received this product complimentary from Dr Dennis Gross Skincare in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this for awhile, and I’ve experienced no sensitivity, redness, irritation or dryness so far. It’s lightweight, and absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling sticky. My skin feels hydrated and firm, and looks smoother. I’ll continue to use this product and I am looking forward to seeing the results. So Far, So Good
