in just 3 weeks this has transformed my skin! I had a deep hormonal acne breakout that left some intense scarring behind. I can already see a major difference- I would say it’s 1/3 of the way gone. It’s much easier to cover up with concealer or foundation now. I’ve also noticed that my skin is smoother & just overall happier. I have sensitive skin, so I started off doing this every other day to ease myself into it. I definitely recommend doing that if you also have sensitive skin, bc my skin was dry and irritated the first few days. That went away though, and I’ve been able to increase my usage to 1x/day. I can’t recommend this enough! Acne scarring is fading!!
