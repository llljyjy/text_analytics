Love the bright orange jar.. The cream is rich and has a nice smell.. I don’t know but the smell kinda reminds me of aloe vera products.. It is just light and doesn’t bother me.. This cream feels good on skin and very hydrating.. A little goes a long way, it spread nicely and absorbs easily.. Skin feels so smooth.. This cream kinda feels luxurious.. It doesn’t feel heavy, sticky or greasy.. My skin looks dewy and glowing.. Didn’t see changes on my fine lines but hopefully overtime.. I have a dry and sensitive skin and I didn’t get any irritation at all.. It’s just I have a days that I need to re-apply in the afternoon on the corner or sides of my nose coz it starting to feel dry, not everyday maybe I just have a drier days.. Love this cream!
