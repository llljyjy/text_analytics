I’m a fan of anything with vitamin c for the benefits it offers for the skin, but I have dry sensitive skin and not all of the products suits me well, I’m sad to say in this case I have to pass on, I knew this won’t work for me the moment I put it on, but I have to say I like the texture and my skin looks super luminous when I put it on, I have to point out this didn’t work for me but I may work for others. I have to pass on this one
