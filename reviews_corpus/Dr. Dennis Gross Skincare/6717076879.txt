I think itâ€™s a lovely cream the scent is a little overwhelming but not terrible I do love the ingredients list and it feels very nourishing a little goes a long way I would say that this would be a really great moisturizer for fall winter spring and then you could maybe use just like a little bit during the summer months but my skin feels very bouncy and more resilient. nan
