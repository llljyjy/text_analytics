I absolutely love this new Dr. Dennis Gross line. It’s not have vitamin C but lactic acid too which is very gentle and hydrating. It has high 15% concentration of Vitamin C so it’s very effective but at the same time not irritant. It gives my face beautiful glow, texture is smooth and skin is hydrated. so good
