Beautiful gel-like moisturizer. Although it is similar to a gel moisturizer, itâ€™s richer and more moisturizing than others I have used. A little goes a long way, making it worth the investment. I think the formula and ingredients are top notch. The ingredients are incredible. Initially I thought it was scented with an artificial fragrance and I am not a fan of that. But, after looking at the ingredients, it seems that the scent is purely from natural ingredients like lavender and fruit extracts. For that reason, I give it a 10 out of 10. It does remind me of the scent of nair though. Still, beautiful products and formulation and I hope the addition of lactic acid will help continue to brighten my dull skin.
