Iâ€™ve tried many moisturizers by Dr Dennis and by far this is my favorite. It feels so good on my skin and gives that dewy glow throughout the day. I have a very dry skin, so not all the moisturizers work for me. After using for almost 14 days I can say this is one of the best moisturizers for a dry skin. I apply AM/PM on my face and neck my skin feels smooth and hydrated. It smells so good and fresh. I highly recommend. Best Dr Dennis moisturizer
