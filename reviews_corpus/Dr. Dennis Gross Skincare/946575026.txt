This serum reminds me so much of a more expensive Vitamin C!  The smell is slightly like hot dogs, but it quickly dissipated and is worth it for the benefits.  My skin always feels so hydrated and is glowing when I use this.  I automatically look brighter.  I canâ€™t wait to see the long-term results with consistent daily use.  I use this in the morning before my moisturizer and sunscreen. Glow baby!!
