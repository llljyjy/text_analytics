Fantastic for adult acne; I use this product on my face, chest, and back. My acne scars are fading and future breakouts are prevented. If it helps: I currently use a tea tree face wash from The Body Shop during my showers and Paula’s Choice retinol at night. I am about to try a Kiehl’s mask for remaining nose blackheads (pesky things) and a Paula’s Choice niacinamide for redness. Adult acne; oily skin; large pores; blackheads
