I’m really enjoying this eye cream as part of my morning routine. The cream is hydrating and definitely makes my under eyes look a little brighter with the pale yellow color. I layer this under sunscreen, which is important because the eye cream has AHAs, and makeup and it provides a smoother base than without it. I also appreciate the packaging, it’s a pump so I don’t have to worry about sticking my finger a jar. All in all a wonderful morning eye cream! nan
