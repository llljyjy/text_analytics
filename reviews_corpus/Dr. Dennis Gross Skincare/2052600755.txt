I’m definitely not new to vitamin c serums but this one actually seems to be working. This is a higher concentration than I’m used to but it didn’t irritate or cause any reaction to my sensitive skin. It’s very light weight and not as sticky as some of the other serums I’ve tried. I really like this one and will continue to see if my dark spots lighten more. Great serum!
