I have an issue with almost all retinol products because my skin is so sensitive. I peel a massive amount on every retinol product I have tried and I have tried my fair share! I got this as a sample and instantly fell in love because the peeling was almost nonexistent! Thatâ€™s huge for me! I can not tell you how irritating it is to have to reapply makeup over and over because you can see all this peeling skin that you thought you had already gotten exfoliating or dermaplaning. This is a complete game changer for my wildly sensitive skin!!! I instantly bought a full size after using the sample, totally worth it. in love with this retinol product!
