This is the perfect addition to my morning skincare routine. You can use it in the AM or PM, but I prefer Vitamin C in the morning. This was very gentle on my under eye area, and I can tell a difference in my puffiness and dark circles. Makes me look more awake! Donâ€™t forget to follow this with SPF! gentle
