*gifted by Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare* Lactic acid and vitamin C are some of my favorite ingredients in skincare, so I love that they are combined in one product. This eye cream is lightweight, absorbs well and leaves undereye area hydrated. It helps with undereye darkness when used constantly for a longer period of time. nan
