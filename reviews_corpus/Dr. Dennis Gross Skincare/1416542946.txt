Tried this out during Sephora’s 20% off spring sale. Yes it is insanely expensive, but wow! I have sensitive skin that reacts to most things and after my first use of this my skin was so smooth and soft. Not irritated at all. I used a good moisturizer afterwards which I’m sure also helped. Definitely recommend, just wish it wasn’t so expensive. Love it!
