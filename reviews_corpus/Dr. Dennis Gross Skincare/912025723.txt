Dr Dennis Gross makes some amazing products. I have had the opportunity to try many and love them, so I was excited to see if this is just as good as the others. First, the packaging is great. Aesthetically pleasing, effective, really simple, but a big deal because it does make a difference in containing it and dispensing. The product is an oil-free, light lotion texture. A hybrid serum + lotion. It really imparts a healthy GLOW. It also smooths fine lines and overall improves the appearance of the face. Easy to use and easy to love.  Radiant, bright, healthy complexion is an accurate description. Definitely follow with SPF in the day. Definitely makes you GLOW!
