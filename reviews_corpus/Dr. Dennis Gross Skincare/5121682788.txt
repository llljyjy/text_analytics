This is a super potentened high quality vitamin c serum so I highly recommend doing a patch test first. I personally love vitamin c and use it daily so this one didn’t cause any irritation to my skin. It’s east to spread and absorbs quickly, so far my skin feels soft and overall complexion looks brighter. Will definitely continue to use. Good quality vit C
