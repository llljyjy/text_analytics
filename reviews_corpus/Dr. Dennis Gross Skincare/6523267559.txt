I have a few bumps on my face that are not acne.  I cannot remember what they call it.  These peel pads work wonders on them!!!  I donâ€™t use them every day since they are so expensive.  I wish I had taken a before pic.  If you are in doubt try the trial size.  I actually noticed a tiny difference with just a few uses.  So I bought the normal size.I will definitely be keeping these in stock! Pricey but Worth it!
