I’ve gone through 2 boxes so far, spread apart as maintaince for my skin. It makes a difference in texture and improved my skin overall. It mayt sting a little so I would recommend gradually incorporating this into your routine, I definitely didn’t use this daily and was happy with the results. While you’re at it, don’t forget to bring this down to your neck! nan
