This moisturizer is great! I love that it has vitamin c in it, it really has come in handy during mornings I just don’t have time for my full skincare routine. I have dry skin and because this is packed with so many powerful ingredients like vitamin c I stick to only using this in the morning and it has worked wonders for my skin. It is a great base for my makeup - nothing has pilled or broken up on my face while using this moisturizer. I haven’t been using it long enough to notice a serious difference in my overall skin tone but I do think it has made my skin more glowy and luminous. It also really does hydrate your skin, my skin is so soft and supple from using this moisturizer I really can’t recommend it enough. nan
