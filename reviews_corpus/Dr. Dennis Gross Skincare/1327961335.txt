Scentless, quick absorbing and makes my eyes look less tired than I feel!  I’m the mom of a toddler and I’ve been battling tired eyes for a while now.  What makes this a stand out treatment is that my eyes look more well rested, AND there’s no weird stickiness or residue.  I can layer this with my primer and makeup without any caking, or wear it with just spf, but it soaks right in either way.  I noticed that I looked better rested right away and less puffiness after about a week, I look forward to soon benefitting from some of the exfoliating ingredients as well. Toddler Mom Approved
