don’t know. I wasn’t in love. There was something in this that just didn’t work great with my skin. It did blend easily and looked fine under makeup - but every so often my fave would feel hot like I was getting a reaction.  I passed this onto a friend and she loved it so maybe it was just my sensitive skin nan
