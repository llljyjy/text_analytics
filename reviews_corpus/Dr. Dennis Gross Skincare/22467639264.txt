This cream is lightweight, fast-absorbing texture, you won’t feel oily or sticky. I have tried many different moisturizers; this one works the best for hydration purposes. My skin was extremely dry in the afternoon but after I used this cream, I didn’t feel the tightening on my face at noon time anymore, my skin is now hydrated, supple and soft. Highly recommend it to every dry skin. nan
