I really love the texture of this product. I’d been using a similar cream for a while but wanted to try something new and I’m so glad I did! This product is somewhere between a cream and a gel. I do have trouble getting it to fully sink into my skin if I use too much. A little does go a long way. So happy I tried this. Just wish the price was a little lower. Pricy but worth it!
