If I had to choose between two products forever it would be the Dennis Gross peel and a simple moisturizer. This treatment is the most effective skin care product I have ever used. It helped me treat my post acne scars and really even smoothed out lines that were starting to form. I was 23 when I started using it and obviously fine line weren’t the primary concern but I found that it really prevented any lines from forming the way I thought they were going to. There is no question, that this is a pricy product and a lot of the products in skin care are luxury rather than necessity. But I believe this is worth every penny and I was buying this even when I could just barely afford. I am not suggesting everyone does the same but I want to stress how much of a difference this actually makes. You can often get this as sample and you will see a difference from one treatment. I started with the regular and moved on to the extra strength as my skin built tolerance. I have never used this daily as suggested as my skin is sensitive and I don’t feel the need, but this does everything that you would expect 5 other masks to do. Definitely try the trial size before committing to the full size. When I first tried this product I had a pretty intense reaction, it does sting a bit and if you are sensitive it can make you red. You should be cognitive of your skin type and what you are comfortable using but this is really amazing. The best thing skincare can offer
