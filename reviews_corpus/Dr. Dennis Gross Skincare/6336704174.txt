I have sun spots and discoloration on my cheeks and forehead. After using regularly for 2 weeks I’ve noticed my dark spots have lightened a little and my skin feels great! I haven’t noticed any sensitivity or reaction ( I make sure to wear sunscreen daily). The packing is pretty and heavy, like other Dr. Dennis Gross products. I like that this comes in an opaque bottle so the sun won’t affect the formula. Brighter Days
