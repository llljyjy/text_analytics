I am so pleasantly surprised by the moisturizer. I went into my local Sephora with some ideas of moisturizers I wanted to try; I have combo skin with dry patches but a t-zone that is blinding by noon.  This one wasn’t even on my radar, but the amazing associate I was working with recommended it as a product she used.  It has been absolutely perfect for my needs! No more dry patches at all, but also no more shine at all finally. Sits great under my makeup, and hasn’t made my skin breakout.  I’m so so happy with this purchase. It’s totally worth the price to check all my boxes.  I will say that I use this for daytime wear, and wear a heavier cream at night. New HG That Took Me By Surprise
