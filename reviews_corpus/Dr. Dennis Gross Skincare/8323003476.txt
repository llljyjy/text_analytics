The thing I love the most about this is the texture! It’s a gel and perfect for the summer heat. It works very well under makeup, and caused no pilling. I have sensitive skin and it didn’t cause any breakouts. The only criticism I would have is the smell. I expected citrus and it’s very floral. It’s tolerable after you rub it in though. If you’re sensitive to strong smells though, tread lightly. nan
