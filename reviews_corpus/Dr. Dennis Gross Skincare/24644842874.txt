This eye treatment is so interesting. I Never heard of eye cream that contains vitamin C and Lactic acid at the same time before. I love that it has a light silky texture and it is so gentle on the eye. I have been using it for a week now and I can already see a difference. My eye area looks much brighter and my dark circles are less visible. nan
