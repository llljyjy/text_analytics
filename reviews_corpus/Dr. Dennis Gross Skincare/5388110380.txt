I always use a product with vitamin c in the morning to pair with my sunscreen and brighten my complexion. This is a tad on the heavy side and leaves my skin very dewy looking, can feel a bit heavy at times when it gets very hot out. Also there is a scent though it subtle enough for me to ignore. Worth a try
