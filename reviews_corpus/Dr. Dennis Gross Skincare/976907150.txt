Is it a moisturizer or a serum? Yes. This is a highly moisturizing serum that can (and has!) be used in lieu of a separate moisturizer, which is great for mornings that you have to rush. My skin loves vitamin C and I love that this replaces the need for a separate vitamin C serum and moisturizer. Great for the hot summer days! 2 products in one!
