I’ve been using this product almost nightly for several months and haven’t noticed any difference. It has lasted a while which is a plus but unfortunately it doesn’t seem to be doing anything for my fine lines. The consistency is a nice gel texture which goes on very easily and feels cooling and nice. no results
