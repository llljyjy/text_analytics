This eye cream is very hydrating I use about a pump and a half for a both eyes you can feel a slight tingle when you first apply it but nothing uncomfortable just you can feel it working it feels amazing on the skin and I’ve noticed my eyes have been slightly plumper and I can tell it’s working on my crows feet to help firm that  area.  I am definitely loving this eye cream. Very effective
