I was excited to give this Vitamin C + Lactic acid serum a try, as I often hear good things about DDG. I honestly didn’t notice a huge change in any of my dark spots or fine lines, but hopefully with longer use I will begin to see more results. I am not a fan of the scent- it’s very strong and just strange. Overall, for $85 this was just okay for me. nan
