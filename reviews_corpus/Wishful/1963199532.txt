I actually liked the results of wearing the overnight mask, it definitely made my skin appear more bright and hydrated and it definitely felt softer the next day. I cannot give it 5 stars because I personally did not like how it felt on my face while sleeping, it feels wet and I just had a really hard time with that so even though the results were great, I know I won’t be consistent with using it because I don’t like my face feeling wet.4 nan
