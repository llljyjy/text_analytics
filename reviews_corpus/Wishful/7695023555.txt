I got this in my Ipsy X Huda Glambox and am now obsessed.  I was hesitant to use it as the ire iridescent look usually isn’t my thing.  However, Huda won me over.  The scent is so lovely, not overpowering, it’s almost calming.  It doesn’t feel sticky or too thick on my dry skin, nor does it feel greasy.  It layers great with my primer and makeup but I often apply foundation on top of it.  My skin looks and feels great.  It’s smooth and more even-toned, glowy without looking greasy. Delightful Surprise
