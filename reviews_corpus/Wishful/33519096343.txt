I received this as a sample and i will be purchasing the full size immediately. Glides on beautifully, I love the thick jelly texture! The scent isn’t too bad like the reviews say, it fades quickly. I applied in the morning when I received my package. Throughout the day I kept looking in the mirror, my skin looked beautiful and plump and i wasn’t sure what was causing that. It was dewy and somehow my very dark circles weren’t as dark anymore. I felt as if my complexion evened out: I have discoloration, very uneven skin tone and I was confused as to why my skin was looking so nice. This was after a very minimal application to test out the product. Still very confused. Heaven in a jar. Literally. nan
