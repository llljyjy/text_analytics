I have bien using this product for a couple of days. And I just simply say that my skin is now literally “drinking my skin care profucts“ because on the next day after using this mask my skin felt plumped, soft and moisturized all day long. I applied it as the last step of my nighttime skincare ritual, it IS thick, It scared me a little at first but believe me it’s worth it. You will notice your glow in the morning. For your next all Day glow...
