I selected this as a sample-with-purchase and I’m so glad I did! my skin is typically dry and winter weather makes it even worse. This Honey Balm has definitely improved my skin! It is very thick but my skin drinks it up. The texture of the balm is different - it’s very silky - and the scent fresh and soft. I’m very sensitive to lavender, it gives me horrible headache, but this Balm is so lightly scented that it doesn’t bother me and, because I apply just before bed, I find it very relaxing. Honestly, I was skeptical as it states it’s for Normal, Combo and Oily skin but this is amazing for my own dry skin. 100% sure I’ll hit that Add to Basket button before this generous sample runs out!
