I first received this product as a free sample. I wasn’t sure how to use it so I didn’t really know what the product was made to do. Even still, with the tiny trial size and first application I was floored at the balled up dead skin that came off and the glow I had afterwards. I researched the product and read dozens of reviews but still wasn’t sold to spend on the full size. Well, I got a second sample and used it according to directions and the results are just simply undeniable. I bought the full size immediately! Run don’t walk ladies and buy this. This is not a textured scrub, use it on dry, clean skin and watch your dead skin disintegrate and reveal the glowy skin below. I’ve had no reactions to this at all, the scent is very mild and not chemical like some reviews have stated. I would suggest using this a max of 3-4 times a week. One other thing to note-it’s a miracle for removing dry skin on you lips! That’s when I realized it really is dead skin coming off, gross but amazing! life changing product
