I love the application and it’s cool that there’s a spare cartridge in the box but that’s about it. The serum is lightweight but ineffective at getting rid of dark under eyes circles. Maybe it would work to depuff eyes but the applicator is not cold enough. Still hunting for an eye treatment serum or cream that can get rid of dark under eyes circles. nan
