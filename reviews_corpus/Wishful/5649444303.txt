I wanted to try this & was excited when it arrived but even though it smells ok it isn’t anything special for me. Admittedly I have dry skin and I found it to be too thin/almost watery. I wish it was a bit thicker like the honey balm they make- one of my favorites. I wouldn’t ever purposely pick it again. nothing special. quite watery
