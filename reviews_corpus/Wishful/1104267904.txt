I received this as a sample. I used it last night and I’m on here to purchase the full size. I’m 45 with dry skin. It has a cool consistency that kept my skin moisturized overnight. Yes, it’s fragranced with Lavendar but it goes away quickly. It has some light reflection that makes my redness less noticeable. I use Tatcha and Drunk Elephant and honestly I think this could be just as good with a better price point nan
