I saw negative reviews all over the place about this product but, I had the opposite experience. I have very sensitive skin and dermatitis. I was looking for something very similar to the exfoliator from EWC and I am really happy with this cheaper replacement. I can use it on my face and my ingrown hairs. I noticed less dermatitis break out and less congestion (black heads and white heads) on my face after using it twice a week for 2 months. I will buy again. great for sensitive skin.
