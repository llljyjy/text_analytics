Worth every penny. This stuff makes my skin glow and feels so soothing upon application. There is a definite smell of lavender that I personally love and the texture of this cream is like a bouncy jelly that Iâ€™ve never seen before. I love this as a night cream or when my skin just needs an overall boost. A definite must have that will forever be in my beauty cabinet! nan
