Received as a sample, inclined to purchase after it runs out. Doesn’t take much to cover my face & neck. I thought the lavender smelled nice and intend to put this on as part of my bedtime routine. I also liked the texture - smoother than a paste but not really what I would call jelly - heavier than that. Results tbd but the product itself is nice. 4 stars because in general I don’t think products should have this much fragrance or silicone (which is comedogenic). I will have to be cautious about how often I use and make sure to clean my face well in between. Feels good - not great ingredients
