This truly is a skin balm - itâ€™s a tad thicker than a face cream, but absorbs easily and feels lovely and refreshing on the skin. I was drawn in by the purple jar!  This face balm is well priced in a crowded beauty products market. In future, I will deffo try other products in this line. Refreshing and nourishing skin balm.
