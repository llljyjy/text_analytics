I received this as a sample. I was excited to try this since I love niacinamide. The product felt nice and thick but when I applied it, it just pilled. I have tried it a few times and tried to use less but it still pilled. It has a light lavender fragrance which I didnt care for either. I have combination skin Not for me.
