I’ve been using Yo Glow for a month now and I absolutely love it. It’s hard to believe it when you see the dead skin rolling off. I recommend using it over your bathroom sink, rinse and follow up with your favourite moisturizer. My skin is noticeably smoother and brighter. I love it so much, I got it for two of my friends. I say go buy it now. nan
