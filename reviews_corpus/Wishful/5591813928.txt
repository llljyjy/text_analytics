I received a sample of this and purchased the full size the next day! At first I didn’t realize this was intended for your face, and I’ve been lathering my hands and arms in it. I’ve gradually tried it around my neck and up my face and so far I have no break out or reactions to it on my sensitive, oily skin! I love how illuminating it is, in the light it looks shimmery and purple. The scent is amazing as well, smells like fresh lavender in a spa. I’m excited to keep this on the bathroom counter to wind down at night. One of the best products I’ve found in a really long time! Relaxation in a Jar
