DISGUSTING. The smell is absolutely ATROCIOUS. I don’t care if this washes my car and the windows, too…no product is worth this. I cannot fathom the idiocy behind the marketing of this product. Did they think no one would notice? Or did they think it was so great (spolier alert: NOTHING is that great) that people would overlook it? I wanted to, but I just can’t. Serious talk: listen to your intuition; in nature, things that smell bad are bad for you. Run away from this! Run FAR away Nothing that smells like this can possibly be good
