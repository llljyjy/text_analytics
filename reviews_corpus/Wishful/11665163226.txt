I picked this up as I gravitate towards chemical exfoliants rather than physical ones and the other ones I use aren’t easily available in Canada. I’ve got to say, this one had me pleasantly surprised. Although it does have a bit of a gritty texture, it’s very gentle and doesn’t cause my skin to turn red (which happens at the slightest provocation so that was surprising). My skin feels great after washing it off and I like to use it for some gentle exfoliation on a daily basis. Definitely worth trying it! I originally got the small size but will likely be restocking the bigger size after i’m done! Good Option for a Gentle Exfoliant
