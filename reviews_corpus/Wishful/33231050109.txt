I got this as a sample and I loved how it made my skin feel. I have dry skin and my skin drank this up mostly and with dry winter air it feels protective. Probably because it is majority silicone/dimethicone!!  I cannot get over this. I should’ve read the ingredients before I got it. I haven’t used silicone based moisturizers since like 2004, they just seem gross. Why huda why oh why.The sample size is very large and I got multiple uses out of it. I really love the lavender scent but I agree it’s a tad heavy on the scent for skin care, which ideally should be fragrance free. But me personally I don’t mind a hint of EO’s for fragrance. The texture of this is really nice, not quite a jelly, more like in between jelly and balm. I loved it. Until I read the nasty ingredients! If dimethicone works for you, I’d say go for it. But for me it is a hard pass until they upgrade ingredients! Love the feel but hate the ingredients
