Honestly, I hate eye serums because they lack the creamy ingredients that prevent transepidermal water loss (think DE shaba eye serum,) so I was not hopeful for this product. Because I love Huda and pretty much all Wishful products, I decided to try this. This eye lift serum is wonderful… it’s ACTUALLY hydrating and the hydration lasts instead of disappearing. Doesn’t pill or get weird and leaves your eye area very moisturized. I had some redness/irritation around my eyes from a chemical peel and this helped keep that area very comfortable, coming from someone with VERY DRY under eyes. Would this replace my PM eye cream? No, but is this amazing in the morning, while using a sheet mask or in your already-late-car-makeup-routine? YES definitely! nan
