I’m not a fan of facial physical scrubs, but I notice a HUGE difference when I use this scrub!The product comes out a gel moisturizer consistency, but as you rub it on your face the product balls up upon itself to creat soft bits of product that gently exfoliate the skin. I’ve heard many people say that it’s just the product balling up on itself and it never attaches to any skin cells to remove it, but I find the product always attaches and balls up when I scrub areas on my face that I exfoliate less then others.Example, I wear self tanner 24/7, and when I’m removing it from my face the product always balls up where I have some self tanner left on my face, helping to remove it vs the parts of my face that don’t have any tanner. Those that wear self tanner on their face know that tanner loves to stick to certain places on the face then others.I originally bought the 40ml to try, but I’ve gotten the 100ml because I love this product that much! Works WONDERS!!
