I absolutely love this stuff! it’s by far the most effective exfoliator I’ve tried.  I have very dry dehydrated skin and this is able to get a lot of the dryness off. I’ve been using this for a year or two now and have no plans to stop! Only complaint is where did the value size go?! GREAT FOR DRY DEHYDRATED SKIN!
