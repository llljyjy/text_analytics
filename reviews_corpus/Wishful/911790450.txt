I got this as a sample and put some on my face, immediately wondered if I made a mistake. It’s so heavily fragranced with lavender that I thought maybe it was supposed to be a body moisturizer. Plus it’s got a shimmery sheen to it. I used the rest on my arms, which was fine. But I wouldn’t put this on my face with that much fragrance, even if it is essential oils. Too fragranced for face
