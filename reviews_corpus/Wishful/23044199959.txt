I was expecting that “jelly moisturizer“ means a light gel that absorbs well but this is the opposite, really. It’s very heavy, oily and just sits on the top of the skin; I do use hydrating skincare products before applying the moisturizer step so there’s that. I did end using it up on my neck. Too heavy and clogs pores
