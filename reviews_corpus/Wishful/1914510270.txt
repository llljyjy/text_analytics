I have incredibly dry skin and it drinks up product very fast. This product is VERY moisturizing and my skin remains supple and moist. I bought this right after I tried the sample. It’s almost jelly-like and very thick. I’m not sure how some wear this during the day because it’s so thick. I use it at night and wear a silicon mask cover (from Amazon) to seal it, because it’s THAT thick. I love this so much. nan
