I love this moisturizer but it is best used at night because it is very thick and takes a while to soak in. However, my skin feels so hydrated and plump. There is a strong lavender scent but surprisingly it does not irritate my sensitive skin. I do occasionally use it as a day cream, but I donâ€™t generally wear primer or foundation, just some Dr Jarts color correcter and a lil highlight, so not sure how it layers beyond those. It does leave my face greasy for about 15 minutes so I usually busy myself for that time before finishing my hair/makeup. All in all, I love this product and have bought it multiple times. A little goes a long way. So lush and moisturizing.
