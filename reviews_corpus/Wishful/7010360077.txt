The best scrub I have ever used! A little product goes a long way so you donâ€™t have to worry about blowing through it. This product is way better than using a face wash with scrubbing grits in it. I highly recommend. It never makes me break out. I have oily skin with large pores and dry skin and this helps make my skin look so much better. It also smoothes and cleans my skin for better makeup application. Love it! Best facial scrub!
