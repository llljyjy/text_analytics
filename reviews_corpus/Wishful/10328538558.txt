I’ve been using this serum under my Dieux Forever reusable eye masks every morning for a few weeks now. I love the packaging & that it’s refillable, the ingredients list is impressive and the product absorbs very nicely. I did notice a strange scent but I’m not sure if it’s the product or the packaging as the serum is fragrance free. I will definitely be repurchasing this eye serum! New A.M eye serum!
