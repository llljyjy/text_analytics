I bought this because I read it would help with blackheads and pores. I’ve been using it for like 6 months now abt 2x a week (i was using it routinely but now I use it on an as-needed basis)  and i don’t notice a reduction in blackheads or pores overall. that being said it definitely helps reduce the appearance if I am having texture or dryness, but I wouldn’t say it has long-term effects. It does leave my skin feeling nice and doesn’t cause stinging or irritation. I would say it’s more of a quick fix if you have some dry patches or texture you don’t want showing under your makeup and not a long-term solution. good quick fix,  but not a long-term solution.
