This detox mask is the truth. Very quick and easy to use. The Sephora advisor told me exactly how to use it (on clean, dry skin). Wasn’t too much of a mess for me because I use it in the shower, but the product rinses off easily. Your skin will feel super smooth and deeply cleansed after 1 use. Also didn’t make my skin feel dry. Only had it 1 month but my scarring is going away! I purchased this mask on super sale & I appreciate that Beauty Advisor for introducing me to this.
