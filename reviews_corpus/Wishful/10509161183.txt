I found this product as a sample in the beginning but then I bought the full size because it was so good! I really liked the texture of my skin after using this product, I have dry skin so this really helped me by giving a fully moisturized and firm feeling. I really like the smell too, the fragrance is very subtle, and overall, this is now my go-to moisturizer! Recommend for all dry skin and comibination skin!!
