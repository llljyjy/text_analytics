I rarely write reviews for products but I had to for this one. Rub a little onto your face and the dead, dry skin almost instantly starts to pill and fall off - be sure to do this over a sink or your dead skin balls will go everywhere. Ha! The result is smooth, even skin. I use this product 1-2x a week right before hopping in the shower so I can rinse it off easily. I’m also sensitive to smells and this scent doesn’t bother me. Smooth and even!
