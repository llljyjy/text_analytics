I have a few moisturizers that I keep for different uses. I always reach for this one. I love the scent, the texture, how it absorbs and how it makes my skin look. I look moisturized and youthful without any greasy feeling. It also feels super clean on the skin, does not feel heavy or greasy at all. I use a little more than a dime size amount. My dark circles under eyes have also improved. My makeup (Armani foundation/Anastasia concealer) melts into this moisturizer like a dream! Will repurchase again and again I love it
