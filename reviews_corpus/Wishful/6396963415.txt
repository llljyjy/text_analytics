I received a sample in a purchase of some other items. The sample was actually super generous and allowed me to test this for a week before making a decision whether to buy the full size or move on (spoiler: I bought it)I have hyper pigmentation on my chin and jawline from painful hormonal acne that started in my early 40s (cry). I also have sensitive skin so did not want to jump into strong exfoliating acids or high percentage niacinimide products.I’ve been using full size how about two weeks, so three total weeks with the product. Morning: I use a gentle cleanser, gentle toner, Clarins Double Serum, and then my eye routine while the serum sinks in, and then pat (do not rub) the Honey Balm into my chin, jawline, mouth area, and t-zone.My hormonal acne has stopped. STOPPED. The scars are showing genuine signs of fading, with the most recent scars showing the best improvement. Honestly it makes me tear up because I’ve spent the last year+ feeling so ashamed of my red, oozy, painful cysts on my jaw and neck. I repeat treatment at night, after double cleanse (DHC oil and Dermalogica Microfoliant), and gentle toner. I also spot-use Milk Makeup’s Cooling Water for redness or ultra dry spots before again patting on the Honey Balm.Tip: I have to encourage PATTING not rubbing. I did see that rubbing will result in pilling up but gentle pats are perfect. A little goes a long way.When I am wearing foundation I follow the balm with Milk Hydro Primer and my foundation looks soft and flawless. Twice a day, keeps skin beautiful and plump
