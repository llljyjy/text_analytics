I got a sample of this from Sephora, and it was very generous in size, so I had a few uses to judge how it worked for me. The moment I opened it I could smell the lavender, ant it was a bit overpowering. Oils like lavender don’t go anywhere near my face, so this is a no for my face. BUT- a drop of hyaluronic acid and then a touch of this balm, and my hands are so soft and hydrated! I may bite the bullet (it’s a bit pricey for a hand cream) and purchase this anyway! My hands haventlooked this good in years. Lots of lavender...
