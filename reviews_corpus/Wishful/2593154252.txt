First off, one star taken off. Shame on Huda for lying in her videos and saying the pilling effect, is dead skin coming off. It is not. Please understand the ingredients before your spout off non sense. It’s the ingredients in the scrub mixing together and forming a physical exfoliant. Do you really think globs of skin come off your face within the first 10 seconds?! No. other than that false claim, I do like this scrub. It’s a little better than the exfolikate that I usually use! nan
