This is SO similar to the Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream ($70), the smell, the look and feel. I got this as a rewards point sample and they give you a great amount to test with. It drives me crazy when a sample only gives you enough cream for half of your face and Wishful got the memo! I just purchased my Tatcha so when it’s out this is my new replacement. It’s great for super dry sensitive skin like mine. really nice Tatcha dupe $$$
