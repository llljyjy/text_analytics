This is good stuff! I had liked the Wishful Honey Balm moisturizer for nighttime use, so I thought I’d try this one for daytime. I got a sample from Sephora, and sure ’nuff, it’s great. Makes my skin feel smooth but not greasy at all. I use this moisturizer on my “niacinamide days,“ that I alternate with my “vitamin C“ days. There’s a school of thought that says the pH’s of those two don’t play well together.Speaking of wishful, I wish that these two Wishful moisturizers came in smaller-sized jars. It would take me too long to go through these larger sizes, especially with the alternating of days that I do. So I ordered the mini size of this one from Huda. There is no mini size afaik for the Honey Balm. A keeper for me! But would like smaller size.
