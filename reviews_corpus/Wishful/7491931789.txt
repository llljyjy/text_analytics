I absolutely love this product. I had been using the Laneige water mask and the moisture bank… but despite both feeling great after putting it on, it still didn’t absorb fully into the dry patches on my skin. I put this on as a trial and omg, it completely nourished my skin. No dry patches after putting on foundation. Great moisturizer or primer before foundation. No patchy skin. I did NOT like the lavender scent but honestly I don’t care because I loved how it moisturized. Reason for 3 stars, I’m allergic to something in it. My assumption is the lavender because I’ve never had it in any of my skincare products before. I’ve used ole henrikson, inkey list, ordinary, glow, Peter Thomas Roth, etc. none gave me a reaction quite like this. Itchy small bumps… not acne but some short or rash break out. So sad because I love this so much but it’s moisturized skin with a bumpy skin or dry and clear skin…I’ve been using belif for a a couple days, so far it’s good and the hype seems to be living up to its name. But this product still is by far my favorite for a moisturizer - especially before liquid foundation (matte!!). I have neutral skin tone. Freckles. Tan in summer and pale in winter. Sensitive skin, but not extremely sensitive. nan
