I adore this product. There is scent and it is thick, yes. Being a jelly balm though a little goes a long way and it really hydrates your skin SO well. I use this as my nighttime moisturizer during the summer as I live in Florida and need something lighter in the daytime, but the honey and the niacinamide are a dream for your skin. If youâ€™ve ever had acne prone skin or hormonal cystic acne, this moisturizer after a really good exfoliation (or with an acid exfoliate on first) is a holy grail combo. nan
