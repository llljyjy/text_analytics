I’m on the fence with this product.  The texture is like vaseline, which I didn’t like, so it goes on very tacky and stays that way until the next morning when you wash it off.  It doesn’t really sink in but stays on the top of your skin, so be prepared to change your pillowcase the next day.  But I will say my skin was very moisturized the next day and I did notice a difference.  Some red marks from acne were starting to heal too.  The product does what it says it will, you just have to be ok with the texture. Does what it says it will do
