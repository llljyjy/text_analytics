I always like to try new skincare products, and this one I believe is the first sleeping mask from huda I try. It feels like Vaseline in the the texture which makes it a little thick and tacky when put on so I donâ€™t ever use it in the morning hence it is a sleeping mask. It does moisturize the skin but I have tried better in my opinion. Also, a little goes a long way so make sure to use a little so it is not too thick on your skin. I love the ingredients and that it  helps with fine lines & brightening. Overall I like and recommend but I took one star off because I am not a big fan of that type of texture and for the price I think it is a little expensive. On the Fence
