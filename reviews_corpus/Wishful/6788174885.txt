I got a sample of this and almost FORGOT because of how much the sample included. It’s not a one-and-done sample, so great job Wishful! I see mentions of shimmer; this product does not make your face shimmer at all. If anything, it’s just a chill glow. I love how it feels on my skin. Most of my life I had oily skin, until having babies, and now it’s dry but the blackheads on my nose remain. I have noticed this sort of blurring them out and helping my pores appear smaller. There’s a slight tingly sensation (from the niacinamide, I’m sure) but I enjoy when things feel like they’re actually doing something. The honey is great for antimicrobial properties, so if you have blemishes this would be ideal for you. The only thing I would suggest is to scale down on the scent. It’s lavender which is lovely, but it’s SUPER strong. Doesn’t last, though, so it’s only obvious while applying.I’ll be buying the full-size version of this product! The sample did it for me!
