I was gifted Huda Beauty’s advent calendar which contained this item and received another in Ipsy. After 5 times of trying this product, I can confirm that it causes me to breakout. I don’t have especially sensitive skin, although I do use products like tretinoin that can cause it to be more sensitive. I generally can use most products but this each time I used it, caused breakouts. I’m confident it was this product as I was not altering other products I was using and I was breaking out in areas that I never do. I looked at the ingredients list and it contains fragrance which I try to avoid in skincare. It’s a shame because it seemed like a nice formulation otherwise but I’ll be tossing both bottles.
