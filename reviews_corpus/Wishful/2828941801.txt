This product as like putting velvet on your face! I have normal to dry skin with redness concerns and this balm felt so wonderful on my skin. It does smell really, really strongly like lavender (which I’m not a fan of) but the fragrance and seem to irritate my skin at all. Even though I don’t like the smell what the balm does for my skin definitely makes it worth it! nan
