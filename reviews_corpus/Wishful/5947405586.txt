I have oily/normal skin and I’d say this moisturizer gives me the exact moisture I need for my skin! But I do wish there was just a little more moisture! That being said, this might not work if you have really dry skin. Also, there is a scent to it but it doesn’t bother me at all, I like it. And the packaging is meh. I prefer a pump because it feels more sanitary and I see myself picking up too much product sometimes since it’s in a tub. Overall, I’d recommend for those with my skin type and who aren’t sensitive to scents. Works with my combo skin
