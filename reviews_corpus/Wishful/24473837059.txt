I have gotten 3 sample pods of this and that alone has lasted me a month. It is balm so it’s quite thick which is usually a no for me because my I have combo oily skin but my skin actually likes this and I use it morning and night. It does a have a strong herbal lavender smell, I love lavender so that’s fine with me…makes me feel like I’m in a spa… but if you hate lavender I’d steer clear of this. Surprisingly amazing!
