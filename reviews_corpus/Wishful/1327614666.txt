I have super sensitive skin under my eyes and more often than not eye creams end up looking much worse than without -- but this one has been working really well for me. I like the applicator. You click the bottom and the perfect amount comes out for each eye. I like the cooling sensation and that the applicator glides over the eyes so less needing to tap around. It comes with one extra cartridge to add. Feeling very confident about this purchase -- just don’t know long term if it’s really doing anything -- but I do feel like my undereye area is very moisturized but also haven’t tried with concealer just yet. So far so good.
