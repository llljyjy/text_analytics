Received this as a sample and I didn’t like it. it’s so greasy and feels like Vaseline. It feels cheap to me. It just sit on the skin and give you an oily look. Moreover, it seems like they had mica or some sort of fine  glitters in it. I don’t like the strong lavender fragrance either. keep your money. nan
