I received a sample of this in my most recent order. I really like the texture of this moisturizer, and I don’t mind the iridescence, but my god I cannot get over the smell. Lavender is one of my favorite scents but this is so strongly scented it felt like I was putting lavender scented body cream all over my face! Thankfully I didn’t wake up with any irritation but I wouldn’t purchase this. Huda loves having aggressive fragrance in her products and unfortunately this moisturizer is no exception. We don’t need strong fragrance in skincare! Heavily Fragranced
