I used the St. Tropez whipped crème mousse for the first time and I was actually surprised at how easy it was to apply it with the velvet mitt. It smelled really good too! Like fruity but not overbearing. I really liked the consistency of the mousse too. It melted into my skin and didn’t make me feel sticky as the day went on. I turned a nice golden color after it developed which I am super happy about! Nice Glow!!
