The Luxe Tan Tonic Glow Drops - use all of the good supercharged skincare components to enhance your skin from within! Niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, Echinacea, Vitamin C&E, and detoxifying flower extract are 5 highlighted ingredients included in this product. This is a product that allows you to customize your glow. For a light glow, apply 1-2 drops on dry face; for a medium glow, apply 3-5 drops; and add extra drops if you want a more deep bronze. It’s simple to utilize, especially since you may use it alone or mix it with your moisturizer. I’m excited to see how it performs after weeks of use. nan
