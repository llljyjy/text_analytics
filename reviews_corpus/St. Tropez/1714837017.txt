Omgggggg. I have had this in my cart for a while and decided on a whim to go out yesterday. Well… I bought this in person lol and I have no regrets. After showering and using the Necessaire Body Serum I used this kit with the mitt, and while the color is very light, I am super fair so it worked for me. I don’t stink like self tan, I have no streaks. I just wish the color was a little darker and a little more ashy. Overall, super pleased! (And to note, I am in Texas, it was 103 yesterday, and I did not sweat it off) This would be a great first time tanning experience for someone who is more fair or afraid of a bad experience and I’m considering buying a few more as gifts for my sisters, who, like me, shrivel at the idea of sunlight. For the size, I will probably get three or so body uses, but for the face, this mini might last me all summer. Next up is the vitamin enriched version! new to self tan fair skin hg find?
