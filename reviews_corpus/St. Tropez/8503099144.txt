I honestly really liked this product! I have been an avid self-tanner for a while now so I can be really picky in what products I use. I feel like I have tried almost every brand and I really liked the results from St Tropez. I didn’t feel too sticky after the application. It was also easy to apply. I washed it off after I woke up and it wasn’t blotchy at all. Definitely worth it! Loved it!
