I really enjoyed this product and look forward to using it more. The glow drops smell really lovely. It’s hard to tell if it applies evenly so I would recommend adding the drops to a lotion when using it. I’m still getting use to evenly applying since I’m a skin tan newbie but one drop doesn’t have much of an impact and is low risk when applying. The glow drops are natural and look great so I’m excited to keep using it. Good for beginners
