i have used st tropez tanning products in the past. this one was a super let down. i had read in other reviews that this lotion didn’t smell too great. they all were correct. at first, the product smells fine. but as your tan develops…so does the smell. in addition, with this being a lotion texture, i found it hard to ensure it was even. it did leave a tan. so it wasn’t completely hopeless…just smelly and uneven. disappointing.
