I usually don’t like sunless tanners because they have a tendency to streak or be stinky. This was so much better than I expected! It didn’t streak, goes on bronze so you can see where you may have missed spots, and it doesn’t have that weird chemical smell that lingers forever. I’m pretty pale, and this didn’t look unnatural or orange. A great tanner! Smooth and Streak-Free
