First of I like how this self tan uses drops so itâ€™s easy to just mix with your lotion. I used about 6 drops but you can use less or more depends on how dark you want it to be which is very customizable. When applying it was super easy just make sure you exfoliate before. So I would put it on before bed and wake up to a nice tan. My skin tone definitely went up one shade and loved it since it was very natural since it just looked like I got a nice tan. Natural Tan
