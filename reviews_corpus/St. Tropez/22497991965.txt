Absolutely loved using this self tanner! It gave me a natural sun kissed glow and will be a beauty staple in my summer skin care routine! I noticed a very small pimple pop up on my cheek (which is very uncommon for me) after I used this product but I would use it again because it doesnâ€™t make me break out as much as other self tanners do. I actually really enjoyed using this self tanner and love how well it looks under makeup! Sun Kissed Glow Perfect for the Summer!
