I prefer this over other gradual tanners because you can actually see results pretty much right away.  At the same time, I love building my color, so love a gradual tanning product.  This smells like summer with its watermelon sent and is very hydrating.  Not noticing much of a difference when it comes to the firming aspect, but that’s probably not what I’d purchase this for. Great self tanner
