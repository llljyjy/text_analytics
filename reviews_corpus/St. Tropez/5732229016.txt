Got this product as a gift. We must say we loved it. I would recommend to friends. Application of the product was easy. Just add a few drops to moisturizer and bam! 8 hours later and there was a hint of glow and the color of my ski was slightly darker. It did not leave my appearance greasy, nor did it make me break out the next day. Wonderful product
