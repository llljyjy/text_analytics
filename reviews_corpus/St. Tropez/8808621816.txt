This is the first self tanner drops I’ve used and I love it! The smell is great, nothing too strong and it goes on very smoothly. I recommend mixing it in with your moisturizer for it to come out more even. The only thing I noticed is it could irritate you if you have sensitive, dry skin. I have combination and recently I’ve been more dry so it did irritate certain areas of my face. When I mixed it in with my moisturizer, it was fine! Overall, it’s a great product and the glow is amazing. Great glow
