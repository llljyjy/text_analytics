I understand the negative reviews. The tanner does go green when first applied. This is my opinion, my experience. I put this on with the mitt before bed. I let it dry for about 15-20 minutes first. The color/green washes off when I shower in the morning. It leaves a beautiful subtle tan for my pale skin. Very subtle and that is the reason why I like this and it stays. I knocked a star off because the texture can be messy-gel like. But I do not recommend this tanner if you want to apply it and then go about your day. You will be green. Different opinion
