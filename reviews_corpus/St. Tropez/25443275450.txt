This watermelon tan lotion is yes for me as its gives hydration plus natural glow to my skin. I really like its pleasant fragrance which is much alike watermelon. The tan is just accurate to my medium skin tone. The consistency of texture is not too thick not too thin just need little bit of time to gets absorb into skin but gets absorbed nicely. Its so useful during this winter season. nan
