To start, I want to say that I should have used more drops than I did. I’ve used a similar product by a different brand for a couple of years now and that one is pretty finicky, so I was careful not to overdue it. What I’d say about the St.Tropez Self Tan Luxe Tan Tonic Glow Drops is that you can use more drops and not worry. As you can see in the photos, there really wasn’t much change from the night before and the next morning (both after I had just washed my face). In fact, the first photo even looks like I might be tanner (but I blame the lighting, which I tried to mirror for both). I do see a small glow this morning, but I am going to work on upping the number of drops I use next time.The smell is not overly “self tanner,“ if that makes sense. It’s pretty pleasant, in fact, and I didn’t mind it. I also appreciated that the palms of my hand were not tanned at all, showing it’s easy to remove after applying by washing your hands. That’s a perk. nan
