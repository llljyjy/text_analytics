Being a self tanning newbie, these drops were so easy to apply. My white pasty skin was glowing in no time. It does have a strong perfume so keep that in mind if you are sensitive to fragrance. These drop were not sticky and soaked really quickly. While you can apply this directly to your skin, I recommend adding it to you lotion to achieve and even glow. nan
