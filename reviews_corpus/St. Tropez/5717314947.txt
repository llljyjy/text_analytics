I’ve been searching for a tanner that not only made my skin feel soft but also stayed on past 3 to 4 hours. The first time I tried St. Tropez tanner I was hooked! I loved how it’s easy to apply and that it made my skin feel so good. It lasted all day long which was another huge plus! I will definitely be buying more. Great Tanner
