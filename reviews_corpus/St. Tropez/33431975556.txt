Self Tanner newbie here! I am so glad my first self-tanning experience was with the St. Tropez luxe whipped creme mousse. It was easy to apply, and the mitt makes the application streak-free which was perfect for me as I didn’t know what to expect. Upon application, there is a slightly tropical scent, and it leaves a gorgeous natural tan on the skin. I’m a fan! Summer essential
