I received this product free from @Influenster and @Sttropeztan in exchange for my honest review. This product has a really nice aroma but after 30 ish minutes of it sitting on you it does begin to have a slight smell of fake tanner. It has a light and soft feeling texture.  The color is gradual and goes from not so bright or tan right away but the color showed up slowly after multiple uses. I would definitely purchase this product again. #complimentary #sttropezgradualglow #sttropeztan @Influenster @sttropeztan Hydrating and nice finish
