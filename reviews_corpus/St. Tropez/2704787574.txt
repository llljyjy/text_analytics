The perfect way to get that summer tan without the harmful UV rays. I have been using this St. Tropes Self Tan for a couple weeks now and am happy with the results. I simply add 4-6 drops to my favorite moisturizer, and apply it to my skin. After a few hours my skin has a healthy looking tan without the sun. Tip - Add it to a shimmer lotion to get a shimmery glow! Definitely recommend checking this out. Note - I did receive this product for free in exchange for an honest review.
