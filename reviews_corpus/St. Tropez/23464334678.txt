I received this product as a complimentary package from influenster. I’ve never use/applied tanning lotions before, so this review is from my very first experience with it. I have kind of dark skin so I made sure to do some research before applying it and I used gloves. I used it on my legs and made sure to cover every single spot so there wouldn’t be any patches. Honestly I loved the results, I didn’t over do it, so my legs had a nice and light bronze, and a plus, the lotion has a great smell. Great tanning lotion!☀️
