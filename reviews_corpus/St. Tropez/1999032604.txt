I received this for free in exchange for my honest review I have seriously sensitive skin and have to be cautious when using new products. I’ve only used this twice so far and haven’t had a reaction yet. I’m starting to get a nice fall glow too! The scent is OK, but like other sunless tanners, has that odd scent when it starts working. I think I like it!
