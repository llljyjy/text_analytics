I’ve been using this product now for a couple weeks and although I do enjoy the smell and the dry down I’m not a fan on the splotches it creates. I’ve used self tanner on my body before and don’t have issues so I expected a more even application with a hydrating lotion but was disappointed in this. I would not recommend. nan
