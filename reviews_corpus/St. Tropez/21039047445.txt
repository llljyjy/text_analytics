This is an easy to use product, it like that it gives me a subtle glowy tan when I mix it with my moisturizer.  I also could go deeper using it by itself, but I am naturally tan and it works better for me this way.  I also liked that it is not messy at all and it does not leave my skin greasy or with any uncomfortable feeling to the touch. nan
