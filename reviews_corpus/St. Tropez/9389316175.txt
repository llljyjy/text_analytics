I received  the st tropez Luxe Tan Tonic Glow Drops for my honest opinion. . This is a big tan in a small bottle. I use two drops and mix it into my current body lotion to get my desired color. A little goes a long way I found sometimes I just one drop. I love how my skin looks and feels after application. A gradual glow over a few hours and doesnâ€™t leave skin sticky. My skin is very soft and my lines are filled in which is perfectly masked and blends so smoothly and their is no streaks after use everything is evenly placed The best tanning drops
