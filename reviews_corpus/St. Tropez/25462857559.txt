I am very pleased with this self tanning drops. The fact that you can control how deep your tan and glow will looks is quite nice and easy too. So I have been using it alone without mixing it with a lotion or moisturizer as I noticed the color doesn’t look as dark as expected or as if you use it along. As the weather gets nicer and more sunnier, for some reason my body gets darker than my face so these drops have been my go to , to kind of making my face almost as far as my body and so far I’ve liked it. It doesn’t have a smell and it dries out super quick too. Also it is not sticky and is light weight. Remember that you wouldn’t see the shade difference until about 8 hours later. So far it’s been good to have. I like it
