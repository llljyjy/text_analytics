Not only is this my first time trying St. Tropez but also my first time trying any sort of “self tanner.” I’ve heard and seen horror stories of orange looking women who used self tanners before but I didn’t have to worry about that with St. Tropez. If anything, it was faint and barely noticeable. I don’t really have a problem with that but other people might.  I love that there’s hyaluronic acid in it and that it has skin benefits beyond just self tanner It’s okay
