This reminds me of a certain popular drug store brand gradual tanner I used 10-15 years ago which I loved but was discontinued…. The smell is even the same! The formulation is light which I love for summer and it’s pretty fool proof.  I’m really happy I decided to try. Deducted one star bc the price point is a little high for what it does but overall it’s a good product nan
