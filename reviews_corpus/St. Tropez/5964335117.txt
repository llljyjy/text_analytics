Great for a gradual tan! I used these on my face in combination with my face lotion and was actually surprised at how gradual the build was in comparison to other products from St. Tropez. I used four big drops with my lotion and it just gave me an even warm glow that lasted 2ish days. It has a great smell too and didnâ€™t seem to dry my skin out like other self tanners.
