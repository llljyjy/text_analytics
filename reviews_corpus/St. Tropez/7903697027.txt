I actually really liked this! I was nervous because I’ve never used a self tanning product before but I found this straightforward and I was happy with the results. I mixed a few drops in with my moisturizer because you can either do that or just put some drops directly on your face but I chose the prior. I found the results super natural and I liked the subtle color, I didn’t feel like there was a difference in the feeling of my skin, which I’m fine with because I just didn’t want anything to break out my skin as I’m acne prone. So overall this is a yes for me!! Easy to use
