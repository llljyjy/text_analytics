I loved this tan oil absolutely very easy to wear it. I have mixed couple of drops with my moisturizer and body lotion and add couple more drops when I am applying my facial moisturizer and body lotion. This gives a subtle yet healthy tan to my skin; do not even look like a tan. I am white light now I look like I have some blood on me. Loving it. Super easy tanning product
