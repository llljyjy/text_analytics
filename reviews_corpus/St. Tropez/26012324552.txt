This may be my new favorite self tanner! I mixed a few drops in with my lotion, and it turned out so good. I like how you can customize how dark you get by adding more or less drops. The tan turned out golden rather an orange, so it looked very natural. No weird smell like other self tanners and it didnâ€™t rub off on my clothes. Highly recommend! New favorite!
