I was excited to receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review and I’m glad I did. I enjoyed the watermelon scent. It went on smoothly and absorbed quickly. The tan developed gradually and was even through my skin. The watermelon scent did fade and the tanning smell popped up a little but not as bad as other products I have tried. Definitely worth trying and will continue using it during the months I don’t see the sun! Must try!
