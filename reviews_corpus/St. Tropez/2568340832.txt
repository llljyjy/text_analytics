As a pale, skin professional,  living in Miami these are a godsend. I love that thereâ€™s actual skincare ingredients. C and e for smoothness and brightening. Cherry for plumping. Niacinamide, echinacea  and hyaluronic for hydration which is major considering most tanners dry your skin out. Great color. Very impressed nan
