This product smells so good omg. I love the texture, it feels very light on probably because it’s more of a gel consistency so isn’t super heavy. It hasn’t made me break out at all and I have sensitive skin so that’s a huge plus. It has definitely been clearing up my acne scars quicker than usual too! nan
