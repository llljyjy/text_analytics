I was at first hesitant to try on my face so I decided to test it on my wrist where I have a tan line from my watch, I mixed the drops with lotion. After 8 hours I did notice a slight difference in the color. I will continue to use and build to match. Since it is not intense I will be using it on my face. It does come in a nice glass bottle with a dropper. It does have a strong scent but it wasnâ€™t unpleasant. I like that this is buildable and does not leave streaks or look orange. Great for self tanner novices like myself!
