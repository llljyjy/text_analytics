The application of these drops are so easy! I find it much easier than a foam and mitt application. The drops easily distribute across my body when mixed with a body lotion. I prefer using an unscented lotion since these drops already are fragranced. The  drops made my skin look even and gave  a glowy golden color. No issues with streaking, however I would suggest being careful when applying between fingers. My skin was soft and not dried out after using. I also shaved prior to assure no streaks left behind. Over all I really enjoy these drops when wanting an extra golden glow. The drops developed fully after 8 hours and color lasted a few days without exfoliation. My face didn’t have any issues with breaking out after and didn’t feel sticky after use. It felt soft and plump. Gradual nice glowy tan! Not drying or irritating.
