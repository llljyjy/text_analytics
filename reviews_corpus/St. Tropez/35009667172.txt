I love this product. The reason for the product was to even put my skin tone and I’m not disappointed. However I wished I had a few tips beforehand. When I received the product,  I went a little overboard and the next morning I looked like a Oompa Loompa. So ladies, easy on the sprays!! Before bed I put my black tank top and spray over my face and neckline so it looks natural.  As for the smell, it does smell like self tanner and citrus but I don’t mind it. Overall I’m satisfied. Great product
