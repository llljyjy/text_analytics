This is St. Tropez Self Tan Luxe Tan Tonic Drops @sttropeztanSt. Tropez says that it provides all day hydration, is suitable for all skin types, non-comedogenic, 100% vegan and cruelty free, and has natural tanning actives. It smooths fine lines, reduces redness, and gives a natural glow.  Using St. Tropez Tan helps maintain my tan during the cold weather. My skin was definitely smooth and hydrated all day. I didn’t have a problem with my knees or elbows because I didn’t apply enough there. I only used 3 drops to give a subtle glow. I also didn’t apply this to my face because I’m very particular about what input on my face even though this shouldn’t clog your pores. Don’t forget to wash your hands and SPF because this doesn’t have it. Must have fake bake
