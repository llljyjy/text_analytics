This product leaves a nice glow, but it does transfer and it has glitter. It says there is no need to rinse, but when I went to take a bath at the end of the day, my tub water turned brown and the tint came off. It left a subtle tan which looks great, but keep in mind it should be used more like a self tanner and not a moisturizer and may transfer to clothes and furniture. Great glow but transfers color
