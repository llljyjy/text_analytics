I initially tried this glow just on one leg, by itself with 4 drops. I wanted to see the difference with my other leg. I didn’t see much of a difference. So I decided to try it again but use more drops. I used about 6-7 and this time I mixed it with my moisturizer. I think this was better. Same day after about 5 hours I saw the difference. I had a bit of more tan, and since I used it with a moisturizer it was a glowy tan. If you don’t see a difference the first time just give it another chance and it’ll work! Love how I didn’t have to use too much of the bottle to see a difference! It also doesn’t have a weird chemical smell. For reference I’m already a tan person and this still added another level of tan on my olive skin. :) Glowy tan
