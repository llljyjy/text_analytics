Seriously it does work but do not expect you will get tanned overnight. I have super pale skin, and I started out with 5 drops mixed with my moisturizer and i didn’t see the different much, the next day I mixed 7 drops and I started to notice a little difference. It didn’t turn my face orange or break me out. And I love how it didn’t transfer to my clothes too. It gradually build!!!
