So what I did is a exfoliated my legs . Shaved them and use my favorite moisturizer and used 3 drops only because it was my first time using it .  It was super easy to use.  Itâ€™s not sticky and no transfer. I liked it cause it gane me a nice glow I would love to add more next time and use more drops.  It came out even. Definitely recommend it. Buy it
