Not a fan. I received this item for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I’ve never used tanning lotions before and it’s not something I’d normally buy. I’m fine with the way my skin is. I tried this item for the sake of putting in an honest review. It turned my skin Orange the next day. I accidentally got some in my arm without realizing it and now I have a terrible splotch that’s stuck. Not sure how long it’ll take before it goes away. nan
