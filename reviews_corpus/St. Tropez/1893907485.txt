I’ve tried a ton of different self tanners from creams to oils and even having it sprayed professionally. This mousse is incredible! The application with the mitt is completely streak free…even in areas I tried to even out from summer tam lines. It dries quickly and you can build the tan. The color is natural and I would pick this over everything I’ve tried before. Best Self-Tanner
