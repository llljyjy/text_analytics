I’ve tried a million different self tanning lotions ( due to my legs always being Casper) and nothing has ever worked as well as this. I had noticable results the very next morning! The watermelon smell is just awesome and no bad odor afterwards. This lotion left my skin so moisturized and soft, I couldn’t believe it. As for the tightening I’m not really sure if it’s working or not. Overall I’d say this is a lotion that is a must have. Highly recommended. nan
