I am very disappointed with this product. Especially considering the price. Transferred onto EVERYTHING. Felt sticky after application. Spreads horribly when applying. After application I looked SUPER dark with the tint they have in the product. However, after leaving it on overnight and much longer than 8 hrs…there was barely any tab on my skin. I wanted to believe that I didn’t apply it right the first time I used the product. I reallyWanted to believe that. Especially because it’s so expensive. So, this is my final verdict after several tries with this self tanner: don’t waste your money. Just don’t. I’m sorry to say but this product is underwhelming and way overpriced. I picked up a few cans of self tanner on clearance at Walmart a few months back and they work better than this one. I’ve been using sunless tanners for like a very long time. Very long. So I’m not new to the scene and I know all about exfoliating and proper application techniques so this review is not coming from a novice. Really I’m just so annoyed with the poor quality of this item and I’m trying to save you some money and frustration. Overpriced. Bad results. Don’t bother.
