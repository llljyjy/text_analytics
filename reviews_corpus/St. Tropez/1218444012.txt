This tanning mousse smells fantastic. It smells tropical and reminds me of being on vacation. I also really like how it made my skin feel nice and moisturized. This tanner looks natural on me and Iâ€™m on the pale side.  Application is really easy too. I left it on for 8 hours and was pleased with the results. natural glow
