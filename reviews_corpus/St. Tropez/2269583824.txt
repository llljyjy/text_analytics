I always gravitate towards St. Tropez as a brand due to the shade of tan that their products have. I have light olive toned skin, and most self tanning brands give me a tan with orange undertone that looks very unnatural. St. Tropez products always give a tan with a neutral brown undertone that makes my skin look naturally sun kissedâ€”this product was no different. This is the only product that I trust to use on my face. The application is easy and customizable, I mixed 6 drops of the tanner in with a serum and applied it to my face, then I washed my hands afterwords. The whole process took about 1 min and you can tailor the intensity of the tan by adding more or less drops. The formula felt hydrating and was not sticky whatsoever. After 4-6 hours the tan looked like a natural bronze glow, I absolutely love it!!! Best Natural Color Self Tanner
