I live in south Florida, have little to no melanin, and I go through a LOT of self tanner. This is one of the good ones. Color is VERY natural with no orange. I didn’t get any streaks at all. I made sure to follow ALL the directions (which are hard to read on the bottle). I’d say it’s a light-medium tone on me which is exactly what I wanted. And best of all, no self tanner smell. I still like the express BETTER, but this is good too works if you apply it properly
