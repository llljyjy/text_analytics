I’ have been loving the St. Tropez Self-Tan Luxe Whipped Crème Mousse. It goes on so smooth and silky. It has a color guard which is amazing for a seamless application. It will transfer onto your sheets if you apply before bed. I recommend applying in the am to wash off before bed. It smells amazing too! So good!
