While trying out the self tanner the first thing I notice was the scent. For me it’s a floral/cherry scent to it. I am a person that is not a huge fan of strong coconut scents and I am happy this doesn’t have it. The first time I did a test patch on my leg and I also didn’t put a moisturizer to see what would happen and it still worked but it was less noticeable. The next time I used moisturizer with two drops of the tonic and mix it together, and the next day I saw results. I messed up, by having a darker line on my ankle, but this is my first time using a tanner.I know some people want a darker tan look but I think this product is on the more subtle side, but for me I like it that way. This is also better than going out in the sun, you giving uv damage to your skin. Easy to use
