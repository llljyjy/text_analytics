My first impression of this product was it smells so nice, none of that nasty smelling tanner. The formula is nice and thick and it blended out so nice with and without the mitt. The process was fast and easy..However once I finished this wouldn’t dry down. I put clothes on and it was just staining everything!! I didn’t have 8 hours to waste and hope I didn’t stain everything. I had no choice but to wash it off and it stained my shower :( Doesn’t dry! stains everything
