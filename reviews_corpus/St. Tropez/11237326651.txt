This tan is a 10/10!!! I’m a tanning newbie so I was worried about it being splotchy but because there’s a true color you know where it’s been applied and where it hasn’t been. It doesn’t smell terrible like some other tans and after rinsing it off once I slept in it the tan looks fantastic! Summer here I come!
