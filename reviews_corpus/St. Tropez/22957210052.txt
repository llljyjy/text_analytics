Only gradual tan lotion that looks natural. It gives great color with just one use.  I like the watermelon fragrance, smells like summer! Applies really easy, like a regular body lotion . The tan develops quickly, in an hour or two. Not sticky. Doesn’t leave stains on clothes. I don’t think that it’s a great idea to use it on daily basis, but if you need a stunning summer body for a special occasion— it’s my good to go. Natural and easy
