The St. Tropez Self Tan Luxe Tan Tonic Glow Drops works great. I’m able to achieve just the right amount of glow to my skin.  The dropper works fine at dispensing the perfect drop each time. The drops are pleasant to the smell.  My skin feels moist, not dry or sticky after use. I use it on my face and my body. I’m pleased with the results and will continue to use this tonic glow drops for self tanning going forward. Very Nice Tonic Glow Drops!
