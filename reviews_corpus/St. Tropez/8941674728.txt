I have been starting to use self tanners more in the past couple years but I’ve never tried this mousse method. I like how easy it was even for a first timer, and it was not messy at all.The mitt was very nice and it distributes the product evenly. It doesn’t have a strong scent (it actually smells good) and I just left it on for about 8 hours and then rinsed it.I recommend exfoliating before for an even smoother application.I get a beautiful golden bronze tone that looks even better than a natural sun tan (and way safer)The color lasts about a week on me and it fades evenly. Highly recommend, especially for an special event. great mousse tanner
