I am super duper pale and this gave me a beautiful natural glow! The first time I used it on its own and it applied nicely leaving no streaks and I have also tried mixing with a lotion and applying. Both methods worked really well. I recommend applying at least twice to see a noticeable difference. Love the natural tan I have now and definitely will keep using! Beautiful glow!
