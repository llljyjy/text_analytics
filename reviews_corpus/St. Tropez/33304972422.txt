I’m absolutely OBSESSED with these tanning drops!! Gives my skin the most beautiful natural glow! I use around 4, 5 drops mixed with my moisturizer every 2 days or so. Doesn’t dry my skin out, it actually makes it so soft. Doesn’t stain either and I like that I don’t have to wash it off. It’s def a must! Love it!
