I have been using St Tropez as my self tanner for quite a few years now. I love their streak-free formula, and it never looks orange on my pale skin. I am really loving the Luxe Whipped Mousse. It goes on very evenly and the resulting color is stunning! I think this is my new favorite St Tropez tanner! St. Tropez gifted me this self tanner, all opinions are my own. I truly love St Tropez products, and this one is no exception! Fantastic Color
