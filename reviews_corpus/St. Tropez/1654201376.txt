Not really sure why they sent me this product as I’m already naturally tan lol. So it was difficult to see if it actually caused me to get more tan (which I didn’t want anyway), therefore I cannot comment on that aspect (though I do like that it’s supposed to be more natural looking and not one of those super orange and super obvious instant tans). However, I will comment on the other properties of the lotion. The texture is on the lighter side and it absorbs easily into the skin without leaving an oily or sticky residue. I’d say the amount of hydration it provides is light to medium. I like that this product looks, feels, and applies like a regular lotion and isn’t dark in color so you don’t have to worry about staining (hands, clothes, etc). or obvious uneven application. It’s nice that it doesn’t require any special application methods or tools. This makes it so easy to apply. As for the watermelon scent, I found it to be quite artificial smelling. It was very reminiscent of those cheap body sprays that were popular amongst middle schoolers in the early 2000s. I did not like it at all. It didn’t smell bad per se, but it just wasn’t something that I would want to smell like or something that I would want to smell on someone else for that matter. Other than that, this appears to be a nice product for those that want a natural, gradual tanning product that is easy to apply. Not a huge fan of the scent
