This product isnâ€™t sticky and goes on smoothly, making it easy to get an even application. I like to use this to even out my skin tone (my chest is usually lighter than the rest of me). I use 4 drops mixed into my moisturizer for a more subtle result and 4 drops applied directly to my skin to get a more noticeable tan. nan
