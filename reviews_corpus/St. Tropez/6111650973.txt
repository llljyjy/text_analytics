I have seen the black girl tanning trend going around on TikTok and was happy to try this product! I went to the beach the other day and got some very strong tan lines so I have been using this serum on my body to even put the tan! I will say that it took a few uses for it to even it out. I would say 3-4 on dark skin and I just mixed it in with my lotion. It also left a really nice glow on the rest of my body! So far so good! nan
