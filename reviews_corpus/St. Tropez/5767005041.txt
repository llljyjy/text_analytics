i love this product!! this is not a very intense tanning product, it’s going to give you more of a subtle glow, but that’s perfect for me in the winter. i’ve mainly been mixing this into my body lotion, and i love the healthy glow it gives. the best part is that these truly don’t smell at all! i’ve never found a sel tan product that had no smell! i love that i can apply these in the morning and be tanning all day without feeling sticky or smelly. the only downside is that i’m going through the product very quickly by using it on my body, i would love if they made a jumbo bottle! love this for a natural glow
