Another great St. Tropez product. I have been using self tanner for the past 10 years and if you know, you know it’s trial and error. This product is mousse-based and it’s really easy to apply with a glove. I also tried it with a brush to buffer out the product on my skin and that helped even it out. It left me smelling nice and my skin was not tacky for too long. It’s definitely intense after your first application, but after your initial shower, it gives you a nice summery tan. I’ll definitely be using this for my weekly self tan sessions this summer. Love the mousse
