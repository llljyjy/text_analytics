Bronze and glowy! I typically get a spray tan or a tanning mouse, but this changed the game for me! I’ve been using this mixed into my moisturizer and it has been the easiest tan I’ve ever had. It isn’t splotchy and it blended so nicely. Have no complaints. It also does not have a weird smell to any transfer of color. Absolutely obsessed! Glowy goddess
