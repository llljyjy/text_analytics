These drops are so much easier to use than my previous self tanner! I just mix it in with the serums I already use and apply as normal. It produces a great, even summer glow without a sticky finish. Iâ€™ve learned to blend it around my hairline to avoid a line around my face but overall, I love it! Super convenient and effective
