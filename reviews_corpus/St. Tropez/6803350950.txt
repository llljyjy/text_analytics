These drops were pretty easy to use, it definitely gave a natural glow to the skin which hi estoy I prefer over a dramatic tan. I liked mixing this with my moisturizer and it really was a streak free application. The smell of it is nice too, no strong fake tan scent.  I will say this product is not for you if youâ€™re looking for a deep tanning product! nan
