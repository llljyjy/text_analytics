I actually enjoyed this product a lot. It’s definitely a subtle glow, which I like because I find that even the best fake tans make me look orange, no matter how well I apply them. This is absolutely not orange… but it’s very subtle. I mix it with my moisturizer and have to use several times a week to see a difference. But it works! nan
