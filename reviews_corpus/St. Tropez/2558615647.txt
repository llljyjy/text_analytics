I saw this product at Sephora and it caught my attention. I stop using tanning oils long time ago because I heard it is bad for my skin. Instrad I have been using self tanning creams and spray. I have the same results without the damage on my skin.  This products works perfect and I get the results immediately. It is super easy to use and I love the way it smells AMAZING! Truly recommend it! Totalky worth the hype
