I love a nice warm glow and these drops by St. Tropez are amazing for achieving that look. It is so easy to apply and doesnâ€™t make you look weird after it sets. It feels nice on the skin, which is a huge plus because I have super sensitive skin due to rosacea. These are perfect to get a nice bronzed glowy look during the holidays. Nice glow and easy to apply
