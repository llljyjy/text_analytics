These tanning drops are so much better than others I’ve tried! I love that it doesn’t have a sticky, tacky texture—it feels really comfortable on the skin. The color was noticable, but very natural and didn’t have an orange tone. I love that these can be mixed with skincare that I already use, it’s so convenient! nan
