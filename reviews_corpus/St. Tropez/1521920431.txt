I love the look of tanned sunkissed skin without the sun damage so this product is perfect! It’s very easy to apply, you can mix a couple drops with your moisturizer to add a subtle glow to your face. It blends well and doesn’t leave any streaks on your face. There’s a light subtle scene that isn’t over powering. Overall a great product to use! nan
