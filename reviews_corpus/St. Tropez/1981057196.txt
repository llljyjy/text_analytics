I have used 3x so far and am really impressed and wish I would have known about tanning drops sooner! i mix 2-3 drops into a creamy face moisturizer and apply to my face and neck and I really used my fingers to blend in product around edges of face, ears, and down neck into chest area. The next morning I could tell my face was a bit more tan and it was even- no streaks. My first time trying I did however get some tanner streaks on edges of hands, so now i just make sure to massage my hands with product before scrubbing hands after applying. easy to use on face for overnight glow
