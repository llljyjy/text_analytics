I use self tanner all year round. I usually use the St. Tropez foam, so I was excited to try another tanning product by them. This was a white lotion that had hylauronic acid that was suppose toProvide moisture and firmness to the skin while giving you a gradual tan. I usually tend to stay away from tanning lotions that are colorless because I feel like it is harder to apply and can cause more streaks. I was actually pleasantly surprised by this. I applied this a couple nights in a row with my hands. I woke up streak free and with a light golden tan color to my skin.  If you are looking for instant color this isn’t it. It definitely took a few applications to get a true summer glow to the skin, but I actually think I like that better for winter. In the winter, I don’t want a super dark tan which is what the foam and sun usually provide in the summer months. I just want a touch of color so I don’t look pasty,  while still looking natural and this is exactly what it provided. I have very dry skin in the winter so it’s definitely a bonus that it’s moisturizing while providing color. I can not  really say if it’s firming or not, but maybe over time i will see those results. This has a watermelon smell. It’s a fake watermelon smell , but it’s not overwhelming and I didn’t mind it. I would say if your a self tanner beginner or just looking for a little color in the colder months you should give this a try. I will continue to use throughout the winter. Will continue to use
