Ok honestly, I never tried any type of self tanner before. I thought this eas interesting since it was a tanner and firming lotion. That being so, I thought the formula would be a bit thicker, it’s super watery. The smell well I can’t lie it does smell like watermelon. I was surprised how instant my legs started to tan, you have to apply this evenly. I wasn’t sure on what color is would be turning and being a pale person. I turned orange. I'm an orange
