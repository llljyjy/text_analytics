Absolutely love how customizable this is! I am quite pale and tanning products have always left my skin looking unnatural and orange. Because you can so easily control the intensity by adding less drops I have finally achieved a very light tan glow. I mixed it in with my moisturizer and honestly forgot, hours later I look in the mirror and at first I couldnâ€™t put my finger on it, and then I realized why I look so fresh! Great product, easy to use, natural results! Easy Natural Tan
