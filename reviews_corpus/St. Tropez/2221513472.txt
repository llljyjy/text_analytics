This was my first time using a self tanner.  Not to mention this was in serum from.  I used it directly on my skin and it left my skin feeling nice and smooth however a little sticky. Using it with my moisturizer I found it was less effective or it took more product. My skin tone is evened out and it looks nice and natural Pretty good
