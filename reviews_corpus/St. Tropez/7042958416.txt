I have been using these tan drops for a few weeks and I have fallen in love! It leaves my skin hydrated and plump while delivering a beautiful sun kissed glow. I mix 3 drops in with my moisturizer at the end of my skincare routine. There is a slight scent to it, but nothing too crazy. The developed color is a natural olive end result. Will be recommending to my friends! Love!
