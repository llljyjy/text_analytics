I have always been a huge San Tropez fan so when I had the opportunity to try a new mouse I was so excited. A little mouse goes a long way, I like that the formula goes on tan so you can see if you missed any spots. Easy to apply and made my skin feel so soft after. I slept with the tan on before rinsing in the morning and it didn’t come off on my sheets…win!! I love how natural the tan looks and how even it went on my skin. Highly recommend! Only con is the initial application smells. nan
