I love how this product is a self tanner mixed with skincare ingredients. I mixed 4 drops with my moisturizer and by the end of the day my skin looked tanner with a healthy glow. I like how you can tan the face alone or mix with moisturizer depending on how deep of a tan you want to achieve. My skin looks and feels great. No irritation to my sensitive skin and it didnâ€™t feel greasy or heavy on the skin. I think this looks a lot more natural to tan my face with than using my regular self tanner I tan my body with. I will continue to use this product. nan
