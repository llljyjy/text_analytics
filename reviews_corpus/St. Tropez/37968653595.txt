This is a very interesting product. I like the ingredients it has. The niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin E make it very hydrating. I use about 2 drops and it is enough for my face. It gives me a nice glow and it is pretty long lasting. The more drops you use, the more tan it gets. Very easy to adjust depending on your need. nan
