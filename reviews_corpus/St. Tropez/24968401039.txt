I used this product immediately upon opening the box. It has a nice smell. The color - especially if you have very light skin - this will definitely bronze you in a very dramatic manner. When you put the  mousse on, you want to immediately rub it in. You donâ€™t want to let it sit, it will stain your skin in that area. The mit is kind of cheap feeling, but it gets the job done. I am curious to see how many uses this gets! Nice product!
