This tanning product is everything! I’ve tried a few that didn’t really work for me. But this one was a winner! It stuck pretty well and is a beautiful shade with literally no fake tan orange coloring! So that’s a huge win. It is a little sticky feeling when applied but it smells so good and doesn’t have that strong fake tan smell that other tanning products have. I would 10/10 recommend this! nan
