I’ve used St. Tropez tanner before so I was excited to try this. For starters a little bit goes a long way with this stuff. Which means it’ll definitely last. The shade is intimidating at first but it really is the perfect glow. It dries really fast which is good and bad. Good that it dries fast and you don’t need to stand there and wait for it to dry but It dries so fast that if you’re not quick enough it doesn’t blend. I just wouldn’t recommend using this to do a contour on your face. DRIES FAST
