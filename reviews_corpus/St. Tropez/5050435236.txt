Really impressed with this tanning mousse and will definitely be using it all summer! Highly recommend applying it with the mitt because trying to get even coverage with your hands is hard and messy. The mitt makes it go on smooth, even, and helps spread excess reducing drying time. It does feel sticky the first hour but does become dry to the touch in 10-15 mins. I wear dark, loose fitting clothing as there is some transfer regardless of how long you wait for this to dry. This does give a beautiful, warm tan to your skin and looks very natural!! Itâ€™s beautiful!!
