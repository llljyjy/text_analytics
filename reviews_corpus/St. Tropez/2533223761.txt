Love this tan! The application was so smooth, the guide color is really dark but it makes it easier to blend out fully. My skin felt very hydrated after I washed it off in the morning, I was left looking bronzed and glowy! My only complaint was there was a lot of transfer, but it washed out easily! Perfect tan!
