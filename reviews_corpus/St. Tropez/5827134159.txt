I have tried a lot of self tanning drops, and so far this is one of my favorites. The first thing I noticed is the packaging- it’s gorgeous, heavy, and high- end, which is what I would expect from St. Tropez. The second thing I noticed is the smell. Thankfully, it doesn’t have the same tanning smell that we all know. Application was smooth and I loved that it was customizable based on how many drops I used. I love that I can mix it with my regular moisturizer! It was very easy to apply and didn’t feel harsh on my skin. I applied it to my face before bed, so when I woke up 8 hours later I had a nice natural glow! No orange. I am definitely impressed and feel more confident now to test it out on other parts of my body. Beautiful coverage
