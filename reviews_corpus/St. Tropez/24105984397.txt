I am always apprehensive about trying a tanning lotion. I hate the a lot of them leave you looking like you have a tint of orange or streaks. This St. Tropez gradual tanning lotion is life changing. It leaves. I streaks or even a hint of orange. Just a nice, subtle glow. And smells great too! No streaks or hint of orange!
