The St.Tropez watermelon tanning lotion comes in a slender plastic squeezable tube container that holds 6.7oz. The consistency of the tanning lotion seems to be on the watery side. A little does go a long ways with the consistency. It smells like watermelon dum dum sucker to me. However this is my first tanning firm lotion I wasn’t sure how to apply. So I used it like a normal lotion all over. With my first expiernce I didn’t like how in between my fingers were darker than my body. this does stain your hands. The tanning lotion wears off and looks like bloops of tan all over. When the tan did appear even on my arms at first it looked very pretty. It’s like a orange light brown color of a tan. However if you like tanning lotions this one last over two weeks on your skin. St.Tropez watermelon!
