I have tried multiple self tan drops and this one has been my favorite by far. My skin was so soft the morning after using it and I had a very natural and subtle glow. I also love how you can put it on with or without moisturizer. I used moisturizer to apply it and it looks subtle and even. Plus my favorite part is that it doesnâ€™t smell bad at all. Loved it!
