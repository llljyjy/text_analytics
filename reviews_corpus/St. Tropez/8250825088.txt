I like this product. It worked best/looked the most natural when I mixed it with my moisturizer. I tried it both ways and it worked well directly on the skin too. I definitely don’t recommend putting too much on your neck if you’re only using it to keep up with your tan on your face  because it fades so much slower than your face. It smells nice and doesn’t have that typical self tanner scent too. Love this
