First off I love how easily this absorbs into skin. It has a serum like texture that you can mix with your moisturizer. It smells really good as well. I would recommend a patch test, not just for reactions but also to see exactly how much you need to achieve the look youâ€™re going for. I really love that this gave a very natural looking glow to my skin as well. nan
