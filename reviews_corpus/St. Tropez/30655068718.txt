These facial tanning drops were the best ones I have ever tried. As we all know, tanning the face can be a hassle but this product makes it easy and painless. The application went on seamlessly. It didnâ€™t dry my face out or leave it looking patchy. I mixed a few drops in my moisturizer and the color deposited beautifully. It gave me a natural glow without looking too overdone. Overall, I am excited to keep using this product throughout the summer because I hate tanning my face or exposing it too much to the sun so I think this product will help me avoid that.
