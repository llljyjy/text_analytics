I can’t even count how many self tans I’ve tried and have either hated or loved but was too expensive. This product works and lasts a long time so the price point is okay. I put it on at night (mixed it in with cream) and in the morning I woke up with an even tan. The best part is it doesn’t look orange! I also used it on my body and had the best tanned legs!! Don’t worry, you don’t look orange
