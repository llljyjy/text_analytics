Received from St. Tropez their self tan luxe whipped cream mousse. This It’s so easy to apply it goes on seamlessly easy to distribute evenly. It almost hydrated my skin at the same time. It dried really quick. After eight hours I could tell the difference there are some places that I wanted to build the Tan little bit more, so I just added more mousse. It’s very simple at first I was scared to use it on my whole body after I did my legs I saw how easy it was and I get my entire body and it looks like I spent a day out in the sun tanning. It may look that way but my skin was never damaged by the sun. I am absolutely in love with this and I highly recommend it to anybody who wants a fresh tan look. This will be my new go to the entire summer especially when we Vacay in Mexico. Summer Must Have
