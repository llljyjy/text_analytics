I love how easy this serum is to apply and how customizable it is. I am partial to serums and have been wanting to try this. I’m absolutely impressed. I am using the drops directly on my face/neck and only a few for a light glow, but I like that I can add this to my moisturizer if I like and/or use a few more drops for more color. It is also lightly moisturizing with hyaluronic acid which works well with my combination skin. It takes a few hours for the tan/glow to develop. I love living in Southern California, but don’t want to get skin cancer like my father so this is the way to go for me for achieving a beautiful glow. Lovely Customizable Glow
