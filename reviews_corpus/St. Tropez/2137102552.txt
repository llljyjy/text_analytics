I don’t have too much experience with self-tanners, but this one was very easy to use. I didn’t have any issues with application (just followed the instructions/recs for exfoliation, moisturization). The color isn’t orange-y nor does the formula streak, which are win-win’s in my book! The scent is just ok for me. And there’s a slightly tacky feeling on my skin as it’s drying. Those are the only cons really.The color lasts about a 10-ish days for me. I re-apply every 2 weeks to maintain! nan
