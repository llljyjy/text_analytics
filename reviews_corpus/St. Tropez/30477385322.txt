I was honestly a bit concerned about how this would look on me after seeing how dark this was looking on other people in the reviews and how deep the color was when the foam came out of the bottle because I am a very pasty Minnesotan whose legs haven’t seen the sun for about 8 months. I was actually quite pleased with the natural looking tan that I ended up getting from this product! I love that the product has some skincare powerhouse ingredients like HA and niacinamide- my dry skin is a big fan! Some things I didn’t love about the product are that my skin stayed sticky for a while after application, and I feel like the color washed off pretty quickly. nan
