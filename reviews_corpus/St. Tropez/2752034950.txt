I was fully prepared to be disappointed by this product - bc when I applied it the “guide” color looked horrible against my skin. The next morning I woke up, showered, and was shocked that the color looked so good!! The mousse comes out a bit too much + too quickly for my liking, but that’s the nature of mousse I suppose. I applied w a mitt and highly suggest this approach. The scent was not like typical self tan and I didn’t notice the scent much after rinsing the guide color off - perhaps bc I only did my legs. Planning to do my full body tonight! Better than expected!
