I really wanted to love this, but when compared to the Ashley Graham collab, it falls short. I found it to be sparkly, which I didn’t love. There was also a considerable amount of transfer onto clothes even though I gave ample time to dry down. The pro here is that I wasn’t overly orange. It was definitely a warmer tone than what I normally get with the brands products.I do suggest going with the Ashley collab but this one will do in a pinch. nan
