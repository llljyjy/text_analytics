I really enjoyed trying out these tanning drops, especially now that winter is coming up! I pumped a bit of my lotion into my hands and mixed the drops like that. I also mixed 1-2 drops into my face moisturizer as well. I got a great glow when I woke up in the morning and I thought it looked really natural and subtle which is what I was looking for. I like that you can customize how dark you want your tan by adjusting the amount of drops you use. I will definitely be experimenting and see what I like best! nan
