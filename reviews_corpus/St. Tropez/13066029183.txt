I was not sure what to expect from the St. Tropez tan tonic glow drops. Iâ€™ve never used a self tanner and was very skeptical. I just had a small area on my arm because I did not know how or how fast it would work. I was super pleased with the subtle Sun-kissed glow that my skin received. I love how this product is good for your whole entire body. I had surgery and I have a portion of my leg that is lighter than the other. This is perfect to get my skin to all one uniform color. I have to also mention the packaging and the fragrance. When I tell you, this smells amazing. I almost want to wear it as a fragrance. The new must have!
