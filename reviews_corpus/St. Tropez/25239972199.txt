I have some experience with self tanning mousse and lotion products, but this is my first experience with a tanning oil. This product has a really lovely thick texture. It is pretty strongly fragranced, but I didn’t experience irritation from it. I followed the instructions and conducted a patch test on the day before using this product. I was really happy that I did, because it is much stronger than I was expecting! I made the decision to dilute the pigment by mixing it into my lotion. I was a little confused about the amount of product that I needed, the instructions specify “2-6 drops“ but do not mention what area that amount of product  is supposed to cover. I tried 4 drops in my lotion and used it on my whole body. That gave a very light tan, so I built it up with a few days of adding 1-2 drops a ay to adjust. It took a little bit to get the level just right, but I enjoyed having the option to customize the final result. I felt like my tan looked smoother and more realistic than with the products I have tried previously. I’m excited to keep using this product in the future! nan
