Normally I love St. Tropez self tanners, they’re def one of my favorite brands for vacay glow, but this product left me puzzled. It acts as a self tanner AND as body makeup, so it will not only stain your clothes, but if you sweat a lot or happened to apply too much, it will flake off making the skin look patchy, Idk, maybe it’s just me, but I’m just not sold on this one. I do like the foam format though, it’s a lot easier to apply than a cream. Not for me
