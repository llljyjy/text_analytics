As someone with a very fair cool complexion I was very worried this would make me look orange. Thankfully it didn’t! It was my first time using a product like this and I was really surprised by how easy it was to apply, especially with the mitt. While it did feel like I had self tanner on, it wasn’t the same as like getting a full blown spray tan. I used it before I went to bed and washed it off in the morning. Some of the color does wash away in the shower, but for me I was okay with it. It is a bit difficult to get the product placement right for the knees/elbows since they get darker faster, but overall I was pleased with this product! nan
