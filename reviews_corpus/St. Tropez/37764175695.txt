I absolutely love these self tan drops! They are perfect for the face and blending down into the neck and they offer an even, glowy skin tone. They left my skin feeling hydrated and I was so impressed by the results. Not too harsh but definitely noticeable difference! My new absolute favourite self tanning product, plus it’s so easy to use and add more if you want a darker tone. I love the buildable aspect especially during the winter months when I’m especially pale. St Tropez is my go-to for any self tanning products from now on. Definitely a new staple for my skincare routine!
