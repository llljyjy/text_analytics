’ve tried and loved St. Tropez tanning products in the past, but I’ve always been too nervous to apply any tanning products to my face. My favorite thing about this product is that the amount you use is totally customizable, so you can get just the tan level you want! I saw a review recommended to mix in with moisturizer, so that’s what I did. Super easy to apply, and felt like nothing on my skin, which I love! Super Easy to Use!
