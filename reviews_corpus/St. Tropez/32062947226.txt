Iâ€™m still rather new to self tanning; But so far my experience with the whipped Creme mouse has been very positive.  It has a pleasant scent, the instructions were clear and the product was easy to use as well. The tanning mouse also has skincare ingredients that kept my skin hydrated and had my skin glowing.  The outcome was outstanding and my tan was not patchy or orange. It looked very natural and I am super pleased. Ready for summer!
