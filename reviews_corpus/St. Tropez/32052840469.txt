First time trying St. Tropez Self Tan - Luxe whipped crème mousse; it is beginner friendly, application is very easy and smoothly.  Really like that is lightweight, and had a subtle but nice scent.  Left the skin feeling soft & hydrated; in my experience it didn’t felt sticky at all. And the final result is very natural glowy tan look (not orange or patchy). Overall a great experience and product to incorporate into your routine, if you like me, want the summer tan look avoiding sun exposure. Beginner friendly for a natural glowy tan look
