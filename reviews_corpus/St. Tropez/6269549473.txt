I am not a huge self tanner, but I have definitely tried my fair share of tanners and truly put the mousse by St Tropez in my Top 3. I moisturized after I showered, then used the velvety mit to apply the tanning mousse. No streaks, subtle beachy scent, not sticky. It was also great to do the facial tan/contour with! Really good!
