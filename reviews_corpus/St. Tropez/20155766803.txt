It’s my first time using this self tanner after hearing so many good things about it! It’s thicker then any other self tanner I’ve used. I like the scent and it goes on easy with the mit. The color went on streak free and gave instant color! It didn’t turn out orange like some tanners do and didn’t feel sticky on my body Amazing!
