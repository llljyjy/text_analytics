I’m still using this product and have yet to be really consistent, because I’ve been using other lotions that help with my dry skin at the moment. I started to use it and didn’t notice much of a tan. I was being super careful because I read that with some it was getting super dark and staining hands. I don’t have a tan applicator so I probably could use something to help when applying. I did love the smell of the gradual tanner, watermelon. I feel like it gives that summer-ish vibe but being in the winter. And to be quite honest I don’t feel a need to be tan when I’m just sitting at home. I think I will apply this right before Christmas to see the difference. Can’t wait to see my results. It has potential to have a higher rating
