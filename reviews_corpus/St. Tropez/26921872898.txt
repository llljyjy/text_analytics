This is my very first time using any self tan product ever, and I’m so happy I got to use this one! I have always been so scared to self tan and look orange, but this was so easy! I just put a couple drops in my lotion and applied it to my body in sections. I’m not orange at all and it wasn’t a huge change in color, but a soft tan and a healthy glow. The result is so pretty and even! Happy First Timer!
