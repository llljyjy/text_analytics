This tan topic is super easy to use. I add it to my face lotion each for a gradual tan that’s not orange nor garish, it’s just a hint of summer glow through out the year, which is great for winters when I’m not as outdoors as much as summer. I like how it works gradually and easy to control the shade intensity. nan
