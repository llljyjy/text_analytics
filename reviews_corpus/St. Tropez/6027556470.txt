If you are a beginner at self tanning I think this is perfect for you! It’s hard to “overdo” it accidentally with this product. The tan you get on your face looks natural and slowly develops over time. It’s super easy to use, you just drop a few drops into your moisturizer and you’re good to go.  If you’re looking for something to tan your face quickly - this isn’t it, you need to give these at least a week to notice a serious difference in your skin tone. There is not a noticeable “tanning” smell like there is with lots of tanning products. It blends into the skin very easy and leaves no streaking! great for beginners!
