I’ve tried many self tanning products over the years and this is one of my favorites. I like that it shows where you’ve applied the product which disappears after you rinse off. I’m not a huge fan of self tanner smells but this one isn’t as terrible as some.  Would recommend trying it if you’re interested! nan
