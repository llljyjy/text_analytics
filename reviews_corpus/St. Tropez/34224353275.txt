This was the first time I have ever tried the St. Tropez brand and I was not disappointed! The drops did give my skin a nice glow, but the amount you use matters - 2-3 drops wonâ€™t show up much even on my fair skin. I used 4-5 and loooved the results! This product was given to me for free by St. Tropez! Great glow!
