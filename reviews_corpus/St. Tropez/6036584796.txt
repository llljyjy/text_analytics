I love this so much. I usually tan my face at least once a week with a rapid 1 hour self tan. If I’m exfoliating more or using more acids, I need to do it twice a week. If I forget or didn’t make it happen for whatever reason - I use this in the morning after I wash my face, let it dry for a min and then add my usual products. It does take about 2 hours to really take hold but when it does - it’s absolutely perfect for my coloring. It’s not too dark but you definitely get a color payoff that looks really natural and tanned. For me, it does come off as soon as I wash my face so it’s really just a last min bronzer. But it’a really a natural natural bronzed look. Not a make up or fakey look. nan
