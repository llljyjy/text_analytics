4 drops is my summer go to, since I’m naturally an olive color year round. 2 drops is perfect for my face and I love that after it, it’s the right color for my face where I feel like I don’t even need to wear makeup during the week. I just fix my brows, put on some gloss and head out the door. Perfect for the no makeup look
