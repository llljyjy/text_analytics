I’ve had spray tans & used tanning lotions before, & have always been put off by the sticky feel & gross smell. Happily, this product is very different! It’s like a serum or gel, and it absorbs quickly with no stickiness or lingering odor. It develops gradually & evenly in a very subtle way, so you can grow your tan very slowly without a sudden change or drastic result. It adds warmth to my pale skin without looking orange, & I love that you can add just a drop to your normal moisturizer or serum so you don’t have to do anything special to get a bit of glow in the winter! It’s SO subtle & natural looking. Very subtle & actually natural looking!
