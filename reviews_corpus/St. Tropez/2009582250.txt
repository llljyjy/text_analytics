Wow these are some of the best face drops I’ve ever used. I’ve used them in a serum, moisturizer and body moisturizer for my chest and arms, and it worked perfectly. No streakiness and a perfect bronze color on my light/fair skin. They don’t smell bad either! In fact they smell great, kind of perfumey. Would repurchase Great for all upper body!
