I am a super pale individual and was looking for something to give me a bit of a tan for the summer and for my sisters upcoming wedding. I didn’t want to risk tan lines or getting burnt so got these drops to try instead! They worked super well to give me a bit of a tan- but they didn’t make me turn orange. Also soaked into my skin super well and didn’t leave any kind of icky residue. 10/10 recommend to anyone wanting a little bit of a tan glow! I have sensitive skin and had no issues with this product. Loved this for my pale skin
