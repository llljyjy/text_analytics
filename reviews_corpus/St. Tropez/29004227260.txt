I was gifted this by St. Tropez and was excited to use because I love sunless tanning. I applied 2-4 drops into my moisturizer at night to achieve a summer sun kissed look. Overall I thought it turned out great and gave a very even color. The product was left my skin feeling hydrated with no sticky after feel. Love!
