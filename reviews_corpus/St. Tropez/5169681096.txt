So grateful to receive this gradual firming self tanner complimentary from @influenster @sttropeztan in exhange for my honest review.  #complimentary #sttropezgradualglow #sttropeztan @Influenster @sttropeztanI have used self tanners in the past but never a  gradual tanner. I love to see the instant satisfaction of a regular tan BUT this gradual one surprised me. I actually enjoyed the firming lotion texture. I usually use a moose consistency tanner with a color guard for an even splotch free result. I was at first skeptical due to the above mentioned reasons, but I was pleasantly surprised with the results. To start, the smell is amazing. It does not smell like your typical self tan scent which I love. I consistency is just like a light white moisture. It absorbs quickly into my skin and isent too tacky. Although it doesnâ€™t have a color guard, with my mitt applicator I had an even subtle tan. It does take quite a few times using it for the color I would like, but with the bonus moisture it offers as well as the benefit of firming ; using it more is only more beneficial. Perfect way to keep your summer glow going all year round.  Overall, I did enjoy this gradual self tanner and would consider buying it in the future. Nice glow over time
