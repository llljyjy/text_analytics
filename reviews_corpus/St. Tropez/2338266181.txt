I was nervous that this self tanner would leave me looking like a streaky Oompa Loompa, but the results are quite the opposite! Application is easy because you can see what spots need to be blended. After 8 hours, I rinsed off and was left with a even, natural-looking glow! This self tanner definitely deserves the hype! nan
