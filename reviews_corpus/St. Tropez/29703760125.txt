I’m not the biggest fan of these drops. I’ve used better drops for cheaper. I ended up using 4-5 drops with my moisturizer and didn’t really see a difference in tan after 8+ hours. I think if you want to see results then you will need more than 5 drops. I’d recommend using a different brand for facial drops nan
