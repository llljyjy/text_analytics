This is the easiest at home tanning product I’ve ever used. I’ve tried other ones in the past but it always ended up streaky or slightly orange. The mitt made applying the mousse a breeze. I could easily apply and rub in the product and see any areas I missed. The end result was an even application without a streak in sight. The color is natural and gives you a great glow without being overly bronzed. I left it on for only 4 hours because I’m pretty fair but they give you a lot of  product that I could easily get several more applications out of this if I wanted to build up the color. Glowy for summer
