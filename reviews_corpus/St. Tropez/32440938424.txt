I’m not a self-tanning type of guy but I thought I would bring my girlfriend in on this one for a little help, seeing as how she’s always complaining about being pasty-pale-sickly looking. She tried this self tanner a couple of times, and then refused to use it anymore. She said she’s not sure if it’s because she is so incredibly pale, or if it’s the product, but she was starting to feel like she looked like an Oompa Loompa, and I had to agree that she was tinted a bit orange and that perhaps this wasn’t as “gradual” as we initially assumed. She says it would probably work better for someone who already has a bit of color, but since I am as pale as she is I wasn’t about to try my luck. She also said it looked a bit streaky in certain areas even though she exfoliated before applying the lotion, and that it transferred to clothing. On the plus side, she did say it smelled pretty good, though I personally didn’t think so myself. All in all, this one’s just not it, for us. Drop a comment  and let me know if you had had any luck with this one. If not, what would you recommend? Not So Gradual
