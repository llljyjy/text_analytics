I love St.Tropez Tonic Drops! It’s so easy to apply. You can adjust your tan color by choosing right amount of drops. For light skin I prefer 2 drops, it’s gives my skin nice healthy glow.  My skin feels soft and smooth. It’s applies nice and even, no patching. Consistency not sticky and smell nice. nan
