I am so bad at self tanner and was nervous to use a mousse as I didn’t know how many pumps to do per body part etc. Once I put it on, I was nervous that it would be splotchy. However once I showered it off, it came out SO good. I didn’t see any splotches and it came out looking so natural. I’m so excited to continue using! Great for a beginner!
