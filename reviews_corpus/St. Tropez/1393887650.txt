I am quite the amateur when it comes to self tanning products and I was pleasantly surprised by how easy to use this product is. I first take a shower and exfoliate, then mix 4 drops into my body lotion, rub/mix them together and apply it to my body (I repeat this several times to get my whole body). No irritation or anything, the texture looks like water, but slightly thicker and it doesn’t change the texture of my body lotion when mixed. I was afraid it would give me uneven results like other products I’ve tried in the past, fortunately, this product gave me an even finish. The results were very natural, I feel like I could probably use a few more drops. nan
