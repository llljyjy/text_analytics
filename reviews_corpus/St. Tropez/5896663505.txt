I love St. Tropez product so much and this is the most recent one I’ve tried. It applied super smoothly and my skin felt super nourished after use which I loved because some self tanners leave your skin super dry.  The tan itself looked so good after it had set and it didn’t streak and lasted a long time. St. Tropez Amazing Tan
