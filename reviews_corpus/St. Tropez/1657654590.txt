The mit and mouse combo was perfect. It was east to apply and went on smoothly into the skin without building up layers on your skin. I am very light and tan olive so this color worked well on me for a natural look. It dried fast so I didnâ€™t feel like I had to not touch it for hours. Nice color easy application
