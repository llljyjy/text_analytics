this works really well for a beginner like me. my first application wasn’t perfect and i had some (barely noticeable) streaks on my legs, but i chalk that up to user error since it was my first time using a self tanner. the color matches how my skin naturally tans, and i like that i can leave it on longer if i want a darker color or shorter for lighter. haven’t had any issues with it staining clothes/sheets or looking weird on my hands or ankles. also doesn’t seem to have much of a smell. will def be buying the full size! nan
