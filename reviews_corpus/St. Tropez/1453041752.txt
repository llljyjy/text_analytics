I received this to try from influencer for a honest review. And I’m pretty shocked that I liked this. I usually don’t use tanning products I was just never into it but I liked how this was a gradual tanner. I did it every other night after shower and within a few application I noticed it gave me a subtle tan look. And the smell is amazing! Even my husband loved how it made me smell. I really like this product and would repurchase. I hope they come out with other scents ! Nice gradual tanner!
