I was originally nervous with using this product, but it wasn’t bad at all! I’ve never used a self tanner before so I was scared that the product would be too much for me. I didn’t used too much because of that and got a nice slight glow to my face. I mixed it in with my face oil in my night routine so I could let it do it’s work overnight. Definitely will be using this product more often. nan
