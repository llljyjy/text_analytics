One of the best self tanners Iâ€™ve used!! the application was so easy and it blended really well. Dry time was quick and the instant results were natural - not orange! The color deepened a little over the 8 hours looking even more natural. My biggest tip is to apply quickly because it starts to work right away. Really nice, natural color -easy to apply!
