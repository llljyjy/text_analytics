I’ve tried a lot of self-tanners and this might be one of my all-time favorites! It smells amazing and doesn’t give me a funky self-tan smell, which is quite rare for a self-tanner. It feels great when applied to the skin because it’s like a thick creamy foam. It also doesn’t dry out my skin like a lot of other kinds do. I apply this right before I go to bed and with long-sleeve pajamas, and always wake up to a glowing tan. With an asian skin tone, the color this tan gives is quite natural and doesn’t look “fake”. I love this! BEST SELF TAN!
