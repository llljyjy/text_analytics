It was my first experience with such tanning serums. I really like the results. It has very pleasant smell. After I applied oil to my skin it became softer, smoother and kinda moisturized. I usually add this oil to my moisturizing cream in the evening and as I can see my skin is tanned and beautiful. New for me and very interesting experience
