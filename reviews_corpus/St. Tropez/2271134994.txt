At first I was absolutely obsessed, it creates a beautiful and natural color. However, after using it about a week or so (reapplying every few days) it has started to get horribly splotchy. I have not been exfoliating regularly so that may be part of my problem. For now I’d recommend since I still love the color it creates and I’m hoping that with exfoliating I can prevent the splotching. nan
