I received this product free from Influenster and Sephora in exchange for my honest review.  This product works great and I saw results in as little as 2 applications.  The cream is thick and smooth. It did not irritate my skin, and the scent stayed on me all day. I used shorts and pants after applying it and it didn’t rub off. I’d recommend this product for purchase. Great product
