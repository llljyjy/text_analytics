I have very fair skin and tanners can look artificial on me really easily, but this one develops into a really natural color.  I apply it in the morning, after my shower and by afternoon my skin looks glowy and soft, because I’m so fair, less is more for me.  I love that it has Niacinamide AND Hyaluronic Acid, and makes my skin feel like I’ve used a moisturizer.  Also, I LOVE the smell, and I definitely can’t say that about most self tanning products. Leaves my skin soft and glowy
