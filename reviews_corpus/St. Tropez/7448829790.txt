I applied right after i showered directly to skin with a new tanning glove. I thought it would smell funny, but it smells super clean and fresh. The following morning i saw an immediate difference. I would say i used about 8 drops per blend. BLENDING IS KEY! I will do another layer today and blend in the spots i missed. Super excited for the resultâ€™s. I did use the residuals on my face and it looks super natural It works.
