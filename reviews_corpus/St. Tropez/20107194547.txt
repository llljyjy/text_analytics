I’ve been using the St. Tropez Self Tan Lux Whipped Créme Mousse for the last few weeks.. and oh my gawsh, this tanner is beyond incredible. The whipped foamy texture & consistency glides onto the skin so smoothly and doesn’t dry down tacky or sticky. It gives the most beautiful bronzed glow that is just enough to give you that tanned vacation look, without leaving you looking orange or overly tanned. My skin looks and feels so soft, smooth, glowy, and hydrated.. and honestly I can’t imagine myself reaching for another self tanner other than this one. Absolutely hands down recommend. My New Holy Grail Self Tanner!!
