Watermelon smell and glowing skin can go together! This one is a prove. I am very careful with auto tans /gradual tans , since my skin is extremely sensitive . So i got the result in 1 use . Its mild, literally gradual tanning. the cream DOESNT smell as auto tan! It smells as watermelon lotion. Takes about couple of hrs to develop a mildly  tanner color of the skin. Doesnt stain the clothes. Glowing skin!
