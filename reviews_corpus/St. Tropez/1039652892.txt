I received this tanning mousse and the applicator mitt for review purposes. I don’t normally use self tanner, so I carefully read the instructions beforehand. I cautiously applied this product by dispensing the mousse onto the mitt, then applying to my legs. The mitt seems to create a smooth finish, almost has a ’buffing’ quality. The whole process was fairly quick and I was pleasantly surprised that it did not smell like the self tanner i had tried a few times back in the day. It felt nice on my skin and actually seemed to dry fairly quickly (I did small amounts of product at a time). I applied right before bed, threw on some loose sweats and socks, and crossed my fingers. This morning I woke up to ZERO streaks - the reason I don’t normally use self tanner is that I suck at applying it, so this was a pleasant surprise. I’m naturally very pale and the tint really warms up my complexion and looks nice/healthy. It’s a smidge orange but not too much. I will continue to use this product! I should note that I can’t imagine applying this without the mitt - it seems like it’d be pretty messy. On its own this product is pricey and doesn’t include the mitt (sold separately). For this reason I give it 4/5. nan
