I was impressed with this tan! I love that it’s a mousse, so you don’t go through too much product since it expands. The formula is great, it doesn’t smell like gross self tanner, it’s not too quick drying so you have plenty of time to spread it evenly, and it’s not a sticky formula at all! My skin felt moisturized and looked glowy in the morning. Since it is 8 hours I just slept in it overnight, and it didn’t stain my sheets! Pretty great
