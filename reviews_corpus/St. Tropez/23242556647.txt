This is a great self tanning lotion. I haven’t used one of these in years and I really appreciate how this doesn’t turn you orange. The tan is very modest but enough to give you a glow...looking like you came back from a beach trip. I absolutely love the scent. I don’t get that self tanning scent from this at all. I feel like St. Tropez knows what they’re doing when it comes to tanning products. The firming aspect is the icing on the cake. I have been using this lotion for a couple weeks and the back of my legs definitely look more toned. It could be the fact that they are a bit more tan now or that there is something to the firming part of this lotion. Either way...I’m here for it!! A great self tanner for a modest glow!
