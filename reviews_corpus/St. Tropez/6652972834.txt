Everything it says on the package is wrong. Based on the packaging and directions, I anticipated a lotion or cream, similar to the TanLuxe gradual lotion, that would gradually develop colour as you wore it without the need for showering. Instead, this product is a very dark green liquid that requires a mitt to apply due to instant staining, that leaves instant fairly dark colouring (at least for me, Iâ€™m rather pale), and needs to be washed off after a few hours due to the smell. The product also contains a large amount of glitter. For this price I expect a way higher quality product. I will be returning this. Not Gradual, not a Lotion
