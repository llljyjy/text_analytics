I have fairly pale skin with a slight natural tan and so far I’m definitely a fan of this product. I love how customizable the level of color is and it has a pleasant smell that isn’t overpowering like other tanning products I’ve tried. So far I’ve only used a couple drops on my legs mixed with body lotion and already see a natural-looking subtle glow and my skin feels super soft and hydrated. So easy and customizable!
