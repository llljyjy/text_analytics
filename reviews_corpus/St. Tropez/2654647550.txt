I really love this product. It applies so seamlessly and forgiving on me and it is actually pretty dark after just one use. I’m not a huge fan of the watermelon smell, but I don’t think it has that bad self tanner smell so at least that’s a positive. I’m only docking one star because it is expensive for how many uses you get. Love the look
