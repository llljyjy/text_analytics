Used the moisturizer for a few weeks & it was moisturizing, but the stanch was unbearable, it smelled so strongly of self-tanner and it didn’t go away until I showered again. The watermelon scent is lightly noticeable when you first apply it, but that dissipates quickly and your skin is left nice & soft and smelling truly terrible. I also didn’t notice much “tanning“ from using it consistently just overall disappointing my opinion. I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. Terrible scent long-term, moisturizing, no tan!
