I’ve never found a sunless tanning product that I’ve wanted to stick with until now. I started very slowly as I’m pretty fair and didn’t want to go extreme right off the bat. I mixed 3 drops with a full pump of Cerave body lotion (my daily moisturizer) and applied to my legs and arms after shower. My legs took 4 pumps total, my arms and upper neck/chest maybe 3 pumps total. I tried to keep the areas bare for at least 30 minutes to give it time to dry and set. The next morning I had a slight glow. nan
