I’m reviewing this after using this for a week straight. At first; the smell of blueberry really comes through in a subtle way and I loved it. However, after a while the smell kinda becomes unpleasant and not tasteful. The lotion is super firming and moisturizing for the first few days and then I feel like my skin dries out more. I do see a gradual tanner complexion so that works. But I think it’s nothing fancy to rave about tbh. Good product to try out!
