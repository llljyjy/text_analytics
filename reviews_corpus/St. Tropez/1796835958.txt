I really am impressed with St. Tropezâ€™s tanning products. I love the luxurious feel of the ultra-hydrating and lightweight texture of the creamy mousse. It delivers an instant tan which I was not expecting, as most tanners take a long time to develop. This self-tanner not only gives you an instant tan, but it continues to develop over time as well. After 8 hours, my tan was so pretty and evenly tanned. My skin absolutely loves this mousse and feels so moisturized after application. The sandalwood scent is so so pretty! The St. Tropez tanning mitt provides a luxurious and smooth application with no splotches. I am very happy with this product! I would highly recommend this product to my family and friends. My New Favorite Self-Tanner!
