I love how easy to use these glow drops are! You can use as many or  as little drops as youâ€™d like to get your desired level of tan. I mixed my drops in with my daily moisturizer and body lotion after showering.  I let my lotion dry for a bit before sleeping to let the tan develop. The next morning I woke up with a gorgeous subtle glow, no streaks or patchiness. A gorgeous subtle glow!
