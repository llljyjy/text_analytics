I was so excited to get the chance to try this. I’ve used other tanning drops and had no issue with them (besides hoping that the tan lasted a little longer) but this brand has such a good reputation I knew it was worth experimenting. This tan feels more even and slightly darker but was still even and soft. I’ll definitely keep using the bottle and think I’ll rebuy when the time comes! I’d give it a try!
