I received this product right as summer was ending complimentary from Influenster and st tropez I might use it through the winter..let me tell you it truly works! And it doesn’t look fake whatsoever..use per instructions and you will be happy with the results. I started off with a small patch incase I had an allergic reaction because this is my 1st time using a tanning product. Don’t laugh guys but I did a smiley face on my tummy. I wish I could show you guys the picture but I’m a bit shy about that kind of stuff but let’s just say I truly reccomend it. The tan will last a while as long as you use it consistently like maybe use it evry 5 days. Cause either way if you use the lotion one night you see results the next day not like bam in your face but definitely noticeable You'll love it too..great 1st time tanning lotion
