I am a big fan of self tanner and gradual tan products but this takes the cake! Many of them work well but have a scent that I donâ€™t want to leave the house with once it starts to activate. This smells SO good. I was skeptical of the watermelon scent at first but it truly smells fresh and not like a jolly rancher. It leaves you with great color after a use or two as well! Would recommend! Pleasantly surprised!
