This is my first time using a self tanner but it was complimentary from St. Tropez, who is known for having the best self tanning products. After researching some tips, I decided to shower, moisturizer, apply, and go to sleep. I applied powder to my joints, hands, and underarms. I loved the way it smelled but it was dark and scary at first. Once I washed off, I had the perfect tan and my skin is so smooth. It’s phenomenal. I can’t believe I was missing out for so long. The velvet dual sided MIT made it easy also but I preferred gloves in some areas as well. I genuinely loved this experience but I’m glad I did my research first before applying. The product itself is truly a wonder. ST TROPEZ SELF TANNING LUXE MOUSSE
