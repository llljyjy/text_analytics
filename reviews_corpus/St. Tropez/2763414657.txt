This is quite literally the BEST self tanner I’ve ever used and believe me I’ve tried a ton! It smells amazing, applies like a dream (I love the guide color to help make sure I’m covered) and develops into the most natural looking tan! Best of all? No stinky after smell! The guide color does transfer, so make sure you wear old loose clothing or put something down where you sit until you shower, but after that you’re golden. I’m on my 3rd can and will continue to repurchase! BEST TAN EVER!
