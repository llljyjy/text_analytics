First thing’s first: this smells incredible. I’m not a huge self tanner but when I’ve used them in the past they have typically smelled pretty chemical and just not good. I like this so much I kind of wish they made a perfume or something with a similar vibe. The drops felt great going on, almost like a serum. It felt really good on the skin and didn’t leave any sticky residue. My preferred application is on its own but you can mix this in your face cream. I love that it’s super customizable!Finally, the results. At first I wasn’t really impressed- again, I don’t really use self tanner. I’m already medium-tan so my complexion doesn’t typically need much but I’ve been inside so much lately (and Summer is taking forever to get here) so I figured a little glow would be nice. I did a patch test and didn’t see anything… but after 8+ hours that completely changed. DO A PATCH TEST to determine how much of this you want to use. It really works beautifully and I’m so happy to have been gifted this by St. Tropez! Really Really Pleased!
