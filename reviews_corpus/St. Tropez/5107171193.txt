This lotion smells nice at first, but then quickly turns like every other self tanner to that “self tanner smell” . I liked the ease of the product, but felt that even though I applied carefully and with a mitt - the color still developed patchy. I’ve used better, but for a free sample. I was willing to give it a try. Easy to use but not my favorite
