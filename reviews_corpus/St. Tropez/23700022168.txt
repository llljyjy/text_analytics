This was my first time using any kind of self tanner. The mitt was great for a smooth application when rubbing with circles. When first applying, I could see exactly where the mousse was applied. It did transfer to clothes before washing it off. I only left it on for 3 hours as I wasn’t sure how dark the finish was going to be. I’m relatively fair but even just 3 hours left me a shade or two darker. I also used the mousse with a beauty blender on my face for some natural contour on my face. The mousse also flared up my acne and made my face feel oily. After washing it off, my skin feels no effects still. Great for beginners and results even after 3 hours
