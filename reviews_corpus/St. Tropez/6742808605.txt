I’ve been new to the self tanning world and have been trying Isle Of Paradise self tanning products recently. But I’ve hear great things about St. Tropez, so I was excited to try this drops. I would say that I like them better using alone. Feels light on the skin, not sticky. It’s hard to see if you’ve missed a part of your body with application, you really won’t know until 8 hours later. nan
