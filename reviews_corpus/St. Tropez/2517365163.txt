Within a few hours of application I was already tanned, which worked out nicely, but be prepared. I applied it with a mit and no streaks! The color skews a bit orange on the day of application but it’s evening out nicely and looks more natural on day 2. It definitely still has a self tanner smell, but it’s not as potent as other self tanners. Would recommend to people that want an easy to use tan :) Definitely NOT gradual, but still good
