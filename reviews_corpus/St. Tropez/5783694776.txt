I’ve been a long time fan of St. Trope so it makes me happy to see they have tanning drops! It can be a little tricky to try this on the face - I usually mix it in with a moisturizer but it’s easy to go overboard. The color also looks lovely on the body. It doesn’t have a strong tanning smell and leaves a beautiful golden tan after application.  For a dark tan, you may have to do a couple layer, not ideal for some folks but at least you don’t run the risk of being too tan. nan
