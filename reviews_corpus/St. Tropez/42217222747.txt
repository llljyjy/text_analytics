I love to use self tanners instead of damaging my skin in the sun, but can be a challenge finding the right one. I’m so happy that I’ve finally found tan drops that look natural and not orange!! I love using St Tropez, & I’m so relieved to have finally found a product I really love!! The color of the final result of the tan was natural and it is super easy to apply! Highly recommend! A must have!!
