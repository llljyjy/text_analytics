I have tried a few different tanning drops, these are good quality and so easy to use. You can either apply these into your moisturiser and you can also use it for body. They smell great, The end result is a lovely healthy tan which you can customise to your preferred shade, you can do it a little each day!I am very excited that i tried it and will add to my everyday routine. nan
