*Gifted* this is my first time ever using self tanner and I must say that I was really impressed. It was very beginner friendly and gave my skin a really nice glow that lasted.  I love the skincare benefits it has as well. I think this will definitely become a major staple for me in the winter when Iâ€™m paler. Definitely recommend if your looking to start getting into self-tanner! nan
