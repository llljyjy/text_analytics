I have used many St. Tropez tanners. I wasn’t expecting a similar tanner that would be so noticeable, because of the “gradual“ in the description. This was hard to blend in because you cannot see where you applied. The application wasn’t even, which wouldn’t have happened if I knew it wasn’t gradual. I think this is a good tanner and the smell is nice but just make sure you know it isn’t gradual and it isn’t tinted, so it can be more difficult to apply. Not "Gradual"
