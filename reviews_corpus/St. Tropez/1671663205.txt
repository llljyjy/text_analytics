This gradual tanning lotion worked well! Watermelon scent was decent though Iâ€™m not a fan of watermelon scents in general. Not a strong tanning smell. Overall worked great to give a gradual tan. Not orange or streaky. Didnt stain my hands! I received this complimentary for my honest review Great gradual tanning lotion
