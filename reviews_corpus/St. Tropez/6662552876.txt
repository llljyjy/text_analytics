This was a nice product. great consistency and doesn’t have a weird smell. It did break me out a little but I have very sensitive skin. It didn’t get as dark as I was expecting (I used about 12 drops) But it did give me a nice bronzed glow so my skin looked nice on those no makeup days. I would purchase again! Good Product
