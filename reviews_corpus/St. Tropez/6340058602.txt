I received the Self Tan Luxe Whipped Creme Mousse complimentary from St. Tropez.  I have tried SO many self-tanners, and this one is truly incredible! A lot of tanners dry out my skin, but this one makes my skin feel so smooth and soft. 8+ hours after applying it, I had the perfect sunkissed glow that looks SO natural and much more brown and no orange. It looks very natural, but also provides enough color where you can really see a difference. The mitt makes it very easy to apply, and no issues with streaks at all. I will for sure be purchasing this because itâ€™s so effective. Natural Gorgeous Glow
