I got the st tropez courtesy of Octoly and I am a huge fan. The drops have a very beautiful smell and are super easy to use. I add two to three drops to my moisturizer or lotion and it adds a simple glow not to major which is perfect because I don’t usually self tan. It add the perfect picture glow and is buildable so if you want a deeper glow you just add more drops. It’s not a thick oil so it seeps into the skin instead of sitting on top. It’s a great summer oil Great summer oil
