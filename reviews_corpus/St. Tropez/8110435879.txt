I have been using the self tan oil for the past couple of weeks. The self tan oil adds a beautiful glow to your skin. It’s fast absorbing and I didn’t have any issues with coloring my pillow. The glow is subtle and perfect for someone who never used self tan before. You can build the desire “tan”. Perfect glow
