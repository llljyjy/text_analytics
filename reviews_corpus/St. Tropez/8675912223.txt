I wasn’t a big fan of this product, it left me splotchy and didn’t blend correctly. I tried it two different times once with lotion and once without and both sides did not produce an even blend. I have spots and streaks on my legs. The only positive that it does make me tanner, I tried filling the dropper half way and then using it completely on each spot It’s okay
