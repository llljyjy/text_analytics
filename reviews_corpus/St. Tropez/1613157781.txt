#StTropezgiftedme their @sttropez Self-Tan Luxe Whipped Crème Mousse and now that I think I’ve fully overcome my self-tan fears, I couldn’t wait to get it on! I don’t often say this about self-tanners, but oh my, did I enjoy my experience with this one! The scent is divine - not even a hint of that typical fragrance we all expect from self-tanning products, the color is fantastic - very natural, it blends like a dream, and the mitt is the perfect companion to the whipped formula that is actually hydrating! I applied it at night and washed it off in the morning and I was quite pleasantly surprised that I had no evidence of any mistakes! My only issue is that I don’t feel like it’s dark enough. In the side-by-side photo, I am wearing no self-tanner in my romper and two (2) coats in my white dress. If they ever come out with a darker shade, I will buy that in a heartbeat! The blend, the color, the hydration - all great!
