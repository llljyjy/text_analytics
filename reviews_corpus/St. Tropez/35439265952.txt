I’m liking this for quite a few reasons. It’s easy to apply - much easier than the lotion and dries pretty quickly (less than 2 minutes on my skin). Not pricey, maybe a bit more than other tanning lotions and products but it’s definitely worth paying that small amount extra as when comparing it to other brands; this product has the least streaking and most natural looking color, not orange, just a nice golden hue. Bonus: there is no funny smell left on your skin once you have washed it off.I find one full bottle lasts me for approximately 6 full body applications which makes it more than worth it for me. It is very much on the ’chemical’ side which is the only reason I haven’t given it a full 5 stars, but if you’re not overly concerned about that kind of thing then definitely give this a try.~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
