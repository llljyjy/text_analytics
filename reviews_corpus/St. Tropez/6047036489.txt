I was gifted this product by St. Tropez. I’m new to self tanner so I loved how easy this product was to use! All I did was mix it with my normal body lotion and face moisturizer and it gave a really nice natural glow. On top of that, my skin felt great! I love how it looked really even and developed gradually because I’ve definitely ended up with patchy tans using other products. Overall I would continue to use this! Easy to use and great for beginners!
