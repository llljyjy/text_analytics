I am usually not a fan of self-tanners.  I have very fair skin and they usually make me turn orange.  However, I am really enjoying the St Tropez Self Tan Drops.  They are so easy to useâ€”I mix 2 drops in with my moisturizer and about 8-10 hours later I have a nice healthy glow.  I love how natural these look on the skin and they smell so good! Look so natural!
