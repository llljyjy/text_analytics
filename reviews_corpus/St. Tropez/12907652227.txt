If I could give this product a million stars, I would!!! For starers, the smell....amazing! I legit wish I could get it in a perfume. Second, I love how it gives a good bronze color when you apply so you can see where you have the product and where to rub in. Super helpful to avoid a blotchy tan. Last, the color....I mean chefs kiss!! I feel the perfect bronze with this self tan! I couldnâ€™t recommend it enough! a million stars!!
