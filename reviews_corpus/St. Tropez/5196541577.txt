I was looking for a good product that DOESN’T TRANSFER. I was debating between the isle of paradise which is one I’ve used before that doesn’t transfer but I didn’t like how the pump doesn’t work. So the ladies in Sephora recommended this and said it DOESN’T TRANSFER BUT IT DOES. I put the tanner on, waited an hour, then got into bed and immediately, I got up and there was orange everywhere. All over my white sheets. What I do have to say is that I like the consistency of the mousse, and the color is nice. Too dark for my taste. IF YOU HAVE WHITE SHEETS DON’T BUY
