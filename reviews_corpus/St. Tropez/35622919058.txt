I received this St Tropez Self Tanner in exchange for my honest opinion.  There are so many great things to say about this about this product,  let’s start with the easy application, the fact there is no overpowering chemical smell, even after 8 full hours of use you will still have a healthy even bronze glow and not that awful orange look, and a huge plus is that it won’t transfer to your clothing or bedding. Holy Grail of Self Tanning
