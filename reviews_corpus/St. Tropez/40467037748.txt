I did receive this product for free from influencer for my honest review. This product has a great smell to it especially for being a tanning lotion. As far as the tanning lotion it seems to be very gradual. The tanning I feel is subtle. The product is not greasy on the skin and was easy to apply! Make sure to evenly apply! I would recommend this product to someone looking for an easy quick way to start getting some color. Great smell with some color
