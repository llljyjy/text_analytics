I mean it’s useful and good but as a black person i dont feel like using it personally because well I don’t wanna get any blacker now maybe white people can use it because they really need some color cause they are so pale and translucent but I don’t really feel like using it and also because my skin is really sensitive i cant use it till I get it to my dermatologist and check out the ingredients but u guys should totally try it and buy it though Seems like a good deal ?
