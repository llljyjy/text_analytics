This is the best self tanner you will ever use. Seriously, this is a must have. Super seamless, natural-looking tan, with zero blotchiness because the mist is very fine. I always get compliments on the color too. A much healthier alternative to excessive UV rays (though a healthy amount of sun is still great.)I like to apply after a shower before bed-time and make sure to spray evenly over my face and neck at about 7 inches away. I wipe the very edge of my hairline just, in case the product has built up and in the morning I’m all set, though if you’re having a no-other-face-products kind of day, you could totally wear this out. It gives a subtle dewy glow. It lasts about a week for me.I’ve never had a problem with this product staining any of my fabrics but I always heir on the side of caution and sleep with a shirt that I wouldn’t mind getting stained. I would also put a shirt on my pillow if I had white pillow shams, but mine are red and this product has never stained them.Totally worth the purchase even if you’re just vaguely considering it. Not into it? Exfoliate and return it, though I feel like criticisms on this product are rare. I don’t see how anyone who uses the product correctly and methodically would ever have anything bad to say about it.SERIOUSLY A SUMMER MUST HAVE! ST. TROPEZ, THIS PRODUCT SLAYS.BEST SUMMER PRODUCT EVER! BEST SUMMER PRODUCT EVER!
