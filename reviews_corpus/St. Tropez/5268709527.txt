I receive this from St. Tropez in exchange for a review. I opted to use 3 drops on my face and mixed into my lotion. For body, I used 4 drops per section- chest, arms, back and legs  with my lotion and rubbed it in well.  upon waking up, my skin looked more even and bronzed!!I plan on using this all summer long. I like that I can still use SPF and gets this effect! nan
