So impressed. I can’t believe how not sticky this is..it dried much faster than I was expecting which is such a plus for me. I did feel like I needed to move a bit faster than I’m used to. I didn’t have to stand in front of a fan in the buff like I usually do waiting to dress. I also usually used a powder to help cut the stickiness but I didn’t need it with this. It also didn’t make me smell putrid! The color came out more brown on me than orange even without having a base tan. The final color wasn’t too dark or too light. I was thinking also I wouldn’t approve of the mitt since I usually like one with a thumb area but its cushiony and super soft. I see why this is on the higher end in price once I used it. Color is believable and even once rinsed off which I did after about 91/2 hrs. It ticks all the boxes for me in terms of what I want in a sunless tan. Wasn’t expecting it to be this good
