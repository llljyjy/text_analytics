This is such a good self tanner for my super pale skin! I have probably the whitest skin out of everyone I know, so self tanner is a necessity for me if I want to have a sun kissed glow without sacrificing sun exposure. I love that it’s tinted so you can see where it’s applied, and because it’s meant to be left on for at least 8 hours, the self tanner gives me a realistic “just got back from vacation“ tan. USE A MITT! It not only saves my palms from getting stained, but it helps apply the self tanner evenly. No sunburn for me!
