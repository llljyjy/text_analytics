This is BY FAR the best self tanner Iâ€™ve ever used on my face.Everything about it is just amazing. First, it is extremely easy to apply, I like to mix in some drops with my moisturizer (the amount of drops depends on how deep I want my tan, I usually do between 3 and 6) then,  I just apply it onto the face and I can already feel and see the hydration in my skin and the glow it instantly gives me is gorgeous. After 8 hours my face tone is even and I am left with the most beautiful sunkissed look. Love it so much
