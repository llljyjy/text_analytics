It is getting normal for me to get self-tanning before I go to any vacation. St. Tropez is my favorite brand in self-tan topics. I loved this new addition to the brand. Since the first application I started to notice a light and beautiful tan in my skin. It has been intensifying gradually. I used a special St. Tropez glove to applied the lotion on my skin and avoid any residue in my hands. It leaves my skin smooth, glowy and hydrated. (Not orange-ish color). The watermelon essence is pleasant and refreshing. It says that provides firmer looking skin, Iâ€™m waiting for that part, I think it is too soon to notice. If you want self-tanning this brand is amazing. My fave brand for self-tanning
