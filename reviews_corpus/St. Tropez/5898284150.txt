The first thing that stood out to me was that it doesn’t have that horrible self tanning smell! The drops were easy to add into my body lotion as I applied it. The color was subtle but definitely a healthy glow! It also applies evenly and didn’t leave any weird streaks - I did not go over the top to blend it in either. Does not smell bad!!
