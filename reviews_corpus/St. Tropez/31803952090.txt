I had high hopes for these self-tan drops, but unfortunately they really didn’t do anything to my skin. The formula felt fine as I applied it, but after letting the color develop for an entire day, I never really saw any difference in the color of my skin. Maybe it left me with a very minimal glow, but nothing that I’d continue to use. Didn’t do much for me
