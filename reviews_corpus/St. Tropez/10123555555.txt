This is the first sunless tanner that didn’t leave me with crazy dark ankles and wrist. It developed beautifully and when you wash away the guide you are left with a natural looking tan that is the perfect shade. Application is super easy and the guide makes it seamless. I didn’t miss anywhere and it blends really nice on hands and feet. The mitt makes it next level. Soft and simple to apply with and equally easy to wash. Beautiful, glowy tan.
