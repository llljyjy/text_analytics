Really enjoyed using this tan. Great easy to follow instructions. I did use a tanning mitt that came with it which helped with easy application and their fore didn’t stain my hands. It was a mousse consistency that smelled so good. Just melted right into the skin and spreaded evenly. I did apply just before bed so that why I could wait 8 hours for the application to work and also did exfoliate my legs prior to tanning for better application. Next day the results were amazing and gave me beautiful even tone glowing legs that looked healthy and looked natural. You wouldn’t think I used a tanning product overtime did get darker which I enjoyed. It also helped cover my dark spots which I was so happy about. Highly recommend this product Natural tan with a beautiful glow
