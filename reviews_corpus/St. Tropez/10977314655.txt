I received this product free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. The first photo is no self tanner and the second is after one use of the gradual tan lotion. It added a little color which will be nice for winter but not as dark as I would like. I recently went on a tropical vacation and I put on my typical self tanner and throughout my trip I used this lotion to keep my other self tanner more even and to help with the longevity. I can honestly say, it was great! It made my tan last for my entire trip and it still looked beautiful at the end. Highly recommend for this method! Great additive
