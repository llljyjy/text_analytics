I’m disappointed. I used to love this brand and have been tanning with them for years. This express tan does not get as dark as I’d like it to but is great for a quick tan. Works best if you leave it on for 5+ hours unless you want a very sheer flow. However usually a large bottle of mouse lasts 3 months+ of tanning for 1-2 times a week. This I only got 3 applications out of. Not sure if my bottle was defective or if they changed something in the last year. Dissapointed
