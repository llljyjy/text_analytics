Sadly, this new version of the Gradual Tan Tinted Lotion isn’t nearly as nice as the original.  This one is thinner and more difficult to blend, and it’s very, very dark; almost black.  Do NOT apply this without wearing a mitt! It will stain your hands in 2.9 seconds flat, and it’ll take a lot of scrubbing to remove that stain.  It does dry fairly quickly, which is good, but my tan looks kind of blotchy and uneven.  I’m sad because I absolutely loved this product before they reformulated it.  This is probably going in the trash. Don't buy this
