This self tanner is amazing. I have tried this brand before and really liked it. I would say this self tan does last about 4 days. It is easy to scrub off when you are trying to remove it. It does have a smell to it but it is not over whelming. It does give you a perfect sunless tan that looks like you just got back from the beach. Definitely recommend. Amazing Self Tanner
