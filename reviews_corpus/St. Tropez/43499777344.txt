I absolutely love this! I’m don’t normally use self tanners but I will be using this forever!!! It’s not streaky or orange. I added 4 drops to my moisturizer and it gave me a gorgeous tan tone without looking fake. I love that you can add a few extra drop to create a darker tone. You tyget to choose how dark you want to be. I am very pale and this gave me a great natural looking glow. It doesn’t have that weird tanning smell either. Incredible
