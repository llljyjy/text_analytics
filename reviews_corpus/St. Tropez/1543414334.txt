First time using any type of self tanner and I’m so glad I got to try this one out! Firstly, it’s super easy to use and the tanning mitt makes it mess free. On first application I noticed a subtle tanning effect, but after a few hours it had gotten a bit darker. I love how soft it made my skin feel. Not sticky at all! Tan goddess!!
