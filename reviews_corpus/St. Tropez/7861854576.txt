I keep forgetting to take pictures of my before and after! I had a decent glow after 3 days of use. However, I noticed darker areas where my skin was dry. The scent is sweet, but not overpowering. As for firming, I it is a surface firming and not something deep that would affect cellulite. The color fades pretty fast when you stop using it. I would recommend using every few days to maintain the tan. Tan fades as easily as it builds
