I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I wish that the directions stated that I needed to moisturize before application so that I could avoid looking like I have dirty knees and ankles BUT the rest of my skin did indeed have a mild and nice tint after only one application. Itâ€™s okay!
