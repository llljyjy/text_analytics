This product is pretty amazing! The scent is heavenly! The application process was easy. I put the product on me 3 times using a fairly large glob of lotion & my skin had developed such a beautiful, natural-looking tan in that amount of time! My only complain is that it didnâ€™t last long after I showered. Beautiful, natural looking results
