I bought this for my face and neck. I was concerned that it wouldn’t be even and the spray wouldn’t be fine enough. I was wrong. The spray makes it insanely easy to put on. After I shower, I spray it on and then just let it dry. Once it’s dried you can apply other products. I have fair skin (not porcelain) with cool/pink undertones and a lot of self tanners come out orange on me. This doesn’t turn orange at all. The first time you use it the color change is noticeable but subtle. So it’s easy to reapply and build up to the tan you want. Works great, No orange!
