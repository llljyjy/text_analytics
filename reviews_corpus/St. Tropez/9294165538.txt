Loved this tanning lotion! The packaging is simple and beautiful. The lotion is a white, thicker consistency. Love the scent! Not that nasty smell normal tanning lotions have and definitely not as orange. Applies smoothly and easily, rubs on clear, and adds moisture to my skin. I have seen the brand but never used before. I trust the quality, and price point is 2x higher than your drugstore Jergens products, but worth it! Full results appeared over night so I would recommend applying the day before an event. Used this for an October wedding after not having tanned all summer and had great results! Great tan & scent!
