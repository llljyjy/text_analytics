I have an issue with tanning solutions where it irritates my sensitive skin! There’s only a few options I’ve found that don’t make me itch like crazy or give me a rash! This one from st. Tropez is probably the best I’ve found for a subtle bronzed glow! Just one drop mixed in my moisturizer and the results are great the next morning! nan
