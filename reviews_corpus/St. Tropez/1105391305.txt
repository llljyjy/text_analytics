This is garbage. It does absolutely nothing, it’s overpriced, AND it causes acne. I love St. Tropez products. I’ve used them all. This is a huge miss from them. It imparts NO color- I used it alone, with lotion, maximum drops etc. I got nothing. I’m very fair, and I always pick up a lot of color from self tanner. Not this. Save your money. I had to return. Worst St. Tropez product. No tan, causes acne.
