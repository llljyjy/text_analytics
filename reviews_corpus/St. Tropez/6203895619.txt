I was so shocked by the lovely scent of these drops! I had heard good things about St. Tropez tanning products but I had never tried them. I figured drops would be the best thing to start with as I was sure they wouldn’t be too intense. I was right. The tan is buildable and beginner friendly. I actually applied this with a brush just to not get it on my hands but still I managed to somehow get a tiny drop or two to stain my hand which looked intense but on the face it blended so nicely. I actually wanted to have a slight bronzed glow in the contours of my face rather than my entire face so I just applied about 4 drops directly to my brush then on the face on those areas and it looked subtle and blended, not patchy at all. It definitely gives a nice glow to the skin, they feel hydrating too. I loved the consistency which resembles a dense serum. It’s not too runny or too thick or greasy-like. It applied so nicely with the brush and felt fool proof. I’m so glad to have these drops for whenever I feel like looking sun-kissed! My legs, too, will really appreciate them. Beginner friendly and non-irritating
