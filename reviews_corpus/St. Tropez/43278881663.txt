Love this stuff! It really feels like a lotion, I was sorta expecting it to be more oily but it’s a great texture. The smell is great, not super chemical-y, so that was awesome, too. It did gradually tan my legs, but key word gradual! The first application wasn’t super noticeable but it got more evident as I continued to use it. Love love love it!
