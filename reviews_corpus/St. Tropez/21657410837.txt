Iâ€™ve had bad self tanning experiences in the past so I was a little hesitant at first but let me just say that this is the easiest thing ever! The self tanning mit + the mousse has such a luxurious feeling and my skin felt amazing after I washed it off. It also gave me the most beautiful tan ever. Definitely will be recommending this to all of my friends/family! Best self tanner!
