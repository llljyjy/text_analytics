This is my holy grail! I used to work at a tanning salon and tanned in beds, got spray tans ($50 each) - as someone trying to take better care of their skin but stay tan cost effectively, this is the best. I can usually get 10-15 tabs out of one bottle ($3-$5 per tan) and it usually lasts 7 days and fades gradually. I recommend putting it on in the morning after showering/shaving/exfoliating, let dry for 25 min before getting dressed, and wearing for 10+ hours. I usually will shower right before bed - I donâ€™t suggest sleeping in this. Always feel more confident after using, the color is natural and it smells quite good. 10/10 Awesome!!! Read for tips ~
