This product made my skin appear substantially tanner without appearing orange or fake. I often struggle with fake tanners appearing streaky on me, but this one didn’t leave lines or anything. I’m very happy with this product. My skin had no side effects and it made me feel a little confidence boost. I’m in Seattle and wanted a bit of a summery glow, so had to fake it. This product is perfect! I feel like I look a bit healthier, but no sun damage! Glowy, healthy looking false tan
