I can’t speak to this product’s tanning abilities because I had to wash it off after ten minutes. It’s the most heavily fragrances product I’ve ever tried and both my boyfriend and I felt it was so strong it actually burned our nostrils. Smells like cheap floral perfume. I’m mad about it. HEAVILY fragranced
