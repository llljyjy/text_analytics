That was my first time using a self-tan; for me, I had one part on my arm that was super white due to the watch. Because of that, I decided to try that part. First, I used it according to the directions, and since I needed to wait for four h to 8h, I just saw the result the next day. It went well and blended with my skin tone, but I used one part I shouldnâ€™t have, so I had some marks wrong. My tip is to use a glove to spread and try to do even. Good self-tan
