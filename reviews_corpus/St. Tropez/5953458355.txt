This has always been my favorite sunless tanning company. This product is up there in the top 3 tanning mousses ever! Itâ€™s so easy to apply. Just use the mitt and make sure to massage it evenly into your skin and you wont get any streaks or uneven coloring. Also I am very fair skinned and this tanning mousse gives me a natural looking tan, no orange mess here. After application this tan will last me for about 6 days before fading away.
