This St. Tropez Luxe Tan Tonic is really good. It’s very lightweight and hydrating. It’s very smooth. One drop is enough for me to have a nice tan glow, I mix it with my face serum, and in 4-8 hours I see the results right away. If you want a more deeper darker tan you can do 2 drops, it’s very customizable, that’s what I like.The only thing is the scent is a bit overwhelming for me, it’s too strong for me. Customizable and hydrating
