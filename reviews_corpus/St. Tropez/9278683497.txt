These glow drops are perfect for blending your face to the rest of your tan. I love using it on my face, neck & chest. If you aren’t a fan of the smell of self tanner, you’ll love this because it literally smells like a perfume (in a good way). The fragrance in this product didn’t irritate my skin either. It smells so good & gives the perfect glowy look that you can adjust. Notable mention - it has niacinamide & we love that! nan
