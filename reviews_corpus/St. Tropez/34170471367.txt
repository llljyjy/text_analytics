I was pleasantly surprised that these tan drops worked on my brown skin. I mixed about 6 drops with my body lotion and it went on feeling so smooth! The drops themselves are luxuriously thick oil so I don’t think it’s necessary to add them to the lotion. I let the tan develop for about 8 hours and I look so naturally golden and sun kissed. I definitely would recommend these drops! These made my brown skin glow
