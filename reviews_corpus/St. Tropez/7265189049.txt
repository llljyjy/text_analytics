Just in time for the Summer! Going on vacation but I have no time to tan so this worked wonderfully! This has a fragrance to it which I’m not too mad about but it applies very smoothly and doesn’t not leave streaks. The only issue is that the oil is clear so it’s hard to gauge which areas have been applied and which i missed. Overall, a great product. nan
