I was very excited to try this self tanner, and intrigued by all of the bonus ingredients (Niacinamide, High Molecular Weight Hyaluronic Acid, Echinacea,  and Vitamin E & Skin Conditioners, which promise to deliver added hydration, reduced redness & a more even skin tone). I am very pale, and tanning outside is out for me, and I would never consider damaging my skin in a tanning bed) so I was kind of nervous and apprehensive about self tanning, however this product is really hard to make mistakes with, especially when used with the velvet mitt.It left me with a gorgeous tan glow, my only issue is that I wish it would be less transferable onto fabrics. nan
