I’ve really only had good fake tan results with mousse, but the idea of a serum-type texture intrigued me. There are even some nice ingredients like Niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C&E, and detoxifying flower extract. Instructions advise 2-6 drops on face and/or body and states the tan develops in 4-8 hours. Because I am so fair, I started by mixing four drops with enough moisturizer for one leg (x2) and went to sleep with that “baked cookies” fake tan smell. 24 hours later I see no difference. So I tried again by moisturizing a few hours before applying six drops directly to each leg and then again wait 24 hours before making any judgement. But still, no noticeable color change even though I am ghostly white and generally have a hard time finding subtle tanner. Additionally, though they state there is a slight guide color I personally see no difference when applying the drops which makes it difficult to know if it’s blended well. The drops dry down fast but can feel slightly tacky and will stain your light-colored clothes if you don’t let it set. For the price, I this is not worth it to me because the amount you would need for your body would most likely cause you to go through a bottle rather fast. So I wouldn’t really recommend this for the body, but if you tan your face/chest this might be great for you. Best for Smaller Areas; Subtle Results
