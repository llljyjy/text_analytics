I tried Self Tan Luxe Whipped Creme Mousse and their mitt. It is promised to give Medium Golden Tan.I LOVE self-tan, but am I good in applying it? No. So, I am always nervous trying new Self Tanners. This Self Tan Mousse contains Niacinamide, Vitamin E and Echinaea and Hyaluronic acid. I was impressed with several factors; 1. It doesn’t have your usual “stink” of self tan. It is very subtle and after 8 hours I could only smell more refreshing and faint fragrance.2. It is tinted and you can see the color you are applying. It gives instant tan even though color develops in 8 hours.3. Application is easy and luxurious. Each time I applied I never had streaks. Fades evenly as well.4. It dries almost instantly. Usually I have to wait at least 10min. This one is ready to go after you apply it.5. Tan is natural looking. I love the look6. My skin didn’t feel tight nor itchy. My skin felt hydrated and nice.I personally am a fan and will continue using this So good even for clumsy people
