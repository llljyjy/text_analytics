Tried the tanning drops on my face for the first time and loved the results! I am tan skinned already but need a little more in the winter time so these drops were perfect. I applied with my moisturizer and could see a difference a few hours later. It doesn’t leave your skin orange, it’s a nice tan shade. I recommend them! Great drops for a quick tan!
