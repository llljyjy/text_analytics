I’ve never used a self tanning product over. I have been paranoid about streaks and orange. I finally took the plunge and was super impressed using this product! It was super easy to apply, with the mitt wasn’t messy to apply, and wasn’t uncomfortable to have on my skin. A little tacky as it set, but I’m pretty sure that typical as it works. The color results were really pretty. Not orange at all,  very natural looking, not an over the top tan…especially for my fair skin. Definitely product I’ll keep using as the results were what I would want in a self tanner! Amazing Tanner
