I really liked this self tanner. I’ve been using another popular brand of tanner for about a year and I thought I liked it until I tried this! It has a nice scent and I really like how foamy the product gets. It went on pretty dark - I was nervous it would be too dark for me but it washed off perfectly into a very natural looking tan. I like how it’s buildable too if I wanted it to be darker. My new go to self tanner! nan
