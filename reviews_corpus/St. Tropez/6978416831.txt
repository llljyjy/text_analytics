This is my new self tanner for the summer! I’ve used a couple self tanners in the past but I could never really find one I liked. It was so easy to apply this mousse with the applicator mitt. It left my skin feeling so smooth and glowy! I made sure to apply and rub in circular motions and when I woke up I wasn’t blotchy or streaky! Looks so natural! Best self tanner
