I rarely try to do self tanning at home. I’ve try few brands before , some would make me orange , some would stain my clothes even after letting a dry up. I was super skeptical to try the  St.Tropez Self Tan Luxe Whipped Crème Mousse. After trying it I honestly love the texture of it and how fast it drys up. I love the color of my skin after using it. It looks and feels super natural , it also does not stain my clothes which I love. I also like that it’s super easy to apply .  I would definitely recommend this self tanner mousse to anyone who’s looking for a great at home tan. Amazing Product
