I’m extremely pale skinned and this stuff is a dream come true. A lot of the negative reviews seem to be from people without pale skin who are looking for a much darker tan. I’ve tried a lot of other self tanner and had problems with it looking orange, not building well, or being very streaky. This stuff looks great after ONE use and isn’t streaky at all. If you didn’t cover a spot as well as the rest, it really just looks like a weird tan line rather than streaky self tanner. I’ve used with without exfoliating and it works just the same. I do put regular lotion on my elbows, wrists, ankles, knees, and shin bones first. It has a good smell at first but then definitely fades to a normal self tanner smell. It doesn’t bother me though since the result is so perfect. Miracle for Super Pale Skin
