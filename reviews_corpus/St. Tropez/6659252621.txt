I have never used self tan before, I’m always very pale in the winter so I thought I’d try something new this year. It comes in a droplet format and the solution is an oily clear color. It smells delightful. A floral fragrance. It goes on easily. It made me tan and I really liked it. I recommend. Very impressed!
