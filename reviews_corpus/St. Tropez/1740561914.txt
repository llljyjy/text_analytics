The 15 seconds I spend on this 3x a week is prob the quickest way i have to look great. I do 3-5 sprays on my phase then rub in and distribute VERY WELL with a moisturizer.  Don’t use too much, you need to play around a little to find your way with it.  I do find it’s important to exfoliate or it starts to get a little patchy if you are applying daily. Can't be without it anymore!
