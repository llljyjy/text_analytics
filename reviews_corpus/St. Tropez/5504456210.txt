There’s always a first for everything and this is my first tanning experience and I think I’m hooked. I never got the hype behind self tanning. Now I get it, it’s time consuming 8 hrs is a lot I have to say but it was a nice introduction to the brand. The product is moose texture and has a nice smell to it (which I’ve heard tanning products can be off putting when it comes to the scent). It spreads out evenly did not leave streak marks. It gave me a golden sunkissed tan I’m fair so the color was nice not orange looking that I can atest for. Overall I’m happy with my results but I wish they can come out with an express tanning product for busy moms like me cause 8 hrs is a lot of hours. So I’m taking a one star off for the long application time. My thoughts as a First time tanner?
