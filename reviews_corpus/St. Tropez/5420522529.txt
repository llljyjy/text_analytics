This is the second time of trying self tanning drops so I was a bit nervous the first night of application! I applied a few drops, as reference I am a medium olive tone though my face is a bit lighter. I was worried it would be too dark but in the morning I noticed a slight bronzer look that I enjoy specially during these winter months. I do think the scent is a bit strong for me though. nan
