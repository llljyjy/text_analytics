Tis the season to be bronzed and glowing during the holidays with me and St. Tropez Tonic Glow Drops Skincare facts about this product: •Includes Niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, Echinacea, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Flower Extract •Rejuvenates skin by plumping skin and reducing redness •You can customize your glow based upon your self-tanning preference, which is very convenientFor example, you can use 2 drops for a light glow, 4 drops for a medium to golden tan and 6 drops for a deep bronze The way I customize my glow is by applying 3 or 4 drops to my face depending on the glow I want. By adding these glow drops to my face, my complexion is radiant. I love how this product makes my skin feel soft and dewy. I also like how this product isn’t sticky in texture. Sometimes tanning products can be sticky and apply to the skin leaving a patchy appearance. However, this product goes on clear and it applies smoothly. I like to either add these drops to my moisturizer or add the drops alone without any other products. This product does have a tanning scent, which is quite strong, but if you are used to tanning products and scents then it shouldn’t be a problem. After 8 hours or longer of wear, I can conclude that this product is effective. I have used this product for less than a week. It’s convenient due to the easy application process and its premium quality for a self-tan at-home treatment. You can apply to your face or body based on your preference.  If you’re like me and you enjoy using high quality tanning products, then I highly recommend this product! Thank you St. Tropez for this complimentary gift! A must-have tanning product
