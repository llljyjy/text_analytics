The smell is actually quite good comparing to other tanners, BUT even leaving it on overnight, there isnâ€™t much of a tan. It also transfers and smears big time. I put my hand on my arm and woke up with an orange hand and a handprint on my arm. Luckily, this tanner is pretty easy for fixing mistakes. Not my favorite. Especially for the price. I expected more. nan
