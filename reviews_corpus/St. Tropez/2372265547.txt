I always trust St. Tropez products for tanning since to me they are the star of the show for self tanning products, and I’m a big fan of their 1 minute mousse. The dropper is convenient to use and I like that the drops aren’t a dark intimidating color right off the bat, since I’m so fair. It has a slight fruity scent that offsets some of the self tan scent. I need to play around with my application some more to get the perfect amount, it was a little darker than I wanted since it’s a bit one size fits all but customizable depending on how much you use. Developed fast on my legs! nan
