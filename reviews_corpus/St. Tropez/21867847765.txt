I love golden glowing skin and this definitely helped me achieve that. I squeezed about 4 1/2 drops into my palm and quickly applied it onto my face. It has a nice subtle scent by the way. It dried quickly and skin felt immediately soft and looked so dewy. About 5 hours later I noticed my face was GLOWING! I had a nice natural looking tan without one streak. This is FANTASTIC and I’m super happy because it’s super easy to apply. I love that the only thing I need to cleanse is my hands after application. If you want to tan without harmful ingredients or exposure to sun rays then I suggest checking this out! I’m going to keep this on deck because it’s wonderful. Glow safely with these drops
