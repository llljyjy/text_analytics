So, the tan I get from this is great. HOWEVER, the smell is RANK. As you first put the lotion on, it smells amazing. But give it about 5 minutes, and it smells just awful. I was so upset by that, because I’ve been looking everywhere for a tanning lotion that doesn’t smell. The awful tan smell also stays on your skin until after like two or three showers. Overall, good tan, good smell (AT FIRST), but I just can’t get over that nasty tanning lotion smell. Watermelon smell lasts for MAYBE 5 minutes
