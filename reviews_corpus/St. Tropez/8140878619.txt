Overall the product itself is fantastic, glowy within an hour, tanned within 2 and full potential by the next day. Only reason I don’t rate it 5 stars is the smell :( sadly it’s a noticeable tanner smell & only thing that helps is showering (which you can’t do for the first 8 hours or so!) Although I STILL  buy this tanner over any other one regardless of the smell. nan
