I love how I can use this in so many different ways! I’ve used it on it’s own but with the winter months coming up I love it just as much when I mix it in with my moisturizer. I always really enjoy that I can decide how light or dark I want to go with it. It doesn’t go too yellow or orange on me It’s a very natural looking tan! nan
