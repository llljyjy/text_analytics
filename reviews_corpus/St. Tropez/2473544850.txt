Love using St Tropez on my tan brown skin! I struggled to find a quick and easy tanning solution for an occasion or even going on vacation. This does it for me! It gives me that beautiful golden tan even for a wedding I have to attend in the winter. It’s super easy to use - just use the glove and it spreads so easily. I didn’t have any problems with blotchiness. Also, this does have a scent which I personally liked. Highly recommend this to everyone who wants to achieve that golden summer look! nan
