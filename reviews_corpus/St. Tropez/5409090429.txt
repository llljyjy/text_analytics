I had been hearing so many great things about this brand, my sister is always tanning with it at home! I’ve never felt comfortable going to a place so these drops seemed like the perfect thing to start trying. It’s nice that it can be gradual and for your face and body because god know I need some color this winter. I like this better because it leave the skin soft and easy to apply where you don’t need someone else’s helps, kind of like applying essential oil. I’m trying it on my legs first to help even out the out. Perfect glow for the winter!
