I was so excited to try the new gifted by Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare FIRMx Collagen Face and Eye Hydra-Gel Patches and was not disappointed! First off it’s a great deal because the the product comes with 90 patches so you get a lot of patches. These patches are made with seven forms of collagen and collagen supporting ingredients so they are real strong and high quality, packed with amazing ingredients including hyaluronic acid, squalane and niacinamide. These pachas come with both eye and face masks which is a great deal and come with eye patches to target fine lines, firm skin, smooth skin, and make skin appear more smooth. The other patches are for nasolabial folds, lip lines and forehead. I’ve been applying to all these areas and mostly eye patches and lip nasolabial areas leaving the patches on for 15 minutes to 20 minutes and then patting the remaining serum onto these areas and have seen amazing results! My skin appears smoother, smoother and more youthful. I’m surprised by how fast I’ve seen results, telling me how high quality these patches are. It is made without a lot of bad ingredients such as parabans and sulfates just to name a few so I feel good using them. I’ve also been applying everyday and am so happy with the results I highly recommend! Perfect patches
