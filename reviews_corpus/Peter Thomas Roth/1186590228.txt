I received this complimentary to try and I’m glad I did. I really like it. I do think I need to use 2 pads though because I don’t feel there is enough moisture/liquid to cover my face. It stings just a little. I’m still only using twice a night because I don’t want to use it too often. At first it was a little drying but as my skin got use to it it wasn’t anymore. nan
