These retinol pads are incredible for anyone with fine lines or wrinkles, or even if you just want to prevent them! They provide excellent results without drying your skin out, and make you feel like you’ve put all kinds of work into your skin even though all you’re doing is a quick little pat! I love the dispenser, it makes it super easy to just grab and go. This is a great skincare product for someone who doesn’t want to feel like skincare is a chore. It’s really easy to just pat it on, sit, and wait. And since I started using these a couple weeks ago, I’ve had visible results in combination with the resurfacing serum. Truly grateful to influenster for letting me try out such an incredible product!This pairs so well with the serum that I would honestly urge you to try both of them! If they’ve done so much for me, I can’t even imagine the results you’d see on skin that was more damaged or uneven. I’ve already noticed less redness and an overall more even complexion and I can’t wait to see the other results I get! Awesome and super easy to use!
