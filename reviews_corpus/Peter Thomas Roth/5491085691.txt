I received this product for review, and it was great timing. I had just visited the dermatologist who suggested I start using retinol. I have somewhat sensitive skin so I wasnâ€™t sure what would work for me. This product has been a great start. The first week or so, it did make my face tingly and slightly red upon application. But over time that reaction has subsided and I am using it nightly. My skin is noticeably smoother, cleaner, brighter. It did put me through a few weeks of purging. But that has also subsided. I am very happy with the results of this product after about 4 weeks of use. I would definitely recommend. Does what it claims!
