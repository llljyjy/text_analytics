I love that these patches come in two different sizes, crescent moon shaped ones for under the eyes and oval shaped ones for elsewhere on the face like the forehead and lip lines, because they are so versatile.  I recommend keeping the entire package in the fridge so they are extra cold and refreshing.  The under eye patches have been very effective at depuffing my eyes in the morning.  I have been lining up two oval patches side by side to minimize forehead lines and using half of an oval patch to reduce the look of my 11s.  This product comes with mini tweezers that help keep it more hygienic since you donâ€™t have to touch more patches than you need for any given occasion.  The patches are delicate so be gentle when grabbing them or they may rip.  On the bright side, it is easy to tear them into the exact shape you want to fit any area of the face.  Unlike other patches which slip down on the face as soon as you apply them, these actually stay in place.  After leaving them on for 15 minutes, my skin feels firm yet hydrated. Helps depuff eyes & smooth forehead lines!
