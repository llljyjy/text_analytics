These worked better than I thought they did. I looked at a picture from 4 weeks ago and now and there is a noticeable difference in the lines by my eyes, on my forehead, and between my eyebrows. I couldn’t tell much difference between these pads and the serum—I think it’s just personal preference for what you like for application. My skin is super sensitive but I didn’t have any issues with this. No redness or irritation. It helped some with texture though that is less noticeable to me than seeing the difference in fine lines. Good for fine lines, sensitive skin
