It’s an ok product! Have to say I end up buying it because of their TikTok add, but Ever since I only used it twice, and is lost on my drawer. I particularly didn’t like that it react to water, so basically you can’t use any skincare on the under eye area with it, this was harsh since the product itself adds dryness to the area, felt as it was stressing my under eyes and was so relief  to take it off after use. I don’t think I will buy it again. nan
