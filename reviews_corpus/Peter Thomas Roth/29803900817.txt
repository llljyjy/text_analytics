I am new to using retinoids as part of my nighttime skincare routine and was worried that the retinoid would be too strong and would irritate my skin. I introduced it slowly by using it every other day.The yellow cream melts into the skin and does not leave behind any unwanted tacky or greasy residue on the skin. Surprisingly, I did not experience any redness or irritation. I havenâ€™t used the product long enough to tell a difference in my fine lines but the ingredients are amazing and I am certain I will see results with continued use.I received this product complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth. nan
