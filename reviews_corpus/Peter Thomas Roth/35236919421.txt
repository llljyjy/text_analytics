It works as described but some cons.  I’m 56 and over the past 10 years my under eye bags have gotten more noticeable. I’ve tried multiple products and have been using skincare for 4 decades. This was the first product that actually tightened and removed puffiness. It does work as described and removed under eye bags within minutes.  Use and apply as directed, very very small amount. If you use too much you will see a white film.  It does feel tight and it takes time getting used to that. I did notice that after some time with it on (a couple of hours) the white film started to appear.  The firming effect is temporary as stated, but I did not realize the product would show a white film as it wore off.  Also, I went out in very cold weather (15 degrees) and it turned white within minutes, I’m assuming from the cold temp. I’m curious if summer heat will have the same effect. One other issue I had was you cannot put anything over this, like concealer. Any liquid causes it to loosen and not work. You can put powder over it but that made it look dry, at least I personally did not like the way it looked.  For now I will use this for short outings and hope to get use to how it feels. Works as described, but some cons.
