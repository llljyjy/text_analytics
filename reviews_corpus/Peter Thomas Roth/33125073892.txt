So I’ve had a chance to use this for a few months and now will write a review. I am not new to this type of product, I’ve used Easy Eye Solutions tuck serum for years and loved it. So decided to try this out due to the amount you get. While it works very well, I noticed white crystals and the “serum“ is chunky when dispensing. I thought maybe it was just at the beginning of tube but it has been every time I dispense it from day one. These crystals and chunks deposit on the under eye and stick there like crazy glue, super hard to remove and it’s very disappointing. I don’t know if I got an old tube and some of the contents have crystallized? How is this supposed to go on smooth when it’s chunky???? It’s definitely a deal breaker and I will absolutely not buy this again for as much as I paid on here. I’ll go back to Easy Eye. White crystals in the serum....yuck
