I absolutely love these patches to keep my skin hydrated and nourished! I love that you can put them anywhere and the help smooth out fine lines and soften the face! They give such a great plumping effect under the eyes as well so I love using them before makeup application. Also in between the eyebrows and on smile lines works great! I can always tell a noticeable difference in my faceâ€™s hydration! Huge difference!
