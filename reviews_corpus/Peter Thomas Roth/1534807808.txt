I love most PTR products and have used the anti-aging face wash for years. Unfortunately, these just did not hit the mark for me.  I’ve tried them quite a few times - have left them on overnight, have put them on in the morning and left them on all day, etc - and have not seen any results at all.   (I’ve used several other brands and have always seen a difference from when I apply the stickers/patches to when they are removed. I have seen blackheads and whiteheads on the stickers when they are taken off.)  With these PTR patches, nothing at all.  Don’t waste your money/ Disappointing and not worth the price at all
