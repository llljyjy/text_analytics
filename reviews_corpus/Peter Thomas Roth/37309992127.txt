These face & eye gel patches are pretty awesome. I like that this includes both eye patches and smile lines, so I can plump and firm the areas I need to in one convenient package. The eye patches fit my contour properly and they really help plump my undereye area, which generally suffers from inconsisntent sleep. After continued use, I am noticing a little bit of firming in addition to the plumping in my smile lines. I also put this on a small forehead wrinkle and it seems to plump it prior to use. These are one of the better eye patches I have used and I would definitely recommend. nan
