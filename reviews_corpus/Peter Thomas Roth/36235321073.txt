I purchased FirmX collagen serum first. After noticeable results I decided to try FirmX peeling gel. Read a lot of great reviews, wasn’t sure what to expect. I am almost 50 years old and have never experienced an exfoliation such as this! I applied to clean, dry skin and began. Wow! Since my first time to use I only let it stay for under 2 minutes, rinsed off. unbelievable results. My face felt like silk. My nose pores are more obvious or at least to me, they were cleaned out! I can’t wait to exfoliate!! If your skeptical, you won’t be afterwards!! POURfectly exfoliated
