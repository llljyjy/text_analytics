A little bit of this product goes a long ways. My skin is extra dry during the cold months and I normally have trouble with dry patches and cracked lips. This product goes on silky and it stays on all night. My skin feels so moisturized and soft. I also rub some left over on my lips and they are smooth now and no cracks. WOW! Is all I can say about this product itâ€™s a must have for dry skin. Wow wow wow!
