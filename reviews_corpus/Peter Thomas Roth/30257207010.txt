The Max Clear Invisible Sunscreen by Peter Thomas Roth works great as a primer and a sunscreen. I like the gel texture that instantly absorbs and evens skin. My skin definitely looks more even after application. This is a great way to protect your skin from the sun while inhancing it. Great priming sunscreen
