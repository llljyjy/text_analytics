This mask is very nice. I turned 31 this year and throughout the 10 weeks or so that it took me to use up this mask I had multiple ppl ask me how old I was and be surprised when I answered. I credit it to sunscreen and this mask. It got to the point where I would allow myself to sleep with my makeup on (if I was feeling lazy) if I knew I would be using this product the next day. It restarts my skin, it feels fresh and looks even and hydrated. The only downside is that this really is actual mud (it’s odorless tho). I have to pair it with days that I shower bc otherwise getting it off at the sink makes a mess. It still makes a mess in your shower but that’s a little bit easier to control. I found myself not using a bath mat when I showered this off bc it was such a pain having to rinse off the bath mat really well afterwards. The black of the bottle isn’t a label. The bottle is clear. The product is black and it gets everywhere when rinsing off. It’s a great mask but you might find yourself having to alter your routine to use it frequently. GOOD but messy
