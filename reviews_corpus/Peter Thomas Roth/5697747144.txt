I started using these peel pads and their serum beginning in December. I have been using both products practically everyday aside from when I had some hormonal acne. I waited for my acne to heal before continuing to use the Even Smoother line. I have combination skin and some milia on my cheeks. After using the serum and peel pads for a week, I could see and feel the milia had shrunk! I would use the serum most of the time and the peel pads once or twice a week. The peel pads did tingle more intensely than the serum but it wasn’t too bad and didn’t leave my skin red or anything. nan
