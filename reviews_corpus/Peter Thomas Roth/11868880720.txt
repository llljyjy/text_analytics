First, I love skincare that is convenient. I am not lazy, but let’s just say that I am more likely to be consistent with a product that makes it easy for me. This is it. I started with these a few times a week, as directed, and increased as time went on. I didn’t have any noticeable irritation and my skin tolerated it really well. I maybe felt a tiny bit of tingling with the first few applications. Nothing uncomfortable. I started to notice a difference in softness/texture almost immediately. Within a few weeks, I noticed improvement with uneven skin tone, and overall appearance. This is definitely going to become a staple in my skincare routine especially when I am considering ongoing maintenance. Convenience is key!
