[Gifted by PTR] I’ve been wanting new hydra-gel eye patches so was thrilled to be receiving these to try. I love that there are two shapes, one to use for my under eye area and one to use for any other parts of my face. I had recently felt like I had more lines on my forehead than before and quickly used to target the area. I do think I’ve seen some improvement from consistently using it, but am still monitoring progress through continued use. The price is a bit steep, but I will say that I do enjoy using them and appreciate that I’m able to see improvement. nan
