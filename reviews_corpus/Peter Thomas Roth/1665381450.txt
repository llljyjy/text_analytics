I am crazy about these peel pads. They are gentle enough to use daily and I can definitely see a difference in my skin since I started using them. I love the fact that they gently exfoliate but they donâ€™t leave a sticky residual like some similar pads from PTR and Exuvience. I highly recommend these peel pads for all skin types, especially acne prone. PTRs Best Peel Pads to date! I love them!
