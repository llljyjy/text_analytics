My system for this product is to use a soft eyeshadow brush that’s slightly damp. I put a small dab of product (grain of rice size) on the back of my hand and dip the damp brush into it, then apply under my eyes with upward strokes. If I get some residual white spots, I use the cleaned damp brush to even them out. I will say that when you get the magic combination that works for you, the product is amazing. But yes, it absolutely is prone to leaving a white residue, even when applied carefully. I don’t know if I’d buy it again, but I’m not dissatisfied with my purchase and love love love it when the alchemy works. Magic formula
