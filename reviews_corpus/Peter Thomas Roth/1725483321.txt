this product has been on my list for so long, so i finally purchased last month! i don’t care for the smell, but do like how smooth it makes my skin feels after using it. a little goes a long way, i’ll have this product for a while. i have combination skin that veers on sensitive at times. i experienced the slight tingling or burning sensation at the first application, which dissipated after a couple of minutes; however, i no longer experience this sensation. i only plan on using this once per week. happy with my purchase so far! giving it 4 stars because while my skin does feel smoother after using, it does not look “brighter“, nor does it clear pore congestion. finally tried this! great for smoothing skin
