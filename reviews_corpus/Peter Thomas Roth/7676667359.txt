I got this instead of the inkey list vitamin C serum just to try and it’s ok… I don’t really like how thick it is and oily it makes my skin feel but I do have very sensitive skin, and it’s stated as a moisturizer not a serum so! It’s pretty expensive for what you get, and there’s a super faint smell to it that I’m not a huge fan of but it does go on nice, and works into the skin well. nan
