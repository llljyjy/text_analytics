This product was complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare in return for an honest review.The Peter Thomas Roth Pro Strength Vitamin A|C|E Retinoid Treatment definitely lives up to its claims. I already started seeing results after the first use, so I’m sure after 4 weeks it’ll be even more apparent. After the first use my skin was already smoother, hydrated, and more plump than it had previously been. I’m actually really impressed. I like that the treatment is unscented. It absorbs into the skin quickly and you feel can feel the hydration right away. I definitely recommend this product! nan
