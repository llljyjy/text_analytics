I have oily skin and thought this would be a light, water-based spf that would nicely absorb into my skin like usual water-based moisturizers but boy was I wrong ðŸ¤¡ Canâ€™t even go a few minutes with this on before my glasses will be sliding off my nose. Super disappointed because of the price point. I can definitely skip moisturizer using this, especially in the summer. But it was still lightweight, which was nice. But definitely not something I will ever purchase again. Greasy AFFF :(
