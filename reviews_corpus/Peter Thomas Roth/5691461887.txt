I see that some of the lower reviews here are from people who miss this old formula of this product. I personally have never tried the old version, but I am extremely happy with this one. This is the only hyaluronic acid serum I have tried that has no sticky feeling to it whatsoever. I also can use the tiniest drop of this and easily spread it to cover my whole face, so despite being a fairly small bottle with a fairly high price, it lasts a very long time and is well worth it. nan
