I was so excited to receive the Peter Thomas Roth Max Clear Invisible sunscreen! I’ve been on the hunt for a great everyday sunscreen to get into the habit of applying SPF everyday right after my skincare routine. So far I really like this one! It’s no frills, not greasy nor mattifying, very comfortable and wears well on top of my skincare. I love the packaging too. I love most PTR products and this was no different! nan
