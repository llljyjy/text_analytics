I really liked this serum. It’s formula is very easy to apply and feels good on my skin. I immediately start feeling a tightness that is dissolved when I wake up in the mornings. The skin then feels super soft and feels great! I have not had any problems with fine lines and wrinkles but this feels like the perfect start to make sure they don’t happen! The serum didn’t smell anything to me and I only applied it twice a week as it was recommended. I do have sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin in any way! Soft serum
