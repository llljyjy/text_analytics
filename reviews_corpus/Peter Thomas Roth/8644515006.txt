I have been using this sunscreen for YEARS. The formula is unmatched.. the reason for my lack of stars is because the last 2-3 bottles Iâ€™ve purchased have been damaged upon arrival and the bottle and lid just started to disintegrate every time you use it. It is frustrating and a bit disappointing to spend a bit more money and a quality product from a great brand, only for it to crumble after each use. :( nan
