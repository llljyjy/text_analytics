I’m not the person who see results immediately. But here I’ve noticed my skin get brighter, healthier and feels fresh. I like that it absorbs quickly and it doesn’t leave the skin feeling sticky. This can kind of tingle the skin but in a good way. I have very sensitive skin, mostly dry  The way I used this product was, serum everyday at night, before bed. And the resurfacing pads once or twice a week. The package is very comfortable but I don’t like a pink color. Try this product! Your skin will definitely feel softer and younger! You’re going to love it! Great product
