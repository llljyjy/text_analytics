This is a great sunscreen primer.  I have been wearing it everyday for last two weeks and have not experienced any issues under my makeup or with my skincare.  I have oily skin and I find this sunscreen to be really great for oily skin.  It dries down to a very matte blurring finish.   I have never used a SPF that actually blurs my skin, this was definitely an added bonus.  I canâ€™t wait for summer now! Great SPF
