It was gifted to me by Peter Thomas Roth clinical skincare. I’m a fan of retinoid product. It gives tingling feeling and might have some dryness occurs the first week or so of usage. But once you pass that, it improves your skin’s radiance and smoothness. If you’re first time retinoid user make sure you start off with every other day like they recommended. nan
