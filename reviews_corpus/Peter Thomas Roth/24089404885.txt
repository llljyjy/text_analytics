When I first got the product in, it did not have any serum, so I closed the lids and flipped the container upside down assuming the serum was on the bottom and it was. Now before using the product, I flip the container upside down for about 15 seconds and the turn it over. Itâ€™s a great product and will buy again. works fine after I flip it
