Peter Thomas Roth recently gifted me their PRO Strength Vitamin A/C/E Retinoid Treatment in exchange for my honest review. This retinoid cream is packed with vitamins to target skin concerns including fine lines and wrinkles, dark spots and dullness. I’ve been using it a few times a week at night, and have noticed only minimal peeling patches, but no irritation.  I follow up with a moisturizer as well as SPF in the morning.  This product has no discernible scent, and has a light cream consistency that absorbs fairly quickly without feeling sticky or greasy.  I haven’t noticed dramatic results yet, but overall my skin does look brighter and healthier. It also feels softer and smoother.  I’ll be gradually building up to nightly use, and am hopeful to see reduction in my fine lines and wrinkles in the coming weeks. Brighter, Healthier Skin
