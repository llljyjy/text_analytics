These pads are awesome!  This was my first time using resurfacing peel pads and I need these in my life forever.  As mentioned on the box, my skin was a little red after the first usage, but no irritation and my skin quickly adapted.  I am using the pads every other day now and my skin is like baby skin.  It feels so supple, the elasticity has improved, imperfections are seriously diminished and the feel - I have never had skin so smooth!  The pads are a soft cotton and feel smooth as you glide them over your skin.  I am sold Peter Thomas Roth - I am a customer for life. Awesome sauce
