I bought this on my journey to find a skincare routine that will help with my postpartum/hormonal acne.  After a couple of uses, it seemed to be doing the trick with clearing up my forehead and jawline--however, after about two weeks, it seemed to start encouraging more breakouts even though I was only using the pads every other day in the evening.  Maybe I just havenâ€™t found the right balance with them yet. Quick Fix but....Long Term?
