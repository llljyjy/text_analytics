This gets 2 stars only because it washes off easily and doesn’t irritate. However, it’s junk. It starts off gritty, and leaves a white film. It makes skin look extra dry and pulled, but it doesn’t tighten. There are other products on the market that DO tighten, and do it well - sadly, the best out there is pricey and comes from a company with shady sales practices. But unfortunately, since I’ve seen what’s possible, basically completely removing any poochiness under my eyes after a hard night, this stuff doesn’t begin to get reasonable results. I can get better results even with my normal, mild depuffing eye cream. That does about a 50% job, but it sure doesn’t leave my eyes looking like I smeared super glue under them, like this stuff. To the garbage can! Doesn’t do much of anything
