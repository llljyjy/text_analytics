I received the product complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare. I have uneven skin tone and dark spots due to aging. It bothered me a lot and I am looking for some skincare products that can reduce my dark spots and uneven tone. I am so happy that I can have the chance to try this product. I use it at night before moisturizer. I have been using retinol skincare products for some time. So, my skin adjusted pretty well and there was no irradiation at all. I did see the result. The dark spots became lighter and my skin looks brighter. I would definitely continue to use it and recommend it to my friends as well. Visible results! I like it!
