I really enjoy products containing Hyaluronic Acid as I have very dry skin. However, I do have very sensitive skin as well so there are often issues I have where my skin reacts poorly with products causing inflammation or irritation and this did not give me any bad reaction at all while keeping my skin feeling nicely hydrated.
