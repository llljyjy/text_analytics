Putting this on clean skin - it just pills. Can’t get beyond that so don’t know how it wears since none of it seems to stay on the skin! Super frustrating waste of money.Also tried to return 4 days after return window and the answer was no, even after it took 10 days for the shipment to arrive. I work in retail and exceptions can be made, but not at sephora I guess. Losing a customer over $30 after being rouge for several years. SHOW CUSTOMER’S THAT YOU VALUE THEIR BUSINESS. Do Not Buy
