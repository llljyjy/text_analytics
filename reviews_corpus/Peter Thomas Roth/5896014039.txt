I’m a skincare junky and this is my favorite cleanser. I finished off a big bottle recently and decided to try samples of a few other brands. But I came back to this. It’s worth the money, a little goes a long way (I use a silicone scrubby). Smells great. Feels great. I’m in my thirties and feel like it genuinely made a difference in the appearance of some fine lines I’ve been lamenting over as well. Love love love! favorite cleanser
