I was lucky enough to receive PTR Even Smoother Resurfacing Peel Pads from Influenster. I use them along with the Even Smoother serum. I’ve been using them every couple days and I really feel like my skin is smoother. While I don’t have many wrinkles yet, I do have acne scaring, pitting and uneven skin tone. I really do see a difference in my skins tone and texture. It’s less dull and brighter. With this improvement over a month I can’t wait to see the improvement over more time. I definitely recommend this product! Great Results
