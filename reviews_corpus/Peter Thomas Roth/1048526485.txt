When it comes to sunscreen products, my main objectives are finding something that works, that plays well with the rest of my skincare, and that sinks in easily. This sunscreen ticks all of those boxes. The consistency is really unique; it’s silky and smooth, but with a bit more density than similar textures. It sinks into the skin beautifully, and leaves it blurred and primed for makeup. There’s no white cast and no pilling — it works well with all my other skincare and my makeup products. A really great find, and one I’ll be repurchasing in the future. Unique & versatile sunscreen
