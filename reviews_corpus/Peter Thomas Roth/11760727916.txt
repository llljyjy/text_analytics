I think everyone has their own preference when it comes to sunscreen. This sunscreen was good but definitely not my preference. I prefer a more cream-like sunscreen, this one wasn’t creamy but it wasn’t bad. I had a little bit of problems with it though. Sometimes when I would put it on after my moisturizer, it would ball up and I had to take everything off. nan
