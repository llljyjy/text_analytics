This was my first time trying a product from PTR in a long time and I loved it! This sunscreen is truly invisible and has a great texture. It wore well under my tinted moisturizer and felt good on the skin. It isn’t scented, which I especially liked. Just be sure to wear it with some kind of moisturizer - it doesn’t provide a moisturizing effect on its own. Great for summer
