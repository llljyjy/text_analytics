These are great patches! They are unscented and sit in place pretty well without sliding down so I can easily move around while wearing them. I love the fact they come in two different shapes. The oval ones are handy to apply to the forehead or between the eyebrows and they seem to really reduce the appearance of my fine lines, at least temporarily. They also provide great hydration to the skin and help to reduce morning puffiness. Iâ€™m overall happy with these! nan
