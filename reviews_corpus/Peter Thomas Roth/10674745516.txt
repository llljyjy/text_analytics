This is so lightweight with no noticeable fragrance.  It soaks into skin, leaving my face so smooth.  Absolutely no white cast at all.  I went to the beach recently and didn’t have my usually face sunscreen but did have this for some reason.  I applied it at the beach.  3 hours in the sun, not a bit of pink skin.  I will burn after 30 minutes without sunscreen.  I know that if I am in the sun for any length of time makeup or not, I won’t have to worry about my face burning. Amazing
