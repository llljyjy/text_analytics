I received a sample and definitely want to purchase the full size. Most gel-based, hyaluronic acid  type moisturizers are not heavy enough for my skin. But this one was thicker and denser, which I liked. It layered well over serums and under SPF. Having a moisturizer that does not pill under SPF seems harder and harder to find these days. A substantial moisturizer, worth the splurge
