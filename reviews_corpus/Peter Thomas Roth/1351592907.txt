This is the best retinol I have ever used. It transformed my skin in less than a week. It faded red marks and made my skin silky smooth. It didn’t make me break out or irritate my sensitive skin either. I’ve been using it a couple weeks now and I love how it melts into your skin and doesn’t dry it out as much as other retinols do. nan
