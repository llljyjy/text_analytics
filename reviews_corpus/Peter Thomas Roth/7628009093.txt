I received PTR Glycolic Retinol Resurfacing pads and Serum from @influenster in exchange for my honest review. This review is for both products, because I used them both simultaneously.The pads and serum both contain a very potent combination of active ingredients, mainly glycolic acid and retinol. One pad is saturated enough to soak and scrub the whole face, neck, chest and even shoulders, then follow with serum. The serum is light, absorbs quickly, leaves a slightly tacky feeling on the face, but it disappears within an hour. I’ve used both products for the last 2 weeks and am already seeing impressive results. I have a very large sun spot on my forehead and left cheek, post-acne hormonal dark spots on my jaw, blackheads on the nose, large pores around the nose, and perioral dermatitis related to mask wear. After 2 weeks of 3x a week use of both products my blackheads cleared up to a noticeable degree (you can’t see the black plugs anymore) some whitehead acne dried up (I did have the initial flare of acne after the first use, as expected with acids), my awful sun spot is much lighter (it’s still there, but at least I don’t need to cover it up with makeup), the hormonal spots are lighter, an old one completely disappeared. My forehead lines aren’t as noticeable as well. My skin looks darn good already, and I’m actually blown away by how well this product combination works. So far I didn’t have any irritation or stinging from the pads or serum, although my face is used to acids. One thing to note: you must use heavy duty sunscreen daily, otherwise you’ll ruin your skin and will undo any benefits this product gives you. I feel that pads and serum must be used together for the best and fastest results. I will be purchasing both products with my own money when I run out. This stuff is impressive. Love this one ❤️
