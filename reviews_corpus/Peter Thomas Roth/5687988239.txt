I like this product and think it’s okay. I honestly did not notice any change in my skin from using it consistently, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth trying and won’t work for someone else. I like the texture, price range, and it did hydrate my skin well compared to most Retinol items that can dry my skin out.  I just didn’t see any difference so this is why I gave it a 3 star bc I’m neutral. It's OK.
