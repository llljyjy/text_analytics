I received this product complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth. This is a beautiful moisturizer. The texture feels Incredible.  I have super dry skin and I’m sad to say this isn’t enough to keep my skin hydrated all day long. It absorbs quickly but other than the texture I would have to unfortunately pass. Maybe it will work better in the summer time for my dry skin. We will have to see. It will probably work well with my normal skim friends nan
