I actually keep this in the refrigerator and it feels so good when I use these hydra-gel patches.  The tweezers are convenient and keep out the germs. My skin feels hydrated, plumped and firm when I use these. I look so forward to using these patches each night. These were gifted by Peter Thomas Roth. nan
