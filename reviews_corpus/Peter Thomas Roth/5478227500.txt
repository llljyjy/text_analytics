I bought these because they are marketed and reviewed as being cooling and hydrating. I’ve given them two stars because I definitely found them to be very hydrating, and I like the serum. The eye patches also stayed in place the entire 15 minutes I wore them. I did not find it necessary to store the container upside down, but the product was also brand new.The shape of the eye patch is uncomfortable and for regular use I would have had to cut them. The very, very long skinny side goes right up into the eye area. I did not find these to be cooling at all - I couldn’t even really feel them on my face. I noticed no difference to my undereye area in terms of appearance, and my eyes remained puffy and red, though soft and moisturized. I purchased these because they were cheaper (per pair) than the Skyn ones. However, at $72 a jar for 30 pairs, these are still not worth the price. If you love the serum, you can buy a similar one from PTR and just dab some under the eyes and under some much cheaper physical eye patches. Not cooling, not worth the money
