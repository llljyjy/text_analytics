I really wanted to like this, but unfortunately I did not. While it is lightweight and moisturizing, it did not absorb well. My skin was left greasy even after using blotting papers. I didnâ€™t notice a strong scent or really any scent as other reviewers have. I did experience watery, sensitive eyes while wearing this. I would only recommend this product if you have very dry skin and do not have sensitive eyes. nan
