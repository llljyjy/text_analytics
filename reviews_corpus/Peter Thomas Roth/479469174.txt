So far, so good!  I have only been using this for 3 days.  I must say I love it.  I was using the tinted moisturizer by Laura Mercier, as they discontinued my Chanel or it is out of stock.  I have relatively good skin for 70 years old.  I really do not need foundation, just this and some bronzer.  I do not spend a lot of time in the sun, so this should be perfect.  I will update in a couple of weeks. Great stuff
