This is my first Peter Thomas Roth product and Iâ€™m really glad I got to try this out. This is just what I needed for the winter time. I have really dry skin, and this cream has kept my face nice and hydrated and I feel like it also helped with my skin barrier. It helped against the dry winds. It also leaves a lovely dewy finish. Love this for dry skin
