I loved the original Water drench moisturizer but it’s a bit too light for my dry skin in the winter although it works like magic in summer. BUT this gorgeous creamy thick and nourishing moisturizer gives me everything my skin needs!! I am so impressed how my barrier was repaired in a matter of days, no more dry and dehydrated spots, my makeup goes on so much nicer my skin doesn’t feel tight and dull... I am so so impressed!! Rich, creamy and super hydrating
