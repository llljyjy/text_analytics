Aptly named. This moisturizer is incredibly hydrating! The texture reminds me a little bit of gel moisturizers I’ve used in the past, but it’s much thicker and longer lasting on my skin. If I apply a little bit, my dry skin absorbs it pretty quickly, but if I apply a lot it’s almost like an overnight mask. I am loving this for winter—the first time I used it my skin was so dry, and it seriously  was completely rescued within about 10 hours after I applied a generous amount of this stuff. I prefer this as at night because some of my makeup products don’t sit the best on top of it, and if I use a large amount of product it looks like my face is soaking wet for about an hour. I like something a little lighter for daytime, but this is perfect for my nighttime skincare. 10/10 “Drench” is accurate! My dry skin loves this.
