I used this for a good 3 months consistently and I gave it enough time to see results. I wasn’t expecting my skin to drastically change overnight of course, but at the end of the third month, my still looked patchy with brown spots. Maybe it’s just my skin, but I bought this with the understanding that it would alleviate those concerns for me. Sadly it did not :( nan
