I received this product complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth. I thought that the retinoid treatment cream has an pleasant scent. It smell nice without being overwhelming. The texture is like other creams, so not too thick or thin. There is slight oiliness when I first applied on my face but it does feel smooth right after I rub it all in. I donâ€™t have a lot of wrinkles and fine lines yet, so it was hard to see if it was making a difference against that. Overall, this was a nice retinoid treatment to try. nan
