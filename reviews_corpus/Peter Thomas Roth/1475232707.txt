I received this Prostrength Vitamin A/C/E Retinoid Treatment complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth. This retinoid treatment claims to reduce the look of fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven tone. It is a nice cream texture that rubs into the skin and absorbs quickly. Although I donâ€™t have a lot of wrinkles I did notice a very slight improvement on my forehead lines. I did not have any irritation or reaction but if you have sensitive skin you will want to introduce gradually until your skin adjusts. Continuing to use
