I switched to this years ago when I could no longer find the Dr Dennis Gross sulfur mask I had been using from Sephora. However, I’ve been very happy with it. Having tried a few other options over the years (including the new Dr Dennis Gross formula), I keep coming back to this one.My skin can be sensitive sometimes but this does not make it angry. In fact, it generally soothes any redness I might have. It has the reassuring sulfur smell but it’s not as bad as many of the other products I have tried over the years. It decreases my breakouts significantly. I use this as often as a few times a week and as infrequently as once or twice a month, but one tub can go a long way. Depending on use, it can last a couple years (at which point any remaining product will be dried out and expired). This makes it cheaper than other products out there that are $10 but have to be bought monthly. Like any sulfur or clay mask it will be drying. It’s meant to be paired with your typical moisturizer. So make sure you have the right moisturizer for your skin type :) Great Sulfur Product
