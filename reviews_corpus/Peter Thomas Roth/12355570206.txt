I’m very surprised about this product! I was expecting it to be greasy like the Supergoop Unseen, but it’s not at all! I really enjoyed using it. It doesn’t feel heavy, it spreads amazing and leaves the skin with a very pleasant feeling. It doesn’t peel or sting the eyes, so yes! I recommend it! nan
