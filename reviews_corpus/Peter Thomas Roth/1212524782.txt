Relaxing part of my day! I often don’t have time in the morning to do any patches/masks because well, I prefer sleeping those extra minutes than waking up early. But after my nighttime shower, I put these on, sit do my nails, watch something or read and find relaxation. They are pleasant to put on as they are cooling and the little tweezer on the container helps to get these off easily. I’m not sure what the non-eye looking shape is for so I still need to see but overall I like these. I often find myself putting it on under a sheet mask and having a whole pampering session. Will definitely be wearing these when those newborn days come! I was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth. nan
