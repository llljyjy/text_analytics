After trying this sunscreen gifted by Peter Thomas Roth, there are both things I like and dislike about this sunscreen. I like that it has no white cast and is suitable for most. In addition, I like the primer like finish for applying makeup and that itâ€™s SPF 45. I tend to prefer a dewy finish versus the matte one this gives. I dislike how thick this sunscreen is since I feel like it takes some work to spread it into the skin. I would describe this as a thicker version of unseen screen. nan
