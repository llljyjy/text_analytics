This is pretty great. Thought I didn’t like it/irritated my skin at first but turns out my moisture barrier was just wrecked. Once I got that in check there was no irritation from this. It’s light, moisturizing, good SPF level, doesn’t leave a white cast or cause pimples, and doesn’t smell bad - only thing is it’s a bit shiny, but not oily. I would recommend. nan
