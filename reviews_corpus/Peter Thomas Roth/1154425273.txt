Can’t use with makeup!!  THis is very drying, which  makes it tight, hence the “firming’ effect. If you are one to wear a concealer, you can’t with this.  If you are lucky enough not to need a concealer you might like this.  AND.   it only looks wrinkle free under the eye area if you don’t smile. Any movement of the undereye are will cause the skin to look more wrinkled.  Can’t be helped.  I guess if you want it for photos where you won’t smile, it would be ok. I even tried mixing it with my serum to see if it would work.  It made my face very matte.  I have dry skin, so the matte look is not what I“m going for.  Oily skin might be better. Definitely not for those who want dewy skin. Be careful!!
