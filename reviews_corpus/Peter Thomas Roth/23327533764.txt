I received the PRO Strength Vitamin A | C | E Retinoid Treatment complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth for my review and opinions. Peter Thomas Roth is one of my favorite brands, so I was super excited to try this treatment! I have dark spots that I’d like to fade out, so I was interested in seeing how effective this product is. I’ve only been using this product for a couple days, but I’ve seen some small minor improvements, so I’d like to see how it works in the long run! great!
