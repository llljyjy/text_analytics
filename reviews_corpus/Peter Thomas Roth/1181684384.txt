I’ve been using these every night after I was my face and in place of my usual toner! I apply all over my face, neck and decollate. I’ve been using this in conjunction with the Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Retinol Serum and my skin looks just as good as it does after getting a professional chemical peel! My skin is too sensitive and dry to use this product twice a day so I opt to use it at night! I apply my serums and then face moisturizer after I have used the pads and I use a really good SPF 50 or higher face sunscreen during the day! This product makes your skin a little more sensitive to the sun so definitely wear a good SPF of using this! These are worth the hype and great to add to your skin care routine! great exfoliating pads!
