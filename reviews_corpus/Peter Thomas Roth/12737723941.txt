The texture of the pads against my skin feels a little rough. My skin does tingle a little with the pads, but the box says this is normal. Apart from this, Iâ€™ve definitely experienced an improvement on the texture of my skin. My face wakes up looking nice and bright. I only use them about twice a week. Skin texture improvement!
