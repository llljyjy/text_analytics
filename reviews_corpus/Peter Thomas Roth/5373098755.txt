Im a tan brown skin girl with Lupus that affects my skin primarily. That being said I need SPF all year round and it’s so hard finding one that works well under makeup and with an oily T-zone. If you.choose to this wear this alone with maybe a light moisturizer then this will work for you. It didn’t work well with my Fenty moisturizer and light makeup. It pills and I felt like a greaseball. My makeup didn’t hold up at all even with powder and a spray. I had to blot often and my face felt itchy and tacky. Will return. NOT If your T zone gets oily and wear makeup
