I saw a lot of hype around this product on tiktok and was kinda turned off by it.  However, I was in sephora and saw it IRL and tried a little to see what the fuss was about.  My biggest concern is my “elevens“, aka the lines between my eyebrows.  I dabbed a little bit and walked around the store.  After about 10 minutes, I looked in the mirror and was pleasantly surprised, my elevens were smoothed out and barely noticeable.  I will say. it left a white cast that I rubbed away with a tissue.  This eye cream is a great alternative to botox, which I was seriously considering. nan
