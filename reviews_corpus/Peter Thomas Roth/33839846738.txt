I’m a skincare junkie. Honestly, I buy way too many products and rarely finish any. But this face wash? oh my. After the first week of using it I put away my rest of my washes and haven’t used any others for 2 months now. This stuff is great. Removes everything, effective yet gentle, and my skin looks and feels great after washing. I personally love the smell too, it’s so good and not overpowering. I use this with the PTR water drench spf moisturizer in the morning as well. I just love this whole line! Favorite face wash!!
