Love these! These resurfacing pads along with their sister serum has made a huge difference in the texture of my skin, mainly reducing bumps and redness on my forehead as well as creating a dewy glowâ€œ. I alternate both products and use one every other night to try and avoid irritation and flaking and so far so good. The pads do not sting or have any real smell, super easy and convenient to use. I would definitely recommend to someone who can afford the cost! Here are my before and afters! Noticeable difference after one use
