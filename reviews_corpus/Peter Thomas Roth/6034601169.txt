I’ve had a couple of jars of this now and really love using it! It’s a great summer moisturiser as it’s on the thinner side and feels very similar to a hyaluronic acid serum. I haven’t used a lot of PTR products in the past but this is the exception! Super hydrating and sits well under makeup and SPF. Definitely recommend if you’re looking for a light moisturiser that packs a punch with hydration! Love this stuff!
