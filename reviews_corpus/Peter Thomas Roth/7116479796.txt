I was excited to test these facial wipes out for influenster.  They worked pretty well keeping my skin but was a little too potent for my sensitive skin. It made my skin burn, especially if I was in direct sunlight after using.  They were great for traveling though and Iâ€™ll use them weekly instead of daily for my nighttime skin care. nan
