This is time Iâ€™m trying the product from Peter Thomas, as soon as I started using it, it quickly became my favorite. This moisturizer has a light texture; while applying on my skin it felt so silky and absorbed quickly into my skin without leaving my skin heavy or sticky. Its water-based moisturizer helps my dry skin stayed hydrated. Silky smooth texture!
