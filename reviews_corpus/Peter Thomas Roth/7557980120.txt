It’s a Horrible eye cream. Not worth the money at all. I used it twice and hated it. It makes my under eye area uncomfortable, and very dry, and irritates my eyes. I wouldn’t know if it actually tightens or not because it irritates my eyes so much. I like my under eye area very moisturized and not feeling flaky and dry! One of the worst eye creams ever! I don’t recommend!!! Just a waste of money!
