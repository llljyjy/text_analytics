The Peter Thomas Roth resurfacing serum has been used for several weeks in conjunction with the pads and they are working great to help eliminate some of my fine lines and wrinkles around my forehead area.  I have also noticed I overall softness and smoothness overall of my skin using 6 days a week once a day at night in a clean face.  The other day of the weeks I used the pads.  The serum did not have any tingling or burning and was quite soothing overall.  Still had to use a moisturizer as this is not for that purpose. The smell is different but not bad as I think it smells exactly like playdoh , the texture is such that it absorbs quickly and takes just a little bit so a bottle will last a long time. Great for fine line reduction
