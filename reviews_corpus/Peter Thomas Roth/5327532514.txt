I wanted to love this product. It didn’t smell like anything which was nice. It’s a pump which made it easy to use. The good things end there. It is a greasy product, you can see a bit of separation when you’re pumping it. It smooths well. But it made my eyes burn after wearing it all day. It also irritated the my eye lids. nan
