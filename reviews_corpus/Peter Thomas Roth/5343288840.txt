I have started using PRO Strength Vitamin A/C/E Retinoid Treatment for almost two weeks and I am already seeing the improvement. Iâ€™m slowly getting few lines on my forehead and my skin is uneven. My wrinkles are not very visible and my skin is doing so much better with the tone. I am definitely impressed with this cream and I am going to keep on applying for the best results. The cream is very soft and applies so well in the skin. It hydrates very well. I use it at nights after cleaning my face. I was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth Skincare and I am very thankful. Best cream till date for my face
