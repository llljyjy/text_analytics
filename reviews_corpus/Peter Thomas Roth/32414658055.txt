This is my favorite moisturizer.  It feels smooth and amazing on the skin.  It feels light which is surpirsing considering how well it moisturizes.  I use it morning and night as a part of my skincare routine.  I lucked up and was able to score a 5 oz or only $100 at the last sale.  I pair this with a rosewater toner from Hertiage and hyaluronic acid from The Ordinary.  My dry skin is smooth and plump with moisture.  The attached photo is good lighting only.  My skin is clean with no makeup, and no beauty filter.  And did I mention Iâ€™m 39.  My skin looks better now than it did 10 years ago. Current Favorite
