Okay not gonna lie I’ve been sleeping on this brand. Probably because of the price point.. anyways I got a sample of this because they had a pop up and wow.. I’m very impressed with how this left my skin glowing. I also got samples of the eye patches in cucumber and I was shocked I shared it with my friends. I could visibly see a difference in how it hydrated my eyes. I ended up purchasing a few days prior the eye patches (hyaluronic cloud) and they are okay.. going to stick to cucumber! Good go to for skin care
