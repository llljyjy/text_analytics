I purchased these on sale, because normally they are high priced (even though I find that all PTR products are completely worth the cost).  My under eye area is sometimes dry and I definitely have under eye wrinkles from years in the sun.  So I was looking for something like this to help me along. When you open the container, the patches are stacked to the brim.  I noticed how thin these patches are - it would be very easy to grab a few thinking it was just one patch.  I had to gently separate just one at a time, which took a minute.  They will tear if you are not careful, and you have to make sure youâ€™re grabbing just one.  They applied very well, and stayed perfectly in place while I was walking around the house, working, etc. Immediately I felt how cooling, hydrating, and wonderful these felt under my eye - these are super refreshing.  I have not used them long enough to say if they make a difference or not, but I will stay every PTR product I have used makes a noticeable difference. I can see how they would be too heavy or slip if you accidentally applied more than one patch which would be easy to do.  Just for the refreshing feeling alone I would recommend these. A sale splurge well worth it
