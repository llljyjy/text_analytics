The pads dry out way too quickly. I’ve purchased two jars, and each time the pads have completely dried out just as I’ve gotten about halfway through them. I keep the jar tightly sealed and in my vanity drawer, so I’m not sure what’s causing them to dry out so quickly, but it sure makes these feel like a waste of money. Disappointing because they worked fairly well as a spot treatment for pimples. Product dries up too quickly
