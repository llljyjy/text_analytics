Although I’ve only used it for a few weeks, I think I’m going to like this product. Even after the first use, my skin felt very soft. It was difficult not to touch it! Any smell is very subtle, which is important for me. My one warning is not to over exfoliate when using, as it caused a small breakout for me. If you’ve used retinols before, this shouldn’t be too harsh. I received a complimentary sample of this product, but all opinions are my own. nan
