I have testing out the Max Clear Invisible Sunscreen that Peter Thomas Roth me for a few weeks and here is my review. First, I have normal to dry, sensitive skin that is acne prone. Unfortunately this sunscreen felt just like a silicone based primer on my skin. I think this would be best for those with oily skin because it has a drying effect on my normal/dry skin type. This also pills if I put makeup on top. The proâ€™s is that is have zero white cast and a high sun protect factor but I would not repurchase. Normal to Dry Sensitive Skin
