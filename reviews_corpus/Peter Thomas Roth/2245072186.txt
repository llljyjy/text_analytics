I really like this moisturizer with spf to use every AM. However, I hate the packaging. I bought the full size bottle since the sale’s going on and it took almost 5 minutes of pumping for any product to come out. I also found that the sun bum daily spf moisturizer is almost identical in every aspect, it just has less spf (30 instead of 45). With a $32 price difference, I decided to return this and keep the sun bum - I’ll just apply separate spf on days I know I’ll have a lot of sun exposure. So I love this moisturizer, but minus one star for packaging and price. And check out sun bum if you wanna save some money! amazing product but pricey and terrible packaging
