I just started using this product. I have very sensitive skin and this product did not irritated my skin at all. I was a little nervous because when I used peel pads in the past and it made my skin tingle and red. I left my skin feeling refreshed. I am unsure of the long-term results at this time. But Iâ€™ve been looking to introduce retinol into my skin care routine and this is a great product for that. I received this product complementary from Influenster. Good for sensitive skin
