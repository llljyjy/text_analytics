This product has been a staple in my beauty return for years now, but Iâ€™m still pleasantly surprised by its effectiveness. I broke out around my mouth due to constantly wearing masks and I have the acne marks to prove it. I applied the brightened to my spots and I saw an improvement within one day. I love this stuff and would recommend it to anyone who struggles with dark spots. Worth Every Penny
