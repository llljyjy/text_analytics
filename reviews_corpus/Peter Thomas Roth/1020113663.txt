this is different consistency than regular eye cream. it is a little heavy, therefore, I only use it at night. I use my Inky List Retinol eye cream, or Ole H Bakuchiol eye cream, let it sink in a little, and then this cream over it to seal it all in, and let it all work during the night.  Great cream to cocktail with powerful eye treatments. nan
