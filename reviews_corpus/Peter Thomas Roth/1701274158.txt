I’m addicted to this moisturizer. It’s light weight, great for summer and helps with my acne/hormonal breakouts. It’s gentle, and doesn’t  break me out. I have combination skin that runs on the dry side (in my 30s) so in the winter I’ve found it’s better as a day moisturizer and still trying to find something a touch heavier at night. But bottom line I use it once a day, every day every season! I only wish they’d make a bigger size- a container lasts me about 3 months max nan
