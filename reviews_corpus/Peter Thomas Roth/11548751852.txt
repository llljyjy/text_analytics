Milky type, hydrating serum that smells of oranges and contains high concentration of the oil soluble THD Vitamin C derivative. Great at providing my skin with a boost of antioxidants, brightening my skin tone and boosting collagen. Enjoyed using this serum and my skin loves it too. Thankfully i was able to snag it at 50% off because its quite expensive at full price. Vitamin C Goodness!
