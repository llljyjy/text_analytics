These are not your momma’s peel pads! I tried PTR Even Smoother™ Glycolic Retinol Resurfacing Peel Pads to help balance my uneven skin tone and texture. I have extremely sensitive, acne prone skin that continues to change the older I get. While my acne is now mostly under control, the marks left behind are ever changing. It has left me with an uneven skin tone and color. These PTR pads are helping my skin get back its youthful flow. After just using them for a month, I noticed my skin was so much softer, smoother, and clearer. My overall appearance is not just clearer but softer, too. My face was fortunate enough to be able to handle them almost every night. But now, I only need to use them once a week. These pads prep my skin for the next step, without stripping or burning my skin. My skin does not feel tight either. Also, the pads themselves were not too rough. I used what was left on my neck and chest. Love, love, LOVE PTR and the new Even Smoother™ Glycolic Retinol Resurfacing Peel Pads! Try saying that five times fast! Prep Pads
