I’ve tried different PTR products but this one is the one I liked the most. I’ve been testing it for a month now and I do like how it hydrates my skin at night while giving me all of the benefits of retinols. However, I do have sensitive skin and I definitely don’t use it every night, but two or three times a week. Otherwise my skin overreacts and will get red and uncomfortable. Also, don’t apply the product anywhere your skin is irritated. I applied it by mistake near my nose while I was battling a cold and it stings! So just make sure you  skip those areas Great for sensitive skin
