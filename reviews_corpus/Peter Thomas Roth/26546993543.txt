I love it how my skin feels and looks when I am wearing this sunscreen. I feel that is protects and hydrates my skin at the same time. It goes super smooth without feeling unconfortably thick or greasy and it is really invisible even without makeup. It becomes completely unnoticeable after only a few seconds of application as it doesnâ€™t leave a white cast and dries on super clear!! I love the formula! It has a very lightweight consistency and melts on the skin beautifully and evenly. The scent is also  pleasant so it is definitely a must have!! Truly invisible! No white cast! Love it!!
