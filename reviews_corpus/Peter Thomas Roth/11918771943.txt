I keep the serum in a mini fridge, so when I apply it, it feel comforting and gentle on my skin. The texture is like a watered down moisturizer, as many other serums. It’s not sticky and does not feel like it sit on the skin but that it is quickly absorbed. The product is not itchy on my skin and doesn’t have a scent to it. The main benefit for me has been taking off some texture in my skin for sure.This serum is not drying, I use it every other day though. I would recommend this serum to improve skin conditions and getting a smoother and healthier looking skin. Loved it!
