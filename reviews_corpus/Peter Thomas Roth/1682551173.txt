I have purchased similar gel patches in the past and haven’t had a lot of success with them but was hoping PTR would get it right. Spoiler alert - they did!!! These are unscented and I love that rather than leaving the middle of container empty and only filling it with eye patches, they’re filled with the oval ones that you can use on other parts of your face. It feels a lot less wasteful that way! I’ve had issues in the past where I put these on and essentially have to lay down and do nothing else - not with these! I can walk around and do stuff around the house because they don’t slide down my face. And just because they stick in place doesn’t mean they’re not doing their job. They are incredibly hydrating and I’m seeing a lot of benefits from just one week of use. They’re also perfect for slapping on my face when taking a bath and having a little spa day. They don't budge!
