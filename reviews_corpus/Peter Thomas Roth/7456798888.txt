this does work absolutely, which is why I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 3. but the problem is this bottle is huge and sulfur masks should not be used so much every day. it’s been over a year and I’m not even halfway through the bottle. I have red/irritated acne with dry skin, so sulfur is amazing. there are so many cheaper and effective brands with sulfur masks like LAroche and more. but it does have great ingredients and is effective, but I would recommend getting something smaller/cheaper. nan
