The Peter Thomas Roth Gel Patches are so nice and refreshing. I really love the soothing and nourishing ingredients in the formulation. The gel patches adhere to the skin well and instantly plump up the skin. There are 90 patches and 2 different sizes for your eyes as well as face. They really work to reduce the appearance of fine lines and improve elasticity in the skin. They are easy to use and such a convenient way to quickly perk up your complexion. There is a good amount of product on each patch and mini tweezers are included. nan
