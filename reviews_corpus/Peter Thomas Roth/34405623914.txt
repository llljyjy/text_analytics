I received this gifted by the brand. This is my first products from them and I really enjoyed this. The formula is gentle enough for my skin and I am usually sensitive to retinol treatments. I notice reduced lines and wrinkles and improved texture of my skin so I would recommend to anyone with combination skin like mine. nan
