I am excited to try this new sunscreen. PTR is trusty brand for sensitive skin. The active ingredients are chemical uv filters and a solid SPF rating of 45. It contains vitamin E and Bisabolol which are excellent to sooth skin and decrease the unbalanced water loss. The texture is a bit like primer and very emollient. Great option for dry skin girls. nan
