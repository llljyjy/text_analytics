And this cost a fortune. Seeing the price tag as I come back here to review makes me want to pass out, TBH. I get better sunscreen for under 15 bucks at the local pharmacy. Why don’t I like this? It gets in my eyes. I hate it when sunscreen gets in my eyes, not just because it’s unpleasant, but because it discourages me from wearing sunscreen in the future. Gets 2/5 because it didn’t actively make my skin worse or cause any lasting damage… unless you count the price tag, which was hours and hours of work essentially thrown in the garbage. I hate throwing good money after bad.
