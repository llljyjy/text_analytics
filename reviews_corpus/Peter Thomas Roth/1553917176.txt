This is my second try. First time I bought them was about a year ago. Totally dried out. I returned them. I bought them again thinking maybe Iâ€™ll have better luck. Nope. Totally dried out. Unless they are somehow infused into the gel patch?! I stored them upside down to see if the liquid would saturate the top layer. Nope. Just going to trash them. Second Try. Totally Dried out.
