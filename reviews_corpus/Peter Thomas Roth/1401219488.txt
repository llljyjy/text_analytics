I redeemed points for a .5 ml sample size, which lasted about 3 weeks — definitely long enough to know that I love it.  It moisturizes well and really pumps up the effect of my daily moisturizer.  After I ran out, I could feel it.  My skin missed it.  And I don’t know what people are talking about when they write that it smells bad.  I didn’t think it smelled, um, at all. I’m going to buy the full-size bottle as soon as I finish writing this review…which is now. Highly recommend!
