Top notch for oily skin! I have tried everything and then some. I can finally stop the search for a cream that doesn’t make me look like a glazed donut by the end of the day.I wash my face am and pm (with Fresh Soy cleanser) and this is the first cream that I have woken up without an oily face. I really didn’t even think this was possible for me. Ive tried everything and I was losing hope. My skin type is combo/oily with a bit of rosacea, and zero irritation from this cream. It feels like you are putting water vapour all over your face. And a little goes a VERY long way. If you use it and find its oily, take a look at your serums and toners, they shouldn’t contain oils or this can keep happening. If anyone has a skin type like mine I use Luzern Recovery+. Sephora sadly doesnt carry but its the best. I can also see this cream being good for any skin type. The formula is insane. Oh and didnt get this for free, paid for myself. If you are unsure get the mini, its almost the same cost per ml. YOU NEED THIS OILY SKIN PEEPS
