My skin is really thin and sensitive so when I received this product, I was hesitant to use it on my face. After trying a couple of times, I found it really did a good job exfoliate my skin. I used it once weekly so my skin wouldnâ€™t get too irritated. I found that my skin got a little red after using it but after 10 minutes or so, it was fine. Definitely will add this product to my skin care routine. nan
