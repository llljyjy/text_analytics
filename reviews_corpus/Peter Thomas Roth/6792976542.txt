I am a big fan of all PTR resurfacing pads- I’ve used other iterations, most recently the Peptide 21 Amino Acid Exfoliating Peel Pads, so I’m familiar with how instantaneous results are. These are no different- amazing results after one use. These are great to use the day before a big event. It’s full of actives, including glycolic acid, micro encapsulated retinol, and hyalauronic, allantoin and adenosine to soothe. I definitely feel a tingle each time I use it- nothing too stinging, but to me, this is what it’s designed for, as a resurfacing product.I highly recommend these if you’re looking for a strong at-home peel. Absolutely brilliant results, immediately!
