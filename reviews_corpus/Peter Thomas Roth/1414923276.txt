I received this complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare. Since I don’t know the strength of this formula, I started just one a week and ramped up to 3x per week so my skin could get used to it. Great for my fine lines, my skin looks plumped in the morning. Just remember to use spf because the retinol makes your skin sensitive. I use mine Monday, Wednesday, and Friday so I don’t have to worry as much on the weekends. nan
