This irritated my eyes a lot! It does feel nice on the rest of my face, but it was just okay. The smell is too much for me. I usually apply sunscreen over my lips lightly, but I can’t with this one. The taste gets in my mouth and it’s terrible! This doesn’t happen to me with other products. This quickly became a sunscreen for my hands.I did like that there’s no added fragrance in this sunscreen.Other products perform far better for much less money! nan
