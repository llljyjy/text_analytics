I love the concept of these patches! I used them in the morning before starting my day because I usually wake up with my eye area a little puffy due to allergies and these patches had an almost immediate effect. It’s a great experience too because it’s more cooling and refreshing than most other under eye patches. The different shapes allow you to target multiple areas of your face at one time. Innovative
