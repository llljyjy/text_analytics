I am absolutely here for this sunscreen! I was never really a fan of chemical/organic sunscreen until I came across this! For reference I have normal to dry skin, and I only tried this sunscreen because I liked the hologram packaging (lol). I put this on over my makeup and the blur that yielded, SOLD ME. When I applied it to my bare face, OMG!!!! It felt so velvety smooth and my pores looked invisible! It did not sting my eyes. Now it does pill, for me it was only around my neck area and a quick rub in remedied that. Overall this sunscreen is one of the best I tried! Say what you want about “chemical” sunscreen, this is the one! nan
