I’ve been looking for a sunscreen that doesn’t feel and look oily, give me a white cast and also doesn’t crumble with my moisturizer and THIS IS THE ONE THAT DOESNT DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS! it’s very light weight. I wore it but itself and also with moisturizer and i love it either way. My skin felt protected. nan
