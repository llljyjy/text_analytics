The sunscreen is quite moisturizing. This could be a day cream in summer for dry skin. The only thing is it hurts my eyes after putting on for an hour. It wonâ€™t hurt you eyes immediately but it will make me cry after 1-2 hours. But if I put makeup on this sunscreen, it would be fine. Hurt my eyes without putting makeup on it
