Been using for a few weeks and I feel like it’s a nice chemical exfoliant… I’m not sure I noticed a total difference in my skin but I definitely feel like I’m doing something when I rub it all over my face. I do love Peter Thomas Roth products in general. I’m not sure this is a super strong peel as I don’t feel any tingling, but I’d say safe for nightly use. Also doesn’t dry your skin out which is great for me since I have dry skin. Shake n bake
