What I love most about sunscreens are that they donâ€™t leave white cast and this sunscreen was perfect, no White cast at all. I loved it under my makeup too, it lightweight and my makeup stayed really well. Love the holographic packaging, smart.  Little expensive so I might wait for a markdown once I am out of this one. This sunscreen was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth for my honest opinion. nan
