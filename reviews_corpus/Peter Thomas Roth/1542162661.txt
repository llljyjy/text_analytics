I absolutely love this peel pads and Iâ€™ve noticed such a difference after using this pads in my routine! I love the way it leaves my skin. It does get my skin a little red but not bad but this is also normal with retinol. Make sure to use and wear your SPF!! Highly recommend ladies! Fantastic peel pads
