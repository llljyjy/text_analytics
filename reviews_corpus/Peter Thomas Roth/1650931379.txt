The product comes with 2 different gel shapes for the undereye and the smile lines (or wherever) at first I wasnâ€™t sure if anything will change after 15 mins of applying the gel but I think it does! Looking like I just got 1 extra hour of sleep is all worth it. Not to mention that these feel so nice on the face. One extra hour of sleep!
