I’m glad I got this in a sample kit and didn’t purchase a full size bottle. First of all, the smell is AWFUL. It smells like cheap crayons, dollar store lipstick, a middle school art classroom, and paint all mixed together. Aside from the gross smell, it did make the skin on the back of my hand soft (which is there only place I applied it, luckily). With that being said, the effect was no better (or maybe worse?) than when I use Neutrogena Hydro Boost, which 1) smells way better and 2) is insanely more affordable.Seriously, why would anyone pay this much for it?!?! Totally Not Worth It
