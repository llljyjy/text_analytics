When I am tired, my eyes are my absolute downfall. Iâ€™ve been using these semi-consistently for the past few weeks and they really are a saving grace. They glide on easily and stay in place. After 10-15 minutes, I see an immediate improvement in appearance of fine lines and under eye bags. Love them!
