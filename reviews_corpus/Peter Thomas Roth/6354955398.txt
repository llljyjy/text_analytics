I love this product especially now in the winter/colder time when my skin is dehydrated and needs lots of extra help. My skin absorbs this product so well, I like to use this in AM and PM and I probably won’t switch from this cream for the whole winter months. It is so hydrating. I like that it makes my skin so dewy looking and that’s mean much younger and healthy looking. You will definitely love this cream in the winter
