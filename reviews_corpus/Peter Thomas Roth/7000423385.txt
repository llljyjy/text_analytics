I agree with the previous review about it being overvalued - the math simply doesn’t check out, even with 2022 pricing the value is $86.70 and NOT $170 by any stretch of the imagination. However, this is the 3rd year I’ve bought the set and highly recommend! I love the 1.7fl oz sizes because I never go through the bigger ones before they expire in 6 months.However, I don’t like that they swapped out Irish Moor mask for the Water Drench gel mask. To me it’s just redundant to the Cucumber Gel Mask. I previously used the masks in succession to each other twice a month, starting with the pumpkin enzyme, then mud mask, then detox and finished with the firming one. So to get the same routine this year, I’ve mixed up my own mud mask: 1 tablespoon each of melted honey and the blue Water Drench mask, 1 teaspoon each of Aztec Secret’s Indian Healing Clay powder and activated charcoal - leave on skin for 10mins to draw blackheads/sebum out of pores.I still think this is a great mask set, but PTR please bring back the set with Irish Moor! Bring back the Irish Moor set!
