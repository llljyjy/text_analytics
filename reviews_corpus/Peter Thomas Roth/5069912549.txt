I don’t think this gel formula worked great for dry skin. The cream seemed like it would be moisturizing but it felt like it just sat on top of my skin. It eventually soaked in after ~5 minutes, but it didn’t provide me with the moisturized consistency I was expecting, especially after falling in love with the matching serum. If anything it almost made my skin feel a little thirsty. I imagine this would be more useful for someone who has combination skin. nan
