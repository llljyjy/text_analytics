I have used many PTR products over the years and they are pretty good. I do have to say that this sunscreen has been a disappointment. It feels nice going on but did not give me great protection and is so slippery that it is hard to keep it out of my eyes-stings like a bugger. Not a good value in my opinion. Meh
