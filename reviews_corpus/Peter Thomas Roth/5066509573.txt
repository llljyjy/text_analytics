I have noticed a huge difference in the texture and natural redness of my skin.  I only use once a week because my skin is too sensitive to use more frequently!!  I received this product to try and I’m so glad, because I doubt I would have tried it otherwise.  I know it’s pricey but I think it’s worth it.  Side note: I did not like the peel pads. Use with caution - but so good!
