I have super sensitive and reactive skin and I’m always looking for a way to help hydrate and treat without compromising my skin barrier. I am absolutely loving this beautiful texture and the soothing gel consistency. It’s almost like a beautiful cocoon for the skin and just calms my complexion. There’s a gorgeous radiant dew left behind and happy skin. Amazing for the skin barrier!
