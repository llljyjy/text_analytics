Great retinol pads! I usually prefer retinol serums as opposed to pads,toners, etc but I was genuinely surprised how much I enjoyed using these! For me, I couldnâ€™t use the serum and pads simultaneously so I switched between the two every other day but I highly recommend for sensitive skin! Great alternative retinol option!
