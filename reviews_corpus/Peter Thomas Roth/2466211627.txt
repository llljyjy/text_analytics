Had gotten this as a sample originally and loved being able to carry around the little tube to add hydration to my eyes throughout the day.  It works well under makeup and also “dabbed” on over throughout the day to smooth fine lines.  I don’t use this eye cream for long term treatment issues, but it  feels so soothing and “cloud like” when I put it on, that I bought the full size anyway.  Not sure if I would buy it again because of the price, but I just bought other Peter Thomas Roth products that came with another free sample of this so I can carry the little tube around in my purse again.
