The moisturizer is gentle on my skin and I always feel refreshed afterwards. It helps my skin retain its natural moisture as I sometimes forget to to put it on, and it would still feel that way. Although it lacks protection from the sun, it’s not a problem for me as I only use it for my night time routine. Overall, this moisturizer is worth trying if you’re seeking something light and effective for your skin nan
