This was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth in exchange for my honest review. I’m not totally sold on these to be honest. They are packed with great ingredients but I don’t think I necessarily get those ingredients delivered effectively with these eye patches because I have not noticed any difference in my skin. I would prefer to have those ingredients in an eye cream or serum for better delivery. It’s nice that they included some face patches in with the eye ones to use the extra space in the container and they are relaxing to use, but I don’t see them as a must have or worth the money. Didn't notice a difference
