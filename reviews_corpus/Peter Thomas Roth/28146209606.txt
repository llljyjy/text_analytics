I have an obsession with all things under eye whether it be cream or patches. After using these, I will never go back to any others. I keep these in my skincare fridge. I like the little tweezers included in the product because I can gently get the patches cleanly out without touching others. Side note, be careful when taking out the patch because they do tear easily, however, you can make them into any shape you want to target your skins needs! and they feel so cooling and comfortable when applied. They stay under my eye well and I can feel the tightening and hydration immediately. After one use, my puffy eyes are gone! I will continue to purchase this product and highly recommend you give it a try! My Goto Multiuse Hydrating Patches
