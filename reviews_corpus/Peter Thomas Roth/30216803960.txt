The texture of this is really neat  it’s a thick clear...gel? It has a tiny bit of greasiness to it and it feels like you need a lot to blend it into your skin it’s completely sheer though and feels like nothing once it sets on your skin. I have mixed feelings about this sunscreen. Sometimes it works really well and sometimes it slightly stings my eyes and pills off in a glue-ish sort of a way. It’s hard to predict how it will perform and when it’s good, I love it. When it’s bad, it’s uncomfortable and ineffective. I’m hoping to nail down a good routines to use it in with because I love it when it works! Mixed results
