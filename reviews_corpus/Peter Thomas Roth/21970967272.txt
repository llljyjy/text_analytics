I received this product coupled with the nightly serum in exchange for my honest review and i am SO thankful! I have been using for about a week or 2 now and i can visibly see a difference in my skin. My overall texture and tone has really evened out, my acne scarring is diminishing more so than i’ve noticed with any other products i’ve used in the past and my blemishes overall have lessened/reduced redness! It does not dry my skin out and the pads are perfectly saturated so that i cover my entire face and neck area. Absolutely a must try!!! NEW STAPLE!
