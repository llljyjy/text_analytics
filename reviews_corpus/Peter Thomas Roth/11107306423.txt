And also if you have a large pores that also gives it a blur so you donâ€™t have to worry about those pesky pores picking through my foundation look so flawlessly once I apply this primer to my skin everything to look so beautiful I loved it I know it cost a lot but I would surely tell you that is my honest opinion in that is worth the money buying this primer. Sunscreen with prime!
