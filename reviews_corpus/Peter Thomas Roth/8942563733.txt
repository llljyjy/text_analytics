This product is great at providing my skin with hydration, especially during the winter. I struggle with really dry, flaky skin, and if I donâ€™t keep up with my skin care routine, it gets even worse! I love a thicker moisturizer like this one. However, the only thing that I will say is that I can be a bit greasy and hard to layer makeup on top without it breaking up. nan
