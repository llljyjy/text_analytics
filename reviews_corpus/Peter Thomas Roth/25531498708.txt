After finding out that thicker moisturizer broke me out, I started using only HA serum from this company but it wasn’t enough to keep me away from dry spots. This cream, however, is the perfect balance for my skin, doesn’t make me break out and doesn’t make me look oily like many other cream did (I have an oily t-zone and dry/normal cheeks). It is very expensive but if you have the same problems as me, I would suggest giving it a try as it might also be your skin saver ! Perfect for combo and acne prone skin !
