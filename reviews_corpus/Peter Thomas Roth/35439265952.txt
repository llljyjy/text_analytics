The mask itself is very simple to use. I apply to cleansed and dry skin, leaving on for about 10 minutes, and then rinse off. The consistency is quite smooth and yet somewhat sticky, especially as it dries down. Rinsing it off is fairly straightforward, it doesn’t have a habit of clinging on...at least not on me. Does it make any immediate difference to my complexion? Yes - and the reason for that is the ’reflective’ mica content. I’ve tried double-cleansing after applying this and as more of the mica is washed off, the less radiant my skin looks. And radiance is the only visual difference. I’ve heard lots about it feeling ’firming’ but I don’t really feel it does that for me. The only saving grace for me is the ’Sodium Hyaluronate’ ingredient. It’s a moisture magnet and it does slightly plump up the skin. It has the same effect in whichever product I use that contains it. So other than a bit of plumping and hydrating, I don’t see any other difference with this mask. Will use up what’s left but won’t be repurchasing this.    ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
