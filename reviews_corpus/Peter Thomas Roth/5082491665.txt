Like a few others here, I came to try this as a step up from the Garnier brand gel moisturizer and I am very happy with it. It’s hydrating, yet lightweight. It’s more expensive, but because you have to use so little of it, I feel it’s worth it. It also has this wonderful melting effect as it’s warmed by my skin that is so luxurious~ Luxurious, refreshing, lightweight, worth it!
