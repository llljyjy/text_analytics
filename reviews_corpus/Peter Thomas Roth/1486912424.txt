I really like this sunscreen. It comes out of the tube looking medium-thick (holds shape well), but once it touches the skin, it becomes quite light. It applies on the skin very smoothly, sinks in well and leaves the skin very soft. This spf has silicones, so the product gives some slip to the skin and reminds of a primer. It works great with or without makeup. Not sure if it’s just my tube, but i find it a bit hard to squeeze the product out of the tube. It’s not a deal breaker, but I wish it came out smoother. Nice spf product
