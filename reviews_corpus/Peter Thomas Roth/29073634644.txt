i tend to not like pretty much every SPF I try for one reason or another. I hate whitecast, not easily spreadable, etc. this one is AMAZING. The consistency makes it easily spread on the skin. It’s a clear gel so no white cast. It is a little oily but I find that dries within an hour so it doesn’t matter for me. Only 4 stars bc it is so expensive and not a lot in the tube. amazing but pricey
