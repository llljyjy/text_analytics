I just started using Peter Thomas Roth PRO Strength Retinoid Treatment and it’s been going well. I didn’t have any irritation from the first use and on. I like that it also contains Vitamins C and E for extra skincare benefits. It easily absorbs into my skin and doesn’t pill with other serums and skincare. I’ve been using for a couple of weeks and think I see a slight difference in my forehead lines. Definitely looking forward to seeing more improvement in the coming weeks! nan
