Truly an awful sunscreen all around. It smells like chemicals on your face which is unfortunate enough.. But it also pills SO bad. It seems nice when you test it on your hand in store because it seems lightweight but it’s very heavy. I didn’t even put much on either! I would steer clear especially if you’re prone to breakouts or have dry skin. It smells so bad.. PTR this is a doozy
