I really have enjoyed these pads so far ! For reference, I have normal to dry skin and since being on accutane, haven’t had a ton of breakouts- just some residual scarring on my face. I started using the pads 2x/wk initially and found no irritation or dryness like I have experienced with other products. I upped it to about 3x/wk but may even be able to use them nightly. I feel like my skin has been super clear and even since using this product and I’ve really liked them overall. I’d definitely recommend these to anyone looking to get into an approachable retinol product for regular use !! nan
