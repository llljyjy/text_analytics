This is Very very potent! And it works! So noticed a few uneven patches and the vit c and retinol literally helped brighten and even it out! Go slow with this product! It is very drying so I would start minimal and build up using it, and on days you donâ€™t,  moisturize. I received this complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth Skincare. nan
