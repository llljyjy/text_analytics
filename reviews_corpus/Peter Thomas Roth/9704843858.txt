I was surprised how much I liked this product. My skin can be a little sensitive and a pea-sized amount on my forehead, where I see the most signs of aging, did not irritate my skin at all. With use once or twice a week in conjunction with almost daily use of the serum, Iâ€™ve seen a subtle improvement over the past two or three weeks and look forward to even more! Good for my more sensitive skin!
