I’ve been shopping around for a good matte sunscreen and found this one to be the most consistent. It’s thick and needs to be warmed up a lot in your hands before application but afterwards it layers great with makeup or just for the beautiful glow you can get from walking in the sun. Good for people who want a lot of coverage and feel it absorb! Peeling skin happens occasionally but usually just reminds me to exfoliate! nan
