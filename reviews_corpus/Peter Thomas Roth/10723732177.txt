The Pro Strength Vitamin A, C & E Retinoid treatment claims to reduce fine lines & wrinkles, produce brighter more even toned skin that’s plump & radiant & leave skin feeling smooth not tight or dry after 4 weeks. I’ve been testing this out for 2 weeks now. I used it at night & only used it as a spot treatment around eyes & where my eyebrows meet. It made my skin dry & peel in those areas (esp in between eyebrows) and adding a face cream over top causes some burning. I didn’t notice any improvements but I haven’t used it for the full 4 weeks yet. I plan to try to do every other day from now forward for the next 2 weeks & will update my review if the results change. Gifted by PTR. No improvement in lines
