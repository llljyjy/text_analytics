So this does remind me of the Supergoop Unseen sunscreen. It has a similar texture but does seem a bit thicker. This dries down to a matte/velvety finish, I usually like a glowy finish but if you were makeup this works pretty well as a primer. Overall, I think itâ€™s a nice sunscreen! Works great under makeup!
