The peel pads contain 20% glycolic acid complex and 1.5% time-released retinol and the serum is 15% glycolic with the same 1.5% retinol. My skin loved the serum and was fine with the pads. I personally prefer the serum as 20% is quite strong for my skin, but I do use a lot of products with actives. Iâ€™d you do not use a lot of actives I think these peel pads would be great as a one and done exfoliation step. Just be sure to wear SPF! nan
