I wanted to hate it because of the price but I don’t. This stuff is amazing. The smell isn’t as bad as everyone says, the DrunkElephant smells worse. But what I can say is with each day I use this my skin looks healthier. I’ve tried Youth2ThePeople and the Sunday Riley versions make you glow, but this improves your skin. nan
