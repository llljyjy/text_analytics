I didn’t care for these pads. They broke my skin out. I do think they are very moisturizing but after using them for a month I didn’t see any differences in my skin other than it breaking me out. I do have sensitive skin though, so maybe it would work better for other people. They are convenient but a pass for me personally. Broke me out
