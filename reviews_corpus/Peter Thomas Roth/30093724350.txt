I have very sensitive skin. I am not prone to breakouts but most products will leave red itchy bumps on my face and sometimes will swell my eyes. This product did not burn my skin so i felt like everything was going okay.. i left it on for four minutes then throughly rinsed with warm water. This product left an impossible to remove residue on my face and continued to itch and irritate my skin for a few hours. My skin felt very dry and in my opinion the difference in blackheads was not noticeable or worth the irritation. If you have sensitive skin i would suggest something a little less abrasive like dermalogicas microfoliant. Sadly, this is not a recommendable product in my opinion. not for sensitive skin
