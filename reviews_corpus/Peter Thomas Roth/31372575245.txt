I always liked PTR products and was excited to give this Glycolic Retinol Resurfacing Serum a try. I was a bit nervous as I have sensitive skin, but a light application a couple times a week didnâ€™t have negative effects aside from a barely there tingle upon application. The texture feels more like a very light sunscreen (pale yellow pearlescent) rather than a smooth serum. Definitely worth a try and best for nighttime application. 15% Glycolic Acid Complex - Nighttime application
