Was looking for a face SPF to apply now in the summer under my makeup and couldnâ€™t ask for a better formula. It leaves my skin so smooth and hydrated plus all the benefits of actual skincare. The gel like formula goes on smoothly and my skin looks blurry and well primed ready for my makeup application. Will be reaching out for this product on my everyday morning skincare routine now! Just perfect!
