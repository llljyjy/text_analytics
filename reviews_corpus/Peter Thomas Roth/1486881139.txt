I was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth their newest PRO product. I’ve gotten amazing results from the Niacinamide treatment so I was excited to try this. It recommended starting with every other day usage, but since I was previously using another retinol product I dived right in to daily use. The cream has a nice slightly thicker than lotion texture which makes for easy coverage and a little goes along way. I love the combination of retinol with vitamin c in one product which has been shown to amplify results. The vitamin E is helpful to offset the harshness some can experience with retinol (I still top with a face oil and hydrating moisturizer) but I did not experience any irritation. After a few days use I noticed a decrease in my ’1’ line between my eyebrows and look forward to increasing benefits with continued use. I would recommend for both new and experienced retinol users. (also I think my review get posted as over 50 but I’m 36 for reference) Great addition to the PRO lineup!
