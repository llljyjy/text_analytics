I received this product from PTR to review. This sunscreen is perfect for my combo-oily skin, especially when we get to the warmer months! I’m a dedicated sunscreen wearer, but I struggle with finding SPFs that don’t slide off my skin after an hour in the heat. This sunscreen smooths the skin while also giving a nice matte finish! It doesn’t slide around all over my face. I wore this most of the day in the sun, didn’t reapply and it protected all day. (I always recommend reapplying but sometimes I just can’t be bothered.) I’ve really enjoyed and will continue to use it through the summer! nan
