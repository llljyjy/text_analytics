Love this product! The pads did a great job resurfacing the skin and I noticed a big difference in both sunspots and wrinkles on my forehead. When used in conjunction with the serum, it has done a great job. Would buy in the future. Can sting and cause initial redness on sensitive skin like mine but I started off using it only a couple nights a week and have worked up to nightly use. nan
