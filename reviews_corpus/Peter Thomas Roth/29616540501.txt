It absolutely works! There is a learning curve to how much to use in order to avoid the white residue. I barely squeeze the tube & use my brush to get product right from tube opening.  Ive found that I CAN apply powder foundation on top of it. I gently dab on my makeup with a compact sponge, but any liquid you put over it, will remove the product & all of its effects. I use IT powder foundation - but again, use gently & sparingly. Works as described, but use sparingly!
