It won’t work for most people. It seems designed for people 50+ for the crepey, thin skin next to their eyes. All it did to my under eye line is make it look deeper and more purple. It sort of fills while smoothing, which has the effect of making lines deeper in many areas. And no matter what, you’re going to get white, silicon crust that makes it unusable.
