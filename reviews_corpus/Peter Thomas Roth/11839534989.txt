I bought the mini size, because I’ve been looking for an extremely hydrating eye and nose cream for awhile now. I use my regular moisturizer (Ordinary) all over my face and just add as small amount of PTR in my problem areas. My eye contour and nose are the parts of my face that really dry out the fastest throughout the day, so those are the only places I apply this specific cream ($$$).  I can’t wait to get the full size! This product will forever be a “must-have“ for me. Best Moisturizer on the market
