I love using retinol every single night as it’s what keeps my complexion clear and glowing. I didn’t know that vitamin C could be mixed with retinol. This is a super treatment to treat wrinkles. Since it’s strong and if you are like me somewhat sensitive to vitamin C I wouldn’t do this everyday maybe every 2-3 days at night and be sure I put a thick cream on top so that my skin won’t dry out. In my honest opinion this is a great treatment if you’re in your 40+ as it’s targeting wrinkles more than anything but it’s also going to be helpful for acne prone skin due the actives. complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare Excellent idea
