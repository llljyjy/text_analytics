1st I’ll start out by saying if you have oily skin, personally I feel like you’d thrive with this product. I have combo skin, oily in the middle and pretty ok everywhere else.I personally found this product to be drying on me. I will say I do feel like there was some smoothing but after the 1 go and how dry I felt, I decided not to put my skin through it again. If you’re interested in the pad version of this and you’re not oily you may like them more. I didn’t have the same experience & I’m not sure why that is. So I chose 3 stars because this could really be helpful for someone with different type of skin. Too dry for my combo self
