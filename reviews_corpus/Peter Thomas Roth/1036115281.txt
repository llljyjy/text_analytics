I was excited to try these, but I was completely disappointed in them. First, they just slide around too much once you place them under your eyes, and they tear easily. They feel fine while they’re on--if I can get them to stay in place--but I’ve seen absolutely no difference in my under-eye area after using these. Oh well. I will stick to the Baggage Claim eye patches, which are more expensive but worth it. No Difference Noticed
