Terrible stuff. Works by drying out fragile skin under eyes. Applied with brand new Sigma brush and light touch. It burns and when washed off skin was extremely dehydrated and wrinkles are far worse! Also there is no way to put eye cream or makeup on before or after. Do not waste your money. Returned. Terrible, make wrinkles worse.
