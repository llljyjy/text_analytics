Itâ€™s a summer must have! These Peter Thomas Roth collagen face & eye hydra-gel patches work so well and stay on the face perfectly. Before using these patches, I always used to have to lay down with other patches as they typically slid down the face. The Peter Thomas Roth patches stay on the face allowing you to move around freely which I love being able to multitask. Also, they are truly hydrating and I noticed my puffiness decrease after a week! You must get!
