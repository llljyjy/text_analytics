I used this in combination with the even smoother retinol serum. I have sensitive skin so started out using every couple days at first to see how my skin would react. I had no issues building up to nightly use. It has a bit of a tingling effect but makes my skin feel smoother. I really enjoy this product and would recommend Makes skin feel smooth
