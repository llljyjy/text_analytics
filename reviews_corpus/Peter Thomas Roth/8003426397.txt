I been gifted by PeterThomasRoth , I’ve been using this Max Clear Invisible Priming Sunscreen for a couple days now and I’ve got to say I love it! The texture of this sunscreen is extraordinary maybe because it’s a primer as well so it feels like silicone, it also blurred out my pores and gave me a Mattifying look to my skin. It has no scent which I like, it also doesn’t irritate the skin and isn’t harsh. Love this sunscreen!
