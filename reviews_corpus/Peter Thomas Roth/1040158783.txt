My absolute favorite.  Got it as a sample, loved it so much more than any other moisturizer Iâ€™ve used so decided to buy it despite the high price point.  Have tried to find cheaper alternatives in the gel cream realm, but nothing else compares.  So gentle, so weightlessly moisturizing, no tacky finish, no oiliness, just delightful. nan
