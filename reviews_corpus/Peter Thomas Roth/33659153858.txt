My dull, sensitive skin feels better almost immediately after using this cream and by morning it also looks better. My face is more even toned and brightened a little. This is not greasy and it absorbed quickly into my skin during my nighttime routine. I experienced very minor redness, but am newer to retinol treatments and sometimes have this occur. I received this product complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth. nan
