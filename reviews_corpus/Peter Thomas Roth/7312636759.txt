This moisturizer is amazing. I over used some actives/acids and needed a moisturizer to help repair my skin’s sensitivity. This was great! It’s a thinner formula that just melts into the skin and almost feels water like when pressing the product into the skin. My skin looked plump and hydrated instantly. This product was gifted to be in exchange for my honest review Great for repairing skin!
