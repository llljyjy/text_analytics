After growing up in a very humid place and finding myself now living in a very dry climate my skin went insane... this has been such an amazing relief. I find a lot of thicker moisturizes cause my skin to burn under a mask all day. This doesnt do that yay! And my skin is absolutely stunning now! Combined with the exfoliating peptide 21 pads a few times a week, look forward to a whole new you! Before and after. Saved the day thanks PTR
