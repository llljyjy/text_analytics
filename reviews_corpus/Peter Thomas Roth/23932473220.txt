I have been using the FIRMx Collagen Face and Eye Hydra-Gel Patches by Peter Thomas Roth for a couple of weeks and love them! I haven’t used them every day, but the effect is noticeable even after a single use! While these are very versatile since you can use on various areas of the face, I’ve been zeroing in on lines between my eyebrows since they are the deepest lines. There are also patches shaped for under eye application which assist in brightening the under eye area. The patches also come with tweezers for better hygienic use and to make it easier to handle these gel patches since they have a good amount of product on them. While you have to be gentle applying to not cause a tear in the patch, I actually like that you can easily cut them into different shapes to suit your needs and apply around your face. They feels so cooling and lovely when applied. I feel like my skin is getting hydration plus line reducing effects from the collagen. I remove after about 20 minutes and already see improvement which is impressive. The area looks more hydrated, the lines appear less prominent, and the skin looks a little plumper. I took pictures before and after use. I adore these hydra-gel patches and highly recommend! nan
