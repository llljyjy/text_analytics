I received this SPF complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth for my review. I LOVE trying new SPFs and I love PTR, but I wasn’t sure at first if I’d like this one. It’s pretty silicone-heavy, and I had trouble with silicone based products when I was younger & had oilier skin, so it had been quite some time since I’d used products with this kind of formulation.  However, I’m really happy to say that my skin is has had zero problems with this! It applies really smoothly and makeup layers really well over it. It feels lightweight and comfortable. I have to say that this surprised me quite a bit and I really like it a lot! Two thumbs up! So good!
