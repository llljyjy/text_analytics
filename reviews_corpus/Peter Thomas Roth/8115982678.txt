I have been using this product for two weeks and already notice a difference in texture on my skin. I use this twice a week after my shower and my skin feels soft and clean afterwards. Thereâ€™s hardly any irritation on my sensitive skin, which is what I was worried about at first.  I highly recommend this product as an introduction to retinol for your skincare. Such a Difference in 2 Weeks
