I’ve always been super cautious about using retinol products. I have sensitive skin, so a lot of the time I get retinol burn. These pads were very gentle on the skin. I made sure that I would use the pads every 3 days to reduce flaking and redness. I haven’t seen a huge different in my skin with the product when it comes to acne. I am noticing that the hyperpigmentation on my face has gotten lighter. Will be continuing this product for a couple of months. Gentle and Good for Sensitive Skin
