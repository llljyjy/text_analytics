I am on my 3rd bottle & last bottle. I’ve used this during all 4 seasons.  I have oily skin&  this only makes it worse. ￼￼ My face is so shiny after putting it on.  On video calls, my skin looks so greasy.  I’m constantly blotting to remove the shine.  At the end of the day, my skin feels icky and I can’t wait to wash it off. This may work for those with dry skin. Not for oily skin
