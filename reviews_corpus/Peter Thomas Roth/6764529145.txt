These are great for the occasional breakout, and this pack usually lasts me a year. I really like that these don’t move around once they are in place and have two different size options. These do not visibly “suck up” any gunk but they do clear the whitehead and the area is significantly smaller. They smooth and minimize those under the skin breakouts so they heal much quicker too.
