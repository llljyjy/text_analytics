I got this for my mom who has under eye bags like the lady from the tik tok and this at first seemed like magic the bags went down instantly however it’s a very difficult product to use, it doesn’t seem like it but for some reason it does weird things to the eyes it pulls them and makes them look deformed, it leaves some dark spots every time you wear it and you can’t even use makeup on top if it because then the product gets wet or something and boom the bags are back bigger than ever (instantly too it’s crazy) we tried using a bit of concealer with a beauty blender to hide the dark sports and I’m not kidding it barely touched her under eyes and the bags came back in full force. My mom said it’s very uncomfortable too and that it feels like cement and like uncomfortable pulling in her eyes and did I mention it made her eyes look deformed? Not really what one looks for. But I suppose it could work for someone who doesn’t mind the discomfort, it definitely flattened the under eye area however it’s all pretend because if you get it wet or mess with it a bit it’ll go away instantly and I can’t imagine that happening out in public it’d be terrible to day the least. I don’t find this product very reliable. Very hard to wear, not reliable
