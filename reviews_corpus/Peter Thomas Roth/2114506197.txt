Pumpkin Enzyme is truly amazing, I’m wearing it right now! It does everything it claims to, lasts forever but I keep a backup too, that’s how good it is. For reference I’m 70 years young, sometimes mistaken for 50-something and people compliment me on my glowing skin, thanks PTR! Although I have sensitive normal to dry skin, I have never experienced an adverse reaction but I am accustomed to all acids, everyone is different. I also don’t discern much of a scent, maybe a bit of pumpkin spice but I have candles burning! Now I’ve had it on for maybe 20 minutes and feel a slight tingling effect, better wash off! Make sure to moisturize hardcore after as well and wear sunscreen, of course. Highly recommend this product, at 70 years young it’s keeping me looking like I’m in love! It’s pure self-care, yum! #70&Smokin’ Pumpkin Delight !!!
