absolutely not even close to worth the money. i brought it as part of a pack of all of the ptr masks and i like the others much better. this is cute and aesthetic but it doesn’t do much in terms of actual actives. it does contain caffeine, so that might tighten skin temporarily. i can’t speak to the gold ingredients. i don’t mind it, i’ll use it very occasionally since i have it. but it doesn’t do much and is wayyy too expensive. honestly save the $85 and put it towards an actual gold facial with an esthetician. nan
