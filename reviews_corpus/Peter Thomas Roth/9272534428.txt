Hated this product. It is awfully sticky, leaves a residue and feels heavy. I do not like putting it on my face in the morning and have not been able to use it. A total waste of money. And it does nothing on its own to be called a primer! Just sits on your face weighing heavy. A ten dollar drugstore primer does a better job. Fed up of the fake reviews here that convinced me to buy it. Absolutely DO NOT RECOMMEND. Sticky & Heavy. Do not recommend.
