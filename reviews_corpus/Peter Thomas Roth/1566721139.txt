Purchased this for my 19yo daughter’s acne and we were so pleased with it I bought myself a jar.  It clears the cheek bumps I get when I don’t stick to my face washing routine.  I have sensitive skin and using it twice a week for 15 minutes didn’t give me any problems.  It also helped a lot with Chloe’s breakouts.  Not cheap but you do get what you pay for.  Recommend. recommend
