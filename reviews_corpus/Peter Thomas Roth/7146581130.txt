Love love love this formula! Leaves my skin super soft and moisturized (bonus points for being my daily spf protection). It leaves my skin a little oily but (a) that goes away as it absorbs more and (b) I think that that helps almost serve as a primer for my makeup and it goes on very smoothly on top. nan
