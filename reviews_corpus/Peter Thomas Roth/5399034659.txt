Love that there’s no white cast! There is a mild sunscreen scent though, but it dissipates within minutes of application. Can double as a mattifying/blurring primer; wouldn’t recommend layering any silicone-based primer or foundation over it as that can cause pilling. Not as blurring as my fave blurring primer, but worth it to skip a step. 2-in-one primer + sunscreen!
