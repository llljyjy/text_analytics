So far so good! I haven’t had any bad reaction like dry patches which is what retinol can do. I totally recommend cutting these into 4 pieces so they can last longer and truth is a fourth of one of these pads works just as good. My skin looks smoother. I have only been using them a week so don’t see much difference but my mom has been using these two and has noticed some of the wrinkles around her eyes look better! I did receive these free from Influenster to try out! so far so good
