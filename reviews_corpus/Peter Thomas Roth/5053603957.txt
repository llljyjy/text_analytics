I am really impressed with this spf. I used skincare under and then makeup over it and it worked well with both. I didn’t have any pilling or patchiness with this. It went on so smooth too and acted as a great base for my makeup. It didn’t breakdown or get oily throughout the day. Overall a really great undetectable spf to try! nan
