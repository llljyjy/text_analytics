I enjoy the cream itself since it seems to be good for my skin. However, the actual case that holds the cream is really fragile. I canâ€™t carry this with me outside my house because of how fragile it is despite me needing sunscreen for that purpose. Not to mention that the cream dispenser stops working after a while too. I have to manually scoop the cream myself. Besides the fragile case, the actual product is decent but a little pricy. They just need a better dispenser and case WARNING: FRAGILE CASE.
