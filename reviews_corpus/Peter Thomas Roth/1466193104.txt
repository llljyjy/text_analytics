One of the best masks ever. I started using it about 5-6 years ago and it still been one (if not THE) the best masks ever! It’s super exfoliating, skin feels very smooth and clean after using it. Beware it’s very strong - do not use it if your skin is very sensitive, irritated, got sunburn or you just used another harsh scrub, peel or glycolic or salicylic acids. One jar lasts for about a year or more (at least for me) as I only use it 1-2 times per week. This mask is definitely worth the price and I hope they never discontinue it. It also smells amazing.
