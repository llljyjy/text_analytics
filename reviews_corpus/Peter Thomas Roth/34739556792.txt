I purchased this because I saw it on a tik tok video and it looked amazing. I washed my face and applied a small amount and felt it working instantly. It does make your skin feel tight and there is a slight burning sensation. Not alarming but it is uncomfortable. Once it dried it turned white. Crusty and white. It was kind of gross but I put make up on top of it. Once I put make up on I had an even bigger mess. The spot I applied the FirmX was white and creamy and now all the firmness was gone and I looked like I had baby butt cream mixed with a little concealer on my face. I tried multiple ways (as stated on the box) and none worked so I turned to good ole youtube and no one there could make it work either. I set up a return to get my $50 back. If you canâ€™t wear this with makeup or without makeup this is a total waste of money. Hard pass on this. SKIP THIS
