As a makeup artist, I was gifted this sunscreen and immediately wanted to try it  because of its priming effects and translucent color. I am always on the hunt for good sunscreen that will not disturb my clients makeup and that is also skin tone inclusive.  Many other brands leave a white cast on my clients skin that is not flattering or causes flashback in photos. This product truly does not do that. I am so impressed and will be using this to prep my clients skin from now on! Makeup artist review- Amazing!!
