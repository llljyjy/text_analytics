I havwbeen using this product for a few days now which was gifted to me and have noticed positive changes. While I do not expect to revamp my skin overnight, it does definitely smooth out the texture. My skin is sensitive and I only have positive things to say! There has been no irritation and has nor aggravated my rosacea at all. I use this every other night for now, as I need to build a tolerance up for my skin.  It definitely feels like itâ€™s getting the job done. I cannot wait to see results progress in the coming weeks. So far so good
