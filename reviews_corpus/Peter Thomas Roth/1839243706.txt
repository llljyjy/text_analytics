Mostly underwhelmed by this one, and I usually like PTR products. I had to stop using it on my face because it beaded up so badly. And it didnâ€™t seem to add any moisture or do anything for the fine lines under my eyes. But it does work as a neck cream -- it has softened the lines on my neck. Weird. Works as neck cream but not good for the face
