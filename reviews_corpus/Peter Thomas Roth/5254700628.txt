I was so excited to purchase and to try this product. But it did not work for me at all. I followed the instructions to a tee. And everytime I was left with a white cast underneath my eyes. Waiting for 5 entire minutes for the product to dry doesn’t work for me. I’m on a tight schedule in the mornings. This Instant FIRMx temporary eye tightener is a big NOOOO for me. Didn't work for me!
