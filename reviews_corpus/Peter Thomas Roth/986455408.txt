I was really impressed with this just after the first use! I’ve used a variety of different peels and this is one of the best. It does sting a little, which is expected/common, but it wasn’t too bad. It also didn’t dry out my skin, which was really nice! I just looked glowy and smooth the morning after. I wasn’t sure if you’re supposed to layer anything on afterwards, but I did apply a moisturizing collagen cream because I have dry skin. I’ve been using it once a week for about three weeks and have already noticed more even tone and just a brighter, smoother complexion. Will definitely repurchase! Impressed!!
