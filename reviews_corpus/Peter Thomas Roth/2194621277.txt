Im shocked reading how many bad reviews there are for this product because I have used these for a couple years now and restock as soon as I run out! They stay on throughout the night and when I wake up they’ve pulled everything out into a whitehead or have healed an already cleaned zit. I like how there’s some small and some large dots and they’re individually packaged so I can bring them on vacation without the whole box. I’ve used some other brands and they don’t work as well for me work great!!
