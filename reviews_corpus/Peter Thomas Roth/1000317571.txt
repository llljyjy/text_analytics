This product works.  Retin A in the evening with moisturizer, then this Vitamin C product with moisturizer in the morning.  The combo will completely refine your skin texture, reducing fine lines, firming and adding glow.  But, this stuff smells horrid.  Like rancid bacon.  If you use the product on your neck, as you should, then get dressed, the scent will linger on your clothes.  It’s a trade off I guess.  I’m about the finish the bottle and came here to reorder, seeing the reviews about the latest batch of product has me on the fence.  I can continue to deal with the smell but I do not want to potentially deal with an oily, poorly manufactured product.  Is there an update from the company? Not sure
