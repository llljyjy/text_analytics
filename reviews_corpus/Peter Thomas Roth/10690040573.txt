I received this product complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth. I love that this container has 90 patches that will last me a long time. There are two different shaped patches. The half-moon patch shape can be used for the undereye are and the oval patch shape for the forehead or any other part of the face. I take out the patches with the tweezers and apply the patches to my dry and clean skin. I love putting the oval patch on my forehead. The patches have a nice cooling effect and stay nicely in place. I leave them on for about 10 to 15 minutes. After removing the patches, I tap the remaining serum into my skin. I can really see a difference after using them. The undereye area looks smoother, less puffy and my dark circles are less noticeable. They really make the skin under my eyes and my forehead look smooth and hydrated. I love how easy it is to pamper certain areas of my face with these special relaxing patches. I really recommend them! So hydrating
