these are one of the best undereye patches iâ€™ve ever tried. first off, i love the ingredients in this!! i like how they come in different sizes since it helps target specific areas. it also comes with tweezers that makes cross contamination less likely when taking the patches out of the container. the patches are quite moisturizing and they stay on pretty well. nan
