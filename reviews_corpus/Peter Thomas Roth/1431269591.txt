I really wanted to like this product. I gave it a serious try. First off, I didn’t really like the watery consistency. It has the word “cream” in the description, but I found nothing creamy about it. But my biggest issue was that it causes my sling to break out—a lot. I haven’t had acne like this since I was a teenager, and no face product I’ve ever used has done this to me. When I stopped using it for a couple of days, my skin cleared right up. I used it again, and the next day I was broken out again. It pains me to throw this away, but it’s in the trash. Not a Fan
