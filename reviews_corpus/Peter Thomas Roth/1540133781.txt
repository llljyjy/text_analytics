I always get frustrated when I see a new version of the ad for this set with the same stupidly overly-valued price because I really do love these masks (and still think it’s worth it, at that). The amounts (50mL) provided in this kit are 1/3 of the original $60 (150mL) price and x4 is really only an $80 value. That being said, the sizes are still enough for several wears of each of the masks… and is also a great way to sample all of the PTR masks separately before committing to a full size. I’ve tried and can vouch for all but the hyaluronic one, although I have a few PTR products from the water drench line so I’m sure I’d love it.This is definitely a great set for trying many of the PTR masks, I just wish they would stop disappointing people and just do the dang math right. Amazing masks but dramatically overvalued
