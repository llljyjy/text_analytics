This is a chemical sunscreen meaning it has absolutely no white cast. The product is a thick clear gel and virtually invisible. This is my favorite part of sunscreen. It has no detectable scent to me, which is another huge plus. I’m not too fond of the typical sunscreen smell. The finish is silky like a primer. It smoothes out my skin’s imperfections and works as a perfect canvas for my makeup. Be mindful with the moisturizer you layer with; otherwise, it might pill. With the right moisturizer, it works great! No white cast!
