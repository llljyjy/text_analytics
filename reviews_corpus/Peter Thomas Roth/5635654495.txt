I received this product for free for my review. I had never tried a resurfacing pad but have used chemical exfoliants in the past. I wouldnâ€™t suggest this for someone who had never used a similar product or I would suggest using only once a week to start like advised. It worked well with my skin, but if you have any acne sores it will sting. I did notice a change in brightness after a couple weeks of use. Good product overall. nan
