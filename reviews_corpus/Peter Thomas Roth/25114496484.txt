I’ve been using Super Goop for years now. I’ve sworn by it have influenced others to use it too. The Sephora sale compelled me to try something new. And boy am I ever glad I did. I am NEVER going back again. This sunscreen is SO lightweight. The major bonus is that it’s a moisturizer AND spf in one, so you’re not left with super greasy skin with two layers of lotion on. I am amazed at how lightweight yet moisturizing it is. I always just thought face sunscreen is naturally just greasy and leaves a shiny residue. But nope, not this one. It is WORTH the price. Yes it’s expensive, but I’ve never used an SPF that literally does not feel like I’m wearing thick sunscreen. Goes very well under make up. No stickiness, no white cast, no strong smell, no greasiness. I’m amazed and obsessed. I would knock a star down for the price, but honestly it’s just too good of a product that definitely earned a 5 star. A staple product to add to your skincare routine! worth every penny
