I love this Peter Thomas Roth face and eye patches. I like the design of the package and came with tweezers to easily lift the patches, and it’s convenient and clean. After I use the patches, immediately, I can see the change. When I apply it under my eyes and forehead, those area cool down. It’s nice to apply especially in this hot heat weather. Gel patches
