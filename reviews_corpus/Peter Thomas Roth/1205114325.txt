Great moisturizer/sunscreen for daily use. I use it everyday, unless I’m on the boat or will be in a lot of sun. It’s light but moisturizing. I’ve read that even sitting in front of a computer or near windows exposes your face to ultraviolet rays. This feels like nothing on, so it’s great for those of us who don’t like a lot of goop on their skin.  For the record, I’m 70 and fanatic about what’s on my face. Great moisturizer/sunscreen.
