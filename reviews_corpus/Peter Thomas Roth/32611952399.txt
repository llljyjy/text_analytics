Pros: Goes on smoothly, doesn’t feel heavy, no white castCons: Definitely pills when putting it on, leaves face shiny (can be a pro if you like that), make up separatesI’ve been using this for a few weeks and I do like how this feels on my face but I have noticed that since I started using it, at the end of the day my makeup looks patchy and separated. I didn’t have that issue before using the product so maybe the primer in this just isn’t for me. I haven’t gotten a chance to test the spf much since it’s currently chilly where I live. nan
