I’ve used the Peter Thomas Roth hydra gel collagen eye masks a few times now and so far they seem nice. The skin where they were was left softer after use. So far I haven’t noticed a long term change in my skin but I’m going to keep using them and see. I received this product in exchange for my honest review. nan
