Iâ€™ve been using these resurfacing pads after washing my face and applying the serum. My skin is sensitive so I do feel a slight tingle but nothing abnormal for me.  I have been pleasantly surprised at how smooth and toned my face looks after two weeks of use. It certainly is aiding in turning over my dead skin cells revealing fresh new skin. I will continue purchasing and using this collection. nan
