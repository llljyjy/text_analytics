I received this sunscreen complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth. This sunscreen is sheer and definitely has that primer like finish when applied. It does have the typical sunscreen smell that I’m not really a fan off, and with a second layer, the product folds into itself and pills, which is really unfortunate. The only way I’ve been able to use this is as a single layer primer but that is not enough sunscreen to be protective. Works as a primer but beware
