I received this product for free from Influenster, PeterThomasRothOfficial, and Sephora in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks and so far I’m pleased with it. It goes on nice and smooth as long as you don’t use too much at once. I like that there is no oily feeling after using it. A little bit goes a long way so I imagine the container will last at least a month or two. The only thing I wasn’t sure of was the smell. It wasn’t scented, but it just smelled different. I suppose if I noticed significant results the scent wouldn’t bother me at all! Even Smoother Glycolic Retinol Resurfacing Serum
