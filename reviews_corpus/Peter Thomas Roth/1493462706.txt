This was my first time trying a retinol product. I was expecting my skin to feel irritated, dry, and have a lot of redness, but none of this happened with this product! I am using it every other day with no reaction. I feel I need to use it a little bit longer to see the anti aging effects but I will definitely continue to use this in my skin care routine. I have sensitive skin so I am super pleased that I am able to handle this product to add to my routine. I do prefer the serum over the pads based on the texture, but I only need one half of the pad for my entire face which makes it last longer! nan
