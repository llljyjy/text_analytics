First red flag was “universal tint”. The employee at my local Sephora told me it was the best on the market and when I pointed out my skepticism about the universal shade she told me that she has friends who “are tanner than me” who love this SPF. If you read the box closely, it does say that it’s best suited for medium tones. For reference I’m a 370 in Fenty Beauty. It goes on very thick and light in color and definitely enhances dry patches. There is no doubt a white cast. I’ve been wearing it for about a week and I’ve noticed that the white cast improves over time (maybe after 30 minutes or so). Overall, it does even out redness and is lightweight, however I don’t think it is great for medium-deep skin tones or for dry skin. I’ll continue to try it out but plan on returning. no such thing as a universal tint
