I will be the first to admit I use these when I am feeling lazy and donâ€™t want to do a full skincare routine. They are easy to use, more gentle then other similar products, a lot of pads, and have done wonders transforming the complexion and texture of my skin. Would highly recommend , worth the price ! Also a huge fan of this brand. I reviewed this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. BUY THESE
