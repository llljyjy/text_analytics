Yes!thatâ€™s all I can really say about this to sum it up. Originally I was nervous, because my face turned red as soon as I wiped it and I have fairly sensitive skin.  But I started dabbing instead of rubbing and added it in 2 nights a week, the feel of my skin was like it never has been before! Highly recommend nan
