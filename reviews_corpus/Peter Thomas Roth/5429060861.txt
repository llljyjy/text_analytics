I was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth and have really been enjoying this product. This is probably one of my favorite sunscreens so far. The application is very smooth and blurs pores and imperfections. It applies clear so there is no need to worry about white cast and is not greasy at all. I only take one star off because when I received my package about 1/3 of the bottle was empty which was a bummer since I do love the product. Additionally it does contain Homosalate and Octocrylene which are not reef safe so please do not enter the ocean using this sunscreen! Other than that this sunscreen is perfect on land and has truly been a game changer in my skincare routine. nan
