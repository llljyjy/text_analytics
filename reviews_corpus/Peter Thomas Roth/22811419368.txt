So these I have used a few times now and I feel more like they are seep cleaning my skin more than anything else.  I remove makeup, wash my face and then use these and the pad comes out looking so dirty. Unfortunately the serum on it also makes my skin get very warm, which makes it difficult to sleep. Will have to try moving my skin care to earlier in the night. As I just started using this, I donâ€™t see much result yet, but have high hopes! nan
