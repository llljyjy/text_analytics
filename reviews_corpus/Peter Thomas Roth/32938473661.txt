Gifted by Peter Thomas Roth for my honest review. Received this in the mail today and tried it immediately. So far I really like it. It works great and is so hydrating under my eyes. The only thing is the pricing. Itâ€™s expensive for the amount you get but if you have dark under the eyes and have some money to splurge, I would give it a try. I really like that it works for other areas of your face such as your laugh line or just anywhere to smooth out the skin. It's good!
