Pleasantly surprised by this formula! I have been trying this product for 2 weeks and very happy about how this formulad did not break me out at all. I have combination oily skin that not very sensitive but I do have to train my skin when I use retinol skincare. The first week this product did nothing for me, nothing negative, nothing positive. But I can see my skin are slowly getting use to it and there is less dry skin around the perimeter of my face. Will keep trying and updading my review. Complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth nan
