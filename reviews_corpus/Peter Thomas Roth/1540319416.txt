Where has this product been all my life? These little pads have worked wonders for my skin. I use them once a week since they can be a little too much more often than that. I do use them in conjunction with the serum by the same name. They have visibly improved the texture of my skin. My skin is smoother and not as dull as it was before. Iâ€™ve also noticed an improvement in the fine lines on my forehead. nan
