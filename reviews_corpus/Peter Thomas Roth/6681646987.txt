Iâ€™ve been using this mask for years, it has saved my skin so many times. Anytime it feels dry, irritated or after extractions I use this and my skin heals after one use. Every time I go outdoor like camping or hiking my skin feels awfully dry and I break out horribly. So this has been my absolute ride or die and will use forever! Also works amazing as a sleeping mask. I can use it everyday and it works even better if you keep it in the fridge! Love love it! my ride or die
