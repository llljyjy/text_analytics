I bought this product on blind faith since I was advised by the associate that this product would be good for me since I have hyperpigmentation (Black woman with scars from childhood acne.) I’ve done everything under the sun in terms of skincare to correct this issue. Desperate to resolve my forever problem I purchased this product.1. Efficacy: Unfortunately, I could not stick around long enough due to the smell. But, not only that it made my skin extremely greasy. 2. Scent: It is true. The product smells like bacon. The scent doesn’t stick to your skin especially if you’re using other products, but why does it smell like raw bacon? 3. Texture: C’mon.. it looks like a bodily secretion and I couldn’t help but think that every time I pumped the bottle to put that on my face. This was made for someone, just not me
