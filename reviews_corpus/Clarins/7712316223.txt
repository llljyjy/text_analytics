Recieved a 7 day sample of Clarins Double Serum for free in exchange for my honest review. It is 2 serums that need to be mixed and used together. It uses plant extracts  and boosts regeneration, oxygenation, nutrition, hydration, and protection. The purpose is to see reduction of fine lines, wrinkles, enlarged pores, loss of radiance and firmness. I found these samples reasonably easy to use. It has a light and pleasant scent. It is easy to apply. I applied it to my face and neck at night. My skin is definitely soft and smooth. I did not see a huge improvement in my fine lines and that might be because the sample size was only for 7 days. Other than that it was a nice serum and I think that my skin could benefit for a longer time period. I intend to buy it. Clarins Double Serum Review
