Have been using Clarins products for years now. I love this brand. It always produces the best and the most effective products. This one is no exception. I am a new mama. I barely sleep now. I always have dark circles under my eyes. This eye cream is a true miracle. First of all, I have sensitive eyes where I have to be really careful of the eyecreams I am using.  With this cream, I had no irriation issues. No rashes which is amazing.  So good to finally find an eye product that doesn’t irritate and safe to use. This eye cream is very effective. I have dark circles because lack of sleep. When I apply this cream my dark circles are almost done withing couple minutes. It also reduces puffiness which is a plus for me. I also saw a improvement on my wrinkles.  Also it should be noted that it has a light texture and it absorbs fast. It doesn’t effect your eye makeup due to its absorption. I couldn’t be happier with the results. I am very happy with this eye cream. Can’t wait to see most of my wrinkles gone 1 year down the line. It is definitely worth to invest in. nan
