I really love this eye serum from Clarins, I used this eye serum for seven consecutive days. I noticed a difference in my skin around my eyes by day four, my skin was smoother and plumper, so it appeared to have less fine lines and wrinkles. I only use the product for a week, but I would be curious to see how effective it would be after a month. I will be on the lookout for sale and pick this up first chance I get. Loved this eye serum
