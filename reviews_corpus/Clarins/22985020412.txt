Butterly gifted me some samples of Clarins Double Serum, they sent about 5 little sample packages so I was only able to try it out 5 times which doesn’t give me enough time or product to decide if I like something. I will be doing my review based on the first impression of this product by Clarins. It smells amazing and leaves my face feeling super hydrated and satisfied. As far as long term effects or any signs of reduced fine lines I cannot comment as I didn’t get to see those results. I would love to try it long term
