This is my first time trying the Clarin’s Extra Firm neck Serum. I love the packaging, the small spout makes it easy to dispense the perfect amount. This is a light formula that doesn’t feel sticky after application. I am in Florida so I can’t have anything too slimy. Seems to be working so far! Great Cream!
