This Hydrating and lightweight serum works really well, but honestly, I would have loved to have more product to test in order to see long term changes on my skin. So far, my face feels more hydrated and somewhat firm and at the same it seems to have reduced my pores, which is one of my biggest concerns when it comes to my skin, because they have gotten more pronounced with age. However, now they have returned to a smaller size. I have only used it for a week and my skin looks more healthy, and now I canâ€™t wait to buy the serum and make it a part of my skin care routine.#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare A nice addition to my routine!
