As I am entering in my mid 30s I like to do a little bit of prevention especially for my neck area as I noticed some signs of aging. I started to pay more attention to my neck area and I started to look for products that would help me. I really enjoy the texture and formula of this cream, it applies easily and absorbs quickly leaving my skin hydrated and smooth. A bit perfumy, but it is not as noticeable after I applied it. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and I have noticed slight changes when it comes to the firmness of my neck area. I canâ€™t wait to see it at its full potential! I can't wait to see its full potential!
