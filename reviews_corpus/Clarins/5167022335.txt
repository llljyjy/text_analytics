I have had a lot of fun testing this eye cream out. The texture is very thin, so I apply it to the back of my hand and then take my finger and apply it to the area around my eyes. This eye cream is definitely hydrating and I like that it’s made with multiple plant extracts, and I think it’s cool to be able to visibly see the two different textures from the dual-formula. I’m not quite sure it’s worth the price, but I really like it and I don’t typically like eye creams enough to use them consistently. Gentle and hydrating
