This Clarins double serum for eyes is very interesting. There are two types of content inside. One is more liquid like a concentrate, the other one is more like a lotion type gel. I use one pump and both content comes out in about equal sizes. I mixed the two parts together and it forms like a lightweight gel. It glides on my eye areas easily and I pat it around and it absorbs fairly quickly. It gives immediate hydration to my eye area. I like how it feels on my eyes. I am looking forward to the anti-aging effects with longer usage. Good hydration
