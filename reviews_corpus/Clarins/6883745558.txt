I was really excited to try this because I am a huge fan of the face serum. Unfortunately this was not as good as the serum is. I am a new mom, meaning no sleep and dark circles under my eyes. This didn’t really help me. It hydrated just so so. I did notice some tightening and smoothing so it definitely helps with fine lines but won’t do much for wrinkles. It just wasn’t enough for me and I have better experience with other eye creams/serums. nan
