Received my free trial of Clarins Double Serum from Butterly and have just completed my 7 day trial. While the results were not overly drastic after 1 week of use, the texture of my skin improved as well as the hydration. This is an excellent serum if you are looking for extra hydration during the cold and dry winter months, my skin was so bouncy after a week of using this! It had a light refreshing scent and was non-greasy. It absorbed quickly into my skin after application. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to add to their anti-aging skin care lineup, I will definitely be purchasing this product. For reference I am 31 years old, female, and have acne prone combination skin (oily t-zone yet prone to dryness in the winter) Great anti-aging product!
