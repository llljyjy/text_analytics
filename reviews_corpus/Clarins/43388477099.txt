I received this product in exchange for an honest review. My skin gets extremely dry at this time of year, and my face in particular. This serum did a great job keeping my skin hydrated for hours after use. The only down side for me personally is that I am very sensitive to scent and this product has a strong scent that I smelled for hours after use. It wasnâ€™t overpowering, but it was strong for me. Kept my skin hydrated for hours
