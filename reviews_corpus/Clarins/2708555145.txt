I just started using this mask and I already love it! It works great with Clarins neck cream and makes the skin feel so soft and smooth! It helped relax some lines on my cheeks and soften the appearance of the lines on my neck, even if only temporarily. I hope that the results will persist with regular use! I use it together with Clarins neck cream
