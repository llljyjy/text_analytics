I’m always looking for a great eye treatment. Not only do I have slightly droopy top eyelids, I also have a small scar by my eye.  The Clarins Double Serum treated both beautifully!  The serum consists of two treatments that blend together when dispensed.  It feels comforting and slightly cooling, and absorbs quickly. My top eyelids didn’t feel or look as puffy, and the scar tissue by my eye looks and feels less noticeable. Works really well!
