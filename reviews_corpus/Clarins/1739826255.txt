I tried a sample for a few nights! Loved the moisture glow effect a lot.  Didn’t have enough product to try longer. What didn’t encourage me to buy the full size bottle is the fragrance. It’s nice but too strong and I don’t want to put that much chemical fragrance on my skin. I think they should reduced the fragrance to the absolute minimum possible. Fragrance not part of a skin regime for sure … Great moisture and glow but too much fragrance
