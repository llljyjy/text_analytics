I wish the sample size was bigger so that i could conduct a better wear test. This to me smells like Chance Chanel Eau Tendre but with more notes of Rose which i absolutely love. Fresh and fruity. Pretty pricey tho. Projection is good COULDNT really test out longevity because of how small the sample was but it did last a good few hours. I recommend Good
