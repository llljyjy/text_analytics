I really fell in love with the packaging of this product. The pump makes it so much easier to access the product than having to stick my long nails into jars. I struggle a lot with dark under eye circles and I have started to see some improvement with that which makes me happy. The texture is a nice lightweight cream gel consistency that goes on well under my make up. It leaves a really hydrated feeling. This is definitely something Iâ€™m going to keep in my routine. Love
