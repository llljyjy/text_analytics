I received a 7 day sample of this product for testing. This product claims to give you younger-looking eyes in 7 days. I like how this product uses a combination of 2 serums and while my eyes stayed hydrated (unlike the Clarins anti-aging double serum which dried my skin) I really didn’t see any changes. I personally think new skincare routines need more than 7 days to see any real results so while I wouldn’t count this out; but the sample wasn’t enough for me to praise the product. undecided
