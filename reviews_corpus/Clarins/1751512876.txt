This serum felt great upon application. It has a clean, fresh fragrance. It is very smooth without being oily. I noticed that it made my skin red for about 20 min after I applied it but there was no stinging or pain. I have sensitive, fair skin. It dries to be slightly sticky but I didnâ€™t mind as I used it as a night serum. I did not notice any change in my skin; however, I did not use for more than 7 days as I received it as a sample. nan
