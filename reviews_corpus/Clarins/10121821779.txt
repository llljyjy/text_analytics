I’m all for a good serum especially one that helps fight signs of aging..I do not care for wrinkles! However this serum left my face quite oily. I already have fairly oily skin so this wasn’t great for me but it could definitely be beneficial for those with dry skin. It does help diminish the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines! Good but greasy
