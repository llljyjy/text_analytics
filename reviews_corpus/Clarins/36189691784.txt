I’ve been using this for about 4 weeks and there is slight difference. The serum smells really nice, it’s very gentle on the eyes, and it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I’ve also noticed that it plumps the skin and does leave a slight glow. I love that everything is natural, but I think it might be “too gentle”. The changes are really small and it does nothing for dark circles, but other than that it’s fine. This would be great for teens or anyone with younger skin that just wants to give their skin a little “pop”. I’d say if you’d like a really big change, you might just want to spring for something else since you’re paying this much anyway. Decent enough.
