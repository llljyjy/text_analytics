This is a two-in-one product with 20+1 youth-boosting plant extracts which targets wrinkles, firming, radiance, eveness, and pore reduction. Seriously, it’s the holy grail! The packets have two separate compartments that you mix together. You then apply the product onto your face. I love this concept as it helps to keep the ingredients more potent! The two serums are thin in consistency. One has a rich gold colour and the other is clear. When mixed together, it almost looks like honey in your hands. The texture of the serum is a bit oily at first. But, it absorbs into the skin quickly and doesn’t leave you with a greasy feeling!I personally liked to apply this product in both my morning and evening routine. I found that it has a nice floral scent that is not too overpowering. If you aren’t a big fan of the scent, don’t worry, it dissipates quickly. I noticed immediate results with this serum. It’s incredibly hydrating and left my skin with a nice glow. After only a few days of use, I have noticed a dramatic shrinkage in my larger pores and a much smoother skin texture. This stuff is seriously amazing. I am absolutely blown away and loving the results! I have combination/acne prone skin and for me it didn’t cause any break outs or irritation. I definitely recommend this product to everyone and will definitely be purchasing a full-sized bottle of this serum! #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #thisisbutterly #ChickAdvisor Holy Grail Alert!
