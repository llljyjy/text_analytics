Clarins Double Serum contains 21 plant extracts which helps to rejuvenate, protect and hydrate your skin while improving the tone and texture. This serum has a unique blend of ingredients including Turmeric, Beautyberry, Leaf of Life, and Orthosiphon (just to name a few). It has a lovely floral fragrance and the idea of combining two potent serums into one, has me intrigued. Since there are two serums, there are also two different textures. When opening the packet there was a fair amount of the dark orange oil-like serum, with about two drops of clear liquid. They easily combined by rubbing my hands together and applied effortlessly onto my skin. This serum only took a few seconds to completely absorb, and there was no greasy or tacky residue afterwards. After just a few days of using, I noticed much softer feeling skin. I would however love to try the full version to experience all the benefits. Lovely serum
