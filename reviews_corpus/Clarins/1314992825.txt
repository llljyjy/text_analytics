I was so excited to try the Clarins Total Eye Lift and was not disappointed! Just for starters let me say, in the first 60 seconds you will notice a visible eye lift which is amazing and no joke! I was amazed by this!I’ve never seen anything like this before! This product really does it all so I love it and can use it to tackle all my needs. It leaves your under eyes looking rested and brighter, it visibly smooths fine lines and wrinkles, and it (this is a major plus) enhances brows and lashes! I’ve never tried an eye cream nor heard of one enhances lashes and brows before which is amazing. I apply this eye cream by warming it up a bit between my fingers and then applying by gently pressing under my eyes, my eyelids, my lashes, my brows, between my brows, and from inner corners of my eyes to temples. I feel this is the perfect eye cream it does it all and even gives you instant eye lifting results! My eyes feel moisturized with this cream that has a light smooth texture and it absorbs well, my makeup also applies well over it which is important. I now see why this eye cream has won so many awards from magazines! Because it’s just that good! 60 second eye lift
