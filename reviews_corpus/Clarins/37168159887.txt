I had the opportunity to try the Clarins Double Serum. I tried it for a week, as directed, and I found that if I used the directed amount my face was left feeling a little greasy.After adjusting the amount I used, adding a little bit at a time, my face was left feeling hydrated & smooth. I even noticed some small wrinkles around my mouth and forehead seemed to disappear. It also made a difference in my skin tone, I felt it became more even, and brighter.Overall I definitely recommend Worth the price?
