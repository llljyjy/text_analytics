After using this product for a week, my skin feels incredibly smooth and hydrated. As it is an oil, it doesn’t take a lot of the product to spread and cover your entire face.  It has a nice subtle smell that isn’t too overpowering and is easy to apply. The reason I may or may not purchase this again is due to the price tag for the bottle, but as I mentioned a little bit goes a long way.  I would need to try it a bit longer than a week or so to see if there are additional benefits such as reduction of fine lines/wrinkles but I can 100% say that my skin does feel hydrated! nan
