I received the 7 days sample pack. The two serums are thin in consistency, one has a rich gold colour and the other is clear. After mixing it, I applied to my skin. It did not feel sticky but slightly oily which required more patting it into my skin. My skin looked radiant, hydrated and felt really smooth.   It has a pleasant, sweet floral- fruity scent which I didnâ€™t find was overwhelming or long lasting.  I also did not notice a significant difference with reduction of wrinkles which I am assuming it is because I only used it for a week. Overall, I loved using this serum for the smooth feeling and radiance appearance.Free sample from @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor Smooth skin
