I was super intrigued to try this firming neck cream as I’m getting older and developing more neck lines…I really love the subtle scent of this cream! It’s super creamy and more on the thicker side but the texture feels lightweight and non-greasy on the skin…but it definitely gives a lot of hydration to the targeted areas you apply it. I like to apply this during morning and nighttime skincare routines.. I take a small amount, warm up the product on my palms and gently massage my chin and décolleté area..I don’t notice a big difference yet in terms of minimizing my fine lines or firming (been using it for about a week now) but I def feel like my skin around that area feels softer and way more hydrated! I will continue to use it and hope to see more great results! I needed to try this!!
