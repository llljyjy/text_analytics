I was sent this Double Serum from Clarins in exchange for my honest review. This serum helps provide radiant and hydrated skin. The serum feels lightweight and is nicely hydrating and moisturizing. It contains more than 20 plant extracts to help improve the skinâ€™s radiance and minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. I have tried this beautiful serum a few times so far. My skin looks and feels more hydrated and healthier when using this serum. It works very well in combination with my other skincare products. It does have a heavy amount of fragrance but I have noticed more radiant skin while using this serum and will continue to use as a part of my skincare routine. Very fragranced but nice results
