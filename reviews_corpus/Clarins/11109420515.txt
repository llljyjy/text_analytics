Clarins Double Serum is doubly awesome. It is a little oily and watery together. The pump is adjustable so it can dispense a little or a lot. I like this so I donâ€™t use more than I need. I love the ingredients and the benefits they provide. I have been applying this to my face and neck daily. It does take a minute to work it in and it is a bit tacky for a few minutes after until it gets absorbed so this is not meant for a rushed skincare routine. I find it is best to apply it and wait at least 5 minutes before the next step. great serum
