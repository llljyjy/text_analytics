I received a free sample of this product.As someone with sensitive skin, I am always looking for anti-aging products that show visible results but don’t break me out. I really enjoyed the scent, texture, and coverage of this product and am pleased to report it did not break me out. I am disappointed in the wasteful packaging. If the packaging changes I would definitely purchase this product. Until that happens though, I probably won’t purchase it. Great product, wasteful packaging
