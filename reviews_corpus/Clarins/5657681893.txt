I was lucky enough to be chosen to review the Double Serum Firming & Smoothing Anti-Aging Concentrate from Butterly/ChickAdvisor. The packaging was a little wasteful (several small disposable packets) instead of a bottle. As far as serums go, this one wasn’t bad. It felt nice on my skin, but I didn’t see too many visible differences after a week of using it. Maybe it takes a bit more time to kick in? I also did not enjoy the smell at all, but I can be pretty picky about scents. Big Clarins fan, but this one isn’t a win for me. Not bad, not amazing
