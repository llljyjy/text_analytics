I received a 7 day sample of Clarins Double Serum Eye from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I have very light crow’s feet wrinkles, loss of elasticity, puffiness, and very light dark circles. After using this product for the full 7 days I did find that my skin looked somewhat plumper, more hydrated, and more radiant. I had no irritating side effects, I did find that it was a little more like a light oil than a serum in consistency but other than that I think that with continued use this product would do what it promises. It’s definitely worth trying. Worth trying!
