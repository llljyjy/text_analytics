This has been part of my facial routine for over 5 years now.  I use it 2-3 times a week.  It is a citrus scented, gentle but effective face scrub.  It lathers and rinses clean and leaves my face smooth.  I have normal to dry (in the winter) skin and this does not strip my skin or leave it feeling tight.  Itâ€™s great to use after a night out with heavy make-up or after a workout.  My husband and son also use it in the shower. My go-to face scrub
