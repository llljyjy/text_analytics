I received a 7-day sample in exchange for my honest review. The product smells great, and it goes on well. However, the way the sample was packaged, it was a giant pain to get all the product out and then had to mix it together. It said Iâ€™d see results in 7 days, but I see no difference at all. I think you need longer than 7 days to see results. nan
