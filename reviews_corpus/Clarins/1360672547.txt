Okay, so right off the bat I enjoyed the smell of this product, although a bit strong. The serums themself were great texture and really nice to put on. They werenâ€™t greasy or oily and didnt leave any sticky residue on my skin. They absorb well and made my skin feel really soft and hydrated. After 7 days of use, I can say I did notice my face being more radiant and hydrated, but I didnt see any change in fine lines or pores, which was a bit disappointing... but I imagine you would need to be using this for longer than a week to see any true results. Its alright
