I received this for free by influenster for my honest review. I love everything Clarins so I’m probably biased, lol. But I literally saw results in like 4/5 days of using this product. Feels good going on and your skin is hydrated. I’m 39 so I don’t have any wrinkles or sagging skin but I’m sure this will definitely make sure that will never happen. Do they ever disappoint???
