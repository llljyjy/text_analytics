I received the Clairins Double Eye Serum for FREE from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I applied this day and night and I found it to really hydrate my eyes without being irritating. It’s full of glycerin, squalane, caffeine & turmeric which are all really good ingredients! Glycerin and squalane are amazing hydrators and caffeine is fantastic at reducing under-eye darkness and puffiness. Clarins claims this serum will give you younger looking eyes and I feel like there are two types of anti-aging approaches… One being HYDRATION where your skin is temporarily plumped and smoothed kinda like rehydrating a raisin back into a grape! And the other being RETINOL which is a powerhouse ingredient that works over time to truly undo fine lines and wrinkles. This eye cream is the former… just giving you temporary line smoothing via hydration. I found that it worked really well under my eyes as a primer for my concealer. Hydrating!
