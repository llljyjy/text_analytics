I received a seven-day trial of this product from Butterly and Clarins in exchange for my honest review. I enjoyed the formula of this serum as well as the light rose-like scent. My skin didnâ€™t seem to like something in the formula, as I did experience some redness after using. The serum absorbed easily, with only minimal stickiness. I did not notice any real benefits, however, outside of my skin feeling a bit more moisturized. Given that this was a seven-day trial, it is possible that more benefits could come with time. Overall, this was a nice serum, but, given the price, I would expect to see more benefits.#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree Enjoyed Formula, but Skin Sensitivity Issues
