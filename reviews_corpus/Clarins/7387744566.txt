I received samples from @butterly in exchange for my honest review. I liked how soft the Clarins Double Serum made my face feel. I will say I didn’t enjoy the packaging of the samples packs and think I would have had a better experience using a full sized or packaging that similar to the full sized product. The sample packaging didn’t feel like the correct amount of each serum came out. The Double serum is different from any other serums i have tried because the serum its self was recommended to warm it up by mixing it together in your palm then patting on the face. The Double serum did feel very good on my face, and I’m not sure if I would describe it as either sticky nor greasy, but it was heavier than my normal serum. My skin type is combination and the serum did not instantly absorb. While the brand does say you can wear it day or night, I preferred to wear it at night because it didn’t absorb quickly. I will say, my skin was extremely soft in the morning and felt silky. As I did test this for 7 days, I did test it along side of other skin care products such as wearing it under different facial moisturizers. For most of the moisturizers I applied on top of the serum, there was no pilling, but I did have pilling with moisturizer that is more water based so if you prefer a water based moisturizer, that could be an issue. For the pilling, I did mark is down from 5 stars to 4. The smell of this serum is so nice, not overpowering and definitely smells clean and luxurious. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great night time serum. nan
