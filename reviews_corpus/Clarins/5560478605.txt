I’ve been using this serum for an entire week now and can definitively say that there is a noticeable difference in my skin texture. My face looks plumper and more hydrated, giving me a healthier look. My eye area appears to be less puffy than usual, though it’s always difficult to say whether that’s the particular skin product or swings in lifestyle (sleep, nutrition, water intake, etc.) from week to week. Most noticeable was the reduction in my pores, which was a big win for me. The scent is very light and perfect for evening application. My only complaint would be that this doesn’t absorb as quickly as I’d like, leaving my face a little oily and rubbing some residue onto my pillowcase. This may also be a function of summer skin tending to be “greasier” than the rest of the year, so I could see this serum working wonders in the dry and chapped winter months. Bonus: I love that it combines a ton of plant extracts and is made in France, which is my holy grail source for skincare. I #gotitfree to try through Butterly. Reduced pores + healthier-looking skin
