I honestly didn’t expect to loce this product as much as I do. I thought it would be thick, sticky and would keep running out of my lip line... and it doesn’t do any of these things. It’s luxurious feeling, has a surprisingly good lasting power and fully hydrates my lip. I would constantly reapply if it weren’t for the good lasting power! Also smells amazing and is colourless on the lip. My favourite lip oil
