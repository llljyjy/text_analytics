Upon receiving the little sample packets, I thought it was quite creative in terms of packaging and how we were supposed to get the product out (fold in half, press, mix). It is more on the wasteful side due to the individual packaging but it does indeed keep the ingredients fresh and maximize the product’s capabilities. However, upon actual usage, it was rather difficult to get the product out. I think the idea is there but execution could be improved. This is purely regarding the samples, so the full size likely will not have this problem. As for the product itself, it absorbed well into my dry skin and my skin did become soft with a nice glow. However, 7 days of testing wasn’t long enough to test the antiaging properties so I can’t comment on that side of things. It does have a slight but nice scent to it but nothing overwhelming, and if scent is a concern you can definitely try or smell it in store first. Overall, this is a nice moisturizing serum if you’re on the lookout for one! #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree Nice serum
