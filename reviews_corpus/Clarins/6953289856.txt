This eye cream is sooo nice! The packaging itself is stunning and it gives you two pump options. I use the smaller option for less product but there is a larger option for more so you have a bit of control over how much product you get. I have never seen a pump like this. The eye creams themselves come out together and then you mix them with your fingertips. They glide over the under eye area smoothly and have a bit of cooling to them that feels really nice. I notice my eyes are much less puffy and they feel velvety soft. I am hooked! Very luxe and works!
