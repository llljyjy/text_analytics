As a skincare product that goes especially near the eyes, I don’t like that it contains fragrance. If you don’t mind the fragrance then I think it is a nice product. I do like the thin texture and how it easily absorbs to my skin. It doesn’t feel too heavy applied on and I noticed that this helped to depuff and rehydrate under my eyes. nan
