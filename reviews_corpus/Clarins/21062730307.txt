I tried the 7 day sample and I didn’t feel like it was enough time to notice a major difference just yet. Also the packaging of the samples was very frustrating and messy. Overall the product itself is great. It smells very good and it applies to the skin very nicely. It’s not overly oily feeling like alot of serums. It absorbs quickly without any residue. I would love to try this product again but for a longer period of time to see more results! I do recommend it! Great serum
