This eye serum feels great on the skin and applies easily. I was so happy that it didn’t make my skin look or feel greasy. I do think it helped reduce puffiness, but I didn’t notice a difference in reducing fine lines and wrinkles - possibly because I only had a few days worth of samples. I’d definitely try again if given the opportunity. nan
