I cannot believe I waited this long to try this product! I’d been wanting to try it for months but couldn’t pull the trigger for the price, but now I don’t even care how much it is, I’m addicted! The texture was great, not too oily. It didn’t make my skin breakout which is always a concern and the subtle scent didn’t irritate my skin either, thank goodness. I feel like my skin looks more hydrated, more plump and it feels super smooth. I’m praying this stuff never goes off the market!! nan
