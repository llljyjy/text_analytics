Thank you to Clarins and Butterly for this complimentary 7-day sample! The Double Serum is really gentle on my skin and gives it a lot of hydration especially with the changing of weather now that we’re heading into autumn.  It does take a bit of time to fully absorb into the skin but once it does, my skin has a subtle glow to it, it also feels smoother to the touch and there is no residue or piling.  Usually I am not one for fragrance in my skincare, but this one didn’t cause any irritation at all. I found the floral scent to be quite pleasant. Hydrating serum!
