General thoughts: pretty good!For some background, I’m nearing 30 so I don’t have a bunch of wrinkles and fine lines yet, but I do have some! My main concern is crepe texture under my eyes and some dryness on the lid and this did manage to lessen those and left me with a fresh appearance. The texture of the eye serum was a bit thicker than I anticipated, but still much lighter than a heavy crème product. It did leave some minor tackiness on the skin during dry-down. I like that this is an airless pump container because it keeps things hygienic and I don’t have to worry about squeezing out too much. One pump is more than enough for both eyes. Decent
