#gotitfree I was sent this free for my honest review! Love this Double Serum from @clarinscanada from @chickadvisor @thisisbutterly I showed my skin before use, after using the serum and in different lighting so you can see my skin after using this Clarins Double Serum Hydric + Lipidic System. I really like that I see results in a few uses! It does have a scent. You mix the two serums together and apply to clean dry skin. I am really enjoying this and am curious to see what my skin looks like with more use! I do see my forehead wrinkles getting less noticeable, at least to me! I do see a difference in the way my skin looks and feels. It looks more luminous and radiant. Have you tried this yet? Definitely worth trying! Love it but it is pricey!
