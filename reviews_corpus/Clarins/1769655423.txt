The Clarins double serum was like putting on two different serums at the same time. The scent was light and refreshing and did not linger. The serum was also easily absorbed. The sample packet needed to be folded to press and mix before applying - this required some mixing on my palm. I prefer not mix products on my palm as they absorb it. Overall serum was very moisturizing and nourishing to the skin. Double the serum - double the results
