I received this product to try for free in exchange for my honest review.  I used this product as directed and found that using the recommended amount seemed like too much and left my skin feeling super greasy.  I ended up using less product and had better results with absorption.  It did leave my skin feeling nice and hydrated and smoother feeling by the end of the week.  I also love the idea of have both packaged into one bottle.   #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree I liked it.
