Received this product through #butterly and #chickadvisor and very grateful I did. After one full week of using this serum now I have noticed a brightness and plumpness to my skin. Used after cleansing and the serum keeps my skin moisturized and soft. Not greasy which I love and absorbs into my skin right away. Definitely recommend trying this out for yourself.
