I got to from #gotitfree from @chickadvisor @clarinscanada in exchange for my honest review. I wanted to give this a try for a couple of weeks before giving my review. I noticed a change within a couple of days using the serum. My skin felt softer and my smile lines faded which was a great surprise. I was so happy with the fast acting results and how soft and moisturized my skin felt. Definitely putting this product on my daily skin routine! Soft laugh lines and moisturized skin
