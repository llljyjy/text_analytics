I’ve been using this product for about 10 months now and I’m really disappointed. The original formula was so much nicer, this one does contain alcohol even though it claims to be alcohol free. It is much more of a drying formula versus the original which left my skin so soft, really disappointed they discontinued it. Unhappy with it long term…
