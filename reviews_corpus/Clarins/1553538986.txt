I was so happy to receive Clarins for review (#freeproduct) because this is a brand that I love.  The serum did not disappoint - it comes in two vials that then mix together to form a silky serum with a great scent that hydrates and leaves my dry skin feeling plump and smooth.  My only complaint is the price, though I may ask for a full bottle as a Christmas gift! This serum does not disappoint
