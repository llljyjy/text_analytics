Very unique texture; it feels so lightweight and nourishing! I havenâ€™t seen much difference but maybe I will after a few more weeks. This eye serum is hydrating and does help smooth my under eyes. It does feel soothing and felt my under looked more bright and hydrated for makeup. I The only negatives is how it squirts out and is a bit sticky to me and the steep price for a small size. nan
