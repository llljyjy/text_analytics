This is one of those rockstar products that is kind of everything to everyone. My favorite part is that it provides serious hydration to your skin. And, itâ€™s pretty unique because you can alter whether you want more oil or more water when you use the pump. Personally, I go heavier on the oil side because this light weight formulation never clogs your pores. Plus, I find that the more oil, I use the more even my skin tone looks. Overall, it just does so much to combat the signs of aging while making your skin look so much younger if you use it daily. Amazing hydration!!!
