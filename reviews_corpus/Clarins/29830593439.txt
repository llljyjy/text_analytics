I received this product free from Influenstler in return for my honest reviews. I was excited to use this serum as I really needed something to brighten and fix my under eye area. I’m 26 yo and have noticed the dullness and sunken eyes so have been looking to try something for my eyes. I got the 7 day sample, which basically had 7 packets. The packaging wasn’t easy for me to mix the two together but it got better around 3rd day. It has turmeric which I rate really high for its properties and the use of turmeric in beauty or skin care products is something that I am happy about. The serum is easy to mix and apply. It might look runny at first but you have to mix the oil and cream well together. I like that its non greasy and absorbs pretty easily and gives a soft feel. After using the serum for 7 days, I did not notice that the skin looked brighter and also couldn’t notice any other change. Probably with continued application of the serum, one might see the drastic change that they hope for, but for me I couldn’t see major difference on my skin. nan
