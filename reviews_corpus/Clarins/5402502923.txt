Got this free for my honest review. It came with a 7 day trial to test. Packaging is very convenient and travel friendly. Very watery/runny consistency not as thick as I would have initially thought. Pleasant scent. Not too overpowering. Anti-aging. Absorbs pretty quick. Feels very light and not a heavy thick serum. Can’t decide if I like it or not since I’ve only had a 7 day sample, I find it takes a little longer to see results. #gotitfree #doubleserum #ClarinsSkinCare #butterly #productreview A face serum
