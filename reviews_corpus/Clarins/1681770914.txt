I received this 7-day trial sample from @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada for my honest review. First of all, I LOVE the scent of this product as it is mildly fragrant and super pleasant. Secondly, it was extremely difficult to get the product out onto the palm of my hand to mix it up prior to applying it to my face. This process will obviously be omitted upon purchasing a full-sized product. Overall, I think it did an adequate job moisturizing my face overnight. Did I see dramatic results within the 7 days of consecutive use? No. I did not. However, I do need to disclose the fact that my skin was drier and more prone to dullness due to the constant fatigue from raising a newborn. Perhaps with a full nightâ€™s rest, the serum might have had better results. Unfortunately, I did not see a miracle for my trial. Would I purchase it for myself? Not likely from the cost VS the results. Please do your due diligence in ensuring your skincare products do what they promise and are suitable to your skin type prior to purchase!#ClarinsSkinCare #DoubleSerum #GotItFree Decent but overpriced serum
