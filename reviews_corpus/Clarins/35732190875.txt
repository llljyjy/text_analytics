This product gives a change on my under eye. I still need to use it more often but I do see a difference. I have a slight change in my under dark eye and the lines I have under my eye also. You can see in the before and after picture that the lines faded a little. I still want to use it more often. The texture soaks into your skin right away and it does not have any strong odors. It gives a hydrating feel. Try it
