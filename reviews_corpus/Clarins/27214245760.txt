Great lightweight serum, it dissolves into the skin really well. My skin felt hydrated. The oil and water based dual formula works really well and is not greasy on the skin.  What’s really cool about this formula is that it is made with 21 plant extracts . There is a really lovely fruity and floral fragrance to it which lasts quite long even after application, it’s subtle yet long lasting and very pleasant. I did apply this morning and night, and I can’t wait to get my hand on a full size bottle to see the full effects of it. One added benefit to this product it fights two different skin issues by boosting your skin vitals as well as signs of anti aging. Thanks @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada for letting me try this product, I love it and it’s a great plant based formula to try to combat my skin concerns#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare#gotitfree nan
