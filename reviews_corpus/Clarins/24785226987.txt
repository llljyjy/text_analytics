I only use this serum and a vitamin C serum and I will never use anything else! I have no wrinkles or fine lines, and I swear the double serum is the reason why. My skin is still acne prone in my 30s but this is the only serum that does not trigger breakouts. Itâ€™s buttery and goes beautifully beneath makeup. It is so expensive, but lasts me a year-ish and really it is the biggest splurge that I find to be worth it. My cleansers and toners are from drugstore, and this interacts well with those. This is also pregnancy and breastfeeding safe, which was important for me the last few years. Love it. worth the splurge, it works
