I really wanted to like this more because it has such great reviews. I think I’m just used to thicker eye products. This one was on the watery side and the sample packs seemed wasteful because there is a lot of product in one use.  I don’t have sensitive skin but a small area under one eye was a little red and irritated. I did like the smell of it and the presentation.  This just isn’t for me even though I really love the face serum. Not for me
