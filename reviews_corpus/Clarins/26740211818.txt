The Clarins double serum for eyes comes in a travel friendly beautiful bottle. It is a lightweight gel consistency to it. Love hoe refeshing & hydrating it feels under my eyes.  Works amazing for day and evening use.  I do not like to use heavy under eye cream because at night it irritates my eyes.  This is perfect for if you have sensitive skin!
