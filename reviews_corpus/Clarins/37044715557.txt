I love this product. I’ve had amazing results using Clarin’s Double serum concentrate. This serum I felt for the first time ever really made a difference. Within the first week my skin felt smoother and just ultimately looked healthier. Definitely enjoyed the restoration it gave my skin. I enjoyed trying this serum over the last 7 days! it has been so hydrating leaving my skin smooth and radient! This is my first time trying this product. It is called double serum because it is two separate serums that you mix to apply. The combination of both is amazing. I loved how this smelled, like a perfume. It absorbed into my skin quickly and left it feeling hydrated. I’m in love with the texture, the absorbability, the fragrance and of course the RESULTS of this gorgeous Clarins Double Serum. Would definitely highly recommend. Love this serum and I will be purchasing!!!
