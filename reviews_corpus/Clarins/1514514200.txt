I received 4 sample packets of the Double Serum Eye and used 1 packet nightly.  Once I got the packet open (not that easy to do), I realized that the product was actually a serum and cream that you had to mix together and then place around the eyes. It was soothing, non-greasy, with a light fragrance that was not over-powering. The product was absorbed quickly and it immediately made my under eye feel silky smooth and rejuvenated! The next morning, I had no puffiness and I really saw a difference in how my eyes looked. Though I don’t have a lot of wrinkles around the eyes, my skin looked “tighter” and I felt as though the product worked very well. I would purchase this product….assuming that in the full size bottle, both the cream/serum come out simultaneously making it easier to mix together before applying. nan
