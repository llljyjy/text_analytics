The Clarins V-Facial Intensive Wrap is an innovate wash off face mask that helps to alleviate facial puffiness and swelling. It temporarily helps to lift and firm the skin for a brighter, more refreshed complexion. It has a smooth, creamy-mousse like texture with a strong, but soothing floral scent. It is applied to the lower half of the face as well as neck and washed off after 10 minutes. It rinses off easily, feels relaxing on the skin, and gives instant results. It also makes the skin feel smoother and gives the skin a spa like experience. A mini spatula is also included. nan
