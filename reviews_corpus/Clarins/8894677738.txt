Iâ€™ve been using this for a week or so and noticed my eyes look revitalized and less tired. It really helps to brighten and hydrate my skin but could be better at firming the skin in some areas. The serum goes on well and absorbs quickly. The scent is nice and I found the idea of mixing the products to be interesting. You do lose a tiny amount of product due to this but a little goes a long way. Also, I found it easier to mix the products on the back of my hand then apply. Wow!!
