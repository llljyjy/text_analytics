This Serum is the Holy grail!! I got a 7 day sample kit and and my face was feeling more soft and radiant after only trying it for the 3rd day. It’s a Double serum two-phase formula combined with 21 plant extracts making it really worth my money. What I love about this product is even I’m aware that it’s expensive but knowing it’s Clarins france and made from high quality formulas and ingredients, It’s also suitable for any skin types and ages. I have a very sensitive asian skin and  Clarins Double serum is gentle and non greasy (smells good as well) which is just the way I like. I also find it boosting my skin making it glow even without make up On! Just look at my photo under the sun!! :) Double Serum 21 plants extract!
