I love pampering my skin. The serum has a gel and oil consistency and absorbs quickly, allowing for efficient skincare routines. I do enjoy the fruity, floral notes and plant extracts. I use the oil by warming the product slightly before use and massaging into skin. My skin feels hydrated and refreshed after every application, I do love and recommend Clarins Double Serum.
