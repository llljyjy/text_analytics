I received sample of this product from influencer in exchange for my honest review. I don’t love the packaging of the sample sized product. It seems like a lot of plastic packaging waste and it was a little difficult to get all of both components of the serum out. However,  I think the full size packaging would solve this problem nicely since it looks like it’s a pump that would expel both components evenly. i like the texture of the serum - is lightweight and moisturizing without feeling too oily or greasy. i can’t really tell a difference in my fine lines versus with other products,  but i have only used it a few times.  the scent is light and fresh,  won’t fight with other products.  i would consider buying this again,  particularly in winter when i need a little extra moisture boost. nan
