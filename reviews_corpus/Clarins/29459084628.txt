I received the Clarins Double Serum for free from @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor and @clarinscanada in exchange for my honest review. It’s infused with 21 plant extracts that claim to reduce the visible signs of aging. I’ve used it only for 2 days now,so wouldcontinue my7-day trial to see the bestresults. Although, after the first use, my face seemed to be well bright, nourished and hydrated.It has got a double texture formula, oily and gel kind. It was hard to squeeze it out of the sample sachet, but wouldn’t be the case with the bottle. It gives a non-greasy formula after mixingand is absorbednicely onto the skin. Also, it has gota pleasant floral scent and smells amazing. But, I think people who are scent-sensitive might not like it.#doubleserum #clarinsskincare #butterly #chickadvisor Good addition to the nightly routine
