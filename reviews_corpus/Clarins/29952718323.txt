You can see results in just 2 days of using it! My undereye is visibly lifted, the puffiness and darkening is also reduced and not only that, the balm is so lightweight and feels like it’s barely there. I wait about 2-5 minutes before applying my concealer though to give my skin some time to absorb it otherwise, products mix up and gets flaky. Overall, it’s worth it and definitely works. Lightweight and works well with make up
