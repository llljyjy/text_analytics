Thank you Butterly and Clarins for allowing me to sample this product. The sample is not big enough to notice any differences with reducing wrinkles or promoting skin firmness. The price for the product is quite high and I most likely will not purchase this after. I do use this product at night after cleanser and toner. The product got absorbed into my skin quickly and it does have a scent. Itâ€™s Okay!
