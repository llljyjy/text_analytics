I received Clarins Double Eye Serum (Global Age Control Concentrate) to try out. As I age, I’ve noticed dark circles are harder to get rid of and crow’s feet are popping up. The smell was amazing! It didn’t bother me even with applying near a delicate area like my eyes. I didn’t notice a difference with my crow’s feet but this did knock out the dark circles I had under my eyes. For that alone, I would purchase this product again in the future. Dark Circles Be Gone!
