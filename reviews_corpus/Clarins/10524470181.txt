I received the Clarins Double Serum for free to try out for 7 days. The packets really do go a long way so I feel I was able to get a good idea of how the product affects my skin. I have oily combination skin and don’t like anything oily so I’m glad that this product really did absorb well and didn’t leave any oily residue. Hydrating without making me feel like I have a sweaty look on my skin. I fee like the tone of my skin after 7 days did look a little more even and brighter. Would recommend purchasing this product! New must have to my skin care routine!!
