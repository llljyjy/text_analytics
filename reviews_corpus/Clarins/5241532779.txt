I received this product as a sample from Influenster for my honest review.  It smells really nice and light.  I really liked that it didn’t feel gross or oily.  I don’t have a ton of eye wrinkle issues but I did notice some minor results in the few days that I used it.  I didn’t notice much difference in the dark circles I have though.  I have pretty dark circles though as mine are hereditary (so my dermatologist says).  Overall this product is decent but I’m not sure I would purchase at the price it sells for. Some difference but not a huge impact
