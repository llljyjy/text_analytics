I was hesitant about using this product as I’m not the biggest fan of the Clarins brand products, but I was pleasantly surprised! This product left my under eyes feeling soft, moisturized but there wasn’t any leftover residue, which I appreciated. I’m going to give this some more time of continued use to see if I’ll purchase the full size. Pleasantly Surprised
