Love the light fresh smell of this serum. It goes on smooth and my skin feels hydrated and the dullness is gone. I didnâ€™t love the sample packaging as it was quite messy to use but I imagine the bottle is much better. Not sure I can afford it but I would definitely use it again and again. Nice serum.
