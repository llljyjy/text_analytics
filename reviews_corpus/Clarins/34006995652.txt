I have used it for a week and I am pleasantly surprised. It does what it claims and more. I found it to be super absorbant into my skin and left me feeling smooth and looking so good that I didnâ€™t want to use any make-up for the first time in a long while.  The effects are instant, positive and long lasting. It smells quite pleasant, feel non-greasy and apparently prioritizes responsible materials and limits waste. What else can a girl ask for? I am a believer! Instant Positive Effects
