I wasn’t expecting to like the new double eye serum so much. The texture of the serums combined is absolutely perfect together. It’s lightweight, but very hydrating. The skin soaks it up really quickly, so doesn’t cause my skincare or makeup to pill. No milia either. I didn’t notice a difference with puffiness, just with firmness and hydration. I have very fine lines and it seems to plump up the area and hide the lines very well. It does have a light fragrance, but it hasnt caused any issues with my skin. Really nice eye serum
