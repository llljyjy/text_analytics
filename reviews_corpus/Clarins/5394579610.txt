After doing a 7-day trial of this product, the experience and results were really nice. I like that it is 2 different components (gel and oily) that are packaged separately, but then have to mixed together into an emulsion to be applied. I have experience using turmeric for skin brightening, and I can tell that it helps in this serum as well, as I could see a nice radiance to my skin. It also has a nice light scent. I am very satisfied with the overall experience and results. Beautiful, radiant skin!
