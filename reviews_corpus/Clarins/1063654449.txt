After having previously tried the Clarins Double Serum Eye, I was really happy to have the opportunity to test out their Double Serum Hydric + Lipidic System as well. This anti-aging treatment was a real treat to use. In only 7 days of use, my skin looked more supple, firm, and the fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead also looked less visible. I appreciated the consistency, as well. It didn’t feel sticky at all but instead, absorbed very nicely into my skin, which made it great to use both day and night. In fact, it’s a dual mixture of oil and gel that blends together perfectly.I really love the fruity-floral scent as it’s really pleasant, making me look forward to applying the serum on a regular basis. What I also found impressive is that the 21 plant extracts in this unique formula are meant to target 5 important skin needs, as is stated on the Clarins website: hydration, nutrition, oxygenation, regeneration, and protection. My skin felt less taut after the very first application and the radiance was also noticeable after the first few uses.Thank you @chickadvisor , @thisisbutterly , and @clarinscanada for this wonderful skincare product sample. I would seriously consider purchasing the full-sized bottle! This is a high quality skincare product. Excellent!
