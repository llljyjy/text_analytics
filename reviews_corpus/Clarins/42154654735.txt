This is okay...but the other Clarins V facial products are where it’s at. I’m South Asian and struggle with puffiness. I have somewhat hooded eyes and get puffiness from sleep, heat, stress, allergies, food, salt, and dust. So, when I saw this I jumped at the opportunity. I got this form the outlet and it was way cheaper about $70 for the eye serum, this and the mini mask. This helps very minimally, and it works on water retention puffiness, not allergy puffiness or other types of inflammation. You’re going to first want to find your triggers, second sleep on elevated pillows, or a beauty pillow to reduce puffiness. Sleep is first regulate your sleeping schedule is number one, then reduce salt intake, look at diet, take diuretics on weekends, get active and move your body to drain the water. Next, start icing, ice your face and eyes and you will see a big change in the morning. Also try to do a face soak in ice cubes, cold water, and green tea leaves, then try a de puffing massage, also try do a warm compress with salt on eyes. If you still see minimal results, try RF machine once a week, or a facial tool like a roller, non Jade, the double knob silver roller that works really well. Also, take allergy pills if needed, dieuretics, once a week, zinc, and get enough pottasium, and eat less high glycemic foods. See a doctor if you think you have chronic edema or underlying conditions. If that fails, then try this. The eye serum is great. The mask is pretty expensive and didn’t last me more than three months. The eye serum doesn’t work for everyone though however it’s one of the few upper eyelid serums out there. Again as I said: - Facial massage - Icing face with ice/cold water - Find triggers and take allergy pills/vitamins - reduce salt intake and regulate sleep and get beauty pillow - Increase physical activity - See a doctor if all else fails SKIP get the mask and eye serum instead
