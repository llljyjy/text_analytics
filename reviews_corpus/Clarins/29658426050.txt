I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest opinion. This is an excellent serum if your skin is dry. It’s not oily, it absorbs really well into the skin, and it has a really lovely scent to it. It didn’t irritate my skin, and I felt it immediately improved the look and texture. It’s a perfect option for wintertime. Great serum for dry skin
