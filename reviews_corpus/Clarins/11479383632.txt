There is a scent, not as strong as the double serum, it has floral notes. Unfortunately this formula also has fragrance higher on the ingredient list than the 13 plant extracts. It’s lightweight and it absorbs quickly. I did experience a slight tingling sensation after applying but it disappeared quickly. It feels hydrating on the skin and it leaves the under eye skin feeling smooth and soft. By day 3 I saw a reduction in puffiness and eyes appeared to be visibly brighter. I had no issues using under makeup, saw no under eye creasing with concealer/foundation. With only 7 days of use I didn’t experience any dramatic results with fine lines, but 90% said their wrinkles/fine less looked less noticeable after a month of use. I would recommend for all skin types just based off what I did experience over 7 days. If you are sensitive to fragrance then I would avoid.

Less than 1 ounce is around $75-$115❌ Fragrance is listed higher than the 13 plant extracts ❌ No improvement with fine lines under eyes Contains More Fragrance than the 13 Plant Extracts
