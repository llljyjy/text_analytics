This is a light serum for your eyes that applies easily and isn’t sticky. It has a scent so be aware if you don’t like that, but it isn’t overpowering. You have to mix together the gel and cream before applying, so a bit of an extra step. It felt hydrating. I’m haven’t seen a difference really in dark circles, but I’ll keep using. nan
