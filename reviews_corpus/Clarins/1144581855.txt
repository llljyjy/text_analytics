I didn’t notice much of a difference after a week of using this product. I received some samples to try, and I found it very difficult to disperse the product with the way that the samples were packaged. I used the product for a full week at night after washing my face, but I don’t feel like my skin was  hydrated or brightened  more than my normal skin care routine. I was expecting to see more of a difference given the price point of this product, but it was a bit of a let down in my opinion. I’ll be sticking with my normal skincare products. Meh
