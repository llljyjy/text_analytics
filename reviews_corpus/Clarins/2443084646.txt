I wanted to love this so bad because I REALLY enjoyed applying it and the smell and feel on my skin. But after seven days, my skin is no better, maybe slightly worse with a couple of breakout areas. I know seven days isn’t very long to see if it worked but that’s all the sample packs I had. If my skin seemed better, I’d purchase, but it’s too expensive for ‘maybe working’. Again the smell and feel going on are TOP notch. Smells Great but didn’t help my skin
