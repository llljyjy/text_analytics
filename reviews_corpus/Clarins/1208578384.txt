I received a 7-day sample of this product for free to try and review from ChickAdvisor/Butterly. I really enjoyed using this serum but I didn’t necessarily see any changes to my skin over the course of 7 days. Don’t get me wrong, it made my skin hydrated and feeling nice in the morning, I’m just not sure about the anti-aging benefits it claims to do. I would be curious to see how this worked over a longer period of time. There is a slight scent to the product but it’s not overbearing - it might irritate those who are sensitive to smells though. The price point is kind of high so I’m sure you could find a similar product for much less. Try a sample before you purchase! It’s alright
