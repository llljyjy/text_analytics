I wish I could say I loved this, j really wanted to based off the claims for results in 7 days and the fact that it is clarins, but my skin does not agree. the being able to customize the dose of product amount you get with each pump is very nice, although I will say much more serum seems to come out than cream but sadly this pilled terribly on my eye area and was terrible under makeup. nan
