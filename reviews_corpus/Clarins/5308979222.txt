I tested the product for a full 7 days and the smell and texture felt amazing on my skin. I applied this before bed as part of my nightly routine. My dry skin was noticeably more nourished and hydrated. And it has definitely started to restore some light and life in my complexion as I have been feeling itâ€™s been looking dull last couple of months. I really like this product, it feels luxurious and it was an overall great experience. I would pick this product up again! Great night time serum!
