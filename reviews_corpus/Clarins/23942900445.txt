This formula made my under eyes feel so hydrated and healthy! It also allows my makeup around my eyes to go on very easily, with a great texture. I don’t really use anti-aging serum / eye serum, but now that I’m 26 I’m realizing I should probably start. This is a great option! However, it’s a bit too pricey to be a staple in my skincare. Works great! I wish it wasn’t so pricey
