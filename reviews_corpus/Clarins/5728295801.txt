I’ve never tried skincare from Clarins before but love their lip oils so much. Eye cream is my far my favorite skincare product so I always like trying new ones that come out. I’m almost 30 so trying to take skincare more seriously. My moms side of the family have very crepey eyelids so that’s something im scared of. I’ve been using this eye cream morning at night and enjoying it so far. It doesn’t burn or sweat into my eyes like a few other creams I’ve tried. It also doesn’t pill with my other products and eye makeup which I love. Pump packaging is also my favorite. I recommend giving it a try! nan
