I got a 7 day sample from @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada and I really loved this serum from the first try! It made my skin feel very hydrated and smooth, and just overall it had a nice luxurious texture.  More like an oil to me, so I use this as the last step of my PM routine. After several days of use, I did find slight improvements in firming and radiance. Really enjoyed this serum!
