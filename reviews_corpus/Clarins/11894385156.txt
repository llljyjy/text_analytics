After receiving this product as a free sample, I tired it for a week. The scent of the serum is very strong so if you’re looking for no scent or low scent, I would suggest not using this product. The double serum comes separated and you mix it together before use. I found my skin was extra hydrated and all set for the harsh winter weather after use. I would imagine that the anti aging benefits would be more noticeable after long term use, but I can’t say I noticed a lot of overall change in the week that I used it. #gotitfree A quality product for thirsty skin
