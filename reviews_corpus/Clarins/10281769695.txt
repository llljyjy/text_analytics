I’m grateful for the opportunity to try this product #igotitfree of Clarins Double Serim in exchange for my honest review. I received a sample of this product with 7 individual use packs. I found the packaging weird, but the standard bottle looks more straightforward. It had a silky consistency and was easily applied. It’s light and quick absorbing. Very softly scented and leaves your face feeling refreshed. Left my face feeling smooth and soft. The one con I felt was the sample packets and how hard they were to use along with the added waste. However, overall I really enjoyed using this products and was satisfied with the results I noticed. nan
