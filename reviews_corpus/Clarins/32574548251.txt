I only have a few good things to say about this eye cream: it’s lightweight, feels hydrating, and hasn’t caused any irritation so far. However, it doesn’t absorb completely, and leaves a sticky feeling. Also, it contains fragrance and alcohol, which I try to avoid. In my opinion, it’s overpriced, as well. I would not recommend this product. Disappointed
