I received this product for free in exchange for my honest feedback.The sample was only for 7 uses which is not at all enough to see any effect (especially if using twice a day).The drawbacks for me is that this serum is very light, but still feels like it sits on top of my skin instead of absorbing. I did notice some makeup pilling when using this under it. nan
