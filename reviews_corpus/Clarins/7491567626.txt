I received a 1 week supply of this product complimentary for testing purposes and I don’t think that it was long enough for me to leave an accurate review. I can say that the product felt nice on my skin and did not cause any breakouts or burning. It absorbed quickly and worked well with my existing routine. However, I didn’t notice any difference in my eyes after the 1 week period. nan
