I received this intensive anti-aging Clarins Double serum for free to tst and share experiences. I like the way you need to use it - fold it and squish it, then mix and apply. It doesn’t smell, and doesn’t leave skin greasy. I have a problem skin and most of the serums make me look like a shiny ball. Clarins serum doesn’t have this problem. Too bad it is pricey. Great add-in
