I received a 7-day sample of this serum to try from Butterly/Chickadvisor. This serum packs a punch! It has 21 different plant extracts. In just 7 days, I have noticed a slight reduction in fine lines and more of a glow to my complexion. The texture is easy to spread on the face, and the scent is quite nice. I tested the product using sample packs, which were easy enough to use, but I canâ€™t comment on the bottle format that it is sold in. Powerful serum
