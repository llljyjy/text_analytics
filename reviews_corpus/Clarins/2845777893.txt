I received a 7 days sample from @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada and I can say it’s a very good serum. When you apply it, the smell is floral and luxurious, but it’s still a light scent, which I appreciate. The skin absorb it really fast, it’s hydrating but not oily. My skin type is sensitive, combination/oily and rosacea prone, so I really think it’s for every skin type. After 7 days, I feel my skin is a little bit more smooth and more radiant, and it’s just 7 days! If you can afford this, give it a try! Smooth and radiant skin
