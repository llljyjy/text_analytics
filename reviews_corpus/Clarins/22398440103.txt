I received a Clarins double Serum 7day sample from Butterly. I am glad of the results I see for 7 days. My skin needed a little extra care after hot summer days. The serum didnâ€™t make my skin oily and it absorbed very quickly. I really like the fruity smell of the serum! Also, noticed for this period that my face looked refreshed and happy!@thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare Beautiful skin after using Clarins double serum!
