The packaging for the eyes serum is amazing, by using a pump it keeps it more sterile not to mention it also is a beautiful bottle that looks unique. After using this eye serum for 2 weeks I noticed a significant difference in my under eye area. I don’t have dark circles but I get puffiness and fat deposits from normal aging (I’m still young but trying to prevent it from escalating). But I do tend to get minor breakouts and many styes often so I found it best for me to use the eye serum every other day rather than everyday. This product is worth every penny and will last a long time since you don’t need much product. I will be purchasing the full size soon!! Great serum for sensitive under eye skin!
