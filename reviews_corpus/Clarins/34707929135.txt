I #gotitfree from @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor & @clarinscanada in return of my honest review.This Double Serum from Clarins worked great on my sensitive skin & I found that it absorbed quickly without leaving it feeling oily. I noticed my complexion looked more radiant, smoother & felt firmer after using it for just one week. Made with plant extracts to help target wrinkles, fine lines & even enlarged pores. I definitely recommend this product & canâ€™t wait to get my hands on the full size of this amazing two-phase serum!#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare Absorbs quickly!
