First, this serum smells great. The smell is floral and not overpowering. It felt great on my skin and I could definetly tell that it was super hydrating. The only reason I didnâ€™t give it 5 stars is because it left my skin oily for hours, which I did not appreciate. I might buy it again, but not to use daily because it will probably make my skin greasy after a while.#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree Really hydrating!
