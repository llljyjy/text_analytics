This is even better than I imagined. I have the shade Honey and Cherry and I just ordered Pitaya. Honey is probably my favourite. It feels so silky on the lips and gives the most perfect shine. It’s thick but not too heavy or uncomfortable. I had never tried the previous formula so I can’t compared but I’m very satisfied with this one! Holy Grail lip product
