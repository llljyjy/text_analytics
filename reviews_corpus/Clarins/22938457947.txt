I have just finished my week long trial of the double serum and I really enjoyed it! The product was not greasy, did not dry out my skin, did not have a chemical or overly powerful smell which is a big plus for me. the serum was light, absorbed quickly and my skin felt tight almost.  I am excited to keep using the product and hope to have long lasting results! Going to buy more!
