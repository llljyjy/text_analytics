I have really been enjoying using this eye cream. I enjoy the process of the apply and drain method that they recommend it really feels like a little bit of a spa experience in my routine. I’ve seen great immediate results where my fine lines and wrinkles are way less visible after application I have also started to notice a reduction in the bags I have underneath my eyes. It absorbs really nicely I’ve never had any issues with pilling or irritation and it also sets well under make up. Definitely a new favorite of mine! The perfect eye cream!
