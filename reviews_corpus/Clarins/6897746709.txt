typically use vitamin c under my eyes for brightening. I have a lot of darkest and hereditary dark circles so I try to minimize them. I tried this one in hopes of upgrading to something stronger and help with the puffiness in my eyes and I really feel like I saw a difference! I usually love the serum formula, but this one can dry down a little tacky. I havenâ€™t experienced any irritation near my eyes! Helped my puffiness!
