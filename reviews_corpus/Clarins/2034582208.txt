I was provided a sample size version of this serum. First off, it smells absolutely amazing! It glided onto my skin very easily and made it feel silky smooth. While I was unable to see any visible differences with my small sample, I would recommend this sample to anyone who is looking for a daily serum, especially if youâ€™re in the market for one that combats aging as well! Glides on easily and smells fantastic!
