I was really excited to try the Clarins Double Serum, however the smell was so off putting I didnâ€™t even want to try it. I however did, and found that the serum felt like it just sat on my skin and not really absorbed. For the fact that so many products now can come without the chemical scent it was a big disappointment. Disappointed
