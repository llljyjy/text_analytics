Total Eye Lift by Clarins; very beginner friendly upon application. The area feels very smooth & soft; and looks hydrated and awaken. You can feel a little tingly sensation but is subtle and tolerable. The texture is creamy but not oily or heavy, and for me thatâ€™s a must. Overall good product. nan
