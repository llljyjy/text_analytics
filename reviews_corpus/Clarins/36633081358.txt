Have been using this product using the sample packets that I received via Influenster. Based on the instructions, I mixed the two formulas before applying it to my undereyes and I did notice that my skin felt more moisturized but I did not see any anti-aging effect. I also felt some tingling every time I applied the product though I am unsure which exact ingredient I am reacting to. All in all, it was nice for an eye cream but still too expensive in my opinion.
