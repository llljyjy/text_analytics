Amazing product and amazing technology. I loved the inovating packaging even though it is a lot of plastic. I LOVE the scent, it almost smells like shampoo. The serum made my skin look hydrated, it can be a bit oily if you don’t mix the two products well together. It leaves a durable hydration. This product is high cost but you don’t need lots for it to work so it would last a while. Wow !
