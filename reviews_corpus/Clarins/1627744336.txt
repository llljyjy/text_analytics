I received a seven day trial of Double Serum to try out in exchange for my honest review. Clarins Double Serum dispenses from a dual-chamber and has a very pleasant smell that’s not too overpowering. The serum soaked into my skin nicely and didn’t leave behind any sticky feeling. After seven days, I can confirm that my skin feels a lot smoother and it evened out my skin texture a bit. However, I did not find my skin to be any more firmer or radiant. Maybe if I use it for a longer period, I would notice those changes. I say this is worth giving a shot and seeing if you get favourable results in the long run. #gotitfree #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada Smooth skin in a week!
