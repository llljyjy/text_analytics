I recieved this product for free from Influenster, Clarins, and Sephora in exchange for my honest review. I tested the eye serum at a different time that the face serum. While the face serum did break me out, this one, gave me no bad skin reactions. The smell was good, i like that it’s thick but was still thin enough that it gets absorbed by the skin quickly. I wish I had more samples and could test it for a longer time. The price point is pretty steep which is why I’m hesitating to buy it. But I definitely recommen it. Good one!
