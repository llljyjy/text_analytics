I was excited to receive a box from Influencer with this sample size product to try. But I was pretty disappointed once I used. First I don’t like the packing think it would have been better in a little bottle with a dropper for better distribution of the product. But once using the serum I didn’t feel like it does much. As a high end product I’d expect more but for my under eyes it didn’t do anything special. I would definitely NOT recommend. It was not hydrating for me at all and felt sticky and drying. Drying!
