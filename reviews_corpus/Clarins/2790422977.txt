I usually use the same creams from Farmacy or Ren on my full face including eyes, which generally help to keep my dark eye circles relatively plump, nourished and ready for concealer application with minimal under eye creasing. This formula actually dried the skin around my eyes out more than the general facial moisturizers and now I have a ton of makeup creasing under my eyes and even on my eyelids. Itâ€™s a Total Eye Disaster. nan
