love this product! I feel that Clarins truly never misses. Their skincare products are very life changing. I’m in my early 20s and I believe that it’s important to start using anti-aging products at an early age to prevent wrinkles and other skincare concerns. I use this product, morning and night, and right after I use a gua sha to help shape my face. I am so happy that the texture is so lightweight and moisturizing. I love that the product comes out of the little tube, making it more convenient to use. absolutely in love!
