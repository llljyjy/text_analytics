I was lucky enough to receive a 7-day sample for my honest review. While it was not enough to speak to long-term effects, I can say that you need very little of the product to cover your whole face and neck. I used it nightly as part of bedtime routine. It absorbs well and was not sticky or greasy feeling. I can be acne prone, but did not experience any breakouts during the trial. The oil has a light, pleasant scent. I would recommend this product. A little goes a long way!
