I recently had an opportunity to try a 7-day sample of Clarins Double Serum (#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare) for my honest review on behalf of Butterfly (@thisisbutterfly  @chickadvisor  @clarinscanada).  Having used the product for the last full week, I am somewhat pleased with the results.  Although I noticed a bit of an improvement on fine lines around my eyes, one has to remember that this product will not be effective on deep set lines/wrinkles.So far, I have noticed that my skin feels more hydrated and slightly glowing and radiant.  I do not know if this has to do with the fact in which one of the serums has a beautiful honey-like tinge to it.  For those that only care to use odorless products, be warned that Double Serum does have a subtle fragrance, which I find to be quite elegant!The only factor that I was not overly crazy about is its absorbency, which is possibly due to its thicker consistency.  This did surprise me a bit, since it does make note that it contains Hyaluronic Acid, which I find to be easily absorbed into my skin.  All this to say, I preferred applying it at night as I felt that it leaves a bit of a tacky feel, which made it very uncomfortable to add makeup afterwards.  But overall, I find Double Serum to live up to other products produced by Clarins. Clarins Double Serum Review
