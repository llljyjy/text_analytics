I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Soooo I applied this product nightly after first cleansing my skin with a non harsh cleanser. I put the serum on my under eye and below brow area. I can tell a difference, however it is not as dramatic of a difference like I experienced with its sister product-the regular double serum. I did notice that not only were lines slightly smaller but my eye area was more plump and glowy. Pros: -nice scent -non drying- you do see results, though not as fastI would definitely recommend and I will be purchasing the product series when able :)Cons: -results slower Great Product Line
