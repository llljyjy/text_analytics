I received this in exchange for my review.  I haven’t been using it long enough to see any visible results beyond the fact that it gives good hydration and leaves my skin looking healthy and glowy. I have reasonably firm skin still (I’m 45) but I like using products like these for preventative reasons. I like this and I will continue using it, but I’m really torn due to the fragrance. It’s strong and not my vibe. I’d love to see a fragrance free version! nan
