Absolutely love the Clarins Double Serum Eye! It smells really good.  It’s hydrating without being greasy or filmy. Doesn’t leave that hard to rub in white residue on your face like most facial products. I used it after washing my face with a  cleanser that tends to dry my skin out. I upon using the Double Serum Eye my skin around my eyes went from dry to moisturized instantly. Color came back in to my face. The puffiness and dark circles were less noticeable.  My skin  felt illuminated.  Really liked the product but it’s a little out of my budget for eye serums. Loved it!
