This is my to-go self tanner. It applies smoothly and doesn’t make my skin feel gross and clammy. With proper exfoliation prep, I’ve never had a single streak. I would imagine it would be too subtle for medium or dark skin tones, but for pale people this results in a perfect glow! Natural tan for fair skin tones
