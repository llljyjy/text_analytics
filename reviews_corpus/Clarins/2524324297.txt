Was chosen to try this product for seven days @ThisIsButterly @ChickAdvisor @ClarinsCanadaMy skins feels great, hydrated and the product smells good. Got it in a package to try for 7 days, easy to apply and skin feels so soft. I noticed you can get the 7 day trail in the glow to go kit if your pressed to get the full size. Honestly use a lot of clarins products now and none of them have dissapointed. It works for me, hope they work for you too! Good for your skin
