Received this free sample from @thisisbutterly of the Clarins Double Serum for my honest opinion and review. I received enough for a total of 7 days. The substance is a nice watery texture, not sticky. You rub it in between your hands to warm it up and gently place it on different targeted areas of your face. It felt refreshing and almost like a quick release of the stress you can sometimes where on your face. I didn’t see much of a difference in wrinkles, not to say that if  you used this product consistently for over a month, I’m sure you would see that. I did however see a difference in firmness, radiance and pores… all that in just 7 days. @clarinscanada @chickadvisor @doubleserum @clarinskincare Great start for a 7 day supply
