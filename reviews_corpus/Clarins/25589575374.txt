This is my new favorite face mask! I’ve used Clarins products before and I loved them, but this is the best thing I’ve tried! I have combination skin and I struggle with face puffiness,so I was super excited to try this mask and see what it does. The texture of the mask reminded me of a mousse and application process was super easy. I loved the unique auto-lifting method too.   This mask did a number of jobs : de-puffing, evening out the skin tone and making my skin look matte and fresh. After 10 minutes my skin looked amazing without having to use a bunch of different products and wasting time. I’m really impressed and would definitely repurchase and recommend it to everybody! nan
