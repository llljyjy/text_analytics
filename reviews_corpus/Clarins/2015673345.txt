#gotitfree from the folks at @thisisbutterly ! This  #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare was a fun product to try. What I like about it is that it goes on lightly, and it easily absorbs into my skin! I also liked that it has a very light scent but that this goes away quite quickly. The downside for me was I found it to make my skin a little more oily. Not enough to cause issues but enough that Iâ€™m unsure if I would keep using it. Probably not for me.
