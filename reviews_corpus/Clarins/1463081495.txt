I have a bit of a love hate relationship with this eye serum. I have definitely seen a difference in the skin around my orbital bones. I look refreshed in the morning after using it at night and when I put it in in the morning I look awake as well. It works well under makeup and soaks into to skin feeling soft and subtle.  What I hate is the scent.  I dont like products that smell strong this one definitely has a bit of a lingering scent, but if you are not sensitive to scent then I highly recommend this serum. You will definitely see a difference in the fine lines surrounding your eyes in just a few days. I will keep using it for sure because at this point I dont mind the scent. Really Good, but has a scent
