This product really did help my dry skin. It’s not oily, it absorbs really well into the skin and it has a really nice scent to it.  It didn’t help with overall redness that I have, but it did make my skin feel really hydrated and soft. I would recommend it if dryness is an issue for you. I received a sample of this product in return for an honest review @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada Great for dry skin!
