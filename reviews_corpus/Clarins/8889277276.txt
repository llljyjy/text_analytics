I received a seven day sample of this serum and now I know what all the hype is about! My skin felt great after the seven day treatment and completely hydrated. I have very dry skin so I can appreciate a product like this that not only hydrates well but doesnâ€™t cause a reaction to my sensitive skin. The scent is also lovely! The only downfall is the price but you get what you pay for and this is a quality product. Feeling fresh
