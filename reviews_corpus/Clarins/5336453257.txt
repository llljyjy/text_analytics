I really love this serum! The packaging that dispenses the dual serum is easy to snap open and push out. I like that you don’t waste any more f the product by using to too much. It’s the perfect amount for the face and neck!  It applies to the skin perfectly and absorbs with no residue, or stickiness! My skin felt and looked smooth and my makeup went over nicely with no interference of the product. I felt my skin looked radiant  and with a nice youth glow! Love the look of my skin
