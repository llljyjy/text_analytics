I received this complimentary in exchange for a review. I did like this product, it was great for hydrating but I couldn’t give it 5 stars because I only had a 7 day sample and didn’t feel that was enough time to tell a huge difference. It has a light scent and soaked in quickly without being sticky or tacky. Overall I liked it and would purchase it! nan
