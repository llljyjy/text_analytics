I’ve received this 7-day free sample of Clarins Double Serum from @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada  for a honest review.  I don’t typically use serum because in the past I have tried serums that feels too heavy on my skin and caused breakouts. However Clarins Double Serum is different. I can see noticeable changes in my skin (feeling more hydrated, smaller pores) after 7 days, and it doesn’t feel heavy. The only complain I have is that I’m not a fan of the scent.#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare nan
