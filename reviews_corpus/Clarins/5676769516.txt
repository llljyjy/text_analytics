Let me say that there a few Claims products that I cannot do without. I have every option of their lip oil (with backups. On hand). This was such a fail for three reasons s. 1 - The opening pours out way too much. I am forced to use a cotton pad or it is everywhere. 2 - The smell is so strong my eyes water. Don’t get me wrong. I do not mind earthy or medicinal natural scents. This wasn’t either. 3 - I would happily put up with 1 and 2 if this product actually hydrated my skin. It does the opposite! My skin feels dry and tight. If you have an oily skin type, you might enjoy this. It is a hard pass for me. So Sad
