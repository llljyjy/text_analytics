I was quite excited to try this product I had high expectations for my fine lines. But my lines are deep so it might take a long time to remove those. But it’s quite hydrating which I like and very gentle on my skin. Giving it 3 stars one for fragrance second for how my skin feels and third for how much hydrated i feel. Taking two away because it didn’t do anything for my fine line second for the price I might see a dermatologist to fix it. Love the smell
