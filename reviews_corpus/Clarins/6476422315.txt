I am actually completely impressed with this; I wasn’t expecting it to have as dramatic results as I’ve gotten over the past several weeks. As I’m starting to employ more anti aging products into my routine one of the areas I’m focusing on is the fine lines around my eye. After using this for about three weeks, the little line are filling in, so to speak. It’s actually incredible. Now, this does little for my dark undereye circles, but they are hereditary and nothing I’ve used short of makeup really works. But as far as fine lines and smoothing, this little bottle really does incredible things in a short amount of time. Highly recommend. nan
