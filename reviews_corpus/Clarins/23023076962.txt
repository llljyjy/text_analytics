I’m amazed at the formulation of this serum! Its water to oil texture both looks and feels absolutely gorgeous! It soaks in pretty quickly leaving the skin smooth and plump. It’s worth mentioning there’s some floral scent to it - pleasant and not overpowering. I also appreciate the ability to adjust the pump to get the amount of product you need. nan
