I’ve been hooked on Clarins double eye serum for a little while now and when I got the opportunity to try the iconic face serum I had to jump on it. First of all for a serum it’s very hydrating. But not just hydrating, it leaves my skin with that bouncy, plump look. You know the one I mean- not all serums can produce this look, but my almost 40 year old skin looks calm, glass-like, plump and bouncy which is not an easy feat! This is on its way to HG status easily. nan
