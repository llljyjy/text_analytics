I’ve been using Clarins double serum for 7 days and my skin looks radiant. This serum leaves my skin smoother. I feel my face looking better and soft. It is a plant-based formula that’s gentle on the skin and it has a great anti-aging properties. It helps to decrease fine lines. This serum has a thin, slippery texture. My skin looks hydrated. It is easy to combine the products and apply with gently pressure. It does soak in nice and it doesn’t feel heavy. It smells great.   I received this product for free for testing purposes #freeproduct Skin looking better
