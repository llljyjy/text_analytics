I received a 7 day supply sample of this product to test which included two separate pouches for the “double“ serum. That part was somewhat annoying so I hope the actual packaging is more streamlined. However, I did like the serum. It made my skin super soft.  I felt like it slightly tightened my undereye area too. I would like to see the difference with prolonged use Light application,  slight tightening effect
