Being a tired mom, a good eye serum is essential! I really love the Double Serum Eye. I love the texture of the serum and how fast it absorbs. It lives up to its claims of your under eye being more firm, hydrated, and smooth in just 7 days. Iâ€™ve noticed how hydrated my under eyes have been since using. I no longer have super dark circles either which is amazing! Such a great eye serum!
