This serum has a lovely floral scent, typical of Clarin’s products, that will linger on your skin. I enjoy it, but if you don’t like scented products, you may want to stay away from this one.It is a combination of two anti-age serums made with 21 plant extracts, and both have a liquid consistency.After applying it, my skin feels tight and tingling. It gets easily absorbed by my skin and doesn’t leave any residue. I used this product for four days, mornings and evenings, and my skin started to break out. It provided some hydration, but I can’t say I saw significant changes, as any difference in the texture or colour of my skin, so I stopped using it.I love Clarins products, but this serum wasn’t for me. I wonder if I didn’t get optimal results because the sample sachets I received didn’t dispense the same quantity for both serums. nan
