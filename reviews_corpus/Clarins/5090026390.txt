I actually love this product, I combined it with Lancôme absolute rich eye cream(if you r not dry skin don’t consider about this combo). I’m at my 30s, extremely dry skin, skin barrier damage, fine line around my eyes for sure. I use this eye serum after lotion&face serum, and then the absolute eye cream, finally my face moisturizer. Fine line are noticeably less than the time without it. Hopefully Clarins can improve the package a little bit, too much for one pump. Works well for me
