I received samples of this product to test. I wish they had given me more because I don’t think 5 doses is enough to give a honest review. What I will say is, I’m happy with the 5 times I did get to use it & would be interested in purchasing to continue to use. It made my skin a bit tacky but it also made my skin feel plump & glowing. May be a little heavy for the eyes, I only used at night. Eye serum
