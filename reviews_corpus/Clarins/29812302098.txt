I was so excited to try this Clarins total eye lift ! I’ve seen so many amazing reviews and I’m adding another amazing review because it’s sooo good! First off the red packaging is gorgeous! This is a light weight eye cream that gives your eye area and instant lift and works perfectly under makeup! It’s a creamy beautiful white texture and I don’t detect a scent , it literally melts right in and my lines are instantly softer and plump ! I love this and couldn’t recommend more! It’s has become my favorite eye treatment to use! LOVE!!!!
