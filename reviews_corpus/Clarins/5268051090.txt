I received this product for free in exchange for a honest review. I only got a small sample size so not long enough to use to see results. I will say I have been using retinol and this did bother my skin. It burned a bit when applying and I actually had to wash this off. I’m not sure if it was the combo of me using retinol or if it was just irritations from the serum but I wasn’t loving it. I will get better results from using retinol so I will not be adding this serum to my must have list. Not great with my retinol treatment
