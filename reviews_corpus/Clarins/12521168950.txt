I donâ€™t use much eye serums, I am a very lazy skin care person, especially in my third trimester and now postpartum. But so glad to try samples of this! Serum was difficult to evenly dispense from the sample packets, but the serum absorbed very nicely, and is lightweight. My skin felt and looked rejuvenated! I was not able to use this religiously every night, but can see great results just from using it a few nights a week! Will get!
