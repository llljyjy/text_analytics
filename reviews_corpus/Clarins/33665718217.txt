Clarins is one of my favorite brand , I’ve been use their products for long . This is my first time try this Extra-Firming Neck cream , and I love the smell/the light scent of this product. It is very easy to apply into the neck area , not sticky but leave a deep moist to my neck . I will keep using it and can’t wait to see the reduce wrinkle of my neck . And I believe it will show me the results as they offer good products. A must try
