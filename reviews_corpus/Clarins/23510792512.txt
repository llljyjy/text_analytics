I received Clarins double eye serum via Influenster to try. I don’t always use eye cream and I tend to use my facial moisturizer all over. I absolutely enjoyed the experience of the double eye serum. It feels luxurious and my skin seems to enjoy it as well. I can’t comment on long term use and benefits. I can only comment on that I enjoyed the experience and my skin feels better after using. Excited to try!
