I received samples in order to write a review but unfortunately there was not enough serum in my opinion to make a decision on whether or not I would recommend the product. I will say it did have a strong scent that I was not a fan of but with only receiving samples I could not see a difference in my skin. Normally this brand does provide nice products which is why I gave a three star Strong scent.
