I donâ€™t often try a new face routine and actually like it/stick to it. My face usually starts to break out after I use the new product and I resort back to my old routine but not with this one. It has a great smell, it goes on so smoothly, and I do notice a difference on my extra tired new momma eyes. Only con is the price of this but a little goes a long way. Great for tired momma eyes
