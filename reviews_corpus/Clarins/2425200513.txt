This is not the best or the worst makeup removing cleansing oil I have used. It does a decent job at removing my face makeup, but could do better with waterproof eye makeup removal. I’m not a big fan of the formula or consistency. It’s very runny and too thin for my personal preference. The amount of product for the price point is steep too. Most of the other cleansing oils on the market I’ve used are bigger in quantity and less in price. Because this cleanser does its job and removes my makeup, I’ll finish the bottle, but I won’t be repurchasing. If you are looking for a similar product comparison, I have used Biossance squalene cleansing oil and Clinique take the day off cleansing oil, and both are less expensive with a larger amount of product and more effective with better formulas in my opinion.
