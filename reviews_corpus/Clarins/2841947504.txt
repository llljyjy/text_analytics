I am approaching an age range where I want to tackle fine lines. I noticed the smell is rather strong but I honestly don’t mind because it’s not a bad smell, it’s just something to be cautious of if you have allergies. I like the nice glow that it gives but I definitely need to pull it down to my neck and look more even because you will notice a yellow cast. But I am a fan of Clarins and I trust that if I used it everyday I would see a reduction of lines but I only had a trial sample/got it free. I like that it doesn’t feel sticky and I feel moisturized. Great sun glow
