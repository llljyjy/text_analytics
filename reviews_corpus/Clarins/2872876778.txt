It was a great product I like the texture and feel on my skin. My skin felt great and it felted smooth and hydrating. I think itâ€™s best used at night but it is a really nice product. While this was a 7 day trial and I was unable see improvement in the wrinkles under my eye I think overall it was a great product to try. I received this product from butterly as a 7 day trial.DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree #Butterly Great product!
