This is a fantastic product that leaves my skin so soft.  I love that it’s two products you mix together meeting the different needs of my skin.  My only gripe is that I hate the packaging of the samples… it’s hard to open and impossible to mix. However, a full size bottle may not have that issue so I still have it 4 stars because I can only comment on the samples. Must have splurge!
