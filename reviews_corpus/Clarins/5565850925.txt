This is a great mask to use to treat yourself in the mornings when you wake up a bit puffy! The texture is a thick mousse and itâ€™s very easy to spread on your face. You do have to leave it on for 10 minutes and then wash off. I noticed my skin felt a lot smoother and brighter! Wonderful 10 minute mask!!!!
