I really enjoyed the Clarins Double Serum. I got a 7 day sample and wasnâ€™t expecting much improvement in such a time but i was impressed. My skin is dry and showing signs of aging. This serum definitely hydrated my skin really really well. My skin was smooth and soft and looked revived. I would love to purchase this serum and add it to my routine but the price is a bit too steep. Definitely recommend it for those who can afford it. You wont regret it Great Hydrating Serum
