An interesting product where the two serums are kept separate until you mix them in your hands yourself. I like it! It goes on smoothly and feels very luxurious on the skin. There is a light fragrance to it -  so if you’re sensitive this would not be for you.I haven’t really noticed any difference in my skin appearance but I did enjoy using the samples I was sent. I think a longer trial would have produced results. Luxury Feel
