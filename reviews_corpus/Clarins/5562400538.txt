I received a 7 day sample to review in exchange for my honest review from Influenster. It’s a little hard to get both serums out of the sample packs and not long enough to see long term effects but I do find it very hydrating and smoothing especially under makeup and didn’t have any issues with it making my concealer cakey. I do wish it was fragrance free especially since it’s under your eye. Hydrating eye serum
