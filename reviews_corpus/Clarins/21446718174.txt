I got to try to Clarins Double Serum from @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor in exchange for my honest review. #gotitfree #clarinsskincare #doubleserum This serum is a little bit sticky when I applied it on my face but my skin felt nice and soft after. It nice has nice fragrance that’s not too strong and contains Tumeric. I don’t notice any difference yet maybe because I haven’t been used this serum long enough. nan
