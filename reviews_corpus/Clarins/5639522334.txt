I received a 7 day trial sample packet to review so it’s hard for me to give it 5 stars when I don’t feel like the sample gives enough in them to cover my face.  One side of the packet came out fine while the other I had a hard time.  But what did come out it did make my skin feel softer. My makeup was easy to apply after. Which some makes my face look greasy and this one didn’t. The price is kinda high for a mom of 3 on a budget but if it does everything it says I would buy it. nan
