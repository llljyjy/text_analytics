Been using it for over a month now I really waited to try this before I leave a review so I could be honest as much as possible.This eye serum is great but at the same time I would probably just recommend this to people who have a dry skin.I’m combination and sometimes I find it too oily.As far as if it’s effective or not I would say it does makes ur under eye really hydrated .
