I grew up seeing commercials for Clarins products and always thought they were a reputable brand with affordable products. I used the Double Eye Serum for a week and didn’t see significant results. While I do still have young skin, I am starting to get fine smile lines. What I look for is eye serums are serums that hydrate and firm the area. While I agree that this serum definitely hydrated, I didn’t see any improvements in firmness or reducing fine lines. I got these products in a pre-packaged box and I had to squeeze out the product from individual snap packages. At first it was very hard to get out and I was confused by the different textures of the hydrolipidic emulsion and the hydric gel. However, they do combine into a nice mix that easily soaks into your skin. I also liked that this product is plant based, lightweight and contains turmeric. For a price point of a whopping $79 I will not be purchasing the full size. Note that the full size is only 20mL. Just Okay
