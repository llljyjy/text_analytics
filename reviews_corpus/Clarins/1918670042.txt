I got this lip oil as a gift from my best friend. She had purchased one for herself and loved it so much that she needed me to have one too. She was right to think so; Iâ€™m in loooove with it. A bit of a splurge, but the scent, the feeling, the glossy look, the hydration, the fact that it stays on for a while... all good reasons to indulge. Perfect lip oil, in my opinion. nan
