I have used the Clarins double serum eye, so I was really excited to try this one as well. I used it for a few days, in the morning and in the evening. Iâ€™d previously had a little bit of trouble dispensing the samples in packaging like this in the past, but because I knew what to expect, it was fine this time. The 2 serums mix together easily. They have a light, pleasant scent, with a slight gel like consistency. It blends into my skin easily. I really like how this serum feels on my skin. It has a slight tightening feeling. My skin feels very soft to the touch after using it. Overall I really enjoyed using this product, and I do recommend it. Great product
