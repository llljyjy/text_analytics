I received this sample from butterly to try for seven days. I am very impressed with the Clarins double serum. The scent is amazing and the texture is as well. It goes on so soft and easily into the skin without needing to rub too much. There is no piling and the serum penetrates into the skin so there is no oily or sticky after feel. It feels silky and soft on the skin. Sometimes I use it on its own because it does enough for my dry skin. The only issue I had was the way the sample was made. Cracking it in half made it difficult to take out all the product especially the clear serum. nan
