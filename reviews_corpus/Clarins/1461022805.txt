I received a sample for free in exchange for my honest opinion from @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor and @Clarins I really liked how the serum absorbed quickly into my skin and helped hydrate my skin. It appeared to have helped make my skin seem more plump, too. It has a very nice, gentle scent as well. Iâ€™d definitely recommend it! Amazing!
