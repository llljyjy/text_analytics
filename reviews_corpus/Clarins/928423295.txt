I was sent a sample of this product. I don’t think it’s realistic to expect a noticeable difference when using new skin care with a week’s worth of use. That being said, I have no complaints about this serum. I didn’t notice any firming or additional smoothing but I don’t think anyone really sees that after only 7 days. It’s a nice serum, it felt nice on the skin, not heavy or oily, and absorbed well, and paired well with my moisturizer. Need longer than a week to see a difference
