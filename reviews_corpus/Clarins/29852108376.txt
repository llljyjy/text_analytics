I loved everything from the unique packaging (2 seperate vials you fold together to extract the serum) to the product itself. The serum has a nice not overpowering scent, goes on smooth and leaves skin feeling extra soft. I unfortunately got the shipment late so didnâ€™t get to test it out for an extended length of time to see the more long term effects but my initial reaction to this product is that I would definitely buy it again. Loved it!
