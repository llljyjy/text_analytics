I don’t particularly like the strong floral scent and it feels a bit drying on the eyes of I use it anywheres near my eyes ( I don’t put it too close but my eyelashes are quite long so I think they might pick up a bit of the product). It also is more of an oil tan a serum on the skin so it’s not as absorbent as I would look for in a serum.I haven’t noticed a difference in fine lines or wrinkles but it does make my skin look radiant while using it. I don’t think it’s worth the price but I would have to use it for a longer than a week to really find out how well it works.I received this serum as a 7-day trial free for my honest review. More of an oil than a serum
