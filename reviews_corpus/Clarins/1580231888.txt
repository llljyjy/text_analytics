I was so excited to get to try this Clarins cult favorite contouring mask after reading the rave reviews surrounding it! It has an amazing cream-mousse texture that feels thick and luscious when applied to the skin. I left it on for the instructed 10 minutes while getting ready in the morning and was pleasantly surprised to see a more refreshed face staring back at me in the mirror! My puffy, tired mom skin looks brighter and more revived! This has become a new staple in my skincare routine! A little goes a long way so I know this jar will last me months to come! nan
