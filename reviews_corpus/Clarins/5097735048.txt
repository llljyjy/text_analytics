Lift, lift, lift! This magic formula creates a visible eye lift in 60 seconds flat. It smooths the pesky fine lines and wrinkles. My makeup goes on more smoothly without creasing. It also minimizes the appearance of dark circles and puffiness in the eye region. My eyes and face just look more rested and refreshed. It feels good with zero irritation. This uses a formula that is 94% ingredients of natural origin. It contains organic Harungana extract which I like that it has been shown to be as effective as retinol. This helps to replenish and firm my skin gently. The immediate tightening and smoothing affect comes from Cassie Flower wax. It also contains a blend of plant-based caffeine, escin from Horse Chestnut, Albizia, and Organic Guarana extracts to reduce my dark circles, shadows, and puffiness. The ingredients are really good and I love that itâ€™s a much cleaner formula with so many organic elements that really work for me. It lifts and tightens visibly
