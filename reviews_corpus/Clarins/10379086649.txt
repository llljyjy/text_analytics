Iâ€™ve been using this serum twice daily for a week. I was amazed at how much more hydrated and smoother my skin felt overnight! Dry, cold winter air had caused red dry patches on my cheeks and the serum really improved the feeling and smoothness of my sensitive, aging skin. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that I prefer fragrance free products and this one is fairly strongly scented. nan
