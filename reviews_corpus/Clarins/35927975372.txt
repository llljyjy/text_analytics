I have been looking for a good anti-aging serum for a long time, and was happy to try Clarins Double SerumThe texture of the product is nice, very smooth and not too liquid, but more creamy. It smells amazing and dries out quickly. After finishing all the samples, I can tell that the skin looks more healthy and glowing. The pores are not that big like before, and the wrinkles are less visible. I would definitely recommend this serum. #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree Skin looks smoother
