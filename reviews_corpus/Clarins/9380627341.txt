I will start by saying I do not have fine lines or wrinkles around my eyes and the samples I received only lasted a week. That being said, I do feel like this serum did improve the look of my skin. I noticed reduced puffiness and brighter skin around my eyes, so it did what it needed to for me! It was also easy to apply and felt very smooth. Reduced puffiness and brighter!
