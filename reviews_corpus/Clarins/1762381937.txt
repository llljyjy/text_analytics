This serum is so light, it literally feels like water. It feels very hydrating as soon as you apply it, and it works well layered under moisturizer. I’ve been using in the AM and PM and my skin looks overall more supple and glowy. It’s only been a couple of weeks but I’m excited to track results after using for a bit longer. nan
