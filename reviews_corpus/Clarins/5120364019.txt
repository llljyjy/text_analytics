I received this product for my honest opinion. The samples were very difficult to work with. The serum seemed fine but when you have to mix two products I had a hard time knowing how much of each I actually used. I personally invest in a lot of clinical skin care so I canâ€™t say I noticed a great deal of benefit from this sample product. nan
