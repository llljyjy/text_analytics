I received this #gotitfree from #thisisbutterly and #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare for my honest review. It came in a neat packaging that was super fun to use and definitely worth rebuying. I have been using it for the past 7 days and I have to say it did not show as great an effect/outcome to be visible in that time period. I would like to go ahead and buy it again to see if it makes a greater difference. The product went on very well, no sticky residue, the fragrance is rather strong. I will say that it definitely moisturized my skin. Moisturized SKin
