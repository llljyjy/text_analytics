This is one of my favourite lip oils yet! The formula is very thin, non-sticky and is hydrating while giving you a sheer colour. It is very light on the lips and doesn’t travel outside the lip line which some lip oils do.  I purchased the shade Pitaya and it has a soft sweet fragrance which reminds me of those tube glosses. This particular shade looks very bright in the component but actually enhances my natural lip colour. I am already looking to purchase the other shades. I can’t recommend enough! Top Tier lip oil!
