Smells AMAZING like fanciness! So you have to mix up the 2 different products to apply on your eye area. Was a bit runny but overall absorbed all right. You end up using too much each time because you really don’t need too much for your eye. Didn’t notice a difference but it was pleasant to use. Smells great
