I received this product as a sample to try for a week, although it lasted for a bit more than that as the serum applies easily and a small amount goes a long way. I loved the hydration power it have, and although I have oily skin didnâ€™t notice anything greasy when using it. I would love to try for a longer time to be able to test the anti aging claims, but I also likes that it is free of mineral oil and sulfates. It is a higher price point though, so it is worth it to try a sample before buying. Great hydration
