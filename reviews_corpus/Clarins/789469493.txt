I received this product compliments of Influenster and Clarins in exchange for my honest review. I’ve never been a big fan of serums but this has changed my mind. I apply it all across my eye area and instantly feel like I’ve pampered myself. It’s very hydrating and has a pleasant scent. I used it at night and within two days could see an extremely noticeable difference in the appearance of my eyes - fine lines were faded and skin that had looked crepey looked plumped up and hydrated. The effects are temporary - skipping a day left my eyes looking tired and older again - but the results were so quick and obvious that I think it’s worth adding to my daily routine.
