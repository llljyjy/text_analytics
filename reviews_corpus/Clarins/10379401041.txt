I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. This serum promised to give you visible results in 7 days and it did. My skin texture looked better after the seventh day and it also looked more hydrated and less red. I personally was a big fan of the scent, my husband would always compliment the way I smelled when I got in bed. The serum did not feel greasy and it did not leave any residue behind on my pillow case. Only thing I did not like was the way it came packed because I always struggled a bit to make all of it come out from both sides since you have to crack the pack in half and squeeze the product out. Results after seven days!
