This serum has vitamin C, vitamin E, citric acid; moisturizing and anti-aging ingredients. For the first time, I tried it before going to bed, and in the morning my skin felt super soft. My skin tone was even, pores seemed less visible. I was pleasantly surprised by the results and continued using the product. Since then, I haven’t noticed any dryness at all. For someone who’s been struggling with skin dryness for years, this is a great advantage. The bottle looks very chic too and has a nice luxurious feel to it (well, for $100+ this is expected). I know that over the years, Clarins reformulated this serum a bunch of times, thus mixed reviews. But this version is very nice and I’ll keep using it with great pleasure. Really enjoying it!
