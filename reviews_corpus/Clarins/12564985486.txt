The texture is so unique! It looks like a cream, but it has more of a gel type texture, like a mousse. The application process is very easy and this mask is easy to spread.  I love that you just leave it on for 10 minutes. Itâ€™s very easy to wash off. This mask almost instantly depuffs and moisturizes your skin. After washing it odd, you can see how the mask evens your skin tone, hydrates, and depuffs your face! I will definitely buy again. Amazing
