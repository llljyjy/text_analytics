Okay, this is pricey but I can see why. If you need something that works longterm AND that gives you that instant gratification, this could be it. Immediately, I noticed a lot more hydration and also a tightening effect/sensation. Nothing mind blowing on my 37 yo skin, but definitely noticeable and makes me curious to see on others.The product itself has a really nice moisturizing texture thatâ€™s on the thicker side and feels deeply nourishing. It sinks right in and wears comfortably all day without feeling sticky or greasy.Although the scent is pleasant, I do wish this was unscented. Sensitive skin friends may want to double check ingredients to see if this will work for you. Has Real Potential!
