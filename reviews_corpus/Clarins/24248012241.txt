I really enjoyed this serum. I love the smell of it, and I didn’t find it was super strong like certain serums out there. I liked how it left my skin feeling very smooth and nice and hydrated and it didn’t leave it feeling greasy which I was super glad about. My skin felt plump and glowy after just a few days of using this serum. I would recommend this to family and friends to try. For me it was a great sample to try that worked well with my skin. Only reason it did not get 5 stars is the price point. it is a bit pricey so not everyone could afford this besides that no complaint!! Great serum!!
