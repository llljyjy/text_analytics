I overall really liked this eye serum and found that it did a good job of brightening my undereye area. The bottle design is very unique, there are 2 compartments that combine in the pump and when applying the product. You can toggle if you want a lot or little product with the pump twist setting too, which was very helpful. It takes a little bit of mixing the product when it comes out due to the different textures - one is a watery gel and the other is a light creamy lotion texture. After applying my undereye area looks instantly brighter and after a few minutes the puffiness decreases as well. nan
