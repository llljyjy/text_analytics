This is stuff is nice! I am a fan of serums, and Clarins Double Serum is top notch. Just a small amount mixed together and your on your way to you get looking skin. I’m at the age where I’m desperate for younger looking skin. My face is feeling smoother and has a bit of a glow, which is lovely. It has a two-phase formula combining plant extracts. It boosts your skin’s 5 viral functions : hydration, protection, regeneration, nutrition, and oxygenation. Clarins Double Serum is suitable for all skin types, ages, and ethnicities.  Fantastic! Anti-ageing miracle!
