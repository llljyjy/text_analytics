This feels really nice on the under eyes. The texture is very creamy and easy to apply. It has a nice subtle clean smell so it is very enjoyable to apply. The bottle pump does take quite a bit of time to warm up and work properly, but mine seems to be working great now. The cream does have some tackiness to it, so it tends to grip nicely to the skin and my skin feels nice and hydrated while using this. Lovely eye cream!
