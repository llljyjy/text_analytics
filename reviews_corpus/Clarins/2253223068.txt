I was not a big fan. I did feel it did what it needed to do. But it wasn’t amazing. I also noticed that when snapped in half the one side would open always but the other one you had to play with to get the serum to come out. So it was a bit frustrating as it’s more watery based so it made a bit of a mess. Maybe the actual bottle wouldn’t be such a hassle but with the sample packs it was hard to get a true feeling with not being able to get much out on the one side. Good but not great.
