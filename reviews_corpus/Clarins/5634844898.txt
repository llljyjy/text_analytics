It was a treat to be able to try this new Clarins anti-aging serum. The format definitely took me by surprise. In order to access the product, you fold the package and squeeze the two-coloured products out to apply. I was a little turned off by the brown/orange colour at first and wasn’t sure whether the oily liquid texture was going to make my face oily. However, I was happily surprised that not only did the colour did not stain my skin, it also didn’t make my face oily or make me break out in acne! My skin was smoother, softer, and lines were lightened over the course of the treatment. There was plenty of product in the one daily package that I could moisturize my face as well as my neck and hands. I can understand why it is pricey, it’s good stuff! An interesting take on anti-aging serum
