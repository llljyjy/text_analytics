I wasn’t really impressed with this serum product. The concept of having to mix the two products together is interesting but not really explained as to why. The sample packaging is kind of awkward to use and get the product out of. There is too much fragrance added for something that is supposed to contain all kinds of botanicals. I didn’t really see any difference in my skin after using it for a week and it made my skin breakout in a way that it hasn’t for over 15 years. I wouldn’t purchase this for myself. Not recommended for people with sensitive skin. Not for me, especially at this price
