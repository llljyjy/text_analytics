After a week of trying this serum, it made a remarkable effect on my skin making it brighter, clearer, and softer. Although it was hard to get out of the package, it was easy to apply, absorbed quickly, and had a really nice floral scent to it. I do love that itâ€™s primarily plant-based and also that this serum focuses on preventing/delaying the appearance of wrinkles. It really is a good way to get extra anti-aging effects and do believe that this product is worth the price. Makes skin look better!
