i received the Clarin’s Eye lift free from Influenster, in exchange for my honest opinion. Unfortunately it was a sample but as a person suffering from different allergies and rosacea this product did not hurt my skin , I do not suffer from dark circles or puffiness so can’t tell if works on that but I felt my under eye area  brighter and tighter, also more hydrated and smooth . I do really recommend this product. nan
