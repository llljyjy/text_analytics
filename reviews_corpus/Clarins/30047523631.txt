An anti aging serum with 2 separate formulas, that combined together just before use for maximum effectiveness!This is what made me so excited to try out Clarins Double Serum. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it. Its gentle on skin and very hydrating. I think its too early to see anti aging properties but it definitely gave a glow to my skin. I loved its texture, not too liquidy and not too dense. It has a light floral scent which is very pleasant. Cool concept, effective product
