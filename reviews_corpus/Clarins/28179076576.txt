I recently gave birth and the lack of sleep with a newborn, my undereyes really needed some loving. I’ve been testing this eye cream and it really helped with brightening and hyrdrating my undereyes! The texture and consistency isn’t too thick and didn’t cause any milia which is usually the case when I use thick creams. It is definitely pricey and on the luxury side though, but I enjoy using this! nan
