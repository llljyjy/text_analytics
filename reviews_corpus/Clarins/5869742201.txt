Although the sample snap packaging isn’t the most convenient for ensuring you’re not wasting any product, I really am glad I get to sample it. The serum smells great (makes me feel like I’m at a spa day) and immediately after the first application, my skin around my eyes felt softer and looked hydrated! I have high hopes for the results after 7 days (as noted on the packaging), but I’m currently indifferent on whether I would recommend this product or not as it’s too early to tell. Rating 4 stars now; hopeful for results in 7 days
