In all fairness, I don’t have a long history of using many different types of facial serum products, so my review is an opinion based on only a week’s worth of supply, with very little time or other products to compare it to.  As many others have already pointed out, the serum goes on and absorbs nicely into the skin, and seems to be hypoallergenic even for my moderately sensitive and acne-prone skin.  There is definitely an improved look and feel to my skin after using for a few days.  However, as to whether or not it provides long-lasting, permanent improvements, how long you would have to use it for desired results, or whether or not there are other products on the market that are as effective or better, and/or at a more affordable price, that’s something I wouldn’t be able to answer.  You may want to start out by purchasing a month’s supply, use it religiously for that month, and then go off of it for a few weeks to see if you notice a sustained improvement, that may help you to formulate your own opinion about whether or not this product is the right one for you.  Trial and error is typically the name of the game when it comes to cosmetics and skincare.  Everyone’s results will vary.  Good luck and have fun! Nice, but is there better for less?
