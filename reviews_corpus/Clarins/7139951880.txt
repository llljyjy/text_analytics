I tried the sample provided by Butterly and the product is nice, and I didn’t mind the smell. I mixed the two products together and used it nightly but honestly haven’t noticed anything. My skin is oily and acne prone, and so I am not sure if it contributed to a recent flare up. I really wanted to love it, as many other Clarins products are so good#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare I didn't notice a difference
