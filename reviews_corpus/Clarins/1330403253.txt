This wasn’t a good match for me, the scent was overwhelming for me and the product wasn’t great for my skin. It probably is extremely effective for some skin types, but it just wasn’t a match for me. Overall I think it would be something to try and see, as reactions vary and my skin didn’t like something in it. nan
