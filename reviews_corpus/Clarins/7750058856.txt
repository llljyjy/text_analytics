I was able to try out this serum all thanks to Butterly. I used this serum for 2 weeks straight and I could already see how soft, smooth and firm my skin started to look. One packet of serum goes a long way! I used this daily before I went to bed every night and woke up with such amazing skin. I’ve already bought a bottle from Sephora as I don’t think I can live without this serum as part of my night skincare routine. Such an amazing serum!
