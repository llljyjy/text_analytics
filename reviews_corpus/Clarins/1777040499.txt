THE Best self tanning formula out there right now. I’ve used it on my face and my body without any issues.  The only negative I can say is it is highly fragranced so when I put it on my face it does bother my nose a bit for a while.  It has not broken me out at all.  The color is beautiful and very natural on my fair skin. No streaking.  It’s gel however I feel like it has a great slip and it doesn’t dry me out.  The color fades gradually.  The tube is on a small side if you use it on your whole body often.  Best part is the self tanning smell is almost nonexistent. The Best!!!
