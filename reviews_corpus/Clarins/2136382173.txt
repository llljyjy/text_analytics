It hasn’t broken me out or clogged my pores—which was my main concern. It smells like creamy sandalwood and a little goes a long way. I use it all over my face and neck before my creams. I think this was the best choice oil versus the other ones and the ingredients are really good. My skin is hydrated and freshly prepped. I think it’s giving me a glow and it’s great for the price.
