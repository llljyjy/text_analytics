I received a 7-Day Sample of the Serum to try before in order to review this. Unfortunately I didn’t see any noticeable differences in my skin after the 7 days. I liked the gentleness of the Serum and it felt good on my skin. The scent was also quite nice, subtle and pleasant. There really wasn’t anything in particular that I didn’t like, it just didn’t seem to be effective for me after the week. nan
