I’ve been using this double serum for few days before going to bed, but I can see already that it is seems to be working. I was planning to wait before posting my review but it needed to be in by today and I just received the samples a couple days ago. I’ve used other similarly priced serums before without seeing any effect, but this one makes my skin feel different already, my skin looks radiant and soft, it’s very hydrating without being oily. Due to the style of the sample packets I find it hard to mix the two serums but I’m sure that in the bottle this wouldn’t be an issue. I do find that my face feels a little sticky after application but it dissipates quickly. At this point that I’m not using any moisturiser after applications and, it feels perfect all over my face, eye contour included. The serum smells sweet like something tropical but I can’t place what it is. I may  buy a bottle and try it again once my seven day trial is gone but we shall see.. It’s nice
