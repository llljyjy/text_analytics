I got to sample this for a week. The sample packaging was pretty annoying, but shouldn’t be an issue in the full-size product. This serum definitely made my eye skin feel very hydrated and protected from the elements. However, after only one week of use, I don’t really see/feel much of a difference. For as expensive as it is, I wouldn’t purchase the product. Good But Not Worth The Money
