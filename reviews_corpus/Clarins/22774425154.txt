Very hydrating for your eye area! I used this in addition to the serum and found my skin to be very hydrated. I tried a weeks worth of sample sizes and felt like I was applying too much. With one large bottle, you will be better able to control how much you pump out. It was pretty fragrant, but I enjoyed it. nan
