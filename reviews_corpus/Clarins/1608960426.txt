I am so glad I ordered this despite the reviews. I’ve used the old cotton face wash and loved it but had used something else for a while since the Clarins by me closed. I decided to go back to Clarins after 5 years of using another brand because I got tired of having to order it and my local Sephora started carrying Clarins so I canrun in and grab this from the store when I’m out. I am sensitive to smells, but found this to have a mild pleasant scent that doesn’t linger like some washes I’ve used. It takes off most of my makeup and leaves my skin soft and hydrated! I love it. It’s definitely worth trying if you’re on the fence! Love it!
