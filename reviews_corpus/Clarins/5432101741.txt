I received a week’s supply of Clarins #DoubleSerum to try out from Butterly. #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree Each packet was single use and 0.9 ml, so about a 7ml sample in total. I don’t know if the bottle is similar, but the packet had a lot more of the orange non-greasy oil versus the clear melting gel, so it was more difficult to spread on the face as the clear side was more hydrating.  I’m not a big fan of the supposedly fruity and floral scent. And why is it so expensive? It doesn’t seem to inflame my dry, sensitive skin but does sit a bit oily on the skin. I do like that it includes plant extracts, but overall the description is a bit vague. nan
