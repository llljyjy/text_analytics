I love the Clarins Double Serum and have used it for at least a year. I have aging skin with fine lines and since using this Double Serum my fine lines hardly show at all anymore. Its easy to apply without a lot of hassle and my skin absorbs it and feels soft right away.  You just press it into your skin without rubbing so you arenâ€™t pulling on your skin which can damage your skin over time.  I love it and will continue to use it a long time to come. Have used for at least a year!
