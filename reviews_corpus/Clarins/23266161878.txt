I was sent a bunch of single-use packets of @clarinscanada Double Serum Firming & Smoothing Anti-Aging Concentrate from @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor to try/review and WOW! I’m pretty frugal when it comes to skincare and tend to opt for cheaper options and dupes, but this is one of the first times that I’m actually considering paying for a full-sized bottle despite the high price point ($96CAD for 30mL). It has almost 2k reviews with an average rating of 4.2/5 on Sephora and I completely understand why!This is a two-in-one product with 21 youth-boosting plant extracts, including turmeric (for aging), teasel and mayrothamnus (for firming and lifting), and avocado and Mary’s thistle (for softening). The packet/bottle has two compartments that each contain different combos of ingredients, which combine when you pump them into your hand (2nd pic). I’m not kidding you when I say this product MELTED into my skin. I’ve been trying out retinol for the first time and it has been extremely drying and aggravating to my face. This serum has quenched my skin’s thirst for moisture, reduced bumps and dry patches, and gives me the most glowy skin of my life! It’s so incredibly hydrating and I can’t wait to see the additional benefits it has in reducing wrinkles and fine lines! What an amazing product. #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree Incredibly hydrating serum!
