Who knew such a small amount, literally just a few drops, could be so powerful. It’s a great system to have the small amount needed in the fold and break open packets. It can be hard to show self control when using products and the fact that it is pre measured makes things easy and easy to travel with. There’s actually quite a lot of products that might even be excessive considering the eye area is so small. I like this product a lot and it makes my face feel great in an almost instant. Love this paired with the face serum for a complete routine. Packs a punch
