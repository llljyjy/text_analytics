I’ve purchased many many lip oils over the last couple years but never this one in raspberry, until now. Very disappointed. The smell is very strong, like a raspberry/vanilla but not in a good way. It’s also very thin…Definitely not worth the almost $40 price tag with tax. I have yet to find one better than item beauty’s lip quench. It’s thicker, smells faintly of mangos and is $18. For those liking a thicker oil, without the stickiness I suggest you give it a try. Hands down my favorite so far. I will be returning this (shoppers drug mart) Not worth the hype..
