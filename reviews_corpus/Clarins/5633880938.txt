i received a trial size of this somewhere along the way, i used it for the first time yesterday and was surprised. first i was confused at the texture, it comes out looking like a moisturizer or cream, i wondered if i had grabbed the wrong product. I double checked it was the cleanser! The small was pleasant, floral but light i really really liked it! When i lathered it up i didn’t get any foaming, it just kind of turned into a watery paste BUT it cleaned my face really well! All of the oil from my face was gone and it left my skin feeling hydrated and clean, not stripped and uncomfortable like other cleansers I’ve tried. Also, usually new products break me out and it hasn’t so far, really enjoying this and will update if anything changes! Great, light floral, left my skin hydrated
