I have been using this product for almost a month and had high hopes because I truly, genuinely enjoy Clarins products! This was great under the eyes, I used it day and night switched off, and I have super dry sensitive skin and my skin tolerated it very well! It was a great step to add before my moisturizer as it provided a little extra hydration and helped diminish harsh dark circles. nan
