Wow! I am absolutely obsessed with this Clarins facial intensive wrap. I can notice right away after the first use that my puffy under eye bags have been dramatically reduced and my face looks so much healthier! I love that it contains rich plant extracts and this is a moose like cream that soaks so wonderfully into my skin. You just leave it on for 10 minutes and then rinse with a cool water. AMAZING! I couldn’t be happier with the results and I can’t wait to continue to use! AMAZING!!!
