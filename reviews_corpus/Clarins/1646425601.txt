This eye cream has a lovely soft texture. It absorbed quickly and didn’t irritate my eyes at all. I’ve only been using it for a week and a half, but so far I’m enjoying it. I feel like my under eyes are starting to look brighter, firmer, and more healthy overall. I can’t wait to continue using it to see even more drastic results. Clarins
