I received the 7 day sample pack. The individual card pack had the perfect amount of serum, though one side (brown coloured oil side) had more than the other side (clear serum side). Sometimes itâ€™s hard to tell if I squeezed all the clear side out. Regardless, the product was a nice oily serum that smelled really good (not overpowering) and absorbed well. My face did not feel dry/tight and felt really soft and smooth. I would recommend this product to delay aging skin. Skin feels so soft!
