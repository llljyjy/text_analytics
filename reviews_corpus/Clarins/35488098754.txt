I received this product complimentary from Influenster and I can’t say enough about this serum! It actually surprised me in how it exceeded my expectations. I’m in my 30’s and have dry/combination skin, with an occasional pimple here and there. First off, I was pleasantly surprised with the light scent of this serum (it wasn’t strong or overpowering) and actually enjoyed it. My skin is pretty dry and absorbs serum like a sponge, so I usually have to use a lot for the extra hydration, but I was able to use a pea size of this product and a little went a long way. I loved the way my skin felt without feeling greasy. My skin had a glow after applying and appeared brighter. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the fact that I have not yet seen a difference yet, But I would definitely recommend this product and look forward to buying the product in its full size. Definitely Recommend
