received this product as a free sample for my honest review. I really liked this product a lot! I love the feeling of the product, it was a little harder to mix the two serums together though because it was in a little sampler pack and one side came out better than the other. The product itself went on nicely a little goes a long way! It absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves a smooth non-greasy feel! It has a soft smell to it that I actually really liked! I felt like my skin looked healthier and  hydrated in the morning. The sample lasted about 1 week and feel that it made a difference in the appearance overall. I would purchase this product in the future! nan
