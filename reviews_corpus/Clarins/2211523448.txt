Every time I use this, I question why they have to keep the 2 serums separate. Especially when it seems to be activated when they are mixed together to be effective. The little 7-day sample packets require you to fold it in half to crack it open and I used about half of the sample packet for 1 full face application. I find it oily on the fingers but not so much on the face; although it doesn’t seem to fully absorb into my skin and because of how the product gets dispensed from the packet, I don’t think the 2 serums are equally distributed; I got more of the turmeric/orange serum. I saw no difference in my skin but I think it would be more beneficial in the winter months when my skin is drier. nan
