I enjoyed trying this serum. I like the way it feels on my face, a little goes a long way (the first time I used a bit too much and was very shiny/greasy, but using less was much better!) It does have a scent I’m not super fond of, but it’s not overwhelming. I found it to be very hyrdrating, I didn’t need to use a moisturizer after it as I do with most serums. I haven’t noticed a change in my appearance after the sample pack, but it seems like a good product! nan
