I am always on the lookout for a décolleté cream as I am in my 30s and am in the sun all the time. I want to take care of that part of my body, and so far I am really loving this Clarins product. It’s thin and lightweight and rubs in nicely. It has a pleasant fragrance. I like the bottle design as the cap twists and it’s a squeeze bottle. Great neck firming product!
