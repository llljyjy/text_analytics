I received a 7 day sample of this serum and use it nightly for a week. I feel like this serum was so hyped up, that I expected to see fantastic results immediately. Usually I don’t look for results until I’ve used a product for a few months, but this product promises them after only 7 days. As far as those expectations go, I’m not so sure.
