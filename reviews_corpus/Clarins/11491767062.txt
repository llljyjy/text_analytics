I was selected to try and test out Clarins double serum.I really enjoyed using this product, I used it every morning. I started to notice that my pores were less visible and my face felt a lot tighter. That made me really happy because it was one of my skin concern. The oil smell was great & it was light weight. I feel like it gave me a sunkissed glow which I really liked. It’s a little on the pricy side to be honest but I think it’s worth it if you want to invest in a good product Great !
