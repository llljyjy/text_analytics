I have such sensitive eyes and it’s hard finding an eye serum or eye cream that doesn’t irritate my skin.  This serum goes on light but is super moisturizing and I love that I don’t have any sensitivity to it. It’s a little pricey but I’m enjoying it.  I also love that you can change the amount that comes out on the top of the pump. Enjoying so far!
