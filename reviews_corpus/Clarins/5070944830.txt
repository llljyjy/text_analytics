This eye serum has been great on my face. I have only used it at night although the instructions say to use it twice a day, I’ve only used it at nighttime. I have oily skin and it tends to make me feel oiler than my skin already is. I live in the South where it’s humid and dry so using it only at night works best for me. I think this serum would seem to work best for people who have dry skin unlike myself who has oily skin. It was really easy to glide around on the skin as well even with light and gentle pressure, which is great especially around the eye area. After using all seven sample packs, I have noticed that the skin around my eyes is much smoother, more hydrated and plump in comparison to before. Great but lil oily feeling
