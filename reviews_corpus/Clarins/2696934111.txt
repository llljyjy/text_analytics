I received samples of this from Influenster. Right off the bat is has an extremely strong floral fragrance. Not bad but buyer be ware if you are sensitive to that. It is extremely liquidy, not my favorite for an eye cream but does feel nice when applying. No immediate difference so would need to try it longer than the 7 days of sample I got. Meh
