The first thing I noticed was how strongly this serum is scented. Like perfume directly on my face. It felt like forever before I couldn’t notice it anymore. The oiliness of the product made the packaging  very slippery for me to press and squeeze. It was messy for me the first couple of tries but I got better at it. Despite how oily the serum is, it dries very quickly on my face and left it feeling very smooth and soft. I received this for free to trial from Butterly, Chick Advisor, but I don’t notice anything dramatic that would make me spend that much on a serum. Strong Scent!
