I received a set of 6 sample pouches of this product for free from influencer to test and took it in my honeymoon. While I liked this product and it felt great and hydrating I didn’t notice any big differences after the 6 days. I also found it slightly watery for me as I prefer thicker eye creams. There was nothing wrong with this product it’s just not a new staple of mine. I recommend it for younger women without too many fine lines or to be used in conjunction with a thicker more wrinkle focused eye cream. nan
