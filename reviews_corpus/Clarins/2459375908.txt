I like using the serum in the evening a little goes a long way, i enjoy massaging the serum in my skin with finger or a face massaging tool after this i apply my night cream. The serum leave my skin well hydrated and smooth. The turmeric leaves a slight tint on your skin, its like you have a glow. The sent of the serum is very faint and subtle which i like. The packaging is quite genius with the 2 formulas in one bottle, it gets complicated with all the serums and creams to apply and sometimes i forget to apply one, now thats one less step i have to take. Also much easier for traveling. #gotitforfree Clarins double serum
