I received a 7-day sample compliments of Chick Advisor and Butterly.What a lovely anti- aging facial serum.  It’s a double formula water (hydric) and oil (lipidic) based serum, packed with 21 different plant extracts with such ingredients as turmeric root extract, banana fruit extract, mango leaf extract and kiwi fruit extract.    It has a nice floral scent that is not too overpowering.I noticed immediate results with this serum.  It’s incredibly hydrating and left my skin with a nice glow.  After a week of use, I noticed a dramatic shrinking of the pores and a much smoother skin texture.My only issue is that its oily and messy on the fingers, mixing the two formulas together.  Just a minor irritant.  I will definitely be purchasing a full-sized bottle of this serum. What a lovely serum
