This is my holy grail facial oil in the winter months. I have dry, sensitive skin and especially during the fry and cold winter months I reach for this both morning and night. I use one full dropper before moisturizer and press it into my face. It leaves my face feeling soft and hydrated, not to mention I love the earthy smell. Itâ€™s a splurge for me but now a must-have. best facial oil for dry skin
