This serum is used twice daily, on clean skin, after toner. One side features an amber non-greasy oil while the other side holds a lush melty gel. Once combined they create a smooth, semi-viscous texture and a delicate turmeric-floral fragrance. I loved, loved, loved it’s scent and it quickly faded but it might not be great for my fragrance free friends. I loved how gentle, highly moisturizing and deeply hydrating this serum is. It feels amazing on your skin, especially dryer areas and it’s noncomedogenic so it won’t promote blemishes. There were 7 packets so I wasn’t able to see immediate results, however, I did love it it. I’d definitely consider purchasing again based on my samples. It’s a solid 10/10 as a first impression but you honestly can’t go wrong with Clarins! ✨#gotitfree #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare Solid 10/10 first impressions!
