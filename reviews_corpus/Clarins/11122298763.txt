I absolutely loved it. I loved the oil and melting gel combined into one package. The scent was so nice, light and refreshing and it didnâ€™t even bother my skin at all. I was left with hydrated and firmer skin.  Best part was I only needed a super tiny amount and I had more then enough for my face and neck!! I loved the fact that h this a double whammy of goodness for your skin. Less waste and more product.  #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare Double the good stuff
