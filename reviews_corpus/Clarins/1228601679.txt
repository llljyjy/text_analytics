Got a sample of this product in the mail last week & really enjoyed trying it!  I put it on before makeup & it definitely helped my under eyes from looking creases or cakes throughout the day. Didnâ€™t notice a lot more than that, which makes me wish I had the full size!  Definitely worth a try! Wish I Had More!
