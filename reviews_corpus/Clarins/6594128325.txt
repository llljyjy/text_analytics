Honestly I received this as a free sample to try out from Influenster and I’m absolutely obsessed with this serum now ! I wouldn’t of normally gone and tried it because it’s definitely a little more on the pricey side , but it’s so worth it ! Makes my under eyes so smooth and hydrated , and also helps with my crows feet a little bit! I love this stuff , definitely something you have to try out and incorporate into your skincare routine ! Love this eye serum !
