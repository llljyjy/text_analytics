I’m in my late 30’s now, and signs of aging are starting to creep in. I noticed the skin around my neck was looking dull and lines were getting deeper. I was excited to find the Extra Firming Neck and Décolleté Cream because I’m a big fan of the Clarins anti aging serum. Here’s what I love about this product so far:1. The texture of this cream is perfect! It’s super light weight and my skins absorbs it immediately. 2. There isn’t any oily residue after application.3. The light scent is refreshing. 4. After using it for a few weeks, I can attest that I’m starting to notice visible improvement in the texture of my skin. I’m looking forward to seeing additional results after continued long term use. Love the texture!
