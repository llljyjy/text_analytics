I’m skeptical about anything claiming eye lift, but with almost no sleep for about two weeks due to extreme body pain my eyes needed this serum and let me just say: it ain’t a miracle but it makes a difference! In the picture I uploaded I decided to do one side with the product and one without. (No makeup) You can clearly see the difference in sagging. Seen it work!
