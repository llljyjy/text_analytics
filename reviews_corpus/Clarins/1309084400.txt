I received this product for free in exchange for my review.The samples were individually packaged and each pack had enough serum to use twice (day and night). This serum is lightweight and feels good on the skin. It absorbs well and does not leave a greasy feeling. Due to the limited time of use, I cannot say if it is effective or not. I havenâ€™t noticed much difference in my skin but it is worth a try. This serum feels nice!
