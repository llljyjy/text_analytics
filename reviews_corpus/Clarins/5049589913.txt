I barely get enough sleep these days because of my busy schedule at work but eye creams are my best friend that hides away them dark circles. Itâ€™s a very soft texture and says to apply under the eyes and above the eyes. It makes me look like I get eight hours of sleep every night super hydrating as well. nan
