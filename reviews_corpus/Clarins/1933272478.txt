I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This product was really interesting. It was cool how I got to mix the serum together. Although, it was hard to really test since the sample was given in a small card-like packet. If I had the bottle, it would have been easier to test. The serum smelled great. I love using eye serum as a preventative measure for anti-aging. nan
