You can tell right away that Clarins Double Serum is a high quality product.  The ingredient list is impressive to say the least.  It contains 21 plant extracts, perfectly chosen to help minimize and protect against aging.  After only a few uses, you can really notice a difference in your skin.  It gave me such a nice glow and the texture of my skin looked amazing.  It was almost like everything was slowly smoothing itself out, including fine lines.  I really liked the floral scent.  My only complaint is that I found it greasy or oily and it made my skin look very shiny after application and the shininess lingered.  Because of that, I would only use this product at night.  Other than that, I think this is a high quality product that does work well to help keep aging skin looking beautiful. Works Well
