I got to try Clarins Double serum through the Chickadvisor Product Review Club. The serum has 2 different ingredients that mix together right before you apply it. I liked the light scent and how easily it absorbed into my skin. The serum is designed to improve the appearance of wrinkles and enlarged pores. It also helps your skin become more radiant and firm. I liked the way my skin looked after a week of using this product. I would like to continue using it to keep my skin glowing and healthy. Adding this to my skincare routine!
