I have had an opportunity to try Clarins Double Serum for free in exchange for my honest review. I was intrigued by the instructions but seemed easy enough. Product feels like satin on my hands as I mixed the product and my face felt the effects almost immediately. After using for 7 days I do find that my skin feels hydrated, which is especially difficult during the cold weather we are having. The area around my eyes looks better than it usually does as I do feel the fine wrinkles have diminished a bit, and under my eyes doesnâ€™t look as tired as it normally does. I suspect with regular usage I would see even more positive results. I definitely am happy with how my skin feels after seven days. Surprised at the results!
