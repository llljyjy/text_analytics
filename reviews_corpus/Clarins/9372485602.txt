I bought this because I saw online it’s a “dupe” for dior and half the price, let me say it does not disappoint!  It’s 100% a dupe too since it’s hydrating (don’t need to apply lip balm before), lightweight and not sticky feeling and the color shows up more than the dior. I got a bright pink color and you can see it on my lips with a “smooth” gloss feel (if that make sense) Buy! It won’t disappoint, maybe better than dior. you need this product!
