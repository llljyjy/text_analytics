This is a nice eye serum. It is thin in consistency but that’s because it’s an eye serum, not a cream. I used this for about a week and my skin does feel smooth and hydrated afterward. I didn’t notice any firming results. I usually use the Dermalogica Biolumin C eye serum and love it a lot. The Clarins product has fragrance but smells nice. I will overall continue to use my Dermalogica one because it is more hydrating and brightening. nan
