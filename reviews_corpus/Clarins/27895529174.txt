I received a packet of 7 samples complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  I was impressed with how little it took for full coverage of my eyes. It was difficult to get the side of the serum to come out that is more a moisturizer consistency while the oil was very easy to get out. Iâ€™m not sure if that is the case with the full sized product. They do mix well together and I felt it helped diminish the under eye bags I get and soften the wrinkles I have there. A lot goes a long way!
