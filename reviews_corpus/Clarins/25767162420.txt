Review thank you for my sample but I have to be honeslty not my fav.  @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanadaI have to give an honest review clarins double serum was not my favourite.  I have oily skin, this was very oil took a while to dry and my face doesn’t feel soft still feels oily.  I really don’t like the scent. I don’t know if this is how you buy it, in the little packets (I hope it comes in a bottle). I would not recommend for oily skin. Not for my oily skin
