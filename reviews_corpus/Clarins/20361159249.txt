I were using this cream for the past two weeks. It’s still too early to tell about visible results, but I can see that my decollete and neck skin feels well moisturized. I had a little bit of stuggle with the applicator at the beggining, but now it’s working fine. I like the scent overall. It’s smells like classical cream for me, but for the summer, I feel it’s a little bit heavy. Oveally I have really positive impression about Clarins Extra-Firming Cou & Decollete cream and will definately continue using it. Effective
