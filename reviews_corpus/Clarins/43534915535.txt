I received this product as sample, so my review is based on that. I have used it for a couple of days and what I can say about it is that although it looks greasy ot is very well absorbed in the skin, does not leave a greasy film on the face, my skin does not feel heavy after using it and it has a pleasant smell. Not sure how much younger my skin will look like in the long term, but it feels nice after using it. A good feel skin routine
