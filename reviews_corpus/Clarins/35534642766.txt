I received this products for free from Influenster,Clarins, and Sephora in exchange for my honest review. I have been lucky in my life to not get very many fine lines or wrinkles yet.  After using this product for 7 days, I notice that my eyes feels and looks nicer. I would use this to prevent fine lines around the eye area. This products has a slight warming sensation when you put it on your eyes. It also smells amazing. I would recommend. Works great
