I got a free 7 day sample from a VoxBox.  The product is suppose to show results in 7 day, but for me I didn’t see anything. I feel like if I had more product, I might start to see a difference, but it was hard to get the product out from the samples. Then again I can’t complain because it was free.  I do tho like the formula and how it felt when applying. The smell was nice as well. If you are someone who likes serums and use them all the time, then this might be for you. I don’t normally use serums and the price is a bit high for me. nan
