Received the Clarins Double Serum - Hydric + Lipdic System to try for 7 days. A lot goes a long way with this serum. I was able to extend the application to more than 7 days. The smell is perfume like. It’s non-greasy and easily absorbs into the skin. Skin appears to be more radiant and hydrated after application. I didn’t have any issues wearing it under my makeup. Would recommend purchasing this product. Two-Phase Hydrating Serum that smells great
