I love this eye cream, very light yet hydrating and it doesn’t cause milia like other eye products. But the pump is terrible, I have had to dismantle the bottle and just scoop out the cream because the pump is too short and stopped working. I shouldn’t have to do that considering the price! Good product, terrible packaging
