I received this product to test out in exchange for my honest review. The product was fairly simple to dispense by folding over on the dotted line of the individually packed serums. The serum has a nice pleasant scent and is not greasy at all. I applied it under my eye area and noticed a great reduction in puffiness after several uses. My skin also felt hydrated and smooth. I would definitely recommend this product to others. Great product!
