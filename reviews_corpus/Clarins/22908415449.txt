I have been wanting to try this Clarins eye serum and the facial serum, of course, since I’d heard about it a few months ago, and I’m so glad that I get this chance to try it out! I just started using it, and I’m already in love! It feels really nice and weightless on my eyes, which is perfect! I love the whole idea behind the dual serums and hydrolipidic system. It’s totally innovative. I will say that I am expecting a lot from this Serum, especially based on the price, but mostly because I’ve heard such amazing things about the eye serum. I’ll certainly be using this and maybe cry once it’s gone lol. It does have a great application, and I noticed a bit of immediate tightness to my under eye area, which is always a nice touch, especially if you haven’t slept well or something like that. I totally need to collect the facial serum now, so I can use them together! Thank you Clarins, for this awesome eye serum! My new love!
