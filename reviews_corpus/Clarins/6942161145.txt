I was selected to try and test out Clarins double serum. I didn’t expect to see any results really from this but after using it for a week, I did notice the increased firmness in my face and it reduced the look of,pores. The serum goes on smoothly and doesn’t leave my face oily. Lately my skin has been dry from the weather, the serum has really been hydrating my skin. The scent is subtle and mild for bonus points. Overall, I’m definitely satisfied after the week use of this serum, my skin looks healthy and I love it. Very lovely serum!
