I love this product! It went on my skin so smoothly and absorbed quickly. I was able to see the brightening affects after a few uses. I have very sensitive skin and this product did not irritate me at all.  I like the texture and feel of the product and how it glides under my eyes and gives a slightly cooling effect. I would definitely buy again, worth every drop! brightening after a few uses!
