I received the Clarins Double Serum for free in exchange for an honest review. Clarins as we know, is an expensive brand, and is associated with top-of-the-line skincare. I was super happy to try out the Double Serum. My skin must’ve been so dry due to the weather… the serum was 100% absorbed within seconds. My skin was so smooth after only 1 application – I guess that’s why Clarins is a top brand! The product speaks for itself! After using it daily for almost a week, my skin 100% feels softer and a little bouncier. I haven’t had any new break outs, and I’m actually really loving incorporating the Double Serum into my skincare routine. Now to wait for a sale and stock up! Super absorbant serum that makes you feel classy
