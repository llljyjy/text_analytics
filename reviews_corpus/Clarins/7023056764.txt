I received this product from Influenster free of charge in exchange for a review. The serum is a nice, liquid-y consistency and a pleasant light fragrance. Overall, I didnâ€™t notice a drastic change in the appearance of my under eye discoloration and fine lines, so the product is just OK. I think that for the price you can find other options out there.
