I recently received this beautiful neck cream and am really enjoying it. I love that it is in an ample sized tube.   It soaks in easily and isn’t greasy. It works well with other serums and SPF and doesn’t pill. I don’t have any illusions that it will make my neck look like it did 30 years ago, but it serves as a great moisturizer and definitely leaves my skin feeling plumped up. nan
