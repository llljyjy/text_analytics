I got a 7 day free sample from Influenster and while it was nice to try something new, I don’t think it did much for me. It’s a nice product. Smells really good, nice light consistency, goes on smooth and absorbs quickly, very hydrating. It’s definitely a good experience and a good product. I just didn’t see any real improvement to my skin. Add the price and it makes me feel like there are better options for hydrating eye products. If you’re looking to splurge it may be worth the high end experience, but probably not for me. Nothing Too Exciting
