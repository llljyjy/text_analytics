I have received samples to test out and give my opinions. First off I love the texture and how it doesn’t leave it feeling super heavy under my eyes. It’s very much like a liquid consistency. It has fragrance to it so if you don’t like that you may not like this product, I on the other hand don’t mind it. I feel like I have noticed a difference with my darkness but not so much with my fine lines under my eyes. I have not had any irritation on my part either. Received samples to test out
