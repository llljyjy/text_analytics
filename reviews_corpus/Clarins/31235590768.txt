The clarins double serum tester was for 7 days. You are supposed to fold, press, mix and apply the serum to your face daily for the best results. The serum contains turmeric which is beneficial for the skin. While it feels very soft when you apply it to the skin, you would need more than the 7 days to notice a difference in fine lines. It absorbed well into the skin and has a light fragrance to it.#gotitfree Clarins Double Serum
