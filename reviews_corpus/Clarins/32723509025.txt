really like this serum. It feels lightweight and hydrating. After using it for a few days, I noticed my pores seemed smaller and my skin looked brighter and healthier in general. It also seemed to smooth and soften texture when applying it as part of my usual skin routine before makeup. I don’t have major issues with wrinkles and fine lines so I’m not sure if this will help in terms of anti-aging, although I could see this plumping and brightening skin over time for a more youthful appearance overall. Definitely a must try for anyone who enjoys luxury serums Perfect
