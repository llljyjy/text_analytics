I have been using this product for a week now. It’s very expensive, but you only need the size of a pin drop. It has a ointment like feel to it. It goes on easy but like some other users have said, it doesn’t seem to absorb well into the skin. When I wake up in the morning I still feel some residue under my eyes. Honestly, I haven’t noticed much of a change after using for one week. It does seem to minimize fine lines ever so slightly. I’m going to continue to use and hope that prolong do usage provides greater results. Jury still out
