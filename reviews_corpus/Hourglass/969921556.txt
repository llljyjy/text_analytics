This eye mask was gifted by Hourglass for my review. To be honest, I feel like this doesn’t do very much for me, which is disappointing considering the price tag. It feels good upon application, gives some hydration, and I think that the overall eye area appears more plump after use, but I feel like it’s really subtle and there are products that are half the price that do more. I do appreciate the large size of the tube, so it will definitely lasts a while.  It’s just ok for me. Just ok
