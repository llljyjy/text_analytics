I’ve been needing an under eye treatment because of the dark circles and puffiness I’ve been getting from lack of sleep due to work. This eye mask by Hourglass is the perfect remedy for me. It comes in an easy to use tube and is a nice gel texture. It feels soothing when I apply it and not super tacky! I usually leave it on overnight as I sleep so I wake up the next day looking more refreshed! nan
