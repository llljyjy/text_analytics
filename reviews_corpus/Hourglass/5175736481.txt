Such a a creamy velvet texture. Unlike any eye cream I’ve ever used! It layers nicely with no pilling. I’ve worn it by leaving it on instead of a mask and I’ve even layered it over thinner eye “creams” and it feels like it seals everything in nicely. It also have a filling effect to it. Pairs lovely under makeup. Love it!
