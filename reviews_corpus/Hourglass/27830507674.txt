This was gifted to me complimentary from Hourglass for review. My main skincare concern is anti aging, especially around my eyes. After applying morning and night,I found this eye cream worked to firm my undereyes and helped the appearance to look smoother. I like the pointy applicator which distributed the right amount of product without cross-contamination. nan
