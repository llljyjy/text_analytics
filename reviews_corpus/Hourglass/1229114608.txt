Hourglass gifted me the Equilibrium Instant Plumping Eye Mask to test, honest opinions are my own. This lightweight gel type formula does indeed hydrate, plump up and smooths out my 41 year old under-eyes.At $68 for 30mL of product, yes the Equilibrium Instant Plumping Eye Mask is on the expensive side but a little goes a long ways and it also does double duty as an excellent under-eye primer. You will get MANY uses out of this tube since you only need to apply a super thin layer on cleansed skin.I can use it as:before bed as Overnight Eye Maskin the morning as Eye Cream and a wonderful Under-eye PrimerI love how it helps depuff and wakes up my morning eyes. It also creates a great primer base for my no makeup makeup looks â€” color corrector, concealer and/or foundation stays put smoothly around my eyes. nan
