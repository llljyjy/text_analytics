There are many ways to use this plumping eye mask. You can use a little or a lot. I used it as an overnight treatment mask or a mini 15-minute treatment. I also used it when I felt like my under eyes needed hydration or under my makeup to give a softer look and to help reduce the appearance of fine lines. I enjoyed the many ways to help my eyes look softer and smoother. This gives great hydration which helped me to see a plumping effect. Great hydration
