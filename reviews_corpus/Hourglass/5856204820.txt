Gifted by hourglass. This is a great product that can be worn with or without makeup. I find that the consistency is thin but a little goes a long way. I use this mainly as a primer under my eyes before concealer. I find that it adds a nice amount of hydration but nothing greasy. It doesnâ€™t interact with my concealer either. nan
