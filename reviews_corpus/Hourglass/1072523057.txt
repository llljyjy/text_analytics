I have dermatitis around the eyes and they cry a lot from being sensitive and dry. I react to most eye creams and cant wear concealer because it flakes. This has been a game changer. The skin around my etes is super taught, smooth and hydrated. I was suspicious because this is not a skincare brand- but the quality of their makeup seems to have crossed over. GAME CHANGER
