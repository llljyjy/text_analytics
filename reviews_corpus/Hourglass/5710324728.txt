This is very hydrating and rich without feeling heavy. It’s like a thick gel and feels amazing under the eyes. I apply it right before I start my makeup and by the time I get to concealer my undereyes are smooth and hydrated. My concealer wears better when I use this I don’t wipe it off and just tap in any excess. Pretty pricey but great product! Perfect for smooth concealer
