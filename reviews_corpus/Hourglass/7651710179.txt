Iâ€™m actually shocked with how much I like this. The gel formula feels really refreshing under the eyes. A lot of it gets absorbed but I end up washing off the rest as personal preference. The skin under my eyes is so baby soft and hydrated afterwards. I was actually really shocked the first time I tried it. nan
