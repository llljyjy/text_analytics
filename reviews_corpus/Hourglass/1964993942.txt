I received this complimentary from Hourglass and I absolutely love it. I run an Instagram account so I was able to try this, however I am also currently going through IVF which is a very emotional process and this has actually helped make my undereyes look better. You do need to rinse this off, it’s too thick to use as simply an eye cream, it’s definitely a mask. Helps so much!
