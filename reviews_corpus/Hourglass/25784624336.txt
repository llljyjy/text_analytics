WHOA. Wasn’t expecting this sort of performance from this simple yet elegant little jar. My pores? Diminished…. Texture? TOTALLY refined and smoothed and I’m talking post acne scarred skin…. Skin tone? Yep! Check…. Perfect…. Soft radiant glow that I swear makes you look like you just got a professional facial. Oh and that glow lasts literally all day and night. This deserves major hype really does what it promises and more. RESTORATIVE is an understatement. Super luxurious subtle smell that is fresh and pretty. This is definitely for thirsty skin… perfect as a thicker night cream as well, however if you use it with the cleanser and the essence it will have no problems absorbing for daytime. Seriously worth the $130 because you need way less than even a dime size for your whole face. This will last you more than 6 months for sure. LOVE! Gift from the Gods of skincare….
