Stings my eyes, which is the biggest downfall. Also, it doesn’t apply very easily. It’s thick. Based on the consistency, I’m pretty sure this is also a primer, which would explain why I’m breaking out more. It also doesn’t come with a cap, which means that it’s not easy to carry in bags. Anyways, definitely too expensive for what it’s worth. Won’t be repurchasing. Hurts eyes. Expensive. Very thick. Also a primer.
