I had high hopes for this eye mask because I have fine lines around my 47 year old eyes. It just didn’t live up to the hype. It moisturized my eyes well but that’s about all it did. I saw minimal plumping and no fading to the discoloration around my eyes. I would only recommend this as a night moisturizer for the eyes and don’t expect spectacular results. Misses the mark
