Bought this on a whim, quickly became a nighttime staple. I love this cream! I use it on my hands and elbows and love to use on my face as last step every night. I wake up w the SOFTEST skin and hydrated! Not oily or acne or anything. Perfect for winter, loving it. Def a new staple in my routine/nightstand. Love the versatility nan
