First of all, love the pink! This is a nice thick cream, definitely almost a body butter texture and not watery at all. Upon application, you can feel the thick creaminess but it’s not greasy or oily and absorbs into my skin easily. It felt pretty instantly hydrating and would definitely be an ideal winter moisturizer for me as someone with dry skin. While I haven’t noticed any reduction in fine lines, my skin does feel more plump. The smell is not my favorite (kind of a strong rosy/bitter scent to me personally) but honestly not that big of a dealbreaker.  I like the idea of using this on my “off days” from using tretinoin as a more gentle and moisturizing option Very rich and moisturizing!
