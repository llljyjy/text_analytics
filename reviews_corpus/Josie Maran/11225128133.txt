I was gifted by Josie Maran this product and I definitely recommend it. I used it a few days after getting a spray tan and it is very light weight, doesnâ€™t leave a white cast, blends easily, and a little goes a long way. I only needed to use one pump for each arm, leg etc and I felt like it covered everything. I will be using this all summer long! Easy to Blend
