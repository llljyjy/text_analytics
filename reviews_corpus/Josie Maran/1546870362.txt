This moisturizer contains a high factor mineral sunscreen, which is great for protecting the skin daily without the use of chemicals. Josie Maran is always known for very clean formulas, which I really appreciate because I know I’m using harmful chemicals on my skin. While it has a high SPF, the formula leaves no white cast on my tan skin tone and leaves me totally protected. The formula is hydrating but lightweight and it helps fight against environmental stressors that can aging. The texture is really beautiful and it applies very smoothly on the skin. It had a light lotion texture that blends into the skin easily. It works really well under makeup or alone. The squalene really helps to nourish my skin and refine its texture. It’s also packed with antioxidants for protecting and repairing the skin from damage. Gifted by Josie Maran. Lightweight Daily Protection
