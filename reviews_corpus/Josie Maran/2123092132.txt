Pros:- no white cast (FYI the  Josie Maran Argan Daily Moisturizer Tinted SPF 47 Protect + Perfect STILL gives white cast for my darker skinned beauts)- no irritation- good ingredients- physical sunscreenCons:- pilling, pilling, pilling. Basically you can only use this if youâ€™re not going to wear any makeup over and even then, it still pills.- only SPF 33 (the Josie Maran Argan Daily Moisturizer Tinted is spf 47)For 46 dollars for 2 oz of spf, i would expect NO cons. Pros and Cons but for $46 for spf..
