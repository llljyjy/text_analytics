This is absolutely heavenly! I’ve tried A LOT of high end SPFs lately & texture/scent wise, this is my favorite by far! It smells faintly of exotic fruit in the most delicious way, hydrates my dry skin & leaves it feeling soft & plump, not sticky or greasy. And it does not seem to leave any white cast that I can detect (although I haven’t tried it with flash photography). The bottle isn’t the prettiest but it’s dark glass & I love that. The ONLY complaint I have is the coconut oil… Why oh why?! It hasn’t broken me out YET, but I know it’s a pore clogging ingredient & a lot of people have acne issues already. So as much as I’m LOVING the formula, I wish it wasn’t in there. I’m deducting 1 star for it not being non-comedogenic. But if coconut oil agrees with your skin, look no further… This is your PERFECT SPF!*gifted by Josie Maran AMAZING!!! But… Coconut oil >.<
