I’ve been using this for a week on a beach vacation. I love the lightweight consistency and the smell is fruity. It covers well without a noticeable white cast. I did sweat it off after a hike. It’s not water resistant. It’s perfect for a day outside shopping or everyday use. I wouldn’t use this at the beach or on a hike. It’s kept me from getting burned which is rule 1 with an SPF. I was gifted by Josie Maran. nan
