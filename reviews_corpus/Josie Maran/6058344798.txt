I really love this sunscreen. It’s like sunscreen, highlighter and moisturizer all in one product. Unlike many sunscreens, it doesn’t leave this nasty thick white cast. In fact, it’s super lightweight and it makes my skin so glowy! It lights it up just a tad. It is very easy to apply this product evenly and makeup that goes on top doesn’t cake. It also keeps my skin hydrated, which is a huge plus. exceptional
