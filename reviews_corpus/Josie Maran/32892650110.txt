I’m super pleased with this product! It smells really lovely but not like your typical sunscreen. The texture is more like sunscreen but is lightweight and blends in well. It doesn’t disturb my makeup and dries well. The most important factor is that there’s no white cast which I love! This was gifted by Josie Maran but I would purchase myself. Great sunscreen!
