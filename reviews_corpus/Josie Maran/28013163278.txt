I’ve been taking a 2 month break from retinol after heavy use for about 2 years, and this was the first serum I’ve used since my break. I started by using it 2 nights a week but have increased usage to every other night, and I have to say this is my new favorite nighttime serum. My skin is so much brighter and clearer, and my hyperpigmentation is healing so much faster. A little goes a long way, and my skin absorbs the oily serum very easily, and leaves my skin looking glossy and bright, despite absorbing like an oil. I’m a huge fan of this and my skin looks so much younger than it did when I began use 3 weeks ago. Love that it’s also cruelty-free, vegan, and comes in recyclable packaging! nan
