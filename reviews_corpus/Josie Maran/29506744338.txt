I have eczema and this has not made me break out at all! I also love that it has SPF in it while not making my skin dry, which tends to happen when I use sunscreen. I have never really used tinted moisturizer before because my skin is so sensitive, but this is a great product!! Sheer moisturizer great for eczema-prone skin!
