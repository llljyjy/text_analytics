This is such a nice face cream omg. I love Josie Marian’s body creams, especially during the winter when my skin is really dry. This feels just like their body creams in the sense that it’s just as hydrating, but not too thick that it’ll make your makeup pill. I can’t wait to see the long term effects of using this! nan
