This creamy oil is so unique and I really enjoy using it. I love that it is so hydrating and that it can be used anywhere that needs it, including my face. The texture changes when you start the rub it in and becomes so soft and creamy. My skin feels nourished and soft when I use this. I highly recommend! This was gifted by Josie Maran.
