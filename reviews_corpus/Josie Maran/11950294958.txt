I received this complimentary from Josie Maran in exchange for a review, so here it is - finding an mineral-based, weightless, non-tacky SPF that doesn’t actually leave a white cast on the skin is tough (hence why I usually end up opting for a chemical SPF even though I would prefer it to be mineral). This one really delivers - it doesn’t feel heavy in the slightest, and really does blend down/absorb leaving zero white cast whatsoever. I love that in addition to sun protection, this SPF is loaded with antioxidants and skin-nourishing ingredients. I love that you get 2oz - on average I spend around the same for the 1.7oz of product. Least to say, I’ll be getting more of this when I run out. No White Cast + Feels Weightless
