Its good mineral sunscreen with Kakadu super fruit and argan oil ..very light weight as it says milky consistency,doesnâ€™t make skin oily or greasy. No whitecaste at all. very hydrating gives a dewy finish, suits all skin type.oily skin peeps can skip moisturiser.complimentary from josie maran. Good option
