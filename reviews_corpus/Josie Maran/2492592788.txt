I bought this hoping itâ€™ll help the wrinkles around my eyes while working on the dark circles. Ive been using it for a month now, every night, sometimes mornings, and nothing. I wake up in the morning feeling dry around my eyes, yet I have to wipe them to get the creamy gunk off. The cream does not seem to soak in. Drying and leaves gunky residue
