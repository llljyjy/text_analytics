This C Serum is so smooth and gentle it’s been an instant part of my routine. I apply right after cleansing and toning, followed by moisturizer, (oil if needed) and an SPF. This was not too harsh on my fair sensitive skin, and a little goes a long way! I’m incredibly impressed by Josie Marian products after buying a travel kit to sample over the holidays; the whipped face butter is smooth and lightweight! The word butter gave me the impression this would have been thick or greasy and it’s exact opposite. It’s fantastic for a morning routine and lays velvety smooth as a makeup base. The Argan Oil is also divine and perfect for face massage, gua sha / rolling in. I will be purchasing these all again! LOVE this C Serum!
