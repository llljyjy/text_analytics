Love this serum! I got a 3ml sample from my online order. I was initially hesitant to use it as it looked like an oil and i have a sensitive dry combination skin. But then one day I decided to try it. It was an oil but surprisingly not “oily”. I only required 3-4 drops from the amazingly cute but functional dropper bottle for my full face. I applied at night underneath a moisturizer. Yes i still required a moisturizer coz like i said it wasn’t really oily when applied. My face was smooth in the morning! The tiny bottle goes a long way. I have already used it 5 times and there is almost half left. That is good news because this is VERY expensive! I will the price was lower coz i really love this product. It absolutely did not break me out which was another reason i was initially hesitant to use this because i har only tried retinol a couple of times before and it broke me out. I know this is normal for retinol but i felt I wasn’t ready to include into my skin care yet. But with this serum i don’t have to worry about it. Its perfect for those starting out on retinol. I feel pro-retinol is best when you don’t really have so many wrinkles. I do have acne scars though and i feel that this serum is helping. Would I buy this? Definitely!!! When i can afford it lol! I think this is the perfect pro- retinol starter product for all skin types :) Perfect starter retinol even for sensitive skin
