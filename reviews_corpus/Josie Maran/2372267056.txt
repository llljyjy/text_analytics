I don’t often get excited about new moisturizers because you don’t see a dramatic difference in your skin typically just from changing that one step, but this is one of the few exceptions that I’ve experienced! I could immediately see a difference in my skin, in terms of the bounciness, and overall health of my skin, as well as my fine lines and dark spots, looking slightly diminished after a few weeks! I also love the ingredients in this product they’re effective, but still very gentle! So good!
