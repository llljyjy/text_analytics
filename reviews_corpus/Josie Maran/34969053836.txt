I am familiar with the Josie Maran body cream, but have never used a face product from the brand. I was intrigued by how thick & rich this cream is; it reminds me of panna cotta or thick pudding! it’s so soft & creamy. I was slightly worried it would be too oily for me (I’m combo to dry, sometimes very dry in winter), but it is the PERFECT night cream - it keeps my skin moisturized all night long, and I wake up with the silkiest, plumpest, bounciest skin! It’s truly the night cream I’ve been searching for! I don’t know about the retinol effects - I’m a regular retinol user so I’m not sure if I’ll be able to see any effect from a plant-based retinol, but time will tell. The only thing I don’t love is the smell - it’s unscented so the smell of the sunflower oil is detectable, and I’d prefer a fragrance. Otherwise, perfection! New favorite night cream!
