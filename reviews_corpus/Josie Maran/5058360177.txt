I received this product complimentary from Josie Maran. Easily one of my favorite new sunscreens for my face. It doesn’t leave the white cast on my skin, applies evenly and smoothly and works well with my makeup routine. It is a thinner formula than I’m used to, but nothing that would deter me from using it. It has a light tropical fruit scent to me that is very pleasant, but if you are sensitive to any scent, I thought I would mention that aspect.Works well and I’ll continue using. I do wish it had a higher SPF though. Works incredibly well
