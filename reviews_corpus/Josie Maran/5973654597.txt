Ummm this might be my new favorite spf product! it feels like a super light moisturizer, not quite liquids but definitely that water-based feeling. Nice semi-dewy finish and leaves the skin super hydrated. Doesn’t even feel like I have spf on, so sunscreen/sun milk/whatever we should call it, I love it!! Gifted by Josie maran but I’m definitely repurchasing A must-have lightweight SPF
