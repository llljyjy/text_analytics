#josiemarangiftedme their Get Even Sun Milk broad spectrum SPF33 I’m loving this pump sunscreen. This is a 100% mineral sunscreen SPF33. It leaves no white cast & it has a nice scent and it’s lightweight, non-greasy. This is multi-tasking as it works as an every day SPF, a light moisturizer, or as a hydrating, protective primer.  LOVE multi-tasking products!  It’s light enough to layer under makeup and over other skincare products.  My skin feels moisturized and it leaves a beautiful sheer finish after applying it. (see last pic) It’s a really good product to add to my routine! Amazing product!
