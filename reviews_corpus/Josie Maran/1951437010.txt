This moisturizer is so buttery and hydrating on my dry winter skin! My skin is also pretty sensitive and this doesn’t break it out or cause any bad reactions at all. My skin feels so silky and soft, and I noticed less texture just one day after using it! Makeup wears beautifully over it, and I notice less pores. I’ve only been using it for a week, but I can’t wait to see long term results! Leaves skin with less texture
