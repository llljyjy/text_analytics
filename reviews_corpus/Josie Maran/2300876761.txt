There’s a lot of things I like about this product— it smells great, the consistency is nice, and it didn’t feel heavy on my skin. The problem was though that under my makeup, it made me look so pale because of the white cast. I know this isn’t supposed to be an issue with this product, but I definitely noticed a difference compared to my daily spf. This product was gifted by Josie Maran but all opinions are my own. Great Spf but made me look very white!
