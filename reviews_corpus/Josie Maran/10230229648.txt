I have really been enjoying this serum because it has helped with my dull, textured skin without being to harsh on my sensitive skin. I have noticed a lot of my texture even out and I’m excited to continue using this product. I love that it’s cruelty free and vegan as well. I use it 2-3x a week. This product was gifted by Josie Maran. nan
