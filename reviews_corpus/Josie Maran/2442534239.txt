Besides the glow, my skin is more even and the fine lines around the eyes and lips from the constant weather changes/skin dryness is finally diminishing after adding this serum to my routine. I have sensitive  eczema prone skin but I didn’t get any irritation nor breakouts (acne prone as well) from this serum! Main reason why I got attracted to this brand/serum is because it’s vegan, cruelty free and it comes in a recyclable package. nan
