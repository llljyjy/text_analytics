Josie Maran Argan Pro-Retinol Mega Moisture Cream is a really good product. The texture of this cream is thicker than I’m used to for my combination skin, but I didn’t have any reaction to it. It has a very light scent that dissipates quickly and didn’t trigger any migraines (which a lot of products can do). I noticed my skin to be more plump, and fine lines slightly improved (I’ve only used this product for a week).  I would recommend this product to anyone with fry to combo skin, I’m not sure if it would be too heavy for oily skin. A bit heavier than expected
