I love anything by Josie Maran, because the products work! They always benefit my skin in so many ways! I was so excited to try this new creamy argon oil by them! This is must have cream to keep on hand all year round but especially during the winter time! It helps with dryness, uneven texture and elasticity. I tend to get patches of dry skin and this helps so much with keeping my skin fully moisturized. I love that the cream can literally be used anywhere on the skin and works so well! Love this cream - a must have!
