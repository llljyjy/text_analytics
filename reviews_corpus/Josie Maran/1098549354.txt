I’d give this 3.5 stars because it ends up pilling on me after I’ve applied it and it’s set a bit into my skin. Anything I layer on after makes pilling happen on a slight level. It’s not as bad in this arena as the Tatcha poreless sunscreen, which pills like crazy on me, but this is why as much as I wanted to love this new sunscreen from Josie, I can’t give it the 4 or 5 stars I would’ve liked to give. The formula is hydrating and silky and smells fantastic. I know I’m getting protection with great ingredients. Hope it works even better for others as it’s a great formula from an excellent company! No irritation on eyes or skin. 3.5 stars
