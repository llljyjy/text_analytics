I use tretinoin and I can say the sun protection this provides is top notch even without reapplying every 2 hours. I’m outside a lot for work and this stuff adheres really well to my skin even when I sweat- I don’t think its waterproof but it does stick throughout the day. I don’t always have the chance to reapply (even though I should), so this is great especially as my initial daily sunscreen application. This is also one of the rare sunscreens that doesn’t completely break my skin out if I leave it on all day everyday! PS if you don’t like the oiliness, I recommend very lightly setting it with setting/ finishing powder. Pure sun protection!
