I am in my mid-30â€™s and wanted a retinol eye cream but was very skeptical. The sephora employee recommended this one as it is all from plants! I was skeptical of the texture but the sephora employee told me to warm it up then press under the eyes. WOW. It didnt irritate and I have VERY sensitive eyes. It was hydrating which was surprising and after 7 days I noticed my darkness and fine lines and wrinkles getting smaller . retinol that doesn't burn, results after a week
