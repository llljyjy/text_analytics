This is hands down the best product from the Josie Maran brand that I have tried. I am 32 years old and although my wrinkles have not yet made a noticeable appearance I do struggle with extremely dry skin in the winter months. This cream has nourished my skin and added a suppleness and brightness that I have not had in months! The packaging is right up my alley, I love the pink color. The formula itself is thick and luxurious and it absorbs into my skin efficiently every time. I use a nickel sized amount for my entire face three times a week before bed and my skin has looked the best it had in a long long time! Best Josie Maran Cream Ever
