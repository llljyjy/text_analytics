My skin feels replenished after using this cream! I use it on my really dry spots such as my elbows and knees and it keeps them moisturized all day long. This cream gives me a much deeper level of moisture than I get with other moisturizers.  I love the texture and would recommend this product to anyone looking for a cream to help with dryness! nan
