I love that this is nourishing but not too heavy. The pink whipped texture is beautiful and It’s great for my dry/dehydrated skin! It’s has no added fragrance  making it perfect for sensitive skin. This has really helped with reducing the appearance of my dehydration lines underneath my eyes. It’s refreshing and I like to use most  pm! I love that my skin feels softer after use and has a reduction in fine lines. My skin also appears brighter! No greasy, sticky, or heavy feeling after use. I love the ingredients in this formula! Nourishing, brightening, reduces dehydration lines
