I had bought the vitamin c serum and loved it so I had high hopes for this one but it was a no. It sits really heavy on your skin and never really absorbs. I saw no difference in my skin at all after a month of use, plus it broke me out along my hairline (as someone who rarely gets breakouts). Moisturizes but thatâ€™s it
