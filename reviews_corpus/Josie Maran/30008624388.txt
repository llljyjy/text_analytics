I received this complimentary from Josie Maran to test and review - I like this serum a lot so far!! I love the texture and feel of it on my skin. Its very smooth and layers with other products really well. It is gentle, but still effective! My skin looks so glowy and feels so soft after using this! Great retinol serum!
