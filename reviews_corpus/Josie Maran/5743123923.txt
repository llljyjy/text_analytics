Extremely overpriced for what it is. I got it on sale and am still asking myself if it was even worth $20. I typically use Dermalogica which is amazing. It’s pricey but worth it. This cream just doesn’t do anything to improve my skin. Just meh. It doesn’t irritate my skin or break it out. But it also doesn’t moisturize for that long either.  I would skip this and go for a different prestige brand. overpriced and average
