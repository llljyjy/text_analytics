This is a lovely, medium-thick formula perfect for dry, winter skin. It’s fragrance-free which I appreciate but does have a light natural smell to it which I don’t mind. I definitely noticed how plump my skin looked and how soft it felt after applying and had no irritation at all. I’m really excited to see what this does for my skin with long-term use. Rich and hydrating
