The instructions say to use 2-4 drops, but I recommend using it has a spot treatment for your dark spots during the day time. It’s not easy to blend across your entire face, and if you use more drops, it is very greasy like an oil. At night time, I don’t mind the greasiness, as it absorbs by the time I wake up. I have super dry skin also, so I can’t imagine how this would feel on oily skin. Just try to test out the formula first and find what works for you. Formula feels more like an oil than a serum
