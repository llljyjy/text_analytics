Most oils, in fact most skincare products break me out eventually, but the two times I’ve used Argan oil for extended periods it has calmed my skin down completely. Hydration is adequate, although not as potent as an actual moisturizer and yet it’s not oily - any Argan oil on the surface of my face has more or less vanished within half an hour or so of application. Coming from someone who has very oily skin, this is quite unbelievable! The very first time I tried, it was straight after a reaction to Clinique’s DDMG. I didn’t expect I could get away with using this on my face but it was literally the only thing available to me at that moment that was fragrance-free and natural. I cautiously applied a couple of drops to my flaky forehead on a night and checked the mirror first thing in the morning. What a surprise! No bumps, no increase in flakiness and my skin felt less tight. I then thought “what the heck“ and used a few more drops that morning. I did this every AM and PM. Each passing day my skin became restored more and more to its former condition - clear, flake free and breakout free. I eventually stopped using it only because my skin was ’reset’ and I was itching to try some new products again (nothing new there!). Also perfect for adding shine to my hair (a couple of drops) daily and on cuticles.
