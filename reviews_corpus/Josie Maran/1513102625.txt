Wow.  This is AMAZING!   It’s as if Charlotte Tilbury’s Wonder Glow had a baby with glossier future dew and a nice sunscreen.   No real coverage but lovely light sheen ( not as much as glow screen) and does not sting around eyes.   Think soft candlelight, and so very easy to incorporate into a routine.   I have dry, mature skin, and this is perfect.   Oil base6d but soaks in quickly. Color is a translucent peach, which for me just adds some warmth to pale skin.  So glad I bought this.  I see myself using this for a long time.  Think it will be great to travel with. Candle- Lit Warmth
