I received this product complimentary  from Josie Maran. I was surprised at how lightweight this sunscreen is. It goes on smooth and does not leave a white cast. The scent is light, so it it not overpowering. It absorbs quickly into your skin and leaves a nice glow that feels very hydrating. The product comes in a glass bottle which is nice, and the pump on the bottle is helpful. Nice
