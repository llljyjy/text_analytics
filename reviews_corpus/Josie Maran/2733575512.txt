I’m a huge spf wearer…it’s in my face everyday even if I don’t leave the house. I’m pretty picky about my spf too. Anyways, I love the formula of this one and how lightweight it is. It sits well on top of my skincare and under makeup without leaving a white cast. It feels like a serum on the skin and I’m really enjoying it. Gifted by Josie Maran. nan
