Gifted by Josie Maran! Have been using this daily since I got it and it’s my new go to! I haven’t found a sunscreen I LOVE enough to use everyday until this came along. It’s light, thin but still soft & creamy, and leaves absolutely no whitecast. Almost reminds me more of a serum/moisturizer hybrid than a sunscreen. Love it so much! nan
