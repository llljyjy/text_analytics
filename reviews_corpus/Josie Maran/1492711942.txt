I’m really enjoying this retinoid serum that was gifted by Josie Maran at the moment. The texture glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly. I have been using it as a part of my nighttime routine, after cleansing and before my moisturizer. I love that this serum is vegan and cruelty free, it’s also so great that it comes in recyclable packaging. The best part is the serum itself that’s incredibly gentle on the skin. Very pleasant to use
