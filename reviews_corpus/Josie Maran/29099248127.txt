One of the best Mineral Sunscreens (gifted by Josie Maran) I have tried lately.  No white cast and leaves the skin feeling so smooth. It gives a slight blurring effect as well. I loved how It sat under makeup..no pilling at all. Has a blend of skin-loving oils that my combination skin loves. I am not sure how it would work for super oily skin esp in summers. nan
