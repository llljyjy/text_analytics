I have been using this sunscreen every day for close to two months and I have had no issues. I have combination skin which is very oily in the warmer weather and I have not had issues with being oily using this. I look glowy and NO WHITE CAST. I also hate sunscreen smell so this smell is amazing. ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ 10/10
