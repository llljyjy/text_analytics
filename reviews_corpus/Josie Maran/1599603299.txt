This was gifted by Josie Maran which was perfect for me because I live in florida and am a mom of two! We are constantly on the go and go to the beach or pool multiple times a week! I have done tried hard to find the perfect sun protection to add to my daily face routine. This Josie Maran Get Even Sun Milk has been amazing! The texture is super lightweight, is perfect alone or on top of all my products. It leaves a nice dewy glow but no white tint and no greasy feeling like other sunscreens. It left my skin super hydrated and lasted all day! So hydrating and not greasy!
