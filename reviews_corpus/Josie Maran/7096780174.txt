This is so versatile that it’s a necessity! I’m able to use this before makeup, and then in my brows to give a polished look. I also use this on my elbows because they get dry and this makes them look and feel so much better. It isn’t greasy or gross feeling, it only takes a small amount and it rubs out nicely, plus it has a nice subtle scent that’s almost citrus like. Definitely recommend if you’re looking for something thick and moisturizing that has a ton of different uses. So versatile
