The New Josie Maran Pro-Retinol Megamoisture Face Cream is a rich, nourishing and very moisturizing product.It contains unique ingredients such as Pink Algae-Derived Pro-Retinol: ​A plant-based retinoid that’s clinically proven to reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles without irritation.This means there isn’t any actual retinol in this cream but a plant extract that is more gentle.This is perfect for those with skin sensitivity who cannot use retinol creams/serums.I like it, especially for winter. Such a great addition!
