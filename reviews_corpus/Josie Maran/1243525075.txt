I love how versatile the Argan Infinity Cream Intensive Creamy Oil is. I can use it at night on my face on top of my skincare products to lock in moisture; I can use it on my hands that get dry in Winter; I can rub a small amount in my hands and apply on my hair to tame the frizz etc. I can even use it on my lips. I like the consistency  of this product. Great to have on hands. So many uses
