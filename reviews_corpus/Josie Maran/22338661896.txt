I love this Josie Maran Face Cream.  It’s a mega wrinkle smoothing cream that has hydrated my skin in the short time I have used it. There is no irritation while I used this cream. It is fluffy like a souffle texture. It absorbed quickly and wasn’t sticky. I noticed it also helped my fine lines around my mouth and eyes. I use it twice a day, morning and night as my last step to my routine.  It brightens my skin and I see a smoother skin tone within a few days of using this also. My skin feels really good, and it has a skin barrier that is great for the Winter months. I love this brand and everything they make has really helped nourish my skin. Perfect for the Winter months
