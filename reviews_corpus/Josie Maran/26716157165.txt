I was gifted my Josie Maran for an honest review. This is the first time I’m using retinoid in a serum form. It’s easy to apply and spreads easily. I like the finishing feel after applying that helps me feel I can start and end the day without adding makeup on my skin later. That said I feel like it does the work but it isn’t the strongest beta retinoid out there. For a more mature skin maybe the prescribed retinoids would work better. I felt no breakouts of over drying of any sort. Good beginner retinoid
