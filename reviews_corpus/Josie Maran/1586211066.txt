My favorite moisturizer. Very nourishing, hydrating and makes the skin look vibrant, nourished, and amazing. Iâ€™ve purchased this for a long time. I tried every moisturizer and this is my fav at sephora. It does not contain silicones which is why i love it so much. It actually absorbs into the skin and just feeds it. Great for daytime and at night I mix with an argan oil and use after treatment serums. I wake up w the most glowing beautiful skin. Great for summer and winter. Feels incredibly luxurious and amazing. nan
