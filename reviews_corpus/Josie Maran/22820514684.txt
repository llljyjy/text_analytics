Gifted by Josie Marian, absolutely blown away by the lightweight feel and coverage of this sunscreen! I have combination/sensitive skin and so sunscreen is a MUST. I took this with me over spring break and used it everyday! It blended so well and was basically undetectable underneath my makeup. It lasted all day and felt confident that my skin was being protected. Highly recommend! Highly recommend
