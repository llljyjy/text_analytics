I bought this a while ago and found it to not absorb much into my skin (combo, acne prone, sensitive), so I ended up returning it for that reason. But man did I miss the feeling I’d get whenever I put it on my face! The smell is subtle and rly nice, and massaging my face with this oil feels like some sort of spa experience. It’s so soft and relaxing, I don’t know how else to explain it. So, after months of thinking about it, I bought it again. It still doesn’t absorb but the luxury of the experience, and how nice and soft it leaves my skin, makes it worth it. The best feeling!
