Iâ€™ve never tried any products like the Get Even Sun Milk! This was gifted by Josie Maran, I was super excited because I NEED to wear SPF and I seen great reviews. I love how light weight and easy this was to blend into my skin! My skin felt hydrated and looked smoother, in my opinion. I love that there was no white cast too! SPF is a must!
