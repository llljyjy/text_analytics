It is light, spreads easily on the skin, has a very mild scent, gives a natural glow to the skin.  Does not leave the skin white.  My skin is dry and even then it got a little sticky right after using it, with time the skin absorbs the product better and that feeling decreases.  At 36 years old Iâ€™m preferring this type of sunscreen that moisturizes the skin well. A great sunscreen.
