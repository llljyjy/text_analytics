This product, which I was gifted by Josie Maran, is amazing! It isn’t like your ordinary sunscreen leaves your face feeling sticky and white. It is exactly as it name suggests, milky. It soaked right into my skin and didn’t leave any white or sticky residue. Application was super easy and the product leaves my skin feeling amazing! Loved it!
