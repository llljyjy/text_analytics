To start off I have been using this for a few days and I absolutely love the feeling it gives my skin under makeup! Very soft and hydrating. It also hasn’t broken me out (which plenty of SPFs are known for), so that is one of the biggest things I look for in a SPF. It also has a very nice, kind of sweet, smell. I have really been enjoying this product! It was gifted by Josie Maran and I couldn’t be happier! Beautiful SPF !
