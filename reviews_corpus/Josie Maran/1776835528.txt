Seriously, Josie Maran does it again! I’m a sunscreen snob and this one absolutely fits the bill. It’s my favorite kind, a milky sunscreen, with a lightweight formula that allows me to easily apply another layer. Once applied it makes skin look hydrated, luminous and healthy. No white cast here. It also contains SPF 33 which I think is good for everyday, especially if I am going to layer it with a foundation or tinted moisturizer that also contains SPF. 10/10 on this one — complimentary from Josie Maran If milky sunscreen is your thing!
