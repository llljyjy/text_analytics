I received this complimentary from Josie Maran. This is such a great serum that seeps so well into my skin. I really love to incorporate this into my skin in the night time because I feel it just slicks on the best at this time. The serum ilfeels much like an oil and I feel my skin just captures its benefits more at night. I love the argan oil in this cruelty free and vegan recyclable packages serum because it makes my skin look more radiant and softer.  The serum also feels different from the other because I feel as if I can apply this with few products or just more and always get amazing results. This definitely helps with wrinkles and helping the skin barrier look healthier again. What a serum
