I wanted a sunscreen that was reef safe, looked and felt like wearing nothing on my skin, and provided the sun protection it promised. I purchased this after having issues with another brand that was supposed to be all of these things but let me down after giving it several months of wear. Some sunscreens felt okay but weren’t reef safe. Others were reef safe but irritated my skin or felt heavy. This one meets all of my needs so far. I ordered the small size bottle a week ago and have just ordered the full size. Even after walking two miles in 90+ degree weather with high humidity, my skin feels great. My S.O. even marveled that I didn’t have white streaks running down my face “like I usually do.“ Ha! I just ordered another bottle.
