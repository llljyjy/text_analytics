This serum is a gold colored oil without any synthetic dye and fragrance. Love that about it. It’s also vegan and cruelty free. The oil is slippy but absorbs relatively easily. It’s meant to make skin look brighter and smoother in 24 hours. I didn’t immediately notice differences but the ingredients look good, I think it’s worth trying long term if oil serums are your type of products! nan
