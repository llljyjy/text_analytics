Jodie Maran can do no wrong when it comes to hydrating products! This oil is super thin and comfortable, but extra nourishing. I love to put it on my lips, eye crinkles, and the backs of my hands. But the list is so long of all the uses. Brows, razor burn, split ends, mixing with a powder to create cute glosses. This is a must have product that youâ€™ll use for a million different things!
