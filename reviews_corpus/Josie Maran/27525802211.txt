I just love how many different uses this has! It’s a product that you could definitely use in the winter and colder months because of how great this is for any dry areas. I love using this as a lip balm because it can even look like a gloss but it’s much more nourishing! I do wish this didn’t have any scent at all. It does have a slight citrus scent. Perfect for wintertime!
