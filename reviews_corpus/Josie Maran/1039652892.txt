Oh my gosh, this sunscreen is fantastic. I’ve been searching for a sunscreen that feels more like a skincare product than sunscreen, and this is that. Its so lightweight and easy to apply. Does not have a white caste and leaves my skin looking dewy and feeling moisturized. I’m in love. This was gifted by Josie Maran (thank you!) but I can already tell that I’ll be purchasing after I run out. I love it
