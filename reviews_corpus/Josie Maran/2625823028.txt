This product was complimentary from Josie Maran and I love discovering new sunscreens and this one definitely did not disappoint. It’s super lightweight, milky and leaves your skin dewy. I do love that my face didn’t feel sticky, filmy or chalky after application. This is one of my new go to sunscreens and will definitely be using for many years to come! Loved it!
