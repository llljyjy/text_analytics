This product looks so thick I was afraid it wouldn’t rub in well. It did rub in perfectly but didn’t feel extra moisturizing a few minutes later after my skin soaked it in. Also the smell just wasn’t something I liked. Overall it’s not a bad product just not meant for dry skin. Gave it a three because maybe it works better for others. Not for me
