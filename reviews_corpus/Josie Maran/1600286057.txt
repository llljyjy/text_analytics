I received a free 1 oz sample. Before my skin reacted, I thought the cleanser was nothing special. I have acne-prone skin but it’s extremely rare for me to have a bad reaction to a product, so this was unusual for me. I tried this cleanser on 2 occasions a few weeks apart. The 1st time I didn’t feel sure this cleanser was the issue, but after the 2nd time, now I am certain. Both times, my I ended up with a ton of (as in, at least 100) new, small bumps all over my face. It has been a week since the second time I used the cleanser and the bumps have persisted. It’s surprising since it’s obviously geared towards acne-prone skin. If only I knew which ingredient(s) triggered the problem, so that I could avoid it like the plague. I wish I could say “avoid this if you have sensitive skin“ but I don’t even consider my skin to be sensitive! So please, just avoid this cleanser, period. It’s not worth the risk. TERRIBLE REACTION :(
