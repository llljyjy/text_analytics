I bought this because my tatcha was not as hydrating during the winter. At first i was like meh it’s not doing anything. But i gave it some time to work and it’s so good! It didn’t clog my pores, it was hydrating enough, and a lile goes a long way! I still have more than half the jar and i bought this months ago. I’m not greasy or shiny, don’t cause me to break out, which is very important because my skin is sensitive. I use vitamin c serum as well and i have no problem layering this. Just an awesome product, I’ll continue to use during the spring and summer if the weather allows. Love this moisturizer!
