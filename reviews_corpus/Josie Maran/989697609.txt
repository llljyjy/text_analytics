I was on prescription strength retinol for some time and I liked it, but I wanted to try something more natural. Someone suggested this one from Josie Maran and I absolutely love it. I don’t see any different in results from my prescription and I don’t need to go to my dr to get it and I like that it’s more natural. A great alternative to prescription strength
