I’m really picky about sunscreens and only use mineral ones. The issue with those is you need to spend some time spreading the formula evenly so it doesn’t leave a white cast. Talking about Josie Maran - I’m really impressed with how easily this milky texture melts into my skin! It leaves beautiful silky finish and feels perfectly hydrating so I even skip my AM moisturizer with it. I’m also glad that despite being so hydrating this SPF doesn’t feel greasy on my oily skin. Wonderful product overall! Will be repurchasing for sure. My new go to!
