Honeslty I don’t think anyone needs this cream; you can get argan oil more cheaply. But this is one of the products I’ve re-purchased for years. The formulation feels so luxurious, it easily sinks into skin for just the right level of moisture that you can easily adjust by amount. The scent is very natural and it has never done anything but help my sensitive skin, especially in winter. I’ve also on occasion used it as an eye cream and my lashes and brows seem to benefit. Luxury but a worthwhile one
