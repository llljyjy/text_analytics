Not my favorite but I gave it 3 stars because it does what it’s meant to do just not the way it’s instructed and not as well as other similar products.  Directions as stated tell you to rub it over the skin with dry hands then wet and essentially lather but when you do it this way it is way too thick (may be personal preference) and it feels like your roughly rubbing honey into your skin.  That said if you wet your face first and then rub it into your skin it’s less this (still a lil thick and sticky thought) and it dissolves makeup a lot better but I have used plenty of different oil cleansers that work a lot better and aren’t as thick, they also can go right onto dry skin. Won't Repurchase
