Super rich and moisturizing cream from Josie Maran. It feels so hydrating and rich on the face that I forget it’s a retinol cream. So far it has not been irritating on the skin. I appreciate that this formula is so hydrating as I’m able to use it as my only moisturizer in this cold winter weather. nan
