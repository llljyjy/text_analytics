I’ve been looking for a good sun screen, and I am so happy I stumbled upon this one. It absorbs quickly and leaves absolutely zero white cast. I love that it’s light-weight and easily blends into my skin, leaving it feeling hydrated and supple.  I’m definitely a fan! It is gifted by Josie Maran, but all opinions are my own. One amazing sunscreen!
