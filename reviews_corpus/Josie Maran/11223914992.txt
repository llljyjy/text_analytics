This moisturizer is thick, but absorbs nicely into the skin and a little bit goes a long way. It leaves my skin feeling super hydrated and smooth. After using this product for a little while I’ve noticed a difference in my skin’s complexion, my skin texture has improved as well as my dark spots. nan
