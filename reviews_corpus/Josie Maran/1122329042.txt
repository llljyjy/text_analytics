I got this originally as a deluxe sample with a promo code from Sephora. At first, I wasn’t impressed because my skin didn’t feel squeaky clean after using it. However by the time I used up my sample, I realized my skin was looking better than before. This cleanser was the only part of my routine I had changed. I guess all this time I had been using cleansers too harsh for my skin type. I bought the full size and continue to have clear, bright skin. I didn’t see overnight results with this product but gradual improvement over time. Also, based on my experience compared to other reviews, this may be a better choice for dry to combo skin than oily skin. Good gentle cleanser
