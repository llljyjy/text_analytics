I donâ€™t normally write reviews but when something is great I had to share the knowledge! I suffer from the trifecta of under eye circles causes: hereditary, dust allergies and lack of sleep. I have literally tired just about everything from lasers to creams to prescriptions and this has been the first cream to actually give me longer sustainable results. The prescriptions work, but once they are done so are your results. I think the argan oil to seal is important for the moisture you loose with products that are too strong. I would definitely recommend!! BEST eye cream so far!
