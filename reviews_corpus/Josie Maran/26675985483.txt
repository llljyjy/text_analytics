The key is: a little bit goes a long way! I use it on my face after applying my moisturizer at night. Makes my face look amazing and glowy!! I apply it during the day too sometimes but not very often since I use sunscreen almost daily. It also made my cuticles look fresh. I even use it as a pre-poo treatment on my afro hair. It made my hair grew and my flaky-itchy scalp now stays fresh and healthy. Only downside which why I am giving it 4 stars: it is very expensive. The cold-press argan oil from The Ordinary is a good alternative but I am not sure if its vegan, fair trade and cruelty free like this one My go-to multi-purpose oil
