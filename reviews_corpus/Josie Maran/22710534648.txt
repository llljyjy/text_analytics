I like the formula - it’s lightweight and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. It doesn’t feel like it leaves a white cast that is great. Also, I finally found the SPF with a nice scent. Now that the sun is coming out more often, I know I’ll be reaching for this more frequently! Gifted by Josie Maran. nan
