I had no idea my cleanser was as harsh as it was. I used this one time and felt so clean but my skin was like butter and sooo hydrated. A little goes a long way with this cleanse too. Just a pea size will give you a great lather. I will most deff be purchasing this again. Left my skin like BUTTER smooth and silky
