All right first things first - **this is not a retinol product**.  I can see where the confusion comes from as the product is labeled “pro retinol”. But it’s neither retinol nor for pros; instead, Josie Maran is saying it’s an alternative to retinol that is based in pink algae. We as a community have GOT to do better with making sure we are conveying these kind of details correctly.Now for some details about the product. The first time I used this, I had SOOOOO much pilling. Frustrating. But, I didn’t want to just accept defeat, so I went back to the product the next day and realized my mistake. This is such a thick moisturizer that you have to use less than is intuitive. I think this is great in some ways - I’d prefer my moisturizers last me double the length of time to finish! This second time worked out much better, and my skin ended up feeling very well moisturized. I appreciate that as it’s cold and my skin is DRY. This product helped a ton with offsetting that dryness. On that note, with this feeling SO rich, I do wonder if my oily skin types will like this. Even with a tiny amount on my skin, I could definitely feel it.Now honestly, the  smell is a little odd, simply because there is no fragrance. I guess it’s…is that the algae? Alas, makes for a less irritating formula so I’m all right with it in the end.And one last thing: it’s a little pink. Not so much that it adds a tint to skin, but it was odd for me to get past it looking like a pink clay mask (y’all know what I mean?)TLDR: not retinol, heavy moisturizer, use a tiny amount!Hope this review helps ya not retinol, very heavy texture
