I tried to like this, because I like the brand, I used it several time since I had 2 deluxe sample and you need to use just a little bit of product. But it’s not for sensitive skin1rosacea, it accentuate my redness a lot after I used it. Also, the smell is really strange.Also, it doesn’t seem like a clean product, the EWG Skin Deep Score is 6. Don't recommend for sensitiive skin
