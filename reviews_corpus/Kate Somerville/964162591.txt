This is an awesome cleanser gifted by Kate Somerville to use in my rotation. While I do not use it everyday, my skin is reaping the benefits. I have sensitive skin, and this has definitely not caused any irritation. While I feel for me personally, e erydat use would fry out my skin, I benefit using it every few days. I do not have frequent breakouts, but a pesky bump from time to time does creep up. Since using this cleanser, I have not seen any. Itâ€™s awesome to use for a deep cleaning. Deep Clean!
