Gifted by Kate Somerville, to use and give my Honest opinion. First thing that you see a purse is the packaging and it’s beautiful I love everything about it the color of course is gorgeous also makes you think of water and the delivery method is fabulous. The cream is beautiful and silky I thought it was going to be thick, but as soon as you put it on your skin and go to rabbit and it turns into like a whole water moisturizer I don’t know how to explain it. It has a lovely clean smell to it not over bearing. It absorbs in and doesn’t leave a residue. With other water lotions I’ve had like a tightening kind of salty residue but this has none it absorbs straight in your skin and your skin looks fabulous I don’t know how they do it this is a cream that I will continue to use and I will re-purchase after I am out with some thing I want to add to my every day routine Meet the newest member of my daily routine
