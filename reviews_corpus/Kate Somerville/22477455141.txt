This acne cleanser cleanses the skin very well. I use this face wash as my night time cleanser. It strips the skin from oils and dirt without making the skin dehydrated and dry. I will definitely be adding this cleanser to my skincare must haves. I was gifted by Kate Somerville for my honest review. Perfect for acne and oily prone skin
