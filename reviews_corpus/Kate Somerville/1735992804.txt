I received this product complimentary from Kate Somerville for review. I was excited to receive this because I have oily, acne prone skin and I get clogged pores. What I didn’t expect was such a thick consistency. Belief has a gel cleanser that I love so I was expecting a similar consistency. This cleanser is thick and sticky, which I’m not a fan off. The smell is weird also. It’s an okay cleanser Sticky!
