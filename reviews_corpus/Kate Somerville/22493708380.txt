Gifted by Kate Somerville in exchange for my honest review. I love the packaging of this serum, the pump feels so luxurious. As for ingredients, itâ€™s primarily just a standard hydrating humectant serum but I really like that they included palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7, great for gentle anti aging. Great hydrator!
