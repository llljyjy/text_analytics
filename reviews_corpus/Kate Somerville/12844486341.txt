I used my rewards points for a small tube of this and immediately loved it.  I was getting bad breakouts on my chin/neck and with daily use, this helped clear my problem areas and reset my skin.  The small trial tube is enough for a few weeks so I’d recommend people grab that if they can!  I’ve used sulfur treatments before so I was fine with the smell, it’s something you need to get used to.  I did buy the full size and it’s actually a lot of product… that makes the price tag worth it to me! Saved my skin from crazy breakouts
