I enjoy this acne gel cleanser. A little goes a long way as this is a thick product. Has a very medicinal smell so if youâ€™re sensitive to scents, this one might be bothersome. Cleanses well without making my skin feel stripped. Has done a great job at clearing up some pesky spots. Overall I enjoy and recommend. Gifted by Kate Somerville in exchange for my honest review. Great Cleanser
