Prior to trying this cream, I had been using Farmacy honey halo Ultra moisturizing but wanted to try a less dense formula and I always wanted to try Kate Somerville product. Once I finish this product up, I’m going back to Farmacy - it’s half the price and I see the results within a few days of using, I don’t know what’s up with this KS cream, I don’t see any results. nan
