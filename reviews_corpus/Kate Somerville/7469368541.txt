I’m always on the hunt for a new moisturizer and this one has been great so far! I love the texture of it. So light but still moisturizing, which is perfect for my oily skin. It sinks into the skin so nicely and leaves my face looking and feeling soft and hydrated. Also Im obsessed with the container itself. I love the ease of the pump and not using too much or too little product. Two pumps dispenses the perfect amount of product for me. I would highly recommend. It’s a great moisturizer especially for this in between season we are in. Lovely in between seasons moisturizer
