I have never had acne prone skin until we started wearing masks. This gel texture has help prevent further breakouts. Also, the post-acne marks from picking, etc. I love the packaging with the pump as the product is a light gel that doesnâ€™t feel heavy on my skin.This is perfect for my Combination/Oily skin. It really has helped bring my skin barrier back to life as it absorbs seamlessly into my skin! I use this both in the AM and PM. After a few days, I noticed it faded my acne marks. It did all of this without irritating my skin or making it more sensitive. I am enthusiastic about continuing to use this to see ongoing results. I will continue to purchase this product and highly recommend you give it a try! My New Holy Grail!
