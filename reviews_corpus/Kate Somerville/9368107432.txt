This is my favourite cleanser for the morning and helps so much with my dry skin and acne! I love Kate Somerville products and this cleanser really helps my dry patches from acne and retinol! I love how this feels and it never leaves my face dry or tight. It is worth the price and is the most moisturizing cleanser ever! I was very discouraged when I couldnâ€™t find a cleanser to deal with my VERY DRY skin that would also help with my acne and I am so happy I tried this product and will continue to re-purchase this product. Amazing for VERY DRY skin and acne !
