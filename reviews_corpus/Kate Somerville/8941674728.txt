This is my first product from the brand and I am very impressed!I have been having particularly dry skin since incorporating retinoids in my skin care routine, and a good hydrating product is a must.I like to apply this serum on damp skin after cleansing, since it has Hyaluronic Acid and itâ€™s best absorbed on damp skin.I get instantly plump skin that feels and looks healthier and visibly more hydrated. It has a nice silky texture that layers well with other products and does not pill underneath a moisturizer.Overall I am really enjoying this serum and I highly recommend for fuller looking skin. Great for dry and dehydrated skin
