This product is especially useful for once-a-week pore extraction. Be sure to follow the directions, leave on for two minutes, and use warm water. If you follow up with a gentle pore extraction tool, you’ll be all set! The price tag is high, but if you use a pea-sized amount, you’ll be in good shape - a little goes a long way here! Great for pores!
