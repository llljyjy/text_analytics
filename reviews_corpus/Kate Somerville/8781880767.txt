This winter season has done a number on my skin. Normally I’ve got oily skin, but lately my skin has felt dry and tight and overall uncomfortable. I purchased this to give my skin some gentle care and instantly fell in love! I expected it to leave behind a waxy sort of feeling that many hydrating cleansers have (think of Cerave hydrating cleanser). BUT as I massaged it into my skin, it emulsified beautifully! It was able to remove my Drunk Elephant cleansing balm, which is very thick, and it rinsed off super nicely. It created a super nice lather that was the perfect consistency. My skin had a glow to it and I felt zero tightness. More importantly, it didn’t leave behind any film or residue. I’m in love! Normally I use the Indie Lee brightening cleanser, and this feels so much more gentle and luxurious while giving me a better clean feeling. I’m so excited to have found a new favorite! Amazing!
