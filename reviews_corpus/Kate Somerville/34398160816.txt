This is a really nice gel moisturizer that really packs of punch of hydration into your skin. I’ve been using it for close to two weeks now and I can definitely say it makes my skin softer, I don’t see any plumping affect to my skin though. Additionally, I’m not a fan of skincare that has fragrance in it but I’m actually not bothered by this fragrance as it’s really aquatic. Sits really well underneath make up too! Great formula and packaging
