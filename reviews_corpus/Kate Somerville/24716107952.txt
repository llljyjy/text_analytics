I bought this product having super high hopes due to such high reviews. I use morning & night everyday and my skin felt AMAZING but to be honest, I didn’t notice visible results at first. The product did not last long and especially at such a high proce point, I was upset. The first day I did not use this product after I ran out, my boss literally said “wiw are you okay? your face looks pretty puffy” and I immediately thought of this product! I didn’t notice a difference at first, but comparing my skin then and now.. I see it! I think this has to be one of the best products from Kate and definitely worth the splurge! nan
