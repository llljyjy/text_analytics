I have been a huge fan of Kate Somerville products since the very beginning of my skincare journey and this new HydraKate line is calling out for my dry skin! I was super excited to try the Recharging Serum! Itâ€™s such a beautiful formula and I love how it makes my skin feel! My skin is so supple, plump and glowy , fine lines plump and become almost non existent and my skin stays hydrated throughout the day! This serum is my go to for hydration now! I totally recommend this! Hydration Hero!!!
