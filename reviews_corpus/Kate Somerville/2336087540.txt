Gifted by Kate Somerville. Acne face washes are crucial in my skincare routine because I break out from time to time! It can be a struggle to find a good one that works but this one by Kate Somerville has been working so well for me! Itâ€™s helped keep my acne in control and it helps with acne that may occur and it also helps with my large pores since it contains niacinamide. I would definitely recommend to try this if you have acne prone skin! A must face wash!
