I originally got this in a beauty subscription box and used it until it was empty. I’ve tried other cleansers but ultimately decided to rebuy this. Its such a soft and gentle cleanser. It’s one of the only cleansers that leaves my skin feeling moisturized and hydrated after I wash it off. I personally find it isn’t harsh on my sensitive skin either. This will probably be a staple in my skincare routine. nan
