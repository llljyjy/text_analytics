every time i get a pimple, it leaves a scar—it doesn’t even matter if i pick at it or not. when i saw this product, i knew i had to try it. it’s quite small but a little goes a long way especially because you’re supposed to use it as a spot treatment. i have sensitive skin but this didn’t irritate it at all. i’m hoping this will eventually minimize the appearance of my acne hyperpigmentation marks in the long run.disclaimer: i received this complimentary from kate somerville. nan
