I received this product gifted by Kate Somerville for my honest opinion.  It is a special product for acne, I keep pimples on my cheeks, they are small, they always touch my skin and I feel them, sometimes I have spots, I am using this product and in 4 days that I have been using it I have noticed changes, the truth I did not expect it so soon, I had never seen good results, I am very happy to have had the opportunity to know it, I will continue using it, from now on it is my product for acne, I hope to continue having better results, what I do not like is the smell it has, but from the results I’ve seen in no time, it’s not worth forgetting the smell, it’s light and easily absorbed. nan
