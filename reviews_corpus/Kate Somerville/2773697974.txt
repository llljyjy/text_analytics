This cream is very lightweight and I could see it being great for someone with oily skin. I have really dry skin, and this didn’t do enough to moisturize it. The fragrance in here was also a bit overpowering for me, but if you’re not sensitive to fragrance you might enjoy this! Overall, I think there are better and less expensive alternatives. Better for oily skin
