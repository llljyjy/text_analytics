I got a quarter of an ounce ExfoliKate as a hundred point perk and have been using it twice a week since.  My skin was in bad shape after being in lockdown, and not being cared for as it should have been. Clogged and enlarged pores on my nose and cheeks BUT after one use of this product all my problems were solved! I have been using this tiny tube for at least six months, a very, very little goes a long way. I just purchased the mini, and I know it will be a staple in my skin care routine from here on out. It may seem expensive but the investment is worth it, the per use cost is negligible. Two tiny dabs on two fingertips is enough. My skin is soft, smooth, clear and practically pore-less. Treat yourself to a tube of your own, you wonâ€™t regret it! Worth every penny!
