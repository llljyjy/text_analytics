My skin type is combination/ very sensitive with eczema and is often dry due to retinoid use. I was looking for a calming, soothing rich cleanser to use when my skin is stressed or dry. It has a lovely creamy texture that lathers without stripping and leaves my skin hydrated and residue free (I use it as my second cleanser step at night after an oil cleanse to remove sunblock and makeup), or on its own for a gentle morning cleanse. However, the one star off is for the fragrance: fragrance is stronger than I expected (I did notice fragrance at the end of the ingredients list but most KS products I’ve used have had minimal or no fragrance and most reviews indicated it was mild). The fragrance is very beachy and tropical - kind of a coconut vanilla that smells like cheap sunblock. It’s definitely noticeable and unfortunately happens to be a type of fragrance I really dislike.Been using for about a week and my sensitive skin doesn’t love the fragrance. Giving it a few more days to adjust and if it doesn’t then I may have to return.I would be extremely interested in a fragrance free option (would have received 5 stars except for fragrance) because besides the scent it’s exactly what I’m looking for as my skin gets more mature and dry. If you’re not sensitive to fragrance and you like the smell of fruity coconut sunblock this is an excellent gentle hydrating option. If you’re sensitive to fragrance or dislike vanilla/coconut type bath and body works smells give this one a pass or try a sample first. Almost perfect gentle cleanser - strong fragrance.
