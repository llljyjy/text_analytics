I tried the EradiKate Clarifying Acne Gel Cleanser and overall really like it. It is a thick clear gel. It dispenses nicely and lathers great. It has a slight thyme scent that is not overpowering and does not linger. Seems to clean my skin well and does not strip my skin leaving it nice and soft.  Gifted by kate Somerville. Nice cleanser
