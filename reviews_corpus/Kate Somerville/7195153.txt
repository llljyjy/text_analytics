I received a bottle of this in my FabFitFun box and looked up the price online, and was skeptical of how it could possibly live up to its worth. But honestly, I’ve been using it for a couple of months now and I love it. It really is like giving yourself a mini facial. My face feels so smooth and looks great after each use. I use it maybe twice a week, and I will probably purchase the mini when I’m finished this bottle. You only use a little bit at a time so I feel a mini is probably best for ensuring you have the freshest product. Also a note, I have very sensitive skin and this hasn’t irritated me at all. I rub it onto my face in small circles and let it sit for about 2 minutes before I wash it off as instructed. I usually just do it while I’m in the shower and shave my legs or whatever while I’m letting it sit.  I’m not really a mask person so I love the relative low maintenance of using this, and not having to sit around with something on my face for 20-30 minutes.  It is very expensive but overall I would recommend it. Expensive but Great
