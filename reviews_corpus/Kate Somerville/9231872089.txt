I was gifted by Kate Somerville the EradiKate Acne Mark Fading Gel and surprisingly it worked. I’ve been using this product for a few days and I have noticed my acne scars diminishing/fading. You definitely have to keep up with it because routine is key. There is a chemical smell, but you get used to it. I’m glad I have this product. It Works!
