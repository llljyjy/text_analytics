Love love love this cream! I really like the packaging, and it dispenses the perfect amount. I love the gel like consistency. Itâ€™ll be a great transition moisturizer as we start moving into the colder months. It feels so silky, and combining it with the new serum makes for the perfect combination for my recovery days during skin cycling. Love a gel moisturizer
