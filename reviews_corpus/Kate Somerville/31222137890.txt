My skin is prone to hormonal breakouts and it is difficult to find a cleanser that treats acne and blemishes without striping & drying out my skin. This cleanser is gentle enough for my skin to use once a day. Lathers great and smells of mint.  I hope to see positive results from using this for a longer period of time.
