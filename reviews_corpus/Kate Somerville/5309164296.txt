I have always heard good things about Kate Somervilleâ€™s acne product so I decided to try this product to help with acne scars. I love that it has Salicylic Acid to prevent further breakouts and Niacinamide to help even out the skin tone. However, for the price, I do believe that there are other products out there that work just as well that are more affordable. This product was complimentary from Kate Somerville in exchange for my honest review. nan
