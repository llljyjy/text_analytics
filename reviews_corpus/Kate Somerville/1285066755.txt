I received this complimentary from Kate Somerville for my honest review. This is an awesome moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling softer. It has a great light texture but is very hydrating. The bottle itself is a cute plastic deal, and it feels like thereâ€™s a lot of product in it. The push to dispense top is also so unique and super convenient! nan
