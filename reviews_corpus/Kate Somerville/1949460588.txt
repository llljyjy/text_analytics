I used this for a couple years and initially liked it but now that I’ve switched to a different moisturizer I realize that it just wasn’t a great fit for me. I have dry patches and thought that I’d always have them because nothing I have used before helped. The moisturizer itself felt nice and light, didn’t leave a residue but it didn’t fix my dry patches. This may be great for others but didn’t work out for me. I also hated how much plastic their containers use. Didn't cut it for me
