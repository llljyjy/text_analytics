Wanted to wait until I had gotten a few months under my belt with this serum until I wrote a review.  The jury is now back -- it is everything it claims to be, and more.  Aesthetically, it dries down quickly and provides a good first step for my morning regimen of products.  Functionally, it keeps my rosacea in check: I can feel my skin calming down and it stays that way throughout the day. Score!
