I have dry, dehydrated skin and is always on the hunt for good hydration products and this hydrakate serum passed the test. My skin loves it! After using it I immediately noticed how plump, radiant and hydrated my skin felt. The formula goes on so nice and sinks in the skin quickly without being sticky. The added peptide and blue light protector is a nice added touch and I can’t wait to see the benefits in a few more weeks. Lastly there is a very light fragrance when first pumped out the bottle but it literally faded away and I didn’t notice or smelled it on my skin after applying. My dry dehydrated skin loves this!
