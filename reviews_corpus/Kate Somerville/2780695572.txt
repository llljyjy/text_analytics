LOVE this stuff!! It hydrates, plumps & helps make my primer & foundation go on so incredibly smoothly!! Doesn’t take much so it lasts a good while! NOTE: THE BOTTLE DOES NOT REQUIRE A STRAW in order to draw up the product through the dispenser. NONE OF THE BOTTLES HAVE STRAWS - NOT NEEDED! I just finished my 4th bottle & am about to purchase my next one, none of them had straws in them, & it was never an issue. Sometimes a little pocket of air gets into the dispenser so not much may initially come out when that happens, but all you need to do is give it a few more pumps - it will come!! Drives me crazy - the posts about no straw & all of the “Helpful” up votes lol HOLY GRAIL + DOES NOT NEED STRAW!!
