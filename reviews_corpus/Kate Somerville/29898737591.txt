So luckily for me I got this in my Ipsy bag & I tried it last night… I’m so in love with this. I noticed instant results right when I got out. I still can’t believe how much this is & how I got it in my Ipsy bag but I’m happy I did. It’s so good that I want to use everyday but Im not cuz I don’t wanna ruin my skin again but this really does work. It does sting a little but i promise you that you will see how soft & smooth your skin feels & how glowing your face will look after. Instant Results!
