This is a great daily cleanser for those with acne-prone skin like myself. It has a thick, gel texture and is gentle enough for daily use. My skin wasn’t irritated and it didn’t dry my skin out. This cleanser also didn’t leave behind a residue, but rather left my skin feeling clean! Gifted by Kate Somerville. Great for acne-prone skin
