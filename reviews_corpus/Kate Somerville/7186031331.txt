this stuff is THE BEST and ONLY acne clearing product i have tried that works. ever since i had my daughter at 20 i had the worst battle with hormonal acne for 2 years and was beginning to lose hope & turn to literally getting my face chemically peeled or some crazy expensive facial treatment because absolutely NOTHINGGG was working. i finally decided to use this after realizing it uses benzoyl peroxide over just salicylic acid. and OMG it has kept my skin clear now for the almost whole year that my one bottle lasted (& that’s day & night use!) i already liked the other kate somerville products but couldn’t find one that fixed the acne until this. if you have awful combo skin of dry with acne like me, GET THIS. yes it is definitely more drying than some acne treatments, so just pair with a good moisturizer. i use the kate somerville goat milk one & it’s a perfect match with this. nothing compares to this one trust me & just try it!!!! THE BEST. DONT WASTE TIME ON ANYTHING ELSE.
