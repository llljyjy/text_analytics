My esthetician recommended that I get a cream cleanser to use for removing makeup.  I watched an old review on YouTube  on cream cleansers from Racheal Marie Abreu and decided to purchase.  I am glad I did because I love this product and use it on days I donâ€™t even wear makeup.  I have sensitive skin and I had no reactions, it was gentle and creamy.  I hope they do not change this product. Holy Grail!
