I received this complimentary from Kate Somerville in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this acne mark fading gel for a couple weeks now and have seen some noticeable differences in my hyperpigmentation. The darn spots now look a lot lighter! I appreciate that this has salicylic acid in it because it also helps to keep my acne at bay in the meantime. I’m not in love with the scent (it’s very herbal) but not a big deal. nan
