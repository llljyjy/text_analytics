I really liked this face wash. The gel was smooth and didnâ€™t irritate my face, I felt like I got a deep clean. The salicylic acid helped keep any new acne from showing up and also helped get rid of a few pimples that I had. I like that this cleanser is gentle but effective. I received this complimentary from Kate Somerville. nan
