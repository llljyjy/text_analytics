After beginning to wear masks on a daily basis, I quickly realized I needed something to fight the “maskne” that was appearing and the marks it left behind. Ever since then, I’ve been trying many products but they either aren’t strong enough or are too strong and irritate my skin. This is PERFECT. After using it for a day, I noticed it reduced the amount of acne I woke up with. And after a few days, I noticed it faded my acne marks. It did all of this without irritating my skin or making it more sensitive. Gifted by Kate Somerville nan
