I received this product complimentary from Kate Somerville. Im such a huge fan of Kate Somerville products and I was super excited try this acne cleanser. I love a good gel cleanser and even more when it helps with acne. Lately I have had worse breakouts than when I was a teenager, so I’m always looking for the right products to help my skin. This cleanser is AMAZING!!! It makes my skin feel so clean and refreshed every time I use it. Since using it twice everyday in my day and night routines, I’ve noticed a great difference in my acne. I’ve had less and less pimples and blackheads and it helped get rid of the redness and irritation I was having. The best thing is it didn’t dry out my skin like so many other acne cleansers do. My skin always feels soft and smooth. Very happy with this cleanser and it will definitely be a staple in my collection from now on. Bye Bye Acne!!!
