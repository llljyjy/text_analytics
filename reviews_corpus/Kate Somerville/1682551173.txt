I’ve been using this cleanser for a few days now as a replacement for my other Kate Somerville cleanser and really like it! It’s in a convenient squeeze tube and comes out very thick. I think this thick, sticky texture could be a turn off for some people but I feel like that’s what helped it clean out the gunk in my pores. I’ve tried other acne cleansers in the past and most leave my skin feeling dry and stripped. Thankfully this one does not! It does have a scent to it that I’m not totally in love with (it smells like pizza to me? Might be some kind of rosemary or something) but I’m so happy with the results that I plan to stick with using it. nan
