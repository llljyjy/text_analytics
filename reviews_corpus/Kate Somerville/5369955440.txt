I received this complimentary from Kate Somerville in exchange for my honest review.  I have been getting more acne on my cheeks and chin due to having to use a mask everyday for work. I have heard that salicylic acid is good to use for acne. I have used it for a few days now and I love it. It feels hydrating and I can start to see a difference in my acne. I do have to be careful though as I donâ€™t want to over do it so I will only use it a few days a week to work up my tolerance. nan
