I received this product complimentary from Kate Somerville. This was my first experience with a Kate Somerville product and itâ€™s very different from similar items I have used. It smells more natural than chemical like, which I think is due to the thyme and pine oil. Afterwards, my skin felt very clean and soft. Also, the pores had tightened, but not in a dried out feeling way. Great alternative to harsher cleansers
