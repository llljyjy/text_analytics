I got a sample of this from Sephora. First thing that put me off was the overpowering scent. When I applied it, I had a burning sensation on my face. It got better after a few minutes but still… skincare should not burn. I did give it 2 stars because my skin texture is smooth and feels moisturized but I’ll give this a pass and continue my search. Steer clear if you have skin sensitivities
