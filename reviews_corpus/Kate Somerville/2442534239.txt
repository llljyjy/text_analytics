A great hydration serum to add to the routine. It has a silky texture that absorbs easily into skin without a sticky feeling and plays well with my other skincare. But it does have a light scent to it so if you are an ultra sensitive sniffer, test it in store first. Otherwise it is a great serum for plump hydrated and refreshed skin. nan
