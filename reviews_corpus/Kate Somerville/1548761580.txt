This cleanser did it’s job!! I received it complimentary from Kate Somerville recently and here’s my honest opinion. It foams up nicely and feels like it really cleans your face thoroughly. It has a lot of great ingredients in it as well as Salicylic Acid as an active which is wonderful for acne prone skin. The only complaint I have is the scent is a strong, almost chemical like smell which kind of turned me off from using it too often. If you can get past that than it’s a great cleanser if you suffer from acne! nan
