I struggle with stubborn acne that not only is active but also leaves marks after it has healed. This gel does it all. It targets my active acne to help heal it much faster, & it also targets my post-acne marks and helps fade them away quicker. A little goes a long way, so the bottle will last you a while. Overall, I really enjoyed this acne gel & would continue to incorporate it in my skincare routine. I was gifted by Kate Somerville. nan
