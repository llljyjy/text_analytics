I love the texture of this serum. It gives my skin such a nice dose of hydration. I love the fact that this serum contains hyaluronic acid which provides lasting hydration to the skin for a longer period of time. The serum has a very tiny light scent that is pleasant and not overpowering. My skin looks so hydrated immediately after application. Great for an everyday serum. I would recommend it to all, especially if you are wanting a boost of hydration. Silky and Hydrating
