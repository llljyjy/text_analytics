This EradiKate Acne Mark Fading Gel with Salicylic Acid Serum was gifted by Kate Somerville in exchange for my honest review. As it contains salicylic, it does help slowly control acne on my chin and I can see some improvement with pores as well while in use. The texture is gel so no greasy and no heavy feeling. I am looking forward to see long term effect. nan
