This product is great for hydrating my skin! I love the large size and the unique container/dispenser that it comes with. I like this product because it does not dry down too fast, it actually makes my skin feel plump and hydrated for quite a long time after application. I had never used a water cream before and it impressed me. It also smells quite good. I will be using it in my PM skincare routine! Great hydrating cream!
