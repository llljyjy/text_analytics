I confess that I expected more from this product. I used it for a few days and it improved the appearance of pimples, but I canâ€™t say that it actually dried the pimples and helped prevent future breakouts.Important note: I have always had pimple-free skin, but recently I moved from a very humid state to a very dry state, and I also changed some medication I take daily and I believe that this new medication has messed with my skin, causing hormonal pimples and more difficult to be treated and controlled, since I take the medication every day. Good, but not miraculous!
