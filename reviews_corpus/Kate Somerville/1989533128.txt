I was gifted this cream in exchange for my review. First of all, I love the packaging - from the pretty blue color to the pump dispenser. It is so much more hygienic than a regular jar of cream and you can control how many pumps you need. I have dry skin and even though this is a lightweight cream, it really hydrates my skin and make it look plumper. It absorbs easily and smooths my skin. Love it! nan
