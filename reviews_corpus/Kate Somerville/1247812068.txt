This product is fantastic, if you can get it out of the bottle. I am on my second bottle and it takes forever to get it to actually come out. And then every time after that it’s pumping for over a minute for a very tiny amount to come out. As much as I love the results from Kateceuticals when I could get it out of the bottle, it’s not worth all that effort every day. I really wanted to love this eye cream and even bought a second bottle thinking it was one defective bottle, but it’s not. Hopefully Kate Somerville will change the bottle and then I am all for using this again. Horrible Bottle that you will waste lots of time
