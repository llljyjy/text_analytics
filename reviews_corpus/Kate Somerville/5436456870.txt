Itâ€™s ok. My issue is way to many essential oils that I find irritating and low quality soy bean oil. Other then that the formulation is great, my skin feels soft and exfoliated after using, however there are other, cheaper exfoliants that are less irritating and leave my skin feeling even smoother then this product. nan
