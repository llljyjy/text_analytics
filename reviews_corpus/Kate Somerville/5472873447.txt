I got this product at a pretty good discount. Worth it on sale, but not at its full price. While I used this cleanser it felt great. Very creamy, perfect for sensitive skin without irritating or drying out the skin. However, this completely breaks me out if I use it more than 1-2 times a week. Only new product in my routine, and I never have such huge issues with cleansers. Not dor its price.
