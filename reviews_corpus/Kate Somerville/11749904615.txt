This was my savior. I was breaking out so bad on my face due to stress and retinol purge and this cleared my face in a week! I get acne pretty frequently (luckily it’s only a pimple or two) and I can say, I haven’t had any new ones emerge since using this cleanser!! It is drying though so make sure to pair it with a good moisturizer+serum CLEARED MY FACE
