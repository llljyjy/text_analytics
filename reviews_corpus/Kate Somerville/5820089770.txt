I received this product complimentary from Kate Somerville in exchange for my honest review. First off cute name (EradiKate)- love a play on words. The cleanser both smells and feels fresh on your face and it has a good lather. The best part is that it doesnâ€™t dry my face out like many other acne cleansers. I look forward to using this during a certain time of month when I get stubborn breakouts. What's not to love?
