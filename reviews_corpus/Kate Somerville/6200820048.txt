This cleanser didn’t really feel like it was cleaning, but more moisturizing. It didn’t lather or at all, and was more like a cream. I didn’t help my redness, but felt very soft and gentle, and nice on my sensitive skin.Unfortunately it had a very odd smell, so I ended up returning it. For the price, I expect more. Interesting Cleanser
