This Kate Somerville HydraKateâ„¢ Recharging Serum is a lightweight serum. It is perfect for my combination skin. It absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy. My skin feels hydrated, fresh and nourished. It has a slight smell that does not bother me at all. Very glad to include this serum in my skincare routine. Nice Serum!
