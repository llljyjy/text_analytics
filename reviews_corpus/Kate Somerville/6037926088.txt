My current cleanser ($8) left my face squeaky clean but very drying. My skin is (ahem) changing now so I was in search for a better product and this is it. I still use my Clarisonic and it foams up nicely and a little does go a long way. My skin feels fresh and clean and the scent is light. Not drying at all. I absolutely love it. Can you imagine going from an $8 cleanser to one thatâ€™s $44? Very much well worth it. Im just sorry I was in the dark for so long! Amazing!
