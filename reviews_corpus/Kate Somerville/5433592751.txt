I originally bought the sample kit and had to buy the full size product! I ended up buying all the sample kit products in full size. This is go to for any acne. I donâ€™t have a ton of acne but I break out every so often. This face wash has stopped all breakouts and if a zit does come through I use the other products that were in the kit and they are gone in a day or so. Love this product and product line! Amazing product & product line
