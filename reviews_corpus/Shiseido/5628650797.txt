I love this product because it feels so refreshing! I use this on the lazy or busy days until i can fully wash my face. I have NOT used this to remove makeup, i use other wipes for this on lazy days. Love the quality packaging and you can see the dirt that gets picked up with the wipes with use. My acne prone (stage 1) seems to really enjoy these as i have noticed my breakouts have flattened and are reducing. My skin is not sensitive (burn tingle) but very reactive to things and my skin likes this product. Been using for 2 weeks in total. refreshing!
