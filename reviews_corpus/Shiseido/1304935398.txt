I am a Retinol user and plastic surgery patient and am obsessive about sunscreen even during Ohio winters. This is non irritating and performs nicely when running or walking outside-it doesnâ€™t drip into eyes. My sunscreen arsenal is expansive and this is now the first I reach for. It may not be necessary and perhaps my own obsession but I layer this with a powdered sunscreen if I am hiking or beaching for the day. If I get one freckle I am scheduling laser treatments so trust me that this sunscreen is fantastic! oh this is good!
