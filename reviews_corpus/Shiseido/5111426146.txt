This is the first shiseido skincare product I’ve ever used and I liked it very much. I’ve used it for weeks now and it does makes my skin feels smoother. It gives me a feeling of a smooth canvas on my face like a layer on top of my skin. It works almost instantly for me. I have very dry rough skin sometimes and this serum helps smooth it out. It provides nice hydration to my skin. Hydration: I would give it 3.9/5. Don’t get me wrong, it does makes my skin feels very smooth every time I use it but for some reasons, I just feel like it doesn’t hydrate my skin as well and as much as other products I’ve used. However it gives me that instant smooth skin surface to apply makeup that other products I’ve used don’t give me. Smooth Skin
