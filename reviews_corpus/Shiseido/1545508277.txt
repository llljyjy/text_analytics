I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. I received two Shiseido sunscreens to review!  Iâ€™ve never tried sunscreen from this brand before, but ended up liking them! I liked this fresh moisture hyaluronic acid one a little better than the oil free hyaluronic acid one. The fresh moisture sunscreen had a bit thicker consistency and spread really nicely. My makeup stayed put and it never felt greasy or heavy. I would definitely buy this one Nice face sunscreen
