I received this product for free from Influenster & shiseido in exchange for my honest review. i’ve repurchased this sunscreen multiple times it’s so good! it leaves my skin feeling very hydrated & extremely smooth so it pairs perfectly with my makeup & i refuse to go without it. very lightweight & non greasy, works great for my oily skin so having it as oil free is a plus!! a little goes a long way so it’s definitely worth the price. my favorite sunscreen !!
