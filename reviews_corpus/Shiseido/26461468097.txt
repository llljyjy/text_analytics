This Shi Seido Urban Environment SPF leaves your skin glowing and radiant, while also protecting your skin from the harmful effects of the sun. I love that this formula doesn’t leave behind that horrible white cast, and absorbs very quickly. It’s also infused with HA leaving your skin moisturized and dewy looking. It’s made from a mineral formula without the more harmful ingredients like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which is better for your skin overall. I love this for an everyday sunscreen, and the scent is light to it. There is nothing bad about this, and it’s totally worth it! New Favorite SPF!
