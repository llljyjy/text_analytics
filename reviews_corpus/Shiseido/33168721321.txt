I received this complimentary from Shiseido for my honest review. Most sunscreens leave my face feeling oily, this was like all the rest, left my skin oily feeling. It blended into my skin very easily and had a pleasant scent. I liked the lightweight consistency but it left me super greasy. I would recommend if you have dry skin. Super moist.
