I received Shiseido Urban Environment-SunscreenBroad Spectrum SPF 42 from Influenster andShiseido in exchange for my honest reviewIt is costly but you get what you pay for! I used it asa primer under my makeup and it did wonderfully.This product isn’t greasy like some sunscreens, itdoesn’t burn or sting the eyes and it did not breakmy skin out. I would say it’s worth the price and Iwould recommend it to others!!! sunscreen
