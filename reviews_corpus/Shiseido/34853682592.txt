I received this as a free sample for my honest review. I tried this cream out for a week, and I definitely enjoyed it. It absorbs into the skin quickly, and my skin didnâ€™t feel dried out. It does smell slightly of sunscreen; I always use a day cream with SPF, but this has no fragrance so the smell was noticeable. Honestly, the only thing that makes this my back up moisturizer other than my regular morning cream is that I have dry skin, and I prefer a thicker moisturizer. Great Cream! But maybe not the best for dry skin
