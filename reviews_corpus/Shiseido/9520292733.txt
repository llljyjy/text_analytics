I was a little skeptical at first because it smelled like a strong sunscreen. I love the smell of sunscreen but don’t want to smell like it all day. However after applying the product I don’t smell it at all! The product glides on effortlessly and is very hydrating! This product is exactly what I was missing from my skincare routine! nan
