Wow! First of all, I’m a sucker for Hyaluronic Acid! The packing is sleek and cute with a slight pearlescent shift. There is a small ball in this product that helps mix it up. Also I was pleased to realize this works great as a primer! I noticed when applying it over all my skin care and serums.. it did not feel heavy at all, which I love! I also love the fact that there is such a light scent, similar to Supergoop! I can 100% tell you, I will be buying this again. (If your looking for a product that’s more matte and thinner than Supergoop! you will love this!) SPF, Primer, Hyaluronic Acid.. YES PLEASE!
