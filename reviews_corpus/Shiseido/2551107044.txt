I wear sunscreen when I go out especially since I’m in NC where the heat and sun is no joke. The application of this sunscreen was super easy and went on smooth and didn’t leave a white cast unlike other sunscreens. I wore the sunscreen by itself because being a mom makes you a minimalist. I went to the beach and it stayed on pretty well. It doesn’t leave an oily feeling. love this sunscreen
