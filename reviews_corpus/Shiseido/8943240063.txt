Overall, I very much liked this sunscreen - it’s easy to apply, wears great in the heat of Cancun, doesn’t mess with the makeup being applied over it. i liked the texture of it - creamy and doesn’t run. I didn’t notice my skin being any more hydrated, but it didn’t feel dry while wearing it either. It still does have a slight smell of sunscreen but the overall smell is pleasant. I got this complimentary  from influenster. nan
