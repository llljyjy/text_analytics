I liked this cream as it is very smooth and light weight. But for the hydration it didn’t help much as my skin type is combination so on the dry part it didn’t help but apart from that it’s good and blends in very easily. I think if you have oily to normal skin then it should be good for you but with people having dry skin type, probably it will not work for them. Good for oily to normal skin type
