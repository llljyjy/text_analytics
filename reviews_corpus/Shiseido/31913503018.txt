I received this product free from Influenster for testing in exchange for my honest review.  I liked this product.  It didn’t dry my skin and lasted all day. The texture is smooth and there is a light scent to it. I noticed a light overcast but it didn’t last all day. Overall I’m pleased and would recommend this product. Moisture sunscreen
