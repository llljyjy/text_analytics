I received this for free from Influenster & Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. This is a great sunscreen but it’s not unique/special enough to pay this much for it, which is why I only have it 4 stars. I really need an SPF of at least 100 (I’m literally the color of snow) but it’s nice to have any level of spf around! A few weeks ago, my mom & I painted my grandmother’s front door and I had just received this voxbox. I used that as my first opportunity to try these sunscreens (this one & the other similar one they sent along with it) out. They can be used on the face or body. I put some on under my makeup, as well as on my arms, legs, chest, neck, shoulders, & ears. These sunscreens worked as well as any other sunscreen, but I didn’t see anything special or unique about them. I’d personally rather just buy the Equate brand clear spray-on sunscreen in spf 100, which is WAY cheaper & has the level of spf I need. Good But Nothing Special
