I’ve had a hard time trying to find a good sunscreen for my face. This one is just perfect. It is so lightweight and dries so sooth on your skin. It lasts for a very long time and doesn’t make me breakout. The only thing I didn’t like was that it leaves a slight white cast when sweating or getting wet. The best!
