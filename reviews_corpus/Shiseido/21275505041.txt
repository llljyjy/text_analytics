I received this product from #influenster in order to give my honest review. This sunscreen wears absolutely flawless under my makeup and doesn’t leave you feeling greasy or shiny! I love that when you rub it in, it almost turns into a powder-like finish and makes your face feel softer than it did prior to application. There’s no overpowering “sunscreen” scent and you can’t beat the fact that it has hyaluronic acid already in it so you’re getting protection and treatment in one! I can definitely see why this is rated as one of the top facial sunscreens on the market! Thank you #influenster for bringing this product into my life! Perfection in a sunscreen!
