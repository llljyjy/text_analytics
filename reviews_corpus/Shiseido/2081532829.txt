** I received this product for free from Shiseido and Influenster **Let’s start with what I love! I love the ingredients: zinc oxide and titanium dioxide means that I KNOW my skin is being protected. It is also oil free and has hyaluronic acid in it which is great for my dry skin!The only downside is the zinc leaves a bit of a white cast, so it would be great under makeup. I wish that wasn’t the case but know it just means I am a protecting my skin. Good base!
