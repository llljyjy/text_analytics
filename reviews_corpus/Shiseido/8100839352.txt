I received this sunscreen for free from Influenster to try andreview. I really liked it! It has a nice light scent and has apeachy tone to it so it doesn’t make your face pale. Itwasn’t greasy and dried quickly on my face. I didn’t burn. I will definitely be using this all summer! I also like that it hashyaluronic acid to help improve my skin as well as protect! Nice sunscreen!
