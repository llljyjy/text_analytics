This sunscreen is not good for oily skin, I did not like it.  It looked and made my skin feel really greasy, it did not absorb for me at all.  I’d recommend this sunscreen for normal to dry skin though, it’d definitely be good for those skin types.  I did like the container though and the SPF factor. nan
