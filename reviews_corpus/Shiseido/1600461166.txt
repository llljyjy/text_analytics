This is my favorite active sunscreen. Not for everyday use but I do use it every morning before my run. Not just my arms and neck, but my face too. Even my eyelids. This not only protects when I sweat, but doesn’t sting my eyes.  It also applies clear, and dries clear so no white cast or streaks. And it hasn’t stained my running clothes. But I don’t use this for everyday. My everyday face sunscreen is the urban environment.  But there’s nothing better for active protection than this. Best active sunscreen
