okay review time!  this shiseido moisturizer is fantastic. it goes on so light (I love the little application stick) I put a dab of water on my skin too to help it with absorption. itâ€™s not a heavy cream and a little bit goes a long way. I love that it has broad spectrum SPF20. it does have somewhat of a sunscreen smell to it, but it smells like a clean sunscreen and is pleasant. it feels rejuvenating and brightening on your skin which I love to have in the morning right after cleansing. I would definitely recommend this if you need a new moisturizer and is so nice because it also has hyaluronic acid in it--i will only ever buy moisturizer that has this in it because it is key to hydrating your skin.#shiseidoskincare #complimentary @shiseido @Influenster #productreview #skincare Love, will buy again!
