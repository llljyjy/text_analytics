I received Shiseido Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen SPF 42 complimentary from Shiseido and Influenster in exchange for my honest feedback.I love anything Shiseido. And was beyond impressed again with another one of their products. I always wear sunscreen on my face. It will pay off in the long run. When applying the sunscreen, its just like applying my moisturizer. Itâ€™s not thick like regular sunscreen. Shiseido added a wonderful benefit to this product, Hyaluronic Acid. You can never go wrong with that.I loved the fact that the formula is like a lotion, but absorbed quickly into my skin. It works phenomenal under makeup as well. It left my skin feeling like silk. I would definitely buy this and add it to my skincare regimen. You're going to fall in-love
