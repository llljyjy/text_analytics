I haven’t tried these productsbefore so I wasn’t sure what to expect, but they are a new staple in my skincare routine. Suncare is one of the most important pieces of my skincare routine now and I love that this is SPF 42. I wore it under my makeup and it felt hydrating leaving my skin feel dewy and radiant. It felt amazing on my skin and absorbed quickly. A new favorite! nan
