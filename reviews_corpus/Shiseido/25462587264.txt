The packaging of this product is quite unique and good. The cream is really thick and rich. It gives a very slight fragrance which doesnâ€™t bother me much. It comes with a tiny plastic spatula to decant the product. Skin feels a little more bouncy and plump after application. It comes with spf 20 so a perfect day cream. It works well as a base for foundation. Good for dry and combination skin type. Perfect day cream for indoor and outdoor
