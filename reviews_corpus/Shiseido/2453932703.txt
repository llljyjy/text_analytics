I received the standard and oil-free formula for frew from Influenster and Sephora for my honest review.  I was not a fan of the standard formula. I used as directed and ended up sunburned.  The OIL-FREE formula,  however worked.  I applied the oil-free on my face with no other spf and my face is fine. No sunburn whatsoever.  Everywhere else that I put the sunscreen on, however is burned. Get the oil-free formula!
