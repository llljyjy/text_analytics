I received this item compliments of Influenster & Shiseido in exchange for my honest opinion. Thanks to both brands for this opportunity!I really liked this products concept of not just being sunscreen but also having skincare benefits as well. Hyaluronic acid is one of my favorite skincare ingredients so I really looked forward to trying this product.Unfortunately they way it worked didn’t mesh well with how I want my sunscreen to look. This left behind a white cast on my light/medium skintone that was noticeable even after I’d given it several minutes to absorb into the skin on my face.It does state that this sunscreen can also be used as a primer and with the noticeable white cast it left on my skin it had more primer like look in appearance not at all like a moisturizer and also not a product I’d use as a sunscreen because of the noticeable white appearance it left on your skin.I did really like how it made my skin feels after use and the skincare benefits of this product. I will continue to use this as a primer under my foundation or bb/cc cream. It provides a nice base for your makeup and has a good amount of spf in it too.I’ve tried other products from this brand including skincare products and makeup and I really loved all the previous Shiseido products I’d tried. This is my first time giving a Shishedo beauty/cosmetic a 4 star rating. Everything’s else I’ve tried from this brand was a 5 star rating hands down! First time I’ve given a Shiseido product 4 stars
