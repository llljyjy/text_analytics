I have really loved trying this product out. I was previously using an estee lauder product that I love but is insanely expensive. I’d consider switching to this. It’s not as thick as I would like so I feel like I use more in application but otherwise I love that it isn’t strongly scented, makes my skin feel soft and moisturized and the product goes a long way! nan
