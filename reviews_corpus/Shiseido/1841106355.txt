I loved the application of this sunscreen - lightweight and no white cast. Slight sunscreen smell which I like. This is very mildly tinted and didnâ€™t leave me shiny or greasy feeling at all. Fast drying/absorption. No irritation to my skin at all!Worked really well under my sunscreen and makeup! nan
