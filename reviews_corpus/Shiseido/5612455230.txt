Iâ€™ve really enjoyed testing out this facial serum the last few weeks. I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. I normally use it in the morning right after my cleanser. I follow up with a moisturizer and a light facial oil. This routine has helped out my dry skin and helped to improve fine lines. The only thing I would change would be that it be a bit more moisturizing with less product use. I normally have to use two pumps to feel it absorbing/making a difference to my skin. Great product
