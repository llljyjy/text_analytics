I received this Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-free Mineral Sunscreen complimentary from Influenster and Sephora in exchange for my honest review. I love how light it is and easily applied. It smells nice and it lasts a few hours. I use it in conjunction with a BB cream and it works fantastically. Not greasy. Not goopy. I love it! Light and effective!
