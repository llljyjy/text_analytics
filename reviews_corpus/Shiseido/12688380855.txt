Pros: thick formula, pleasant and subtle aromaCons: way overpriced, I didnâ€™t see anything exceptional in the ingredients list, leaves a buttery feeling on my skin that could cause occlusive acne or irritation if used every day. I believe what is giving the results most is just the thickness of this cream and that it stays on the skin, not allowing it to dry out, and not the actual ingredients that are in the cream. Returning this and will continue to search for a better ingredient list that will actually help my skin, hopefully at a better price point. Lots of money for a fancy brand & poor ingredients
