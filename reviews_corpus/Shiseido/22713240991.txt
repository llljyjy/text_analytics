I really like this product! I just added it to my skincare routine and it blends really well and doesn’t burn upon application. The package is beautiful and looks expensive. I had no idea however that this product was so pricey because I received it complimentary through Influenster, so I was truly shocked to see the price tag. The pump works really well on this and it’s easy to apply. I like this, but it’s $$$
