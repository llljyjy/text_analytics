This day cream has a light consistency and has some moderate hydration to it, I could see someone with oily or combo skin loving this more than someone with dry skin. I like that there’s a little spf but my fair skin needs a lot more spf to be protected. Other than sunscreen coverage only other thing that can be improved is the packaging - it is big and heavy and will be hard to travel with. But if this is going to stay in your bathroom those elements shouldn’t be an issue! I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. Light Day Cream
