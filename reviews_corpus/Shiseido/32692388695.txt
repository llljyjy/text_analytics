Even though this is oil free, because of the Hyaluronic Acid I do not find it drying. This lotion is not white, more like a nude color. And I like it because it leaves no white cast and blends easily into my skin. It has a similar fragrance to the fresh moisture sunscreen and I think it smells like other Shiseido sunscreens I have used in the past. Nice Oil-free SPF
