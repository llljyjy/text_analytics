I love this SPF and the convenience of having it in a stick is amazing. It goes on so smooth and so easily, no white cast, no color, not even much blending or moving around necessary. This is so perfect for days on the go. A bunch of swipes on my face and neck and I feel totally protected. I like that I can feel it on my face at first so I know its there and then it just melts in and feels like nothing.To be totally honest I haven’t tried it under makeup, I usually wear my EltaMD if I’m going to be doing a full face. But for days running errands or being in the sun, this is my go-to for easy reapplying and because it’s SPF 50!! MUST HAVE
