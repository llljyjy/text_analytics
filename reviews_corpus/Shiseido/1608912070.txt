I received complimentary in exchange for my honest review.  Both rubbed in nicely, no white cast for either, and didnâ€™t make my skin greasy.  Smells very similar to your typical sunscreen, with a slightly better scent.  I liked both equally, and these little samples are perfect for travel. Great Sunscreen
