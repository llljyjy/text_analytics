Shisheido serum is top notch. I love it because I already have dry skin and I do shower with hot water which tends to dry out my skin to where it feels extremely tight so this serume just hydrates my face and neck. It’s a staple. When I don’t wear makeup is just makes me look more refreshed and when I do wear makeup it make my makeup lay better and last longer Great content inside a great bottle
