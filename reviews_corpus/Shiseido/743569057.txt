I really enjoyed this project overall. The packaging makes it really easy and not messy to apply to face. Did not cause whitecast on my fair skin. Did not sting or burns eyes or skin at all. The only small issue I had was some slight pilling when applying after vitamin c serum. I will continue working with it to avoid the pilling. I think itâ€™s a very solid product. Overall really good sunscreen
