I received this product for free from @influenster and @shiseido in exchange of my honest review. This sunscreen is good – not as good as the Shiseido Oil-Free but maybe for when I’m at the beach it will be better. I didn’t like much this particular one because felt a little heavy on the skin with my makeup and the absorption was a little bit slower than the other one. I’m still not sure if I will purchase again, need to give a try on the summer time. nan
