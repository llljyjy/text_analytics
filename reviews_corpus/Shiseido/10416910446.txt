I received this from Influenster free for review purposes. Overall I think it’s a nice serum. I love the packaging, it feels very luxurious. I have been using the serum most mornings with my other Shiseido products and I think it does an alright job at hydrating my skin but I don’t feel like it’s doing anything to reduce the minor wrinkles I have on my forehead. Overall it’s nice but I wouldn’t repurchase for the price. nan
