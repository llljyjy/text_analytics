First of all the packaging on this product is absolutely gorgeous. I’m a sucker for pretty jars on my beauty bar. The product was nice. It was a tad bit thick feeling and unscented but I’d considering purchasing depending on how I feel after multiple days of use. On day 1 though I could definitely do with or without. yes
