Urban Environment Oil-Free Sunscreen SPF 42 is a smooth, silky, evenly gliding way to protect my face. I have combination skin and it does not exacerbate any oiliness throughout the day. It applies evenly over a freshly moisturized face and acts as a great foundation primer as well. My foundation stayed in tact all day without separation. I enjoy the fact that it doesnâ€™t leave my face shiny upon application. I really enjoyed using this sunscreen. I believe it is worth the price. I would recommend this product. Great application and wear
