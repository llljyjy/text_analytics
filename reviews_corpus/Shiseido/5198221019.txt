I have dry skin, so I layer skincare to get ultimate hydration. This serum feels so refreshing and cool as you place it onto your skin, but it will dry to a smooth finish. I definitely feel immediately hydrated just after a single use of this product. I use this day and night after toner but before my serum and moisturizer, so it can enhance those products to work better. There is a pleasant, clean scent that is not too overpowering. The packaging is very sleek and modern. Great boost to skincare immunity!
