i got this in an Influenster voxbox. I love that this is oil-free! It didn’t make my skin look oily. In fact, it actually dried down fairly matte. The biggest downside for me is that it turned my skin purple at first. I freaked out a little bit because I was afraid that it would stay that way. However, my skin looked normal after I let it sit for a few minutes. it’s pretty good
