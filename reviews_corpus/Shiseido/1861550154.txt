Having kids has wreaked havoc on my skin. The hormones from pregnancy left me with dark spots and areas of dryness. I am happy to say that after only a week of use, I notice a difference in my skin!  Itâ€™s brighter and smoother. The serum goes on nice and light and does not have a scent. I apply it after my vitamin c serum and before my daily moisturizer.  I highly recommend giving it a try! Definitely Helps!
