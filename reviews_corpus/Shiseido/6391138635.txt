I have a vivid memory of putting sunscreen on as a kid, and immediately feeling a burning sensation so strong I had to jump in the pool. Since then, I’ve been wary about sunscreens, and cautious about ingredients. I decided to try the Urban Environment oil-free one from Shisiedo before going on a garden tour,  and absolutely love it! It is very thin application, has no smells, and streak-free! And, I didn’t get burned even though it was 90-degree day in full sun. Will absolutely keep using it! New Favorite Sunscreen!
