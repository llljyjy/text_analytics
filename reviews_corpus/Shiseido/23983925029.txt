I didnâ€™t like this product. I used it one time and it left me with a terrible white cast. It also was not very moisturizing. I do not see myself purchasing this product unless there is a formula change. The product is also very runny and I prefer a thicker sunscreen. I would not recommend this product to people of colour.
