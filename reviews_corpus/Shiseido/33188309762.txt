This product was one of my favorite products to try. The hydrating day cream has a nice scent to it. It is not over powering but a nice clean smell. It comes with a little applicator stick so if you have long nails or hate when things get under your nails it is very helpful. My favorite part is that it contains SPF 20, the cream is not too thick and when applying it doesn’t feel like you face is suffocating from a thick cream. Feels light and doesn’t make my skin look shinny or feel greasy after applying makeup for the day. SPF 20!!!
