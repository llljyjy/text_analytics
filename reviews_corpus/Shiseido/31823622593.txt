I haven’t tried Shiseido Ultimune Power Infusing Concentrate before. First off, I think the product style is super attractive and just the look of it makes you excited to try it! It has a minimal smell. I found that one pump doesn’t cut it, doesn’t seem to spread that well, so you need two for sure. Once on its light, with a slight oiliness but still a dry/not moisturized feeling? Pairs with a moisturizer nicely for a smooth feeling though! I found this to be a good, but not impressive product. A good product
