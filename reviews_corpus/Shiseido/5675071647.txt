I thought this was a solid daytime moisturizer. I think they could have skipped adding the SPF in since it’s not enough to wear without another sunscreen on top. It smells like sunscreen which I don’t mind since I already wear it daily. I wish it had a pump instead of the spatula. The spatula is easy to loose since there’s no way to connect it to the package. solid daily moisturizer
