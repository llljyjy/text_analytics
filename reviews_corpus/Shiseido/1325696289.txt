This surprisingly did not break me out. But it was way to greasy for my face. It sat on my skin weirdly. I even rubbed it in and it still was super greasy. This also smudges makeup and did not glide over makeup like I read in other reviews. For convenience this is great! But I will most likely not buy again because the greasiness. Also, I used this up too fast. Just ok
