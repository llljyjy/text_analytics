I prefer the SPF version of this cream but this one isn’t bad. Shockingly, I feel like this version is oilier than the spf version which is usually opposite. Who knows. I will probably use this version more at night once for the extra moisture. I do like how soft this moisturizer makes my face feel and it is lightweight enough that my face doesn’t feel heavy. Would def recommend! I like it
