I rarely ever go a day without wearing spf on my face, but finding the right spf moisturizer can be a hassle. I LOVE how smooth the application for this is and the fact that it has no scent and is oil free. I have really oily skin and found that this was amazing for shine control, but still left my skin looking hydrated. The one thing I didnâ€™t like was the white cast is pretty significant for tanner skin, which mostly subsided after being on for a couple minutes, but kind of limited how much I felt like I could put on. Overall, I would recommend! Perfect for make-up free days or under make-up!
