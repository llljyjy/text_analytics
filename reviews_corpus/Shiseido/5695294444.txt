I received this product complimentary for my honest review. I really loved how this did not smell like traditional sunscreen and was not too thick. I have a moisturizer with spf as part of my skin care routine and wouldn’t dare put traditional sunscreen on my face. I would use this on my face. It is light and smells great, does not contribute to any natural occurring oils. If you have the money and means to use this I say it’s worth it! Luxe sunscreen
