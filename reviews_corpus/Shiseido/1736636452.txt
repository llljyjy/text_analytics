For me, there’s nothing better than being outside in the hot summer weather, basking in the sun’s glow. While I’m spending time outside I always make sure to wear sunscreen so that I can fully enjoy myself without having to worry about the sun’s damaging effects. I recently received Shiseido Urban Environment Water Resistant Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 42 complimentary in exchange for my honest review. Let me tell you, I’m so glad that I did.  While I don’t find it necessarily important for me to wear a water resistant sunscreen 9 months out of the year, summer where I reside, seriously brings the heat. I love the hot weather and wouldn’t change it for a thing, however, sweating and being in a body of water is my reality for a few beautiful months. Shiseido sunscreen is moisturizing and oil-free. It doubles as a primer and looks great under my makeup. I happen to love that they came out with a water-resistant formula. Knowing that I can go to the beach, swim in the lake or take a hike without having to worry about my sunscreen washing or sweating off is a huge relief. Summer is my favorite season and Shiseido is one of the products I rely on that allows me to enjoy all activities to the fullest. I highly recommend this product. Just don’t forget to reapply.
