The packaging of this product is extremely high quality and stunning! There is a scent, but itâ€™s pleasant. I love that it is a hydrating moisturizer with sunscreen in it; on casual (no extreme sun days) it saves me an extra step. I would highly recommend this morning, hydrating moisturizer! best moisturizer and sunscreen combo!
