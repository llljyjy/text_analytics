I was super excited to receive this complimentary from Influenster. I was looking for a new daily moisturizer and this is it. The bottle is sleek and classy. The cream is incredibly smooth and semi thick. It has a great fresh smell, not too harsh and I think the price point makes sense. It’s around $40. I think that’s reasonable for a good moisturizer and the container is a great size. Definitely worth the money. This pairs well with my primer and my make up. I definitely feel more hydrated when wearing it alone. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a new moisturizer. Also: Fun Fact: Shiseido’s name implies “richness of life,“  which I thought was so unique considering the richness of this cream. Richness of life
