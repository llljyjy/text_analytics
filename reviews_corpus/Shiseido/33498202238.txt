There is actually a reason to need different sunscreens!  I tried the Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free Sunscreen SPF 42 and LOVED it!  So perfect, especially since it acts as a primer and thus works beautifully under makeup.  Why would I need another one for daily sunscreen?  But then I also tried this version of “Fresh-Moisture” and I see the light!  Whereas the Oil-Free one leaves you with a hydrated yet matte finish, the Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen SPF 42 gives a dewy, radiant finish that maintains your skin’s moisture for 12 hours!  Thus, different reasons to use each type of sunscreen. As with the Oil-Free version, this one also contains hyaluronic acid for boosting moisture, but also has pearl light powder for more even-looking skin tone.  Free of oxybenzone, octinoxate, and paraben, this sunscreen is definitely good for your skin and for the ocean! Skin Boosting Sunscreen
