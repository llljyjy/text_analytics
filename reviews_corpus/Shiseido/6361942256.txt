I’m on a strict skincare routine through my dermatologist that includes needing to wear a fave sunscreen daily. I would usually moisturize then add sunscreen but with this product it makes my routine faster since its SPF and moisturizer. It’s not super oily / greasy - it’s lightweight but also doesn’t make you feel dry! I really like it! Love
