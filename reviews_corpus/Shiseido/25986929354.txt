I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for an honest review. I was super excited to review this item, as I have been looking for a matte sunscreen that also had some active ingredients, such as hyaluronic acid. I found it interesting that this was a tinted mineral sunscreen, as I have only used a chemical sunscreen in the past and was pretty nervous that it would leave a white cast. The application was easy and the product came out with a fairly liquid consistency and orange to brown hue. I found that the product unfortunately left a pretty noticeable white cast on my skin, even after attempting to rub it in for over a minute. I am not sure if the tint just didnâ€™t match well with my skin tone, but it was definitely visible even from a far away distance. Shiseido does state that this product can be used as a primer, and I believe that it would do a great job in that use because it left my skin super matte and prepped, however, for someone that does not want a sunscreen to be visible, I would probably recommend another product. I did wear it for a full day and I did not notice my skin being extra oily, and it did keep the matte appearance for the full eight hours. I love that this sunscreen attempts to add actives and serves a dual purpose, I just think that the formulation and tint is not the best for someone with some medium to dark skin tones. Good Product for Lighter Skin Tone
