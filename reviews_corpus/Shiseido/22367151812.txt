I’m impressed how much this formula doesn’t leave my skin oily and left with a white cast as other sunscreen products have in the past. This feels ultra lightweight and double downs as a skincare and sun protectant which I love! Shiseido products are a bit pricey but this product goes a long way so this will last a long time. This has a very light scent which I love and is perfect for no makeup or full makeup wear days! Great!
