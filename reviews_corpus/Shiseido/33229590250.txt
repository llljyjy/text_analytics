I received this sunscreen free from Influenster and Shiseido thank you very much!!I do like the formula I like that it’s hydrating it’s great for the climate that I’m in because it’s hot and very sunny where I liveI also love the fact that it has hyaluronic acid in it that’s a great addition to any skin care routine I do wish however that had a better smell something more indicative of summertime Hydrating
