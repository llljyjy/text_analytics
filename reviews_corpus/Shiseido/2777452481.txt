I tried Shiseidoâ€™s Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 42.  I did find this formula to be somewhat moisturizing.  My skin has been a little dry lately, so it quickly absorbed the product.  I love that this sunscreen goes on smoothly and does not feel greasy like other sunscreens do.  I will definitely buy when I run out. Non-Greasy Sunscreen
