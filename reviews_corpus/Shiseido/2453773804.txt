As the weather heats up, I’m always less inclined to wear makeup. Thanks to this SPF moisturizers, my otherwise naked skin can still be protected. This sunscreen is not oily and doesn’t have the typical sunscreen feel. It very much feels like a moisturizer, and I like knowing it has high SPF protection. If you’re looking for ways to protect your skin under the summer sun, look no further! Really good!
