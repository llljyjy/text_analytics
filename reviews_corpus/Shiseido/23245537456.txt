I really love this formula. I have dry skin and I like it better than the moisturizing. This is a light, muddy colored, liquid spf that is super lightweight, doesnâ€™t really smell at all, and when applied it has a slight white cast. After a few it sinks in though. Then it got oily, but then it dried down for me. I actually like it. I would recommend. This dried down great!
