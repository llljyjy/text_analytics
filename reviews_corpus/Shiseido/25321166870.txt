I love the light mixable texture of this product. It could be a tiny bit thicker for my preferences, but I use less this way. It goes on smoothly and isn’t greasy. It doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin like some others I’ve tried. I am, however, very pale. Once it’s on, it’s so lightweight I feel like I have nothing on my skin. But I’m still protected from the sun! I use mineral sunscreen daily and this is one of the best I’ve tried! Light and works great for daily wear
