I think I found my face’ new best friend. I tend to breakout due to greasy serums. This is very light weight and drys fast enough. I was looking to see ity face lightened more but didn’t notice. I feel more of a glow than it lightening. Most importantly,leaves my skin very supple. I gave this 5 stars because it is absolutely worth it. Love it
