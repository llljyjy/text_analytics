the best facial cottons ever. maybe I am a sucker and fell for the marketing into paying three times the price of regular cottons, but I love these. they are smooth, soft, and never abrasive. they are sturdy and perform superbly at removing all makeup including eye makeup. they last for a long time because I only wear makeup like once a month. Soft, Sturdy, Smooth
