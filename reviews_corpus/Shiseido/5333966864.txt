Honestly this product missed the mark for me. It was the first product from this brand to try and I was not wowed. I don’t feel it is necessary to have in your skincare routine. There were zero noticeable differences. Sure it soaked in quickly and felt nice on the skin but apart from that it just wasn’t what I thought it would be. Overall, do not recommend. Don’t Waste Your Money
