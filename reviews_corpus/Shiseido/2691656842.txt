Someone recommended this to me and it does not disappoint. I’ve always been bad about sunscreen because most make me breakout but this is the perfect solution and had totally made me a sunscreen person. It’s more liquid than most sunscreens, goes on flawlessly, no residue or piling, smells is mild and it works SO well under makeup. Couldn’t recommend more. I’m a Sunscreen Person Now
