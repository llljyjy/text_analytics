I received this product for free in return for my honest review from Influenster and Shiseido. I tried this sunscreen two ways; with and without moisturizer. Right away I noticed the white cast when applying, but it seemed to disappear after rubbing it in and letting it sit. I actually appreciated the white cast because it really let me see where I was putting the sun screen and the ability it gave me to apply a thorough application. It did not pill when I applied my serum foundation on top and worked pretty well as a primer! My skin felt too dry without the use of moisturizer so the following day  I applied after moisturizer and had no issue with pilling either.All in all, Iâ€™m happy with this sunscreen  and  am glad to add it to my daily routine. Great, non greasy formula.
