I received this product complimentary from Influenster for my honest thoughts and opinions. I have using this serum for a few weeks now and have been thoroughly enjoying it. It is a nice formula that sinks into my skin without leaving it feeling oily or greasy. I have sensitive combination oily skin and this product has not caused any issues. The bottle also feels very luxurious. Itâ€™s made of heavy red gradient glass with a pump for dispensing product. I will continue to use in my everyday skincare routine.
