I received this for free from Influenster & Sephora in return for my honest review. Overall an awesome product! Silky, smooth and absorbed incredibly well. Not sticky or thick like normal sunscreens. Only issue was the strong scent. Not for me. Would highly recommend if you donâ€™t mind the smell. Great Sunscreen!
