This was the first time I was introduced to Shiseido products. I was excited because my skin has been a little dry lately. I loved the packaging but most of all I liked the applicator/scooper that was included. Genius!!! I can’t stand getting product in my nails when I scoop the product out. I wish more products would follow suite.So I like scented products, I can’t put my finger on how I feel with the scent I feel like at times it’s not really scented and other times it has a hint of rubbing alcohol scent.Now to the nitty gritty, I liked that there was SPF included in the product, not really a high level but some is always better than none. I usually like to purchase a moisturizer with SPF so definitely a plus. Once applied my skin did feel more hydrated and it was super lightweight.I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion. nan
