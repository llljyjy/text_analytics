Product left a white cast but I do appreciate that they added a tint to it. This sunscreen goes on smooth and absorbs nicely as long as you don’t use too much. I wear this under my makeup and it doesn’t break me out. I would recommend that they add a broader tint range. Nice formulation and I would recommend for sensitive skin too. Nice sunscreen
