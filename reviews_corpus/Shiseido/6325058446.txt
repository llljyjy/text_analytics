REVIEW THE CLAIMS! I can’t stand when people give something a poor rating because it didn’t meet what they thought it should do- not what it actually claims to do! It is spot on with what it states it’s to do! It is extremely light weight. A little goes a long way and when used correctly it does NOT have a white cast. I have large pores in the center of my face and an oily t-zone with dry patches around my mouth. It felt great. I was on the beach in Florida for about 6 hours and the only thing that got burnt was a corner of my foreheads where I forgot to put it. This will forever be my go-to! REVIEW THE CLAIMS!
