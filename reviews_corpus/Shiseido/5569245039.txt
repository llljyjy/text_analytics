#shiseidosuncare #complimentary @shiseido @Influenster I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is a very nice hydrating SPF moisturizer which I love. I use this product as my second step of my morning routine, the first is my vitamin C. I usually wait a few minutes after applying it and top it off with setting powder to control the shine or apply foundation. It is smooth, lightweight, absorbs well, and lasts a whole day. I would love to see it tinted that will be 5 stars for me. 2 in 1
