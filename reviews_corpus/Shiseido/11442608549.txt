I recently tried Shiseido’s new essential energy hydrating cream and am in love with it. It is very similar to the essential energy hydrating cream that contains spf in it. This cream is ultra hydrating and helps replenish moisture to my skin when it gets really dried out. The best part about it is that it doesn’t leave a thick oily residue on your skin and it can be worn during the day and at night. It also doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin which is an added bonus! The packaging is also eco friendly and you can buy refill pods which helps reduce plastic waste! Would recommend trying this wonderful cream! nan
