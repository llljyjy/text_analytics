OK, I am a bit of a skin care junkie so I was so excited to get this product. I used it both morning and night. My morning routine consisted of a vitamin C serum, niacinamide serum, this Shiseido product, followed with sunscreen. My nighttime routine starts off with niacinamide, followed by this product, then tretinoin, and finish with a night cream and slugging. This had been my routine for quite some time prior to getting this product. Once I added this and I didn’t notice a huge difference but I do enjoy using it. Perhaps it has decreased some of my redness and skin irritation. I have only gotten through about 1/4 of the bottle and I like it enough to continue until it’s finished. Obviously with many skin care Products you need to use them long-term to see results. This is a great trusted brand so I do believe that the longer I use it the more I’ll like it. The price point is pretty high and I think I would have a hard time justifying it at this moment given the current progress. It does contain alcohol which can be irritating for some people but strangely my super sensitive skin didn’t experience any issues. There are so many products that are irritating to my skin and cause blemishes but thankfully this did not. nan
