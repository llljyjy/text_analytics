I received this product Free to use from Influenster. I was excited to try a sunscreen I hadn’t used before and I wasn’t disappointed. This 1 oz. bottle of sunscreen wipes on nicely without a strong scent, no scent that I can smell and seems to last for awhile. I burn easily in the sun and most other sunscreens make my skin itch over time and or burn. Not with this product. I think this great and from what I researched, also Cruelty-free. Which means a lot to me. I like this product, but the price tag is a bit steep for me; at around $35 for only 1 oz. At that price, I would have to use sparingly, but that would deceive the purpose of protecting all your skin to exposure. Clean, non greasy, unscented sunscreen
