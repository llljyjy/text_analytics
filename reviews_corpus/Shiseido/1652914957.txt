I liked this sunscreen for days when I’m not wearing makeup and am spending time outdoors.  It feels quite hydrating and isn’t too greasy, but definitely has an extra dewy finish I don’t think would pair well with makeup.  It stayed put on my walks in the Florida heat so will continue to use for everyday protection. nan
