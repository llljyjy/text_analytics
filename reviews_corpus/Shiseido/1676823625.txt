When one of my favorite brands sent me a package to review this product, I was excited. I normally apply spf daily, and reapply if I’m outside after a few hours. This product is great, it smells decent, does not bother my allergies. The consistency and ingredients appear to be in line with the brand’s other products. The spf works well. Good sunscreen
