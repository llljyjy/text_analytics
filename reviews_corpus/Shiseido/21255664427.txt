I received this thanks to Influenster and Sephora in exchange for my honest review.I have been using this product every day and so far I have really enjoyed using it. Ive used it on my face, I haven’t tried it with makeup but it absorbs easily. It has a creamy, non watery consistency that absorbs easily that I didn’t even notice after it was applied. Has a good spf of 42 and protects against uva,uvb, and pollution!I highly recommend this sunscreen! I’m so glad I could try it. Shiseido sun care
