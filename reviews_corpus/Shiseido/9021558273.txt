Really enjoyed this product. The packaging comes with a scoop so you don’t need to worry about potentially dirty hands in your face cream. My skin felt dewy and hydrated after use. It’s definitely a heavier moisturizer and would be good for dryer skin types. My only dislike is that the fragrance is pretty overwhelming. If you’re sensitive to that, I would not recommend. nan
