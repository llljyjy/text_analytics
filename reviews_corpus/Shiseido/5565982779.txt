I received Shiseido Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 42 free to try for my honest opinion. I love it! It has great skincare benefits. I do prefer the oil free formula over this one as my makeup applies better underneath it. This one I would prefer using when Iâ€™m not wearing any makeup! I do use sunscreen on my face daily, per my dermatologist and I will be changing to this brand! I definitely recommend. I love it Great
