Very moisturizing, I did feel as though it took a bit of time to get absorbed/felt a bit of a “greasy residue.” I put this on before makeup so I felt like I did need it to be fully dry. The fragrance is strong - reminiscent of a department store perfume counter, a bit overwhelming and “old lady” smelling. I prefer something with a more natural scent. Overall I do feel like it gave me the moisture I was looking for that lasted throughout the day. I’ll continue to use and hope to see more of a difference come summer time when I’m outdoors more. nan
