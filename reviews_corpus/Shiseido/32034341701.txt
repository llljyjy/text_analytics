Have fallen in love with this sunscreen! The mineral sunscreen is very light and silky. It has a small glimmer to it and makes my face glow with a matte finish. Itâ€™s a runny formula which has hyaluronic acid, and melts into my skin easily. High-level SPF 42, which is important to me and my face regimen. Will buy again!!!*This product was provided by Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. Lovely Glow, Yet Matte!
