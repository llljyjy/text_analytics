I am ridiculously pale and this leaves *me* with a slight white cast for at least a few minutes. It’s nice and thin but clings to dry patches, pills if your skin isn’t perfectly smooth/hydrated, and only blends in smoothly if you work it in an inch section at a time. There are far better sunscreens, don’t buy this just because of the brand name. not worth it
