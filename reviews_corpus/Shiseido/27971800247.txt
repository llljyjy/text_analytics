This cream is honestly amazing! I have dry/sensitive skin with very mild dark spots from acne scars. I used this daily for about 2 months now and my skin has improved so much! Itâ€™s hydrating enough that it gets me through the day without reapplying. My skin tone has evened considerably, and I rarely ever get blemishes now! If you struggle with dry uneven skin tone, I  would definitely give this a go! So amazing!
