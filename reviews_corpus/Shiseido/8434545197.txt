I absolutely love this product. The smell is wonderful and not too overpowering, in my opinion. After applying my skin feels velvety smooth and hydrated, never greasy. I use it in conjunction with my vitamin C serum and have noticed changes in my skins texture and discoloration, both have evened out. I love it! Definitely recommend! It is a little pricey, but a little goes a long way and it lasts a long time. Awesome
