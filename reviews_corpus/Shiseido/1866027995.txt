I was really ready to be blown away by this product since it was developed by such a sought after brand but I have to admit, I was a little disappointed. The packaging didn’t really stand out in any way and the product itself, although it did an adequate job moisturizing, was a little thicker than I would have liked. My skin felt heavy and I had to make sure to wash my face thoroughly every night or would see breakouts pop up much more easily than normal. I felt like the texture was goopy and as a result clogged my pores a bit. I don’t see myself investing in this product in the future but am still open to experiencing other products available from this brand which I generally hear great reviews. nan
