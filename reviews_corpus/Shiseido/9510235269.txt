This product is pretty good. The cream is super rich and hydrating. It also has other skin care pluses. I enjoy the packaging it’s super lux and comes with the spoon to get product out with so you don’t taint the product by touching it. This cream does however have super strong skincare scent! Which isn’t my favorite thing but also not the worst. nice
