I have been a Shiseido fan for years and this day cream does not disappoint! I’ve actually replaced my other luxury moisturizers for this! The fragrance is light, it wears well under makeup, it’s hydrating and provides good spf! I have worn this everyday for about 3 weeks and I can’t get enough of it! Run don’t walk! a must have
