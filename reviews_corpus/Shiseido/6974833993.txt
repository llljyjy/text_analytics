I’ve been using the serum for a good amount of days and it is amazing! I struggle with hormonal acne and this has calmed it. It leaves my face looking radiant and feeling smooth. I appreciate that it’s not greasy or oily. My face feels moisturized without even adding anything else to it. An amazing serum!
