This review is for the combination version of this sunscreen not the mineral one. For some reason Sephora lumps the reviews together. I am specifically talking about the one that uses Ensulizole, Homosalate, Octisalate and Zinc Oxide as the filters.I was very excited to use this product since it uses more modern filters than any US sunscreen. The consistency is pretty watery and goes on smooth. Even though it says its oil free it does feel oily on the skin upon application. The oily feeling does dry down but never truly goes away. My biggest issue with this sunscreen is the white cast. I consider myself to be quite pale, but this sunscreen left me with a pinkish white cast that never went away. I wonâ€™t be repurchasing as the white cast and the price point make it not worth it for me. A lot of money just for a white cast
