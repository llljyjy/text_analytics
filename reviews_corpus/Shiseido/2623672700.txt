I like the concept of this product. It is convenient and doesn’t pill or burn. However, it does clog my pores and I do get a zit or 2 every time I use it. It doesn’t cause a full breakout but will clog my pores enough to cause a pimple or two. It also stays really tacky and attracts dirt. I wouldn’t but it again but will probably finish using it. Close but not for me.
