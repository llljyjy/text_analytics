I have been using products in this line for years, and this sunscreen is a must-have for summertime and any occasions that one shall need some SPF protection. It sets perfectly to my dry skin and creates a natural look after applying only a small amount. I usually use it under my foundation and concealer, and it serves as a good “primer“ as well. I use it on my face and body, a whole bottle will last me at least one summer, sometimes even longer. The smell is refreshing, and I have never had a problem with the product-- no allergy, no irritations or so. I was gifted this product for testing love it
