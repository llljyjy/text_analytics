I used to think, “how could there be that much difference in cotton pads?“.  A Sephora rep recommended these and now if I have to use a “regular“ cotton pad, it feels so crappy.  These are esp great for eye makeup removal, since our skin is so thin and sensitive in that area.  Never pills, never scratches, great price for a lot of payoff. Be nice to your skin!
