This helps waken my skin up in the morning. I’ve noticed a difference in a week. My red areas around my nose are gone, my skin tone is more even and even glowy. I’ve struggled with dull dry skin on my face and this is a game changer. It does have sunscreen but the smell is not overwhelming, it does irritate my eyes if I get it too close. nan
