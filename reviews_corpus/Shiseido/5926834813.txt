I love this product! I have combination more dry skin for reference. It is quite creamy but not oily for my day time use. It also has spf which is good for day use but not enough since it’s only SPF25. It does have a little scent that reminds me of my grandmother’s moisturizer back in the day but then she loved skin care then so I hope it helps with my skin care regimen. I don’t mind the smell so it’s okay for me. Good Moisturizer
