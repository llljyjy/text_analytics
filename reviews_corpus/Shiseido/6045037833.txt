I love this formula.  My skin is combination but this doesn’t make it too greasy.  I love that it has hyaluronic acid—this doubles as my AM moisturizer.  My skin feels dewy and I often just use this and skip the foundation for a more natural look.  The scent is light and pleasant. Gives a lovely dewy look
