This cream does wonders. I am such a fan of Shiseido products and this one hits it out of the park. The texture is thick but goes on smooth and is somehow very lightweight. The cream is very moisturizing and the fact that it provides spf coverage is awesome. The scent is somewhat floral and just smells lovely in general. Would 100% recommend and buy 1000x over. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. Amazing.
