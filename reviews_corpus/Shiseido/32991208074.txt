Love it!! Goes on well under makeup. Smells amazing, not over powering, no greasy residue. I did receive it as a 2 pack which did not direct what one to use first, or if you use both, so I applied them both. I highly recommend, and would purchase again. I am wearing it since I will be outside all day for Easter ☺️ Love it!
