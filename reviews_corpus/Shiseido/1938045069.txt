I live in a pretty cold/dry climate, so in the winter, my skin gets super dry, including dry patches. even with exfoliating, itâ€™s still pretty dry and I had been having a hard time finding a good face lotion that would help with this and still looks good under my makeup. after about a week of using this morning and night, my skin looked a million times better and my dry patches were gone :) it also held up with my foundation which is a major bonus!! highly recommend! It also comes with a cute little scoop too which I thought was really nice! nan
