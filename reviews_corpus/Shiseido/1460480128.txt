Following the trial of this same moisturizer with the SPF, I was excited to try it without. First things, the heavy SPF scent isnâ€™t there, so the overall scent is mild and much gentler on your nose. Included is the added nenefit of hyaluronic acid. Made with no mineral oils. This cream is lightweight and really moisturizes well, especially on my dry skin. It works for many skin combinations. I practically glow following application. After a few weeks of use, my problem areas have resolved with less redness, clearer skin, and my face is velveety smoothe. 10/10. Hydrated and Clear Skin..
