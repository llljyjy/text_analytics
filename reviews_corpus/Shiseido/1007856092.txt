It’s good, but not sure it’s worth the price. It has a fairly strong alcohol scent, and that probably helps it sink into the skin. I will say it didn’t leave any tachy feeling and did sink in pretty quickly on my combo/oily skin. It also played well with my moisturizer and did fine under makeup. While it didn’t leave me “greasy“ like many serums can, I don’t know that my skin was hydrated either. Just not sure on this one. Fine, not sure it's worth the price
