I received this product through Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  I was really excited to try this Moisturizing SPF with Hyaluronic Acid.  I live in FL and wear SPF daily.  This product had a really pleasant mild scent and felt really good on my skin.  I felt moisturized but not oily. SPF with Hyaluronic Acid
