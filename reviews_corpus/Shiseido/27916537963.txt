At first application ot went on greasy but absorbed completely! I wore makeup over it and my makeup wore off a little quicker but my face was well protected from the sun and it didnâ€™t clog my pores or cause a breakout like other sunscreens do! I use this every time we go to the lake. The convenient size makes it easy to slip in my lake bag! Beauty protection and total absorption.
