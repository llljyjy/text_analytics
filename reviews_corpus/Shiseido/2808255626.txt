I was a bit surprised that with it beginning labeled “urban dual sun care” sunscreen they would take into consideration darker skin tones . While I loved the beautiful and vibrant packing of the product. As well as, the sleek design. The fact that it’s oil-free, mineral and has hyaluronic acid in it is all great benefits to have, but it leaves a terrible white cast on darker skin. It goes on as a white thick liquid and has to be rubbed well into the skin. I understand the idea since it is a skin protectant against urban environment elements. So, I would recommend darker skin tones to use it as a primer which it states you can to prevent the white cast. You will still get the benefits of Sun protection, oil control and a moisturizer without the white cast on your skin. I would give it a 7 out of a 10. Better as a Primer
