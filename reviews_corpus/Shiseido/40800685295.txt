I only use sunscreen when I go to the beach, never in my life have I bought sunscreen to wear on a regular basis, believe me when I tell you that from now on I will keep buying this product, whenever I don’t wear makeup it makes my skin look so much better (it has a little bit of foundation color) and whenever I don’t wear makeup it does really work as a primer. My skin looks so much better, probably because it has been now protected for a little bit over a month. I like to put it all over my face, my neck and my hands.’ There’s still half of the bottle left. Buy buy buy! Love it
