I received these products for free via Shisheido & Influenster for my honest review. This came just in time for summer! Unfortunately in the past month and a half, we’ve pretty much had one full day of sun, but I know sunscreens can still protect you from the bad daylight, so I’ve used it a few times a week in different situations. It’s served really well as a makeup primer! I’ve used this with a CC cream and under foundation and in no way does it feel heavy on the skin. The formula is light and slightly runny but nothing like most sunscreens I’ve tried. The scent is even pleasant too! I swear it helped keep my face less oily than most primers too! These bottles won’t last long at all! I love ittt!!!
