LOVE LOVE LOVE! The product, packaging, and the price point!Shiseido is at it again! This time serving sun-powered skincare with its new Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen SPF 42, containing hyaluronic acid. It protects you against not only UVA rays, but UVB rays and pollution as well. Sunscreen is a staple in my daily skincare routine. The sun-screens I have used in the past have not been oil-free like this one is, nor have they included skincare benefits.. I didn’t know what my combination skin was missing, until now.  It’s has a silk like application and leaves your skin feeling supple and smooth. Its super hydrating and absorbs into the skin so nicely. Think hydration nation without the excess oil. And the glow…. Girllll, the glowwww is just gorgeous! Dewy without the EWWY. This is a new holy grail item. Im so grateful I got the opportunity to try!I will be purchasing this again when I run out and I highly recommend you do so as well! Just do it
