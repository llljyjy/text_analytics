So pleased with this updated version.I’ve used this for years as my go to surf/cycling/running sunscreen. To my surprise, the new version is also “any day in the sun” wearable. Much lighter, protective and sinks right in the skin. Remember to shake the sucker! This has not clogged my pores, holds well after sweating and absolutely no irritation or redness on my combo sensitive skin. There is perfume but it is not as aggressive to me as the previous version.I am not sure why one would complain about oiliness or shine? Just use it over your toner and if you are prone to acne or comedons, use a serum under like the one from Caudalie Vinopure or nothing. I sincerely hope Shiseido will keep this formula that melts and protects any skin tone! Also, if you can, buy the edition Shiseido did with the World Surf League and help the oceans! Hope Shiseido will keep partnering with non profits who makes their bit for our ocean. Arigato real user review
