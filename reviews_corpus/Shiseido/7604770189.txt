The formula is not as lightweight as the oil free formula, but still feels light on the skin. The hyaluronic acid in it keeps my skin feeling hydrated and soft. It gives a dewy finish to the skin and helped even my skin tone because of the pearl light powder ingredient. I like to wear this on days I donâ€™t wear makeup since it helps with redness. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. Love it
