I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review, and is a part of an incentivized campaign. I was so excited to try their latest suncare innovation of Urban Environment Oil-Free Mineral Sunscreen SPF 42 that is the perfect sunscreen for everyday protection, along with great skincare benefits as well! It features 100% mineral UV filters, and is a very lightweight, oil-free mineral sunscreen that helps protect against harmful UV rays, helps hydrate my skin, and doubles as a face primer! It is infused with Hylaronic Acid to deliver, attract, and retain moisture in your skin. It also protects against harmful UVA/UVB rays and pollution, and only mineral UV filters are used. It is water resistant for up to 40 minutes, and love that it is an ocean friendly formula too! The texture is very lightweight and is fast-absorbing into my skin, and helps control oil and mattifies the skin leaving it feeling smooth & hydrated. I like that it has a pleasant light fragrance, and does not leave a white cast on my skin. You can wear it alone or under make-up and I apply it after my moisturizer. A little bit goes a long way, and I lightly dab it all over my face and neck; it absorbs beautifully, and leaves my skin looking dewy and fresh, and feeling so smooth and hydrated all day. I love that it is designed for all skin types, including sensitive skin, and love using this sunscreen as it protects my skin in sunny south Florida. I would highly recommend this dual care sunscreen to others, as it has now become a part of my daily skin care routine! My New Favorite Sunscreen!!!
