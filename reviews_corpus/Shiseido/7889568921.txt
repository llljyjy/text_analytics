I was really so excited to get this box, especially because of the price point of the product ($110/50mL) but I was DEVASTATED to see the ingredients.  The description boasts about these amazing ingredients but when you look at the ingredient list all the amazing things are at the very bottom. I also donâ€™t love fragrance in my skincare although I will say the smell is nice and clean.  At least the packaging is 10/10. I adore the sleek red bottle. Ehhh
