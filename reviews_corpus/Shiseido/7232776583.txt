LOVE those cream. Also have the cream with SPF, which I love, but this one is thinner, smoother, and doesnâ€™t have that hint of sunscreen smell. I do love having the SPF included in the other cream for a morning daily application, but this one is good for when you just need a refresher of hydration. Great stuff! Love this stuff!
