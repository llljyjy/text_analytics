This serum doesn’t have any strong scents or dyes. It applies easily and is absorbed nicely by the skin. It is easy to spread and is completely absorbed in a minute or so. It doesn’t make my skin feel greasy and lets it breathe. It can be used alone or under moisturizer. I use it alone. When I’ve worn it under makeup, it didn’t hinder the application process or anything like that. It keeps my skin hydrated and happy. I haven’t noticed any difference to my fine lines and wrinkles yet, but I’ve only been using it for a week and a half so far. Light, Non-Greasy, Gentle on my Sensitive Skin
