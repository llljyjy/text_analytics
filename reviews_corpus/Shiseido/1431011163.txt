Love, love, love this sunscreen! I have been wearing this now a few weeks and haven’t gotten sunburnt at all. This makes my skin feel luxurious and soft. It’s small enough to throw in your purse to make reapplication easy through out the day. The colors they chose are beautiful for the bottle. I also love the mixing ball in the bottle. I know that everything is blended wel together before I apply. It doesn’t leave that horrible white cast, doesn’t pill up and has yet to burn my eyes even when sweating. I would suggest this to anyone looking to add sunscreen to their routine (PS…do it!!) or to your their sunscreen game! Shiseido sunscreens are top of the line in my opinion! Try it…You won’t be disappointed!
