I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. No white cast and doesn’t pill with makeup! Such a good sunscreen. I wore this at the beach for hours in end and I didn’t get any unwanted sun. I’m acne prone and I haven’t experienced any breakouts yet (been using for a week and a half). Would definitely recommend! Worth a try!
