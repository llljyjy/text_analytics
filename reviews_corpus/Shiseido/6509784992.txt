I received this product for reviewing purposes…So when I tried this face sunscreen I was so surprised how liquidy it was, but once I applied it to my face, I fell in love! It’s like it just melted into my skin and I love how the product isn’t stark white, which usually throws a white cast when taking photos. It is a neutral beige color and in my opinion it will not show on any skin tone ranging from pale to super dark. It has a mixer ball which I like that way I know the product is thoroughly mixed. It did a great job when work under makeup. It didn’t grease my face or make my makeup slide off. I usually use Supergoop Glow Sunscreen, but this one is right next to it. It also left my face feeling hydrated and silky. Extra bonus! nan
