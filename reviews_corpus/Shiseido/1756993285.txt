I absolutely loved these new Shiseido spf products that Influenster sent me to try complementary! I’m a redhead who lives in Florida, so I’m serious about spf! This creamy formula is perfect alone or under a tinted moisturizer! I received these just before a trip to Miami and a trip to Spain so I put them to the test, and they’re great! No white cast and a great texture, so that’s a win win! Spf queen!
