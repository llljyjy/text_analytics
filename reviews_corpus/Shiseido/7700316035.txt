I was at first thrown off by the thin consistency, but I realize the product itself is so much more potent and easy to spread than most other sunscreens. It also has a slightly matte-fying effect which is great. My skin looks smooth and not at all oily. Love that itâ€™s a mineral based and oil free recipe! I received this from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love it!!! Smooth matte skin
