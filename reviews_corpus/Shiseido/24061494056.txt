This is a good hydrating cream. It made my skin feel hydrated,though it did make my skin feel tight later on and I’m not a fan of that. My biggest complaint is how strong the smell is. I get headaches from strong scents so I don’t use products that have that. So if you’re like me I wouldn’t use it,but otherwise it’s a good product. nan
