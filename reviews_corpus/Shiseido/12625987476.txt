I received this product free in exchange for my honest review! I have been using it a few weeks now and I really like it! It does make my skin softer, I think if I used it for a long term I would notice the anti-aging benefits and glow for sure. I love the scent, it’s light and rosy and the serum feels so great and cooling on my skin. I’m looking forward to continuing to use it and see how it improves my skin! nan
