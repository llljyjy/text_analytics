I love this product. It is so soothing on my skin and does help smooth skin for makeup application. My skin feels more hydrated and calmer after use. It also plays well with my moisturizers, primers, and foundations and I’ve tested it with several of each. That being said, it has some fairly intense claims in terms of smoothing fine lines and texture. I do see a small difference immediately after use but the jury is still out on long term impact after 4 weeks use. I would still recommend this as it is one of the better serums I’ve used. Excellent Product but...
