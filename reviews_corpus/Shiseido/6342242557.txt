I received this product from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. This cream is better than their one with SPF simply because it doesn’t have that super strong scent the other one has, however, I’m still not a fan of this cream. It leaves me feeling a little too tacky. It’s a basic cream, not really worth the price. Meh
