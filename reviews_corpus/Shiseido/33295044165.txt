I used this moisturizing sunscreen on my face and I absolutely loved the way it applied.  It rubbed right in and didnâ€™t leave a white or oily film like many sunscreens do.  It made my skin feel soft and ready for makeup application.  Another bonus is a little goes a long way! It has a very light and pleasant smell that is quite enjoyable. I would highly recommend this product as a facial sunscreen. Great facial sunscreen
