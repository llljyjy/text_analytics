Needs to be in a bigger bottle for $38 bucks! But this hydrated your skin, it’s light weight and is the one… lol I love it simply for not drying out my skin. It doesn’t smell like normal sun screen, I freaking love it. But the bottle legit wouldn’t last three days as much as I am on the beach or in the sun! bring on spring and summer now I’m ready!
