I was so delighted to get the chance to try out this incredible new sunscreen through Influenster! I can’t believe how well it plays with my foundation and how nicely it settles into the skin. It doesn’t leave any sort of cast even if you’re wearing it without foundation.I also feel like the sun protection this sunscreen offers is amazing! I’ve worn it out on several days where it was unbearably bright and not even noticed the slightest bit of redness, and I get a ton of redness even on a normal day! So I absolutely love the light texture, the lack of an annoying smell . . . Everything about it is awesome!I would definitely choose this over my other sunscreens because it’s not greasy either, and that’s the thing I can’t stand about most sunscreens. The packaging is also super cute and easy to bring places. A new fav for sure!
