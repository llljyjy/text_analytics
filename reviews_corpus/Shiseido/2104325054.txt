Love this cream! I’ve been using this for a few weeks and love how it feels on my skin. The consistency is very thick and has a pleasant sunscreen scent. The packaging is one of my favorite parts about it since it’s reusable. When you finish all the day cream just purchase another pot and refill! Smells great
