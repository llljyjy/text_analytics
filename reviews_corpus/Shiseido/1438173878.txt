I really like this sunscreen! I’ve been using it both with and without makeup on top. It doesn’t break my makeup down, which is nice. This sunscreen has a light fragrance to it and is not greasy at all. This has the normal sunscreen texture and feels like a light lotion going onto the face. I spent some time outside today while just wearing this sunscreen (no makeup on top) and didn’t burn at all! nan
