Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free Mineral Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 42 is a lightweight, oil-free sunscreen that protects against UV rays, hydrates skin, and can be used as a primer before makeup. I recommend shaking this well before applying and I appreciate that there is a shaker ball inside the bottle to help mix the product thoroughly! The sunscreen goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely on my skin. I use a nickel-sized amount for my face and add a little more for my neck and decolletage. The updated formula is infused with hyaluronic acid and other beneficial ingredients to boost hydration while controlling oil while protecting skin from sun. Love the compact packaging which did not leak for me. It is convenient to throw in a purse or beach bag so I could reapply throughout the day. I also love that the formula is similar to a lightweight, liquid lotion which absorbs so quickly into my skin. However...ultimately, this formula does not work well for me. Yes, it goes on beautifully like a serum and leaves my skin feeling nice without a tacky finish, but it also leaves my skin looking very unhealthy with a whitish, almost light gray cast. I have a light-medium skin tone with neutral to warm undertone and wear NARS foundation in Sante Fe, or Rare Beauty Positive Light Tinted Moisturizer in 30N. I tried several times to make Shiseidoâ€™s new sunscreen work and shook the bottle vigorously to mix the ingredients well! Sadly, it looks terrible on my skin if I wear it alone. Sadly, it leaves an obvious white cast on my skin and even throws off the color of my foundation as well. I had hopes for this, but it's not for me!
