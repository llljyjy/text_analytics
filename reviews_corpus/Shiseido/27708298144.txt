This product is a hyaluronic acid moisturizer, which really pushes forth the idea of getting proper moisture. However, I wasn’t very impressed with this product. After I put it on, it felt very “powdery” on my skin. I have combination skin and it didn’t moisturize my dry cheeks, but made my T zone more oily. The scent of the product was pleasant, but there’s better products out there for sure. Before this product, I tried another Shiseido product that was a moisturizer and sunscreen in one (please check out that review). In short, that moisturizer was FAR BETTER in comparison, and I’d recommend getting that one instead. For reference, the other product by Shiseido is the Hydrating Day Cream with SPF. shiseido hydrating day cream with spf is better.
