I like instant gratification, thatâ€™s why I almost stopped using this eye cream because after 2 weeks of consistent use I saw zero results and it made my eyes look oily. Well, it still makes my eyes look oily but now after a month and a half of using it my eyes definitely look healthier, the dark circles are much less visible, and I look much younger. It works but it takes patience. Worth the cost. Nothing is instant in skincare. Longterm results.
