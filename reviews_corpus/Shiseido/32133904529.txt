I really like this product. At first, it felt slightly greasy going on, however, after rubbing it in it no longer felt that way and absorbed well into my skin. This left my skin feeling moisturized. I gave it 4 stars due to the fragrance. Iâ€™m not big into heavy fragrance for items going on my face and this could irritate some with a fragrance sensitivity. Moisturizing
