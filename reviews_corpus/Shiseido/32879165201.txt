I really wish I found this sooner. Every lotion sunscreen makes me look so oily and gross, burns my eyes, leaves white casts, etc. But this one looks sooo good on my face and I can barely feel it, and is so convenient so I donâ€™t have to worry about my hands being dirty when reapplying. I love this and will continue purchasing! nan
