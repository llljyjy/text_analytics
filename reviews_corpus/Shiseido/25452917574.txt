I really like this cleanser, it has a lot of unique ingredients you can;t find in any other products that are generally K-Beauty ingredients, little granuals for cleansing (I barely notice them), and a frothy foam. It comes out almost like a thick clay but turns into a hydrating foamy cleanser that DEEPLY cleanses. It does leave my face feeling a bit squeaky but always thoroughly cleansed Frothy Foam!
