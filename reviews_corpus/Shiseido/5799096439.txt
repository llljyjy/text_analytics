I absolutely loved this serum. Got it from Influenster and I’m thrilled to review this. First of all the bottle is gorgeous, locks nicely and the box has a cute lid. The serum worked from day one, I applied it at night the very day I received it and the morning after my face was a lovely velvety thing, so moist and soft that it was amazing. It has a very faint scent that I do not mind at all, I love scented products. At first I used a whole pump but then realized that it was not necessary so I only use not even half a pump, I try to so drops at a time but is hard to do drops with a pump, however I do not mind it, I know my product is gonna last even longer. I think it’s still early to see results but I’ll definitely apply this til it runs out Shiseido sure knows its thing!
