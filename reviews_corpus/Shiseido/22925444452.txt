I’m a fan of Shiseido sunscreens. I already have have the Ultimate Sun Protector lotion and stick  in my sunscreen collection and love it. This ones pretty great too. No white cast. The smell is awesome for a sunscreen. Not chemically at all. Very light. Texture is a bit greasy that’s why I took off a star but other then that it feels great on. It’s very hydrating. Protects from the sun great. I’ve used this one for one day on the beach and two days during just a regular day. Works great does its job. Like the squeeze tube. This would be a great sunscreen. Specially for those with dryer skin. Great sunscreen!
