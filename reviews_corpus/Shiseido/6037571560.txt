I was really excited to try this because Shiseido is a great brand for the cosmetic line. The color was beautiful and blended nicely. HOWEVER, it didn’t work for my skin as I started to develop small bumps and a little irritation. I stopped there but decided to give it a try again the following week after the bumps somewhat lessened but it came back again. I’m sadden that I wasn’t able to use it daily. Sad it didn’t workout for my skin
