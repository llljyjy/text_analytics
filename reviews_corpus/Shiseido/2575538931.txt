I’ve been using this for about a week and my face has been feeling very moisturized and I’ve had no issues with breakout. I do think it makes me a little oily if just applying solo but I’ve been wearing makeup over and it takes away the shine. I love that is has spf and a pleasant scent too. Recommend
