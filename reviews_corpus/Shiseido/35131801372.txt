This is my first time trying a Shiseido sunscreen and I was impressed. It has a lightweight and watery texture. I LOVE how soft and silky my skin feels after applying it and the fact that it has no scent and oil free makes it ideal to wear under makeup. Another thing to notice is that it does not leave white cast. The size is great, you can take it wherever you go, travel or keep it in your purse. Ideal for all skin types, including sensitive skin.. However, it does give me a chalky white cast so Iâ€™d only wear this is a makeup primer nan
