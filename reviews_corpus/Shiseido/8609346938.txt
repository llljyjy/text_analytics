I love this and found it to work well under my foundation or applied alone. Rich, thick and has a soft scent. I felt protected in the southern sun! However, a day after use, my face began to itch so badly that I had to take allergy meds. It continued for 2 days. If you have sensitive skin, just be careful. Rich and hydrating, but made me itch.
