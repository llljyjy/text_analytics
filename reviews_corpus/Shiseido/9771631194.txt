Other than day-to-day use, I took this formula to the sun and heat in New Orleans, Honduras, Belize, and Mexico. This moisturizing and broad spectrum SPF 42 formula for the face is the one I’d use on days where I need a boost in hydration and am not worried about sweating. The fresh moisture version definitely took longer to sink into my skin, but it was worth it for the healthy glow I had from beginning of the day to end. The consistency feels like a true facial moisturizer and is silky.  As with the oil-free formula, there is zero white cast and nothing to be seen in photos. No reactions from my sensitive skin, and no burning eyes! Very light scent. Superior protection for my fair skin. At $38, would recommend and would buy.These two formulas are so interchangeable depending on what weather and environment you’re expecting. Hot, humid, go oil-free; cooler, dry, go moisturizing. As someone with dry combination skin, I love the adaptability. Hydrating Glow
