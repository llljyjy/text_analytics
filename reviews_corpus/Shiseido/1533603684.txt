I have combo skin but in the warmer months I get very oily. I wanted to love this sunscreen as it claims to be oil free but I found that after applying and letting it absorb into my skin it caused my foundation to separate. This sunscreen is perfect for a fresh face as it gives a beautiful glow to the skin but it didnâ€™t work out well for me under liquid foundation. nan
