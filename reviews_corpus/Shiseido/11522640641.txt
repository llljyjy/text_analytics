I’ll admit when I first received this I was somewhat disappointed for 2 reasons: First, it’s only Spf 20. 30 is the lowest I’ll go if I’m spending my own money. Second, it’s a thick cream so am I gonna slather my face in two finger lengths, or 1/4 tsp of this? The first dilemma was solved by Dear Husband, who asked why SPF 20 was such a big deal if I’m just in zoom meetings all day, away from direct sun, at least I’m getting something. What is he, a scientist now? This guy. The second issue was fixed by the fact that this cream is so luxurious and rich and melty that I gladly slathered it all over my face, as you can see in the last slide video. It looks oily but soaks in to a nice non greasy finish. I would of course layer my regular spf 50 over this before going outside, but I feel this is an excellent option for when I’m just in the house. I reapplied after a couple hours and had no issues except staying moisturized throughout the day. I don’t always remember to reapply if I’m in the house all day tho. Sue me. (You’ll get nothing, I’m poor.)The container is refillable and comes with a lil spatula. All in all I really enjoy this cream and would love a non spf version for nighttime. Wonderful day cream for lounging in house
