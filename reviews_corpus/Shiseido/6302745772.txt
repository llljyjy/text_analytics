i have very acne prone skin, so i often find that many sunscreens will break me out. however i was quite surprised to see that i did not break out from this, especially with the strong peach fragrance that i detected when putting it on. however, after a few days of wear, i found the area surrounding my eye to be very red and irritated. after i stopped using this sunscreen, the redness around my eyes soon faded. i attempted this sunscreen on a few occasions and every time the redness around my eyes appeared. i have started using this on my body as an alternative and it has presented itself with no irritation. the consistency is very nice because it leaves no white cast, and instead gives the feeling of a silicone makeup primer (not sure if there is silicone in this) but the fragrance is extremely strong! nan
