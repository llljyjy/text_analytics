I ran out of my kiehls creamy avocado eye cream, but instead of repurchasing it I figured I would get something with a bit more anti aging properties considering the prior is just a basic moisturizing eye cream. Unfortunately this is just a more expensive version of the other eye cream: Very hydrating, but zero improvement with lines (both fine and deeper crows feet.) Oh well...On to the next! Expensive moisturizer
