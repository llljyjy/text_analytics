I truly really liked this serum. It’s a very lightweight serum that glides on smoothly and is easy to layer my thicker moisturizer on top to really lock in all that moisture. I noticed a difference in my skin after about a week. My skin looked more radiant and felt nice and firm. I feel like it’s really been helping me during these summer months when my skin would normally look dull and feel dry. Its a nice size bottle which has lasted me a long time Accentuate that Glow
