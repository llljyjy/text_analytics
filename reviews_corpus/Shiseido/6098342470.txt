I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I tried it one morning as part of my overall skincare since I use daily sunscreen already. My complexion skintone is medium naturally dark bronze colored as an African Anerican/Black person and this did not work for me. It left a sticky white cast that could not be blended in and sat on top of my skin. It also dried out any patchy spots I had from an acne breakout that was healing. I let my lighter complexioned multiracial daughter use it, and was slightly better. I ended up giving to my husband who is white/French Canadian/European descent and that worked fine for him on a sunny beach day when he normally burns easily. Wished it worked out better for me since I know this is a reputable line of products. Just not a good fit for my skintone and skin issues. Not for my skintone due to white cast and texture
