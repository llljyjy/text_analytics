This serum claims to boost radiance, increase hydration and improve the visible signs of aging by diminishing wrinkles with just one bottle. The only claim I can comment on is the first, as I have not been using it long enough to report on the others. I used it for three days straight, morning and night, as stated in the radiance claim and saw no significant difference in the appearance of my skin. The serum does have a really nice texture and blends well with my other skincare items, so that is a plus! However, it has a rose fragrance. I personally can’t use products with this scent as I have allergies. I found the serum irritated my eyes because of this. I don’t think I will be able to use this product long term because of this either. I would recommend this product though for anyone who doesn’t have an issue with the scent. Lovely serum
