Honestly, very bummed. I was totally taken a back when I tried this because Shiseido is known for having great quality products. However when I applied this I felt like it dragged against my skin. I’m fairly pale and the first thing I noticed was an immediate white cast, it almost made me look gray/sick. It also had emphasized the dry patches of skin on my nose that weren’t noticeable before this was applied. I will say I appreciate how thin the formula was and it being fragrance free. Sunscreen
