I normally have issues with moisturizer with the sunscreen. Anytime I apply them to my face, I get the burning sensational. I have always struggled finding a good sunscreen for the face and I’m glad I got a chance to try Shiseido sunscreen moisture. This is perfect for me. It leave my skin hydrated for hours and gives the dewy look. The best part is spf 42 doesn’t burn. It’s completely paraben free, lightweight, and does not feel sticky. The best part is it doesn’t leave white residue on the face and works well under the makeup. Must try!! Doesn’t burn!
