I love that this is a mineral sunscreen!  As someone that has had melanoma, I use sunscreen every day.   This is a perfect sunscreen to wear under makeup.  It’s light and absorbs well.  Gives the perfect amount of hydration and acts as a light primer.  I feel like my skin looks smoother and healthier after switching and trying this.   I use about two fingers worth to cover my face and then add a little more to cover my neck and upper chest.  I wouldn’t suggest using alone (meaning not under makeup) as it did give a slightly light/white cast. Perfect Face Sunscreen!
