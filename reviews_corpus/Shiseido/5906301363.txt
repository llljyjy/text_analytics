This sunscreen is, well, just fine. there’s nothing particularly special about it, but it’s also not bad. My one major critique is that the bottle is quite small and to use the amount of product that you really need for sunscreen to be effective, you still go through it very quickly, so I don’t think it’s worth the price. Just Fine
