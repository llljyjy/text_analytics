This is a 100% chemical sunscreen, which I typically avoid due to personal preference. It contains 10% homosalate, 5% octisalate, 5% octocrylene, and 2% avobenzone. The texture of this is a rich cream and it applies easily. This left absolutely no white cast, which was expected due to no physical sunscreen components. There is definitely a scent, but it was more tolerable than some sunscreens. The finish let me very hydrated, almost too much. Since I have oily combo skin that is more oily in summer, this is definitely too heavy for me right now. I could definitely see using this in the winter though. Perfect for Dry Skin
