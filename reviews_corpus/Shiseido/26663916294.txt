I used to use the value size Biossance Zinc + Squalane sunscreen before this which I liked, but I never wanted to carry it in my bag due to fear of it popping open. On a whim I purchased this product and I haven’t looked back since. It goes on CLEAR. Whitecast is NOT a thing with this product! It spreads across your skin beautifully and it leaves you with this nice dewy glow! AND IT’S NOT MESSY! Perfect for throwing in your bag for reapplying on the go! "I love this product" is an understatement!
