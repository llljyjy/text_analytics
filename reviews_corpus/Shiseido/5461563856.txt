Literally never going back to regular cotton pads. These are so soft and luxurious. I have extremely sensitive eyes but use waterproof mascara (the only thing that will hold a curl in my lashes.) When I use these with my makeup remover I have significantly less irritation than using a drug store cotton pad. I found no matter what, drug store cotton pads felt scratchy and less soft. For 11 dollars this is an amazing product. nan
