Finally got a chance to try this since we had a beautiful sunshiney day today!! I really like the texture of this product very lotion like opposed to that gloopy texture some sunscreens can have. I also think it smells really nice for a sunscreen, it has a hint of sun screen smell but is way more of a fresh neutral scent which I liked! And the best part is itâ€™s a moisturizer and left my skin feeling refreshed not dry or sticky! I really liked this product! nan
