I tried this product out for three weeks. I love the feel of the serum on the face, very moisturizing and light weight. After application, the skin definitely feels plump and hydrated. Sits well under make-up. However, I don’t see any long-term results at this point. But then again, I don’t have too many skin issues. I will definitely keep using this product and update if I see any more long term changes in my skin! 4/5
