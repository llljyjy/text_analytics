The most lightweight primer and SPF I’ve ever used. It’s very liquidy, wish it was a bit thicker. No white cast. It worked well under makeup but it didn’t work well as a primer or moisturizer, I would still recommend your regular routine and adding this for SPF. I have normal skin type. Make sure to shake the product before use each time or else the product comes out separated. It’s a nice product but I wouldn’t purchase this nan
