I really liked this sunscreen as a great everyday facial sunscreen! It feels nice and clean and doesn’t make me feel sticky or like something won’t soak into my skin. I can wear it alone or under makeup, which I really like. I have sensitive skin and this sunscreen also doesn’t irritate me in any way! Love, love, love it and will definitely be buying more when this bottle is out. Just Right!
