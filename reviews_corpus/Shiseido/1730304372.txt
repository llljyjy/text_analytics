I’m not much of a daily sunscreen person, but I do like how lightweight this is. It does not have an overwhelming smell. It is easy to use. I don’t know how well it protected me from the sun because like I said I don’t usually wear sunscreen daily so I don’t have anything really to compare it to I would recommend this to a friend.  Since you don’t need much, this will last you quite a while, making it a great value! nan
