Thank you so much to Influenster & Shiseido for sending me this in exchange for my honest review. So far I have been loving this sunscreen for myself. It’s extremely light weight with a water like consistency. It is tinted & the tint is very pale so unfortunately it will probably leave a white cast on anyone who is not super pale. It didn’t seem to break me out or sting my skin. Very moisturizing. I just wish there wasn’t as much of a tint so more people could enjoy it. I hope they’ll change the fact that it’s tinted or do something to make it more accessible to those with darker skin in the near future because other than that it’s a very good sunscreen. Great but definitely room for improvement
