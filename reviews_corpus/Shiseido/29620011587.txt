I live in a very polluted city, and my skin congest so much, I’ve tried everything to calm and restore it and never thought that could be possible without doing heavy acid peelings at the spa. This is a wonderful option, never tried Japanese cosmetics before but this is definitely a WIN. You need to try I’m sure mature complexion can take the best from this actives. In love!!! My skin's savior!
