Great product, smells good with just a lightsunscreen scent (still smells like summer!) The sun isn’t strong enough yet out here in MN, but when putting this on the first thing I noticed was how lightweight it was! I forgot I used it within 30 seconds of spreading it. No sunscreen feeling at all, and somewhat melts on with the warmth of your skin. I’m super excited to try it out on a warm sunny day! Super Light Weight!
