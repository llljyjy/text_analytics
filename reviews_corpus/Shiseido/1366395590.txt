Urban Environment squeeze tube first impressionHas a medium weight texture with a glycerin moisturizing slip. Glides across the skin effortlessly and sinks in within 30 sec to 1 min and left my face feeling dewy and hydrated, appearing glowy but not greasy. Has what feels like a burst of cooling water effect on the skin. Skin feels plump and bouncy to the touch. Upon application there’s a strong scent of spf mixed with a light floral. 3 mins later can still smell it a little but it’s fading. 10 mins later can still smell it but my skin feels amazing so hydrated and plump. After using for a few weeks: I don’t notice the smell lingering as much anymore but it’s still there. It’s really nice it’s so hydrating but not greasy that I can wear it alone or with a lightweight moisturizer underneath (my skin is normal to dry). This gives my skin a dewy beautiful glow! It’s a natural sheen that isn’t glittery or shimmery and it’s sooo nice. If you have dehydrated skin that doesn’t react to fragrance give it a try! The denatured Alcohol didn’t make me breakout or feel dry. The formula is elegant and better than drugstore spfs I’ve tried. The fact that it’s spf 42 instead of 30 is great and I typically do 2 layers. dewy glowy plumping
