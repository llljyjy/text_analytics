I really like the texture of the serum and the scent. It did leave my skin feeling moisturized; however, for the price, I did not notice any difference after a few months of using the product everyday. For the price of the product and in conjunction with the moisturizer, I was hoping to see some improvement to the Wrinkles on my forehead but didnâ€™t see any changes. Not impressed
