I received this product for reviewing purposes. I was looking forward to trying this day cream as Iâ€™ve loved products from this brand in the past. Overall I think the cream is okay but I was expecting for it to be more hydrating than how it ultimately made my skin feel. I do like that it has spf and it might be fine to use during the warmer months but my skin needs more hydration in the cooler dryer months than this has to offer. nan
