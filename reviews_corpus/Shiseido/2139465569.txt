I was pleasantly surprised by this. It’s lightweight, has a nice light scent, and did not give me white cast (please note, though that my skin tone is pretty light.) This soaked into my skin well and didn’t make it feel greasy in the way that some other sunscreens have. I received this for free for my review, but I’m not sure I would spend the money on this as the cost is kind of high for the amount you get. I would recommend trying it out if you have the extra cash to spare! Good
