Overall a nice moisturizer - it fully absorbs and does not leave a greasy or oily film behind. I enjoy the smell - a white floral smell with light botanicals. This is from added fragrance as well as  extracts. These aren’t necessary and could cause irritation to those with sensitive skin and the reason I didn’t give it a full 5 stars. Otherwise, I do really enjoy this so far and have not noticed any irritation on my non-sensitive, oily acne prone skin. I would recommend requesting a sample in store if you are intrigued but have sensitive skin - for $50 it could have been so much better without the fragrance in my opinion. Feels nice but may be irritating to some...
