I thought this Shiseido sunscreen was pretty nice. It had a light sent to it and melted into the skin nicely. I also really like the slim packaging, it makes it super easy to throw in a bag and take it with you! Iâ€™m very fair skinned and wish the SPF was higher than 42 but because of that I just reapply more often. I also have oily skin and found this sunscreen made my face even oiler, so I ended up using it more on my hands and chest which it worked well for. Good Sunscreen
