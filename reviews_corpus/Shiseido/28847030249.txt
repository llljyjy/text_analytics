Pros: - super easy to blend in (serum consistency)- absolutely no white cast (on my skin tone, which I would call tan, but definitely not deep, so I can’t speak for everyone) Cons: - super, super greasy on the skin and doesn’t dry down, even after hours- Has a super strong chemical smell Need very specific circumstances to enjoy this
