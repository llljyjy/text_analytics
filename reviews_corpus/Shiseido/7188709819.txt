This Shiseido sunscreen does not leave a white cast and is very lightweight. It’s not greasy like most sunscreens. The SPF is pretty high at 42 and it contains hyalauronic acid which is great for added moisture. The scent is not overpowering, you still get the sunscreen smell but it isn’t strong at all. Really loving this one overall and it came just in time for summer. Perfect Subscreen.
