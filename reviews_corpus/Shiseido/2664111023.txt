This was the first time I’ve tried a Shiseido product but it won’t be the last. This product was great, it immediately made a difference in my skin; my face was softer, smoother, and I felt like it added a bit of moisture that I need in the winter months living in New England. The smell isn’t offensive and it soaks into my skin quite quickly and adding my moisturizer on top was not a problem. I will definitely purchase this product again and look into Shiseido’s other products based on the success this was. First time’s a charm
