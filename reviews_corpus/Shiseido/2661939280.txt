I absolutely love this power infusing concentrate by Sheseido!  The packaging is elegant and beautiful.  When you open it you will find an equally beautiful vessel for the product.  The bold color and sleek design are something you won’t mind keeping out on your counter.  I’ve been using the product twice a day for about a week now.  The texture and scent are very pleasant and it feels great going on my skin.  I have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin and also how much absorption I get from my moisturizer after using the concentrate.  I feel as though my skin has greatly improved as well as my fine lines.  I also use this on my neck and décolleté.  This will become a regular in my beauty routine. My skin looks great!
