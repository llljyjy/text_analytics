Trying and looking for cream that works, finally found this one. Age 33, using cosmetics only professional for about 15 years, I know what works for my wrinkles and what is not. This one works. It is rich and last long. No smell, no allergy(but I do have sensitive skin). It is to oily tho, but it works, so I donâ€™t care. reccomend
