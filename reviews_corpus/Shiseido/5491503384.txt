This moisturizer has been so good for everyday use! If I know I will only be outside for limited time and leisurely walks, I will use this one as opposed to the water resistant one and it is amazing! This sunscreen does feel a bit thick when applying, but it feels so soft when applied and quickly absorbs into the skin and feels so lightweight once itâ€™s absorbed! My skin has felt great since using this regularly! Silky Smooth Skin
