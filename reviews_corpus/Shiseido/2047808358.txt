I received this complimentary from influenster and was really excited to try it. The lotion is super light weight and did not leave any sticky residue on my fingers like some other brands tend to do. The scent is clean and refreshing not overpowering or too “beachy“.  This even worked on my very fair skinned child in a pinch better than the normal baby sunscreen. nan
