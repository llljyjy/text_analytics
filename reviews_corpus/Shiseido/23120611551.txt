I love this sunscreen! It nourishes and moisturized my dry skin perfectly but also has high SPF! I feel very protected and never had an issue while I was using Retinol at night. My skin never turned red, itched or had any other issues like break-outs. It glides onto my skin very smoothly. Of course you can smell the high SPF but it is not as bad as other brands.I really love the ease of this 2 in 1 product. I just need to apply one layer of moisturizer and am already protected. How often would I go out and my skin would sting and I think, Oh no, I forgot to apply sunscreen - again.I highly, highly recommend this Shiseido sunscreen! I love this sunscreen!
