Thank you influenster and voxbox for giving me shiseido urban environment fresh moisture sunscreen. I have to admit I am not a regular sunscreen wearer but this makes my skin feel amazing and the spf doesn’t burn my face. my face feels soft and smooth after application, half of the time i don’t even need to add moisturizer during the day.! love this I never used face sunscreen now i’m obsessed
