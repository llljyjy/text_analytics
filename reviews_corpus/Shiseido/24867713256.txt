I have loved this face day cream! It’s goes on very smoothly and has helped my skin feel soft and healthy. I have sensitive skin, so I didn’t know how my skin would react, but it has been just great! I also love knowing I have a little sun protection when I apply this. Sometimes moisturizer that  contains sunscreen has a weird texture or smell, but that hasn’t been the case with this cream. I also feel like it hasn’t negatively affected my makeup application.  I would recommend this! In fact my husband and teenagers are trying it now too! Soft, creamy moisturizer with sun protection
