Go to sunscreen for the summer! I only use it to reapply but I trust it more than any other sunscreen because it’s really is heavy duty. You can sweat for hours and the sunscreen will still remain on the skin. I removed a star because it can get oily and sticky to the point where my hair ends up oily if it touches my face a few times a day. I truly dislike greasy sunscreens and this one can get just a lightly greasy but it’s manageable and you really feel protected. Like it
