I’ve been wearing this product for weeks either under or mixed in with my foundation and wow. I’m a makeup artist and usually HATE how SPF products affect makeup application but this product nailed it. It doesn’t really have a white cast just a slight pinky hue that goes away at least on me with a light/medium warm skin tone. It’s thin and weightless and a new fave of mine! 10/10. I included a photo of me wearing it under my makeup for a photoshoot so you can see no cast! Amazing SPF product!
