I like this serum a lot. The consistency of it is very smooth; it glides across the skin if that makes sense. It’s not super runny or too thin of a consistency, like it has a little bit of viscosity. The smell of this serum and the cream are really nice to me for some reason. I’ve noticed a decent reduction in the appearance of the fine lines on my forehead, but nothing drastic. All in all, I think I will continue to use this as my main serum in my skincare routine. nan
