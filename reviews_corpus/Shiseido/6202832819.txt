One of the best sunscreens I’ve ever used, hands down! I love how easily and quickly it absorbs into the skin and it doesn’t leave a purple tint on my dark skin which most sunscreens do. It is lightweight and moisturizing and it doesn’t feel heavy in the skin. I also like that there isn’t that strong of a sunscreen smell and that when I sweat it doesn’t burn my eyes like a lot of sunscreens also do! 10/10 Great for dark skin!
