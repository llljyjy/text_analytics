Let me just start by saying that this is the best cream ever invented, not only does it make my skin feel so freaking soft, it has protected my face from the sun so much. I live in Arizona,  if you live here, you know the sun here BURNS your skin so much, and I always peel, well this cream has protected my face and the best part is It doesnâ€™t leave my skin oily, who ever is looking for a great moisturizer plus sun block for your face, this is it!!!! Must get it
