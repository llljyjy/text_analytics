I have to say I was very shocked when I first opened this sunscreen. The texture is unlike anything I’ve ever used. It’s not oily at all. I put it on and it instantly dried. It was also a matte dry and was even tinted. I was in the sun for hours and didn’t get burned so it must work! I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review Unlike any others
