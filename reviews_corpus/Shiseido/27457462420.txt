I could tell the difference at the first day of use. I think is mostly because my skin is very “thirsty“ because the weather in my city varies from hot to cold too fast but still I’m very happy with the results because my skin is looking great for real, is very lightweight and it can go along with your skincare routine super well. I wouldn’t probably buy it because of the price though. *** UPDATE: Now I’ve been using for a few more weeks and noticed that my skin had absorbed everything that it could from the product so I’m not applying daily anymore, just once a week is ok for me or it will have the reverse results and dry out my skin. Still love it! Loved it!
