I love this brand, and let me tell you these products did not let me down.

It was not greasy or heavy and provided nice coverage. My super sensitive skin was not bothered either, no burning, itching or breakouts. The downside is that it’s rather pricey due to it’s small size and would not last very long considering you need to reapply sunscreen every two hours. Good but small
