I received a complimentary product in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this for about a month now (Am/PM) as the first step in my skincare routine and I really LOVE it. I am very likely to repurchase. The consistency is a gel like serum with absorbs quickly and applies well under makeup and other skin care products (both oil and cream). I’ve noticed an actual improvement in the over all tone of my skin, as well as it’s general evenness. My photo is a no foundation and not filter photo for reference. My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that I find the packaging bulky. But that is more of an aesthetic preference than a con of the product. A surprise new favorite
