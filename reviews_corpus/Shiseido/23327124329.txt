I received this product free from Influencer for my own honest opinion. I usually hate wearing sunscreen on my face due to many different reasons but I will absolutely be wearing this one all summer and all to come! It’s so smooth and non greasy and oily like most I’ve tried. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the smell wasn’t all that appealing to me. It reminded me a lot of a self tanner scent. But other than that I definitely love it and will be using it! Love this!
