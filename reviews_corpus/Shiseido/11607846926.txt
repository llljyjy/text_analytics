I received this product complimentary from Shiseido and Influenster for my honest review. I use Shiseido skincare products religiously, so I was super excited to try the new line of sunscreens. I received the Fresh-Moisture with Hyaluronic Acid SPF 42 1.8oz. This sunscreen did not disappoint from first touch. What I mean is there is a cooling sensation when first applied. It absorbed quickly and did not leave a white cast. I like the design of this bottle with the snap close lid. It will prevent leaking in my purse or gym bag. The only drawback for me is it is not water-resistant. I will use this one for my in-office makeup days. I love the large size of this bottle. I would recommend to family and friends. My new favorite sunscreen! Shiseido Rocks!
