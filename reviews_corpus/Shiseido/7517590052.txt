The consistency of this sunscreen is very thin, almost watery, which is intriguing because in my experience mineral sunscreens tend to come in thicker cream forms. That usually makes them a hassle to apply, so I appreciate how easy the Shiseido Urban Environment Shield was to rub into the skin. I unfortunately have the same problem with this mineral sunscreen as I do with most physical SPFs, which is that the whitecast is very noticeable. I applied two fingers’ worth of product to my face and waited for the whitecast to fade, but it unfortunately sat on my skin like a layer of white powder for the rest of the day. It gets the job done but I just don’t think it’s going to work for anyone with some melanin in their skin. For reference, I am a 220 in Fenty Skin. Easy to apply, noticeable whitecast
