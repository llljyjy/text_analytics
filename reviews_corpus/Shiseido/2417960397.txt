I love wearing mineral sunblock because it protects my skin but I hate how I look like a ghost after using it. I tried Shiseido’s Urban Environment oil free minerals sunblock which is tinted and I like it! I don’t look like a ghost and forget I’m even wearing it because it’s so light. I just use my beauty blender when applying it. I don’t look like a greasy mess either. I wear it under my makeup as the base because it works so well. I did notice that it lasted a long time and when in Florida you need all day protection from the sun, while still looking cute! It’s not too thick or too thin which I love because other mineral sunblock can be too thick you can’t really rub it in. My skin improved over time while using it, which was great! I would recommend trying it out to see if it’s your new favorite mineral sunblock! Mineral for the win!
