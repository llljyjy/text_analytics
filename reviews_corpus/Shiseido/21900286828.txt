I have very dry skin and I. Always looking for new face creams as I get older I definitely realize how much damage the sun and other pollutants can do to my skin so I love that this has spf 20! Not only am I hydrating my skin but Iâ€™m also protecting it again harmful Uv rays it has a light scent and immediately melts into your skin giving you a nice glow and pump I use this everyday especially after showers the amount of product you get and how little you need is definitely worth the price the packaging is also very luxurious I also love that it has purified hyaluronic acid and energizing ginseng root great for your skin ! amazing for dry skin !
