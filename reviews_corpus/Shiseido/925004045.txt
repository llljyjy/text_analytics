I don’t usually wear mineral sunscreen because of the severe white cast and the fact that many of them feel drying to my skin. This is the best mineral sunscreen I have tried. I like the way it feels on my skin, and it works well under makeup. It’s not white, so that minimizes the cast, but unless you have very fair skin you will definitely see it.
