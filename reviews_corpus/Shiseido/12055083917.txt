I am very picky about my sunscreens. Many of them irritate my eyes, some leave a white cast or a greasy skin some leave a weird taste in my mouth. Well, no concerns with this one. It has A very light texture almost watery. It leaves no white cast and it doesn’t leave my skin greasy. There’s no strange taste in my mouth either. I knew Shiseido makes great products and this one is not any different. I received this product and exchange my honest review from Influenster but I really love the brand as well as the product. Must have!
