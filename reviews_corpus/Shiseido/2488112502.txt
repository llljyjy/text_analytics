I really liked this Sunscreen. It did not leave a white cast on my face and was very moisturizing. It has a pleasant smell, and my make up applied well. The only negative thing i have to say is that the price is a bit high for the amount of product in the tube. I might purchase again, but will be on the lookout for a cheaper alternative. Really Liked it
