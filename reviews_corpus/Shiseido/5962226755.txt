This moisturizer is wonderfully creamy, spreads easily, and lasts a long time. I love that it also contains sunscreen, as I live in Florida and sunscreen is already part of my daily regimen. My only (minor) complaint is that it smells like the sunscreen and leaves a little shine behind. The jar is also really beautiful and looks nice on my bathroom counter. Perfect daily-use moisturizer!
