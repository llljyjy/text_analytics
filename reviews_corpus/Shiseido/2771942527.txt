Hydration amplified.  Shisheido gifted me their potent Ultimune Power Infusing Serum to test, and I am happy to report it easily makes my top five best serums list. A culmination of 150 years of Japanese skincare innovation, NEW Ultimune face serum is full of nutrients and antioxidants including: REISHI MUSHROOM, IRIS ROOT EXTRACT, FERMENTED ROSELLE EXTRACT, AND HEARTLEAF EXTRACT. It’s designed to nourish and strengthen the skin, reduce signs of aging, amplify hydration, and boost radiance. I’ve been using Ultimune face serum twice a day for 6 weeks, and love the results. The serum has a watery gel like texture that absorbs quickly and easily into my skin. My face drinks it up, and looks instantly softer, firmer, and smoother. To my delight, it works well alongside harsher products in my skincare routine, providing the protection and nourishment I need. It also layers nicely under makeup and makes my foundation look smoother and prettier. Overall it’s an effective, luxurious, do-everything product made with quality ingredients that’s sure to please discerning skincare devotees. Bonus: It doubles as art.  I love the contemporary lines and feminine color of the bottle so much that I leave it out on the counter to admire it. Excellent
