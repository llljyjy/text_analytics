I was given this Product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. (Thank you to Influenster and Shiseido)This Product feels great on the skin. Not to heavy or oily. Dis not break my skin out or cause any extra redness. The packaging is top tier and looks beautiful on the shelf. I have not noticed changes to my skin yet but look forward to it. This product is scented but not over powering. nan
