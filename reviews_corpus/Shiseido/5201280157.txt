I’m super picky about my moisturizers because I tend to breakout & my skin is super sensitive. This moisturizer feels so lightweight but so hydrating. It wears beautifully under my makeup & I feel like it makes my makeup last longer. The only thing I don’t like is the fragrance. If this was fragrance free; this would be my HG moisturizer. It does go away after awhile but I do know some people are sensitive to certain fragrances. I definitely recommend. Skin so hydrated…..
