I’m never disappointed with Shiseido products.  I’m just about to turn 40 & grew up at the beach, so my skin has some definite signs of aging.  This serum helped with lots of fine lines, has brightened dull skin & leaves my face hydrated. I have to be picky about skincare because I have seborrheic dermatitis that manifests at red splotches on my face, this serum doesn’t affect my skin condition at all & actually has lessened any redness. Great Anti-Aging Hydrating Serum
