Fresh moisture sunscreen SPF 42 is $38 for 1.8oz and is super lightweight. My face feels hydrated without feeling a sticky or oil mess. Upon application thereâ€™s a strong scent of SPF mix with a light floral scent. It does not make me breakout or feel dry. I highly recommend it! Got this from Influenster!
