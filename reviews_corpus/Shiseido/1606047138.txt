I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion. This is an excellent face sunscreen for time spent outdoors. It is a little thicker consistency than the oil free version. I wore this while at the pool and it held up well. I didn’t get burnt and it kept my skin safe for the few hours I was there. The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price point. I think for the price point, I’d like a larger bottle/ more product. Poolside Protection
