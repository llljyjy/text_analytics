I have been using Shiseido since I was a teenager. This is a premium and trustworthy global skincare brand with lots of good products. This sunscreen is one of the mist try of Shiseido. It’s very lightweight and easy to spread on. It doesn’t leave any white cast and it’s a upgraded new version with hyaluronic acid added. It makes my skin very dewy and moisturizing. The best thing is it’s not irritating my eyes. It doesn’t pile with any of my skincare products either. I would like to say it’s works best with normal to dry skin. If you have oily skin you should choose the other white rounded one which is oil free. nan
