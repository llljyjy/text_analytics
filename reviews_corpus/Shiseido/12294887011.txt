This product is buttery soft, hydrating and so luscious, but it’s too much for my skin. I have a combo skin completion and it was just too much and pore clogging for me. I wish it worked tho! I will have to try it once summer comes around for when my skin is thirsty and needs extra hydration due to sun exposure. If your skin is not picky or sensitive, give this a try — the texture is amazing. Compliments of influencer. nan
