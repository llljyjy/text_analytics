After using the entire sample I received for my honest review I feel that it provided my skin Adequate coverage from the sun. I didnâ€™t get red and was at the pool all day for several days. It leaves your skin looking pale and feels dry to the touch. It did however make my skin look brighter overall. Great for Sun Block
