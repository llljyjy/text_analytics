Every sunscreen I have ever tried has made my eyes burn and water. I have been using this every day for the past 2 weeks and it doesn’t irritate my eyes at all. It rubs in smoothly. It’s very thin but but you can feel the coverage with out the “sunscreen cast”. It’s a bit pricey for my liking but in a see of promises this sunscreen delivers and I’ll gladly pay the price to protect my skin. nan
