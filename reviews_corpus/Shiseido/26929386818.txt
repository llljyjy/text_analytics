I received this for free in exchange for an honest review. I’ve been using this one my face, even though there’s no indication that it’s meant for the face. It’s been gentle on my face and doesn’t clog my pores. I like that it’s not greasy and has a high spf. I don’t like that when I add more layers it starts to peel off of my skin, and is no longer effective. I should be able to add more layers as needed. I personally would not purchase this in the future. nan
