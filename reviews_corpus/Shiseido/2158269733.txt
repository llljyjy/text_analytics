Much like its counterpart with SPF, this moisturizer is also very emollient without being greasy. It didn’t breakout my relatively sensitive skin. The included spatula is a plus for hygiene as well. I like that this product does not have SPF so I can use it both AM and PM. I’d recommend it. Great all-purpose moisturizer.
