I received this from INFLUENSTER and I was so happy when I opened the box. It took me almost amount to write this review as I wanted to make sure that this product will work on my combination skin type.  First let me tell you that the packaging looks so luxurious and was so easy to use. I don’t like serum that are sticky when applied on the face and neck. But this one is so light weight and doesn’t leave any sticky feeling on my face. It doesn’t have a strong scent which I’m looking for a skin care. With in 3 days of using it I see a difference on my skin it is more hydrated.But after using it for almost a month I can finally say that my face looks smoother, hydrated and firmer. It is now part of my skin care routine and will definitely purchase again. #voxbox #influenster #shiseido #serum #skincare AMAZING SERUM THAT WORKS WELL!
