Another winner from the Shiseido lineup. Silky smooth texture and light coverage really seal the deal for me. Sunscreen is a must for me living high altitude and this sunscreen/primer isnâ€™t heavy and is practically weightless under my foundation. Very lightly scented, so no weird sunscreen smell. Would totally recommend! nan
