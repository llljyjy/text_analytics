This product has a silky texture and melts right into the skin. I feel so smooth and hydrated after. I would give it a 5/5, but the only thing is the strong, perfumey scent. It’s a good smell, but the fragrance can be overwhelming. It also stings if I sweat and it gets into my eyes. Otherwise I’m obsessed with it, and it doesn’t bother my sensitive skin. Recommend if fragrance doesn’t bother you. Beautiful texture and application, strong scent
