I tried both versions of this product: the one with spf and this one, which is without. They have the same packaging so the same thoughts there - sleek pretty design, love that it’s refillable to cut down on waste, comes with a cute little spatula. As far as the product itself, this is a lot lighter than the version with spf. It absorbs faster with none of the slightly oily feeling of the other version. It also smells great. Honestly I think I prefer the feel of this product, but if you’re looking for convenience the one with spf is also great. Both are hydrating and pretty luxurious feeling. Absorbent and Firminx
