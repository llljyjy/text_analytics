Love this! Sunblock is a MUST for everyday use but sometimes it can feel a little gloopy or the smell is overbearing. This one has a slight sunscreen smell but there’s something else in there that makes it smell really nice! Feels creamy and moisturizing without the thick stick that normal sunscreens have. Didn’t feel thick on the face either! Perfect sunblock for the face!
