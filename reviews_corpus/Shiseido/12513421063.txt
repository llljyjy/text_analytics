I’ve been using this serum for about a month and it’s ok, I like how it absorbs into my skin quickly and how smooth my skin feels. It does have a fragrance but it goes away pretty quickly. My skin gets a bit dry and flaky in spots in the winter (I live in the NE) and this serum didn’t really combat that even though it claims to be a great hydrator. It’s nice and light and makeup applies beautifully over it, it is a nice serum I think it might suit me better in warmer months. I’m going to try it again then bc I did enjoy the texture/smoothness. It has been below freezing/dry/windy where I live (plus I have a wood stove) so my skin has been very dry! Ok
