My skin is definitely drier living in New York during the winter time & this I apply this cream after cleansing/my shower and dont feel the need to reapply for the rest of the day. Usually I also am drier and sensitive under my eyes as well but I don’t feel like this is the case when using this cream. The spf is a huge bonus for me & the cream isn’t ashy or leave a cast on my medium tan skin. The product absorbed easily and did have a scent when applying but that did not bother me at all. Also a little goes a long way and i don’t need much to feel moisturized. So the cream will last some time. Im sure that this cream performs well under makeup, but i haven’t worn any over it yet. 10/10I did receive this as a part of a promotion through Influenster but this is a genuine revieww!! Really like this
