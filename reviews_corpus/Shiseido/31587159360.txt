Love consistency of this concentrate it is very thin feels good on the skin I’ve been using it every day since I’ve used and I love it it does have alcohol in it that is the second ingredients and you definitely can smell the scent whenever you first put it on but it does dissipate after the fact and it’s not an unpleasant it does not burn whatsoever is Good product
