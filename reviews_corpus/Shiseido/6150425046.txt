This serum is lightweight and it does add some moisture. I have combination skin and this doesn’t make my face over oily. My skin did not really get brighter but my face  felt nice afterwards.  While it does add moisture it is kind of fleeting. It could be just my face soaking it all up. The serum isn’t sticky in my opinion and I’m sure with time it’ll work way better so, it’s worth a try. It’s good.
