Wow- very very impressive with this sunscreen. I am an avid kbeauty user and I have tested hundreds of spfs on my skincare journey. I have normal/combo skin depending on the season and I am usually not sensitive. Packaging: Very cute orange and white flip top squeeze tube. Itâ€™s a bit small at 50mL imo but not horrible. Texture and Scent: Lightweight cream texture that melts into the skin like a gel. Leaves no white cast and needs very little effort to blend in. Has a strong floral scent that does not disappear quickly. Leaves my skin dewy with a nice glow and soft to the touch. Definitely hydrating. AMAZING spf.
