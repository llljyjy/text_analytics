I really liked this sunscreen! I have an issue when sunscreens are very thick and feel like they sit on top of my skin. This one absorbs very well and I couldn’t notice any kind of white cast left behind. I am very fair and this kept me protected! I did not try this with makeup on, but I feel like it wouldn’t hinder the product too badly. Overall a very good sunscreen! Decent Sunscreen!
