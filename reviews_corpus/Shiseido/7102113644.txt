I’ve been a big fan of Shiseido for many years, so was very excited to try this sunscreen. I tend to be pretty picky about my sunscreens, as I need something that I’m motivated to reapply throughout the day, and something that is easy to apply & reapply. It has to absorb easily, not leave a white cast, and not pill. This sunscreen absolutely fits the bill. The hyaluronic acid likely helps it to absorb better, and it left my skin dewy and healthy looking. Happy to be a fan of yet another Shiseido product! Great daily sunscreen
