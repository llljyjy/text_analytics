I’ve seen this product before and was always hesitant about trying it given the price tag and since I have sensitive skin, but I was given an opportunity to try it for free and wow! It works so well, goes on smooth and dries well. I found it was more moisturizing than the regular serum I use and I started using this one for when my skin needed that extra boost. It didn’t break me out at all and I love the subtle smell the product has. The product certainly feels luscious - highly recommend! Very nice!
