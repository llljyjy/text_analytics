I’ve been using this moisturizer for a few months now & I love it! It makes my skin look & feel great! It has a very slight scent that is pleasant & it’s not too thick, so it’s great for a day cream. The jar is pretty, but way too bulky for traveling. I wish it was a little easier to pack in my toiletry bag. nan
