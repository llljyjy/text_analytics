This fresh-moisture sunscreen came just in time for summer! It’s lightweight but very hydrating thanks to the hyaluronic acid, it doesn’t make my skin look greasy and it does have a strong SPF smell. It’s consistency is thicker than the oil-free one but still on the thin side, it absorbs nicely, and leaves me with a dewy look. I love how soft and smooth my face feels while wearing this sunscreen and that it doesn’t clog my pores. This sunscreen not only protects my skin from the sun, it also makes my skin look less dull, and leaves me with all day moisture. I will definitely repurchase. works so well!!
