it’s a lightweight, mildly scented cream. Usually creams with spf are too oily for me but I never experienced that with this cream. It actually exceeded my expectations although, I would not purchase because I absolutely hate spf creams. They’re pretty useless to me. I use an actual sunscreen (Neogen Airy sunscreen) and apply the recommended amount (2 fingers) which you can’t really do with regular spf creams without them feeling heavy. I applied my regular spf over this and actually feels great. I gave the other jar I received to my mom and she’s really enjoying this cream, probably a lot more than I am. This is NOW the best spf cream I’ve ever tried but just not something I prefer. I would still recommend it though because I did have a good experience with it but I’m sure you can easily get a coupon to save a few bucks. I don’t purchase spf creams at all and never will but if I did, I would consider this one since it leaves a nice soft matte finish. Leaves a glow but not dewy which I appreciate. The cap, actually the whole packaging is unnecessarily bulky. My combination skin seemed to tolerate this well. It was a bit hard for me to compose a review for this product because it’s not terrible but not something worth going crazy about. nan
