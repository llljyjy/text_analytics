This serum is lightweight, quickly absorbed.  With its gel like consistency it tightens the skin instantly. I use this at night with a heavier moisturizer, theres no reside left behind so it makes me feel a little dry. This is good for all signs of aging paired with a hydrating moisturizer. Definitely worth the price especially with the look of the bottle! nan
