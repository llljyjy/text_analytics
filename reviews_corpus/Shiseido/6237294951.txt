I receive this product as a complimentary from Influenster. I love this product so much because it is a moisturizer sunscreen and it makes my life easier. According to Shiseido, it has a fresh-moisture with hyaluronic acid, a hydrating formula that maintains skin’s moisture for 12 hours. It is a great product that doesn’t leave my skin oily. I feel protected and it provides simplicity to my daily skincare routine because it is 2-in-1 product and I don’t need to use a second product. nan
