Perfect combo of protection and hydration! This added such a nice glow to the skin and gave an extra boost of hydration. Absorbs in nicely. I would definitely recommend and repurchase. Has a slight smell but nothing that lingers. Just the typical spf smell. It doesnâ€™t linger. Protection & hydration in one!
