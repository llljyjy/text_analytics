Shiseido has been killing the sunscreen game with their sunscreens lately and their newest versions are just as amazing as ever, and packed with amazing ingredients like hyaluronic acid to keep skin plump and hydrated. My dry skin loves how hydrating this formula is. It absorbs so nicely into the skin and feels so lightweight, unlike other sunscreens which feel heavy and greasy and slide around all day. This is holy grail product for me and will pick it over other sunscreens every time. nan
