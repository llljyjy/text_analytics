I was sort of skeptical to use this due to my overly sensitive skin but after a week of using it, my skin is definitely softer! It has not broken out either. I tried the Shiseido toner before and liked it. I think I will continue to use this and see if I notice any other changes in my skin. Skeptical but not disappointed
