Love love love this product, I used it daily and to be honest, I normally will get tired of a product and push it back to my skin care fridge but this one I used until it was empty!! Which is rare for me. I love that this product also had SPF and hylauranic acid in it as well! 10/10 recommended to friends and family!! Amazing moisturizer!!!
