Very lightweight and absorbs right into the skin. I love products that add skincare/multi benefits, so naturally loved that they added hyaluronic acid to this. It’s oil free for anyone who gets easily clogged pores, than this one will do. I did think the number spf 42 was odd but other than that I’m a fan. Trustworthy brand.
