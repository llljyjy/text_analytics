I am loving the Shiseido Ultimune Infusing Concentrate! It absorbs into the skin really easily, and leaves a really smooth feel! It smells really nice, a very light, natural scent. I have only been using it for a few weeks now, but I can definitely see some results. It was super easy to incorporate into my current anti-aging skin care regimen just by adding it in before I moisturize. It makes my skin look and feel more youthful and hydrated! This will be a new staple in my routine, and I highly recommend it! Youthfulness and Hydration!
