This is my favorite moisturizer for several years (previously I bought it myself all the time). When tried something new I always went back to this cream. The new formula of this moisturizer is as good as the previous one. My normal to dry skin is hydrated and looks plumped and dewy with this cream. It doesn’t feel greasy or uncomfortable. I use it after toner and serum. Makeup is applied very good after this moisturizer. I haven’t noticed any breakouts or clogged pores using this product. I like that the packaging is refillable.I highly recommend to try this  moisturizer. it’s worth it! best moisturizer for me
