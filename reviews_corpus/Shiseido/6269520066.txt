I received the  Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream #complimentary from @influenster and @shiseido shiseidoskincare.  This cream is truly instantly hydrating; the entire day my face remained moisturized.  I prefer this one over the Shiseido Essential Hydrating cream with SPF as this one tends to provide more moisture and longer lasting.  I’ve used this cream for 1 month and though I’ve always had smooth skin I still notice improved softness. Totally recommend for those needing more face skin moisture. Truly ALL day hydrating moisturizer
