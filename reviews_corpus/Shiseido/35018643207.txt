I LOVE this product. It feels like satin in liquid form. Hydrating - fabulous paired with a full skincare routine. Has some good weight to the formula - but it is incredibly lightweight on the skin. I have sensitive combination skin and I didn’t have any issues incorporating this into my skin routine. This feels like a high quality product. Of course the price is a bit much…but I only use one pump in the morning and one at night so I know it’ll last for a very long time. Overall I’m very happy with the product!! like satin in liquid form on the skin
