This sunscreen was awesome. I used this on our first warm day doing yard work  and usually I would get super sunburned. I applied this and only got a slight sunburn, only because I did not stop to reapply and I was sweating. It does not leave a greasy residue on your hands and absorbed into my skin very nicely and also did not leave my skin Greasy. I will definitely re-purchase and use as my normal sunscreen. Non Greasy!
