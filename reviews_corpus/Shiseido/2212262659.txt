First off, I’m already obsessed with Shiseido, so I was super excited to take part in this campaign. I’m a very pale redhead, covered in freckles, and I burn faster than a Marie Callender pie, so spf is a MUST in my face cream. I’ve been looking for a good one because most face/eye creams with spf trigger a nasty allergic reaction in my eyes, and this is the very first one that hasn’t done that!!! The cream itself it lighter than sunblock - not super sheer or thin, but it feels light on the skin and doesn’t make me shiny. The package said it can be used like a primer, and I agree - it evened out my skin tone and made my face feel smooth. It smells lovely, too. This is a definite win, and a must for all sun-fearing redheads out there.*Note: I got this product for free from Influenster in exchange for a fair and honest review, but trust me, it hasn’t stopped me from not leaving a bad review. This good review is legit. À must for any daily skin care routine!
