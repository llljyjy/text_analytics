I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I am always looking for a good moisturizer because I have crazy combination skin. So far, I like this cream a lot. It is super lightweight and great for sensitive skin. I love that it has SPF in it. Hoping that I will see more results as I keep using it! nan
