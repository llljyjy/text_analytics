I’ve been using this eye cream on and off for years. I take a break, try something different and it is NEVER as good as Shiseido’s eye cream. I use Bioscience (Squalane + Marine Algae Eye Cream) in the morning and this stuff at night. It’s super moisturizing and combats the dryness I started experiencing since being prescribed Tretinoin. I keep coming back...
