So after like day 2 or 3 I could actually already see improvements in the smoothness of my skin overall. Apply to clean face followed by moisturizer. I did try without moisturizer and was not successful, you still need moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and when I used this product 2x a day (morning and night) like it recommended , it felt a little irritating. 1x a day consistently at night was just fine. Good overall serum
