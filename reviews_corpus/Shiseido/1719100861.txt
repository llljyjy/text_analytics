I’ll start by saying I NEVER write reviews, but had to after trying this! Like many others have mentioned, this doesn’t break my sensitive skin out or feel oily/heavy at all. If you’re sitting out at the beach or the pool and start to sweat, this *does not sting at all* if it runs into your eyes. The stick doesn’t melt when sitting in your beach bag in the sun, either! nan
