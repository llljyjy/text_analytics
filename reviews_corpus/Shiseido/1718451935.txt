This serum fees so luxurious on the skin and I like the packaging. My only complaint is once Iâ€™m done with my free product, I would be reluctant to pay this price, which is why I docked a star. However, I faithfully use other Shiseido products and this may just be worth a splurge for a new stable! nan
