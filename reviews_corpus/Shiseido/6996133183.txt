I recently received this product and would repurchase this product again, mostly for the experience and not so much for efficacy. Let me explain - I LOVE shiseido. Their essential energy cream is a fantastic moisturizer and the scent is luxurious and fresh, which keeps me going back to it time and time again. This product is similar in that regard - I LOVE the scent. It makes me feel like I’m getting a facial done at a high end spa. I also think the bottle is super sleek and the component is beautiful BUT I’m not fond of the lid since it has to be perfectly placed back on and there were times it would take me a minute to do so. When it comes to the product itself, this serum reminds me of the essential energy gel cream - it’s a lightweight gel that would perhaps work for someone who is super oily but not those of us with combo to dry skin. I’ve found that other brands have more moisturizing serums compared to this and I wish it was just a little more thick. I did think it gave me some moisture but outside of that I didn’t see a huge difference in my skin’s hydration. I also didn’t notice any additional brightness. Overall I would stray away from this product if you are dry or combo skin but perhaps it would work well for oily skin.  Note: I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Not moisturizing enough for dry skin
