#shiseidoskincare #complimentary @shiseido @influensterWas super happy with this moisturizer. It was really hydrating, which is great since I live in a very dry climates. Love the added spf as well, so I can skip that last step in my morning routine. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product. nan
