I have dry skin and have difficulties finding moisturizers that are hydrating enough and don’t leave my skin feeling dry in an hour. This fits the bill perfectly, it’s a super rich moisturizing cream that keeps me hydrated all day. I love that it has SPF too! I’m super guilty of forgetting to put my SPF on in the mornings so having it all in one step is super helpful! nan
