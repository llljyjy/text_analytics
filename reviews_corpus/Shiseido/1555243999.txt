I used to love this sunscreen.  Unfortunately they changed ingredients and it’s like oil with a tint.  So slimy, greasy...I threw it out.  The old one was white, but never left any cast and you didnt know it was on either.   I tried the Urban spf 42, it’s much better, no tint, but too drying on my normal skin, even with moisturizers.  I’m contemplating ordering the Urban lotion.  Too many sunscreens ball up, flakey mess if you dare try applying a foundation on top.  So frustrating. Oil with a tint, horrible.
