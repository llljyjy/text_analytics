I’ve always loved the original in the blue bottle so was excited to try this. It’s the same consistency, just oil free and does not have that beach scent like the original. I really liked as did my sister whose sensitive skin usually doesn’t do well with oily products. My only concern is that it’s not SPF 50 like the original, however it still does a great job and if recommend it! Love Shiseido
