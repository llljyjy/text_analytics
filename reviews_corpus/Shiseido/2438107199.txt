This sunscreen is the best sunscreen ever for going out to the beach or a day out by the pool. It has Hyaluronic acid to help with aging and that also gives the skin a natural dewy finish which I love on my skin at the beach that is drying out. it locks in the moisture so it doesnâ€™t get dry. I LOVE this. it is the oy sunscreen I will ever wear to the beach ever again! I received these products for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review.
