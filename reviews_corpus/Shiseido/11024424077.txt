I am obsessed.  I have oily sensitive skin and this is like unicorn magic on my face. I apply it about 15 minutes before leaving the house and I love it. It’s very light and matte on the skin. There is no smell and the shimmer is soooo beautiful it gives the no makeup makeup look. The packaging is cute and it’s the perfect size to keep in my purse or clutch. I definitely recommend Shiseido
