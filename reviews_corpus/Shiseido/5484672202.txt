Giving this product 4 stars because yes I do like it a lot but I noticed that after a wash my face and apply this all over it makes my face a little dry. Not too much just a little. I now layer it on top of another light weight moisturizer and it feels just fine. All in all I like it. I’d buy it again because I’ve been looking for a good sunscreen for my face.I received this product from Influenster for my testing purposes. Sunscreen? Yes please!
