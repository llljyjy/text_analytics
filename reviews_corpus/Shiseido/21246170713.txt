This sunscreen was pretty decent! I have oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin and was worried this would make me break out. Luckily it didn’t. While it does absorb well into the skin, it’s still a bit heavy for my oily skin. The oil-free version was much more lightweight (although that one broke me out). I love that this doesn’t smell or feel like normal sunscreen. There’s a small fragrance, but it’s not pungent. It layered well under makeup too, but I found that I had to powder a bit more because of my oily skin. Overall, it’s a decent sunscreen. I wish it was larger for the price point though Good But Not My Favorite
