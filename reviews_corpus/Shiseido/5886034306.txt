unfortunately this cleanser caused my skin to feel very uncomfortable.  After foaming it up really nicely to wash the day’s grime off, I massaged it into my skin and then rinsed.  Instead of feeling clean, my face felt like all the sweat and oil had just been covered in a waxy rubber layer.  running my fingers across my skin was terrible.  instead of soft and gliding, it was like trying to push my fingers across a rubber mat-- no sliding, just uncomfortable stuttering, and hitching.It was similar to how Dial soap made my skin feel when that was all we had growing up.I immediately rewashed my face with Kiehl’s ultra facewash, which always makes my skin feel nice and removes makeup really well.if you have not tried this Shiseido product, try it in sample size first to see how it treats your skin.  I was very disappointed with it because I usually love their stuff :( like applying a layer of wax to seal in the grime
