I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review from Influenster. The bottle was super cute, but there were quite a few things I did not like about this product. First, it was very liquidy. The first time I used it, I was a bit surprised with how thin it was. The color did blend in with my skin well. Unfortunately, it did not work very well. I reapplied it every two hours. I still ended up burning. Another thing I found was that it left a residue when it got wet, which was a bit odd. Not For Me
