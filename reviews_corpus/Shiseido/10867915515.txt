When beauty products are technology based, it’s a whole new experience. I don’t have any damage to my skin that I’m trying to reverse or have any signs of aging that I’m trying to reduce. I found that this serum adds and holds a significant amount of moisture in my skin. in doing that, I get a more vibrant and youthful looking facial skin all day long. I use about a small pea size on 4 points of my face and rub it in. I find a small thin layer is all you need to do the trick. I started seeing results only a couple days after I started using this serum. When beauty products are technology based!
