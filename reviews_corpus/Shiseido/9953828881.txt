This Shiseido SPF moisturizer was a complete win for me! I was worried that it would be a little too light, greasy feeling, or would sting my eyes, but it was none of those. Instead, it has a light, soft feel on this skin, lasts for hours on end (as long as you don’t have a habit of touching your face), and a little really goes a long way. It’s not only good as everyday wear - with or without makeup on top - but also when you want to lay out by the pool. And the packaging is so modern and small enough that you can take it anywhere. My only gripe is that it could be a little thicker, but if you don’t need extra hydration you’ll love this. ;) No Sting SPF!
