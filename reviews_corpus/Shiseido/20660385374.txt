I received this product for testing purposes. I like the serum and I like the way it makes my skin feel. However, would I spend this much for this product as a refill? No. I feel like there are other options that are comparable in price or even cheaper that do a better job. The main benefit I’ve found is moisture. I don’t feel like it makes my skin look any better. Just more hydrated. It’s Decent. Not great.
