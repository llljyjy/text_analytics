I was so excited when I received a sample of this Shiseido sunscreen from Influenster.  I love the silky smoothtexture of this sunscreen!It seems to melt into myskin. I love that it is oil-free and did not irritatemy sensitive acne proneskin. It sat lovely undermy makeup and I love that it is water resistant also. It does start off a little white when first applied but then as you rub it in, the casting much improves! Did not seem to show at all through my makeup. Very lovely product! So Silky Smooth!!
