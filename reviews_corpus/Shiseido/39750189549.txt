I’m always looking for great sun protection that works well under my cream faded makeup and that doesn’t clog pores. I received this Shiseido product free in exchange for my honest review. It’s a mineral sunscreen that leaves your skin with a matte, velvety finish. It’s not greasy and it doesn’t cause breakouts. My cream-based make up stays on very well. This is a good primer as well I would say. only annoyance is I have to remember to shake it up well before use and on its own it makes my skin a little “white”. #complimentary #shiseidosuncare @Influenster @shiseido Good sun protection and makeup primer
