First of all the packaging for this cream is beautiful. The jar itself makes you feel like youâ€™re about to use a special product. I was pleasantly surprised with the cream itself. My skin can get very dry especially in colder months. This cream was like a fresh drink of water for my face! Very lightweight, no weird smell, very hydrating. Just awesome! Would definitely recommend. Really awesome day cream
