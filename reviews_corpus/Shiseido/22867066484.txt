+ love the smell+ love the consistency + creates a great barrier/primer under makeup - the moment you sweat or your eyes water this stiiiiings - avoid putting it anywhere near eye or eyebrows - reacts and doesnt mix well with a lot of my other products - it coagulates. Great with the right mix of products
