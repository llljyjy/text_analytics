I normally use the Shiseido cream purifying cleanser, but I thought I would give this a try. I don’t love it like I love the purifying cleanser. I am switching back. This product didn’t irritate my skin, but I think the other cleanser shows better results. This oil has a bit of a rotten smell…mineral like. I didn’t like that either. nan
