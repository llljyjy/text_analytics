I’ve always heard from Dermatologists that people should be using sunscreen daily to prevent sun damage. With the sunscreens I’ve used in the past, I never thought that, that was something I would do with the harsh smells and oily feeling. Shisheido changed that for me! I’m now a daily user of this moisturizer with SPF! The smell is really light and the texture is smooth and light like a facial moisturizer should be. After a few minutes it doesn’t feel like I have anything on and it helps keep my skin feeling fresh even when worn under makeup. And it’s not just me, my husband started using this daily after not having any skincare routine at all! nan
