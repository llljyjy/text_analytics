My initial thoughts on this moisturizer.. it has a perfume scent, not my fave but its not suffocating and it smells luxurious Its super buttery and soft it melted right into my skin..love that It didnâ€™t leave a white cast on my skintone Its not too rich and heavy so I will continue to use this moisturizer going into spring nan
