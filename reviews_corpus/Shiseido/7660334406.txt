This product leaves your skin hydrated and protected. It only is spf 42 which is the perfect amount of protection, not too heavy not too light. It goes on smoothly and doesn’t need mass amounts of rubbing in like most spf’s. It’s not oily like most sunscreens and is easy to reapply, even over makeup. It does have a faint smell but it does fade! Great sun protectant and moisturizer!
