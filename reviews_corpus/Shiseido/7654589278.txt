received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. It just so happened that I had an outdoor concert (with NO shade or coverage) to attend the day it arrived. I am almost as white as you can imagine and I burn incredibly easy. But I didnâ€™t have a single patch of redness when I got home from that show. It also made my skin feel great and really did function well as a primer for my makeup. I absolutely love it and will be buying it again and again. Amazing!
