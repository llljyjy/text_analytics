So far so good. I like the consistency of the serum and the way it makes my skin feel afterwards. The packaging is very swanky. I cannot say that I have seen a real difference in my skin but it could be because I only use the product once a day and I haven’t been using it that long. I just looked the price of it up online and it’s very expensive. I can’t say that I would buy this at this price with my own money. But so far it seems nice. So far so good —expensive!
