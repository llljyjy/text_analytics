This stuff really is not to bad. I actually liked the way it made my skin feel, I did not experience breaks outs which is very nice being my skin breaks out from almost everything . This gave my skin nice hydration and help give it a more revived look. The packaging is more sleek and has a good weighted feel to it which packaging is for me an eye catcher and I love something thatâ€™s stands out. Overall so far so good with using this serum. Pretty good I just say
