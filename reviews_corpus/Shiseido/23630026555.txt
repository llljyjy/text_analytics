I am in love with this cream. As always shiseido uses exceptional packaging. The cream is very dense and a little goes a long way. It saturates the skin pretty quickly, is breathable, and leaves the skin looking kind of oily for a few minutes but itâ€™s not oily to the touch. After saturation your skin look like it has a natural glow. Exception Skin Cream
