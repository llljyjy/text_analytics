ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED!! Soooo... I am highly allergic to most sunscreens but decided to try this one out anyway.... I am so glad I did!! This sunscreen is amazing!! It left my skin feeling so soft, hydrated, and not looking greasy or oily like most sunscreens do. It also mixed well with my other skincare and makeup! 10 out of 10!! Highly recommended especially for those with sunscreen allergies just make sure to have some benadryl on hand just in case!! ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED!!
