I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. This was a great sunscreen for me. The texture feels like a lotion and absorbs well in the skin. This is definitely hydrating and didnâ€™t leave a white cast. It does have a slight sunscreen scent but to me ot was pleasant. I wear sunscreen everyday and this is something I could use everyday, for the summer I would switch to the urban environment oil free version that is more matte, but I did enjoy using this product.
