I love Shiseido and this cream is actually good but it comes with a huge disclaimer from me, This is only great if you follow the Japanese layering technique, if you donâ€™t follow this technique it can be not so great for dry skin people, this contains a high amount of SD Alcohol 40B, which can have a dehydrating effect on your skin, unless you follow the layering system which can pretty much erase that effect and work on your favor (check YouTube for the Japanese layering system) overall this product by itself I cannot recommend to anyone that has dry or dehydrating skin. But for the people that have a truly hydrated and oily skin, this will be the holy grail, but still hydrate the skin before using. Hydrate & layer the skin before using
