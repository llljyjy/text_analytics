Loved this day cream! Felt great on my face, so lightweight but still left my skin feeling hydrated. Love that it has spf as I burn easily and have to wear some sort of sun protection any time I go out. The only thing I did not care for was the fragrance but itâ€™s not horrible, just not my favorite. Definitely glad I got the opportunity to try this product! nan
