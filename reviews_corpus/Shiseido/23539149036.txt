I like that this sunscreen is moisturizing but the chemical SPF irritated my skin :( It has a nice feel and a dewy finish. I might use it on my forehead and cheeks, which didnâ€™t get irritated. I will avoid putting it on my chin and mouth area which broke out and felt itchy/burned after applying the product. Not great for my sensitive skin
