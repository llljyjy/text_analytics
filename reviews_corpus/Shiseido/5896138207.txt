My first impressions, I loved the elegant packaging and the pump provides for easy dispensing. It has a serum-like texture with a good slip to it that dries down to a non-sticky, silky finish. I apply after cleansing/ toning before my other serums. It helps your other products absorb better. There was a tiny bit of stinging and itchiness when I first applied. I noticed some of my sun damage got lighter after using this with an AHA serum. My cons would be that this product contains a very high amount of alcohol that makes my eyes sensitive while using the product. At first I thought this was primarily due to a sunscreen I was using, but even after not using them together I still had the same result. It has a floral scent, so if you donâ€™t like scented skincare keep that in mind. Overall, the product is great once you get past the stinging. My new favorite serum!
