I’ve always been a fan of Shiseido sunscreen in the past and couldn’t wait to try this new product. It does what it says: moisturizing while blocking the sunlight, and it does it very well. The texture is milky white and a little bit thicker than the pebble-shaped bottle version, but it melts into your skin and is quickly absorbed. My skin feels soft and hydrated after using it. I have oily skin so it could be a little too much for me in summer, but I’m definitely gonna restock it in winter. nan
