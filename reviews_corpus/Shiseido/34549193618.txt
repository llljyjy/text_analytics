*I received this Shisedo Urban Environment Sun Dual Care product for free from Influenster and Shisedo in exchange for my honest review. At first, I thought the thin, almost slightly chalky and oily texture of this the Shisedo Urban Environment sunscreen was going to be a big no. On that note, I have found it difficult to find a face sunscreen texture that I’ve actually liked. I got over the texture pretty quickly when I applied it onto my face. The Shisedo sunscreen seamlessly blended right into my skin leaving no white cast and made a soft, light dewy base for my powder foundation and keeps my makeup looking great throughout the day. This very easily became a part of my everyday makeup routine. I’m so hooked on this, I will definitely repurchase it. For me, it would be difficult to beat plus the SPF 42 is perfect for me. Pleasantly surprised…
