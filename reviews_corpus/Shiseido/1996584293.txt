I’m a huge fan of Shiseido skincare products and this day cream did not disappoint. It looks very luxe and the packaging is stunning! The moisturizer gives me all day hydration and is not sticky. I did not notice a scent. It’s lightweight and would works for my skin type - oily , as well as my hubbys skin - dry. I would definitely recommend this product. Great moisturizer!
