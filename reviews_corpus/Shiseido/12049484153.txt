This is a good product however there are a few things I’m not a fan of. It applies very easily and is very light weight yet still protects my skin from the sun. This being said it does pill when applying anything over it like serums or makeup. It also has a MAJOR white cast which is terrible for people with dark skin tones. Overall it’s good but could definitely be better. Could be better
