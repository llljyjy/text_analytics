I love that this moisturizer has an SPF of 42, because I am always looking for ways to protect my skin from sh  exposure.  The product is light weight and blends nicely.  It doesnâ€™t have an overly sunscreen smell and keeps my skin feeling fresh and moisturized all day! I would definitely recommend this product and will become a staple in my routine. great daily moisturizer!
