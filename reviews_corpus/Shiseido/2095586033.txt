Would I consider this the next time I need to repurchase a face sunscreen? Definitely! This water resistant oil-free version of the Urban Environment sunscreen keeps my skin from feeling dry and I definitely notice the more plumped appearance shortly after putting it on. It works well without ever feeling greasy or too heavy for sweaty summer weather. I wore it to the beach and on dry land and am super happy with it. Worked at the beach
