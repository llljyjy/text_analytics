Perfect sunscreen for brown skin. It does not leave a white cast and it also doesn’t smell like a typical sunscreen. It blends and absorbs quick and blends well with makeup. Don’t rub your eyes because it will irritate them but other than that it’s a great sunscreen. * received for free form Influenster for my honest review * Good
