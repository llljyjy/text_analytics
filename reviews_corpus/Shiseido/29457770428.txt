I love this product. I received this shiseido urban development Sun duel care free from influenster to use and review. I love how this doubles as a Sun screen with spf 42 and a primer. It goes on smooth, absorbing quickly, with little too no smell. It feels nice under my makeup it’s a excellent primer. It contains hyaluronic acid and is oil free. I’ve been using it for two weeks now and have zero complaints. It is also water resistant up to 40 min so it’s great for going to the pool!!! Shiseido urban environment I love this
