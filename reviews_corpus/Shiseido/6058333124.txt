I love that this product is unscented. It has a thicker viscosity and really hydrates and plumps the skin. When first applied, the serum is a little sticky but it absorbs in after a few minutes. I havenâ€™t seen any changes in my skin yet but I do like how hydrated my skin feels. Great for hydration
