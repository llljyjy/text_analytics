This sunscreen is so hydrating and refreshing.  Normally I find that sunscreen leaves a white cast on my skin. This does not do that. It absorbs quickly and makes my skin soft! The hyaluronic acid is such a great ingredient to include in sunscreen. The high amount of spf keeps me protected. The tube is cute as well as easy to squeeze from. I’d recommend this sunscreen to anyone wanting a hydrating sunscreen that doesn’t leave this skin greasy.  I’m very impressed. Hydrating sun protection
