Overall I liked it because it helped maintain my skin’s moisture and gave a nice satin sheen of a glow (without light reflecting “shimmer” which I don’t like). It’s main ingredients contain glycerin which helps moisturize the skin and dimethicone which helps seal in the moisture. The bottle is exquisitely designed, sturdy, and fits the look of expensive skincare. It has a refreshing clean smell that doesn’t linger. My skin looks hydrated and healthy after using this product. Consider this product if your skin needs a slight moisture boost! Thanks @Shiseido for letting me try your #Ultimune concentrate in exchange for this review. Luxurious Serum Boosts Radiance
