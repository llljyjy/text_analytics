i received this cream via Influenster for my honest feedback. i wanted to love it but something about whats in it makes my face so oily halfway through the day. also dry spots appeared where they werenâ€™t before, so i cant say i feel moisturized. i use it at night now instead of under makeup because i looks like ive been dipped in butter otherwise, strange. not a big fan
