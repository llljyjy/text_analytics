This was an interesting spf as it’s more of a lightweight creamy moisturizer. It’s easy to blend in, doesn’t have a strong noticeable scent, and doesn’t leave a white cast. I wouldn’t say it makes you look oily or greasy, but there is some dewy-ness to the skin! It dries down nicely and doesn’t remain tacky or sticky. I think it would suit normal-dry skin people! nan
