Wonderful sunscreen. Feels very lightweight and is very moisturizing it absorbed easily into my skin. It didn’t leave any white residue which was a huge plus. I even tried it under my makeup and didn’t have any issues. It worked really well in the sun and didn’t feel sticky. It does have a mild suncreen scent to it, but it’s not overwhelming. I would recommend this to friends or family. It is also the perfect size to travel with or have in your purse. I te or Ed this product for free from Influenster for my honest unbiased opinion. nan
