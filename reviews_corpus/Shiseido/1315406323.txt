I received this product for free from shiseido and influenster in exchange for my honest review. i actually already  use and enjoy different sunscreen formulations by shiseido so I was excited to try this one! This one is pretty different, it’s pinkish in color and very watery. It dries down to a matte finish. It’s nice that it’s pink because you can see where you’ve applied it. I liked it! nice pinkish toned sunscreen
