I’ve been using this moisturizer on and off for a few weeks now, and it’s really gets you nice and dewy, I think my skin loves it, but it just kind of sits there and doesn’t really soak in all the way. I can still feel it hours later, which I don’t like. Overall an okay product, I wouldn’t buy it again nan
