I love this product. Plain and simple. I’m already a fan of Shiseido’s line of products and this may now be my absolute favorite. I use it before bed and can instantly see and feel the difference upon waking up. I also sometime use it during the day when I’m not looking for an extra layer of sunscreen. It’s creamy and silky to the touch, but feels light and hydrating on your skin. It’s not too thick or heavy and has not caused any breakouts or acne. Will continue to purchase once this jar is gone!
