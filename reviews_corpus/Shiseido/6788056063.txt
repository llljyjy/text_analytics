I really liked this sunscreen.  It is definitely moisturizing.   More moisturizing than the waterproof formula.  This is a white sunscreen but doesnâ€™t leave a cast on my fair skin.  It blends easily too.  Again I think this Urban environment line is good quality.  If you are looking for luxury sunscreen, I would recommend this. Very Moisturizing for a sunscreen
