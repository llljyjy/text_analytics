I am fairly impressed with this product. I do not like the fragrance though. Fragrance just isn’t good for your face. I also wish it had more anti aging ingredients in it. Otherwise I enjoy it. My face didn’t break out thankfully,  and the formula is nice and not sticky. I was given this for a honest review. I like it
