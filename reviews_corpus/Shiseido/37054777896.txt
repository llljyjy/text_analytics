I really liked this mineral sunscreen. It’s super light, oil free, and really good for an everyday use, especially in the warm/hot weather. I also put it on top of my foundation. The structure is really consistent and it’s easy to apply, you just need to shake the bottle and open it. Additionally, it has a nice light scent. Last but not least, it doesn’t leave the thick white cast that sometimes happed with sunscreens. I really find it helpful and useful! Light mineral sunscreen for everyday use
