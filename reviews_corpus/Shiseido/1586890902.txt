I received this serum complimentary of shiseido and influenster! This serum is lightweight and feels very hydrating on your skin. I pair this serum with my skincare routine for the last month and have noticed a dewy finish with my moisturizer. It notes firmer skin which I have not really noted much difference just the hydration and dewiness of my skin. If I were purchasing a serum this would be one I would go back to for the lightweight texture and hydration on my skin. Lightweight serum
