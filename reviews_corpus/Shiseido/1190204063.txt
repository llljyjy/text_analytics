This was my first time using a sunscreen just for my face. I usually use a moisturizer/sunscreen combination, and this one was so nice to use! I love how it felt on my skin and the light refreshing scent. It did feel hydrating on my skin and didn’t leave the typical sunscreen residue. I definitely will use this in the future now that I have found how useful this product is. I also appreciate that it didn’t leave a white cast on my face. A great facial sunscreen!
