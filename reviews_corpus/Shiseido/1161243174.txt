Be careful when dispensing, mine was still quite runny after shaking bottle as instructed. It soaked in well and to a nice finish, so can’t complain there. No sunburns with this on and with reapplying it if necessary depending on how long I was out in the sun. I still have some left so I can take it with me to a fair in late September for the last hurrah of possible sunburn… No sunburn
