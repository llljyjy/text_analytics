Received complimentary from Influenster. So when I used this product initally, it was AMAZING. Overnight, my maskne flattened significantly and smoothed out my skin. As I started to use the product as directed (2 pumps twice a day), my skin became more greasy and my forehead started to get small bumps. I think this is an absolutely amazing product, but Iâ€™ll probably use it every other day. The texture is smooth, consistency is runny but still a lil viscous, and it dries quickly too. Will definitely continue using this, and I would purchase it! Great for dry skin, be wary with combination skin
