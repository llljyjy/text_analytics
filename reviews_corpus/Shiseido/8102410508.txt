I got the lil sample as part of the two free samples you get with each order. It was enough to use every night for a week which I did. It did a decent job of moisturizing and hydrating but I donâ€™t love how the fourth ingredient listed is mineral oil - too close to my eyes! Also thought the smell was too perfumey. nan
