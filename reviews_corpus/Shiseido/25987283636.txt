I have recently become a sunscreen enthusiast and this one is on the very top of my list of excellent ones. Why? It doesn’t leave any white cast or sticky residue. It doesn’t stink or sting the eyes/skin. It is very easy to apply over make up and doesn’t erase it. It glides in and gives you that glow that makes you look fresh. It doesn’t spill in your purse when you’re out and about. Its perfect! Finally, a perfect sunscreen!
