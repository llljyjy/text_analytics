I liked this serum it’s not oily or thick, it’s just right. It takes a minute to get absorbed in skin but skin feels soft and brighter. I am going to keep using it for a couple of days more and update the review. Best part of this serum is it has no nasty perfumy smell. @Shiseido  #shiseidoskincare  #ultimune nan
