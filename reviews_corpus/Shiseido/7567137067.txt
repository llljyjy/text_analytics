I honestly can’t say that I have seen a instant difference in my skin. however, paired with my TheOrdinary Lactic acid 10% + ha serum, it works. I use this on days where my skin may have open pores due to extractions etc so I can only use a moisturizing serum and not one containing acids. I won’t lie, I have seen an increased improvement in my skin’s appearance and texture since incorporating this product. I do recommend it. but I do wish I knew more at first glance the ingredients used to make this I really like this
