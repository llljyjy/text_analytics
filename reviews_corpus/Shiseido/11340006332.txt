I received this product to try out and I must say, it has now become an everyday stable in my skincare routine. This product is so light weight and can easily be worn underneath makeup. Although it does go on a little greasy at first, the greasiness disappears fairly quickly. The sunscreen does carry a slight fragrance, almost like a beach or pool sunscreen smell, but I personally donâ€™t mind it. Will definitely be purchasing again when I run out. Everyday use
