This SPF provided me excellent protection from the sun. I have extremely fair skin, freckles, and burn easily but this sunscreen blocks harmful UV instantly without absorbing into the skin. It makes a great primer for makeup with a smoothing, matte finish. I didn’t notice any white cast, if anything it helped even out my already white skin tone. It’s very easy to shake up and apply. I highly recommend this to anyone with fair skin who burns easily. Excellent protection and finish
