First of all, I didn’t like the smell. It’s like a mint or something like that. I really loved the sensation on my face. Was like a tightening effect, wich I love and i felt it inmediately. Also my skin looked brighter. The texture is amazing and dries really fast. I have a combination skin, and it works really well on me. It feels really good
