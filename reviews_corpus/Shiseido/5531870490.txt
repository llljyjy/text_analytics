I was surprised by how much I liked this serum.  I actually noticed a difference so soon after I began using it.  No, it didn’t get rid of my fine lines or anything like that overnight.  But I noticed on mornings I had slept with it on, that my skin looked much more hydrated and radiant than usual.  The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly.  It also didn’t cause any breakouts or irritate my sensitive skin.  I’m still using the bottle and haven’t noticed too much in the way of fine lines, but I don’t have a ton, so that’s harder to see the difference.  If you’re looking for quick results in anti-aging, maybe look for a different product.  But if you’re looking for something to make your skin feel and look radiant and moisturized, this could be a good option!  I honestly think my skin looks really nice when I use it.  It’s more expensive than I would typically purchase, but there’s a very good chance that I will end up repurchasing when I run out.  The fact I’m even considering it means that I really like it a lot.  If you’re wanting to try it, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed!  The bottle is also really nice, if you care about that! nan
