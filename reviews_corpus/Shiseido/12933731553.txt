At first I thought I’d hate this. I started to put it on and it felt greasy but after rubbing it in, there was no more greasy feeling  while it’s tinted, it’s not over the top tinted and perfect for covering small amounts of redness or uneven skin tone. Overall, I’m extremely happy with this and love that Influenster and Shiseido gave me the change to try it for free in exchange for this review! Amazing Sunscreen!
