I love this sunscreen for a quick application. I brought this with me to Miami and loved how easy it was to pack and apply. There was zero white cast and went on clear. I also used it on my kids who complain all the time whenever I apply sunscreen on them. They didn’t seem to mind. I love the smell and how it glides on so smoothly. I haven’t tried it under makeup and prefer to use this for beach/active no-makeup days. I will definitely buy more! perfect sunscreen stick
