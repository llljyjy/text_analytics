The number-one complaint I hear about sunscreen is how greasy and thick they are. Just because we all know they’re good for us doesn’t mean we ever get used to the oily sheen most formulas leave on our skin. In sharp contrast, this sunblock feels like a primer. It instantly mattifies skin, leaving it soft but truly oil-free. (That telltale sunscreen smell is also nowhere to be found.) The zinc oxide does leave an ever-so-slight white residue in its wake, but that’s how you know this stuff will protect you. Better than most
