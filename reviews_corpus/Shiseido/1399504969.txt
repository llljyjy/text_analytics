Shiseido oil free mineral sunscreen with an spf 42I received this from Influenster, shiseido and Sephora for free for my honest review. I easily give this a 9/10 stars ⭐️ Pros: Oil free, doesn’t burn my eyes at ALL!, works as a makeup primer, dries matte without a greasy finish, contains Hyaluronic acid and doesn’t contain yucky ingredients like oxybenzone or octinoxate. Cons:Leaves a slight white cast after applying. And is a bit expensive at $38 for 1oz. I would absolutely buy this. The bit of white cast doesn’t bother me, especially with how great it feels on my skin. I haven’t tried this yet as a primer but I have a feeling it will work great. I’m a stickler for sunscreen. I use tretinoin nightly so SPF is a must. One thing I love about this is it doesn’t burn my eyes. I have a couple other sunscreens that I like a lot but can’t wear on my face because somehow it always gets in my eyes and burns like fire. I will absolutely recommend this to everyone! This SPF is a fave!
