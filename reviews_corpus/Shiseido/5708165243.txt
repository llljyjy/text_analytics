I received this product as a sample. I am so happy that I didn’t buy this. It has intense rose fragrance, extremely watered down, and despite it being “oil free” it makes my skin extremely shiny. I used it once and threw the rest out. I’ll give 1 star because the packaging for the sample is actually really nice and convenient. However, I won’t buy this and I am praying that my skin doesn’t breakout from this after applying it today. Rose fragrance is gross
