I love the light, serum texture of this sunscreen and that it hydrates with hyaluronic acid. The spf 42 protected my face and neck during a hot, sunny week in Mexico. It does have a slighty white cast common with mineral sunscreens but not bad on my light/medium complexion. Works great as a makeup prime. light and lovely
