wow literally the oil plugs in my face came right out. I felt some grainy texture against my skin after I rubbed it for five seconds. I wasn’t wearing makeup but I have a lot of hard bumps that I know have oils trapped under them. So glad something is working. I tried before with another oil but it made me break out and I was rubbing for twenty mins. I know oil dissolves oil so I needed an oil cleanser. Chemical exfoliants weren’t helping. I think this one is much more effective and a clean product without much fragrance. nan
