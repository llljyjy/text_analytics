I absolutely love everything about this product. There is a significant amount of the product in the container which is great because a little goes a long way so it should last for a few months even if used daily. The cream is easy to apply, spreads evenly, and absorbs into the skin quickly. It does have a bit of a strong perfumy scent that may be a downside for some people, but I personally like it. Additionally, it is 20 spf so I feel that my skin is protected. It does not make my skin oily at all, and my skin remains smooth and radiant looking even after working outside all day. I have also noticed that after about two weeks of daily use, the texture of my skin has improved. I highly recommend this product. Amazing
