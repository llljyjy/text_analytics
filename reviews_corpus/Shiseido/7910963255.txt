When I received this serum i was extremely excited! It was my first time trying Shiseido and I’ve heard good things about it. After using it for almost three weeks I can’t say I recommend it. I have combination prone acne skin and i honestly didn’t see any improvement in my face so far. Literally did nothing, on the good side it is gentle and did not cause any breakouts or any issues. I just don’t see it working on my skin.  I received this product complementary from Influenster. not good not bad
