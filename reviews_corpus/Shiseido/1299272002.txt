This is the first eye cream that I actually finished and decided to buy again! I love the texture of this eye cream and find that it instantly brightens my under eye area. I can’t speak much for the fine lines, but overall I like the way this makes my eye area look, definitely fresher and brighter. It also comes with a scoop so you don’t have to dip your fingers into the product. Brightens under eye area
