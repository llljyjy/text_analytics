I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I’ve been using this for about a week. I typically use Supergoop sunscreen (primer and sunscreen in one) and am comparing this product to that one. The Shiseido sunscreen is different from the Supergoop. It is very thin and runny. Has a light pink tint to it which I was excited about (will it provide any blurring coverage?). I like that the bottle has a mixing ball in it and when you shake it, you know you are mixing the product. I also liked the consistency. The thin consistency wasn’t a deal breaker for me. When I applied this I did notice a slight white cast. I didn’t really care for that. The white blends in eventually but I felt like I had to use makeup to make it truly blend into my skin. There isn’t really a scent to it if you don’t like scent this would probably work fine… it has just a tiny bit of a sunscreen whiff which dissipates quickly. Feels light on the skin. Seems to protect skin from the sun just like other sunscreens I’ve used. Doesn’t clog my pores or cause breakouts (I do have sensitive skin). I also felt like this moisturized my skin pretty well when used without moisturizer. Only reason I would probably not purchase this is because of the price. I realize sunscreen is pricey but I will pay more for Supergoop (which I prefer) over this one just because of the way it works on me. Supergoop vs. Shiseido
