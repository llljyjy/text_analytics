I really enjoyed this product a lot. It’s rich and creamy and worked wonders for my dry skin. My skin looked and felt hydrated. I looked energized instead of tired and dull looking. I also liked that there was a little spf in it because I sometimes forget to put some on if I’m in a rush. It’s a nice little bonus. I’ll definitely keep this in my rotation of moisturizers. It might be a little heavy for someone with combo or oily skin, but it ultimately depends on the person. nan
