I received this product to test. I really enjoyed it when the weather was cold and my skin felt dry but it’s a little too thick for the warmer months. The packaging is super cute on my vanity and i love the little spatula so you don’t stick your fingers in the jar.  My skin is combination and this did not break me out but it also didn’t visibly improve my complexion at all Would recommend
