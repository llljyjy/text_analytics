The SPF in it is only 20 which is not enough for what I prefer. The texture of the cream is really nice and light, almost like a whipped body butter texture. It has a white tea-ish scent that’s really pleasant and does not linger. On my skin tone it doesn’t leave a cast but darker skin tones might need to test this. The dimethicone in it does smooth out pores very well and is therefore beautiful under makeup. I find myself regularly reaching for it for daytime! light and smoothing!
