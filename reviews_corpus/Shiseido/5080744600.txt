I received this as part of an Influenster campaign. Iâ€™m a Supergoop UnseenSunscreen aficionado but am always open to trying new products. This felt lightweight upon application but left a very noticeable white cast. I have combo skin and as the day progressed, my face became very oily and shiny. I think this would work better for someone with dry skin. Would I repurchase it? No. Will I use if when I run out of Supergoop or when hiking? Sure. It's ok, not for combo/oily skin
