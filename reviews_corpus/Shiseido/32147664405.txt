#shiseidoskincare #ultimune #complimentary @Influenster @shiseido I’ve received this product for free from @influenster and @shiseido in exchange for my honest review.Let me start by thanking you for sending this gem to me. I really like the packaging, and the texture of the serum. Love the subtle floral scent, it’s very feminine. It really works withing several days. It is super lightweight and moisturizing. Love it! The price tag is a bit too much just to go out and buy it, but on a positive note a little goes a long way. ✨ Perfection! Wish it is more affordable.
