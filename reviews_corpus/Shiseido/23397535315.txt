I recently got to try this serum complimentary from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. I genuinely love this product. The packaging is absolutely gorgeous and well made. The pump always dispenses the perfect amount of serum. The serum applies smoothly and has a luxurious consistency. It absorbs fully and quickly without leaving behind a sticky or greasy residue. My skin instantly feels hydrated after applying this product. Iâ€™ve been using it for about three weeks now and my skin is more hydrated, plump, youthful and healthy than it has been in years. The fine lines that have been appearing on my face the past few years have faded significantly from using this serum. Its definitely on the pricier side but it is more than worth it because of all the benefits it promises and delivers. Luxurious
