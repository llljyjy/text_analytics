I received this for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Let me say, I wanted to love this so badly: a tinted mineral sunscreen with skin-loving ingredients that doesn’t have a greasy finish. Unfortunately this just did not work out for me. Not only did it leave an extreme white cast on my skin tone, it also dried my skin out. It was difficult to spread after a couple of seconds since it is so thin and seemed patchy all over. I tried it with different skincare, damp skin, dry skin, applying in layers, etc. I have combination skin with cheeks that tend to get a little dry throughout the day, so would certainly not recommend this if you have dry skin all over because it will cling to every dry patch you have. You can see in my photos (natural light and desk lamp) how a small amount looks after 20 minutes of sitting on my arm, so just imagine how it looked on my face. Let me tell you I looked like I had died 4 days ago and was attending my own funeral. A look that said “casket sharp” but also “powdered donut factory explosion.” If you wear full coverage foundation and/or are very fair skinned, you could probably get away with it. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this one even though it seems I am in the minority of people who didn’t like it, especially if your skin tone is darker than a paper bag, and especially not for the price. I gave it two stars because of the high SPF rating, the ingredients, and the nice packaging. nan
