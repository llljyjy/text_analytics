I received this sunscreen from Influenster in response for my honest opinion and I have to say that it is a beautiful product! I use it as my facial sunscreen. It has the texture of a lotion and absorbs really well without leaving a white cast. My skin feels really soft and moisturized afterwards and even has a nice glow. My makeup applies beautifully over top of this. Added bonus would be the soft fresh scent it has! Definitely would recommend! Beautiful sunscreen
