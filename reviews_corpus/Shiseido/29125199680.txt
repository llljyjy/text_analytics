I was excited to receive this moisturizer because my face has been dry. The first thing I noticed that I was not pleased with was the smell. That’s not a big deal because it’s not bad. I loved when I applied because it was smooth and cooling. The product melted into my skin without being too shiny. I 100% recommend for dry skin. Great Moisturizer!
