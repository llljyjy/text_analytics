Similar with the essential energy hydrating cream with spf, this product does well in moisturizing my combination skin! I love the packaging and the small spatula included inside the box. I also noticed that this cream didn’t give me that sting feeling around my eye area, which I initially experienced with the one with spf (i still love using that product though, but I try to be careful applying near eye area ). I’ll continue using this to enjoy long term benefits for my skin! Hydrates the skin well
