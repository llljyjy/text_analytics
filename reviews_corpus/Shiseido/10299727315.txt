Was a little concerned upon first trying that the shade would be a little too pale. After blending turns out that it wasn’t. Used this after my morning routine. It has even coverage and after a few hours outside with the kids no burning. Bottle is a little small for the price, especially considering you’re meant to reapply sunscreens every few hours. Works Well
