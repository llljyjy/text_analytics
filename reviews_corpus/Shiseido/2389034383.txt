I’ve been using this for a little under 3 weeks - I’ve definitely noticed my skin looking more even toned which has made me feel more comfortable when not wearing makeup at all. My skin is has definitely felt smoother and softer since I’ve started using this. It’s winter where I live right now and I usually have super dry skin, this has helped keep my skin soft and moisturized without feeling like an oil slick. I have no issues with wearing makeup over it. I apply half a pump during the day before putting my makeup on and mainly concentrate on my under eyes. Soft and Even Toned!
