I’ve been using this product none stop for over a month cuz I bought a kit from #shiseidoskincare and I loved it but couldn’t spend the coin for it. So now I have a FULL SIZE #ultimune serum  this helps so much on my skincare routine since it helps the rest of the products absorb better and my skin looks brighter!!! I keep it on my makeup fridge so it is nice and refreshing when I apply it. Thank you Influenster and Shiseido for this #Voxbox The only reason it is not a 5 starts review is due to the price tag and the string fragrance but for sure it is worth it is you can afford it! nan
