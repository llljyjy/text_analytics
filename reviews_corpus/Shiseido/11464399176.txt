I tried this sunscreen from the Sephora sunscreen set from last summer. It does have a lotion like feel when you apply but I found it too greasy for my oily skin. I feel like this sunscreen would work better on dryer or more mature skin. It isnâ€™t a mineral sunscreen if you are looking for that. nan
