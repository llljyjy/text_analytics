Shiseido is one of my favorite skincare brands. I prefer a sunscreen that isn’t too heavy or greasy. The Urban Environment Fresh moisture sunscreen is perfect. It has a very light texture, feels like a lotion or moisturizer rather than a sunscreen. It goes on smoothly and absorbs into the skin right away. I honestly couldn’t believe it was a sunscreen. It does not leave any white cast on your face and is not greasy at all. The fragrance is light and pleasant as well. I definitely recommend. It is a bit pricey for the amount you get, so I’m not sure if I would purchase. Fresh moisture sunscreen
