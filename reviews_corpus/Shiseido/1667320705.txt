This is my second bottle. I love using the concentrate before my heavier serum. It really amplifies hydration and makes my skin look brighter. This is a staple in my anti aging daily routine. I love the sleek packaging. The consistency is super light. It does have fragrance which dissipates quickly. This is not sticky at all. nan
