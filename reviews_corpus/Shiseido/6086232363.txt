This oil-free sunscreen does a great job protecting your skin from UV rays and can be easily worn under makeup. Application is lightweight and absorbs into skin without any white cast while providing hydration thanks to hyaluronic acid. This sunscreen is not very sweatproof and really stings the eyes if it gets into them. nan
