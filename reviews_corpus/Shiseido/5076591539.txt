One of my favorite moisturizers. Feels soooo good on the skin. It’s super silky feeling on the skin, hydrating, and lightweight. Even though it feels light, it definitely moisturizes my dry-ish skin. I love everything about this moisturizer. The smell isn’t too strong either, definitely more scented than I like but still not too strong. Definitely recommend. Love this
