I was so excited about this product, given that the chemical version is always getting major praise! I’m extremely sensitive to chemical sunscreens, so I always have to opt for mineral, which can mean a white cast. Unfortunately, this product definitely falls into the white cast category is a huge way. I thought it would maybe subside after time, but I really just looked like a spooky ghost. It ended up being fine with makeup, but as someone who normally doesn’t opt for full coverage, I would not recommend this nan
