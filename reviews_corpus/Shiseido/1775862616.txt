Great moisturizer for my combination skin! It’s thicker than the Tatcha water cream that I was previously using but the extra hydration and SPF is worth it.  I have semi-sensitive skin & this didn’t cause any breakouts or flare ups - so would highly recommend if you’re looking for a hydrating morning moisturizer that’s on the thicker side! Shiseido never disappoints & I will repurchase once my sample is empty! Morning Moisture
