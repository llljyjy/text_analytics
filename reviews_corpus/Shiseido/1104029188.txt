I was very excited to receive this product free from Influenster for my honest review. I have been looking for an oil free lightweight sunscreen for a while now. And this one fulfills most of my wishes. One of the most important features is that it did not make me break out when using it. It absorbs quickly, is very lightweight, and dries to a beautiful matte finish. It’s also fragrance free which I really appreciate. If I had one small complaint, it’s that it leaves a white cast shading on my skin. This happens despite  it having a slight pink tint to it. I am already a  fairer skinned person,but it makes me look a little ghostly. I do understand that this is typical of most mineral sunscreens. Because of this, I think it’s best used as a primer underneath a foundation you’re using that may lack SPF. Or you can use it for a day working out in the sun, or at the beach, when you’re not really caring how you look! Another perk is that it is environmentally conscious. I would consider buying this product. Lightweight and  oil free!
