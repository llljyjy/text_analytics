I received the Shiseido Benefiance Wrinkle Smoothing Contour Serum as a complimentary sample from Influenster and after trying, it is now a must-have in my skincare routine! I absolutely LOVE the Shiseido brand in general and was so excited when I opened the box to see their products were included in there. My expectations were already pretty high before trying this contour serum, considering how much I love all of the other products I’ve used in the past but luckily all of my expectations were met once again. The formula feels light-weight and silky, while also absorbing into your skin quickly and doesn’t leave you with that sticky feeling afterwards. The packaging is well made and it has a very nice light, almost floral scent which isn’t overpowering. I also appreciate that this serum is formulated with Retinol, which helps to enhance the skin’s self-restoring power and also works to improve the appearance of wrinkles in just one week because this product offers you quick results with high quality ingredients! A few other quality ingredients that this product includes are Renura Technology+, KOMBU- Bounce Complex, Mukurossi, Chlorella, Gambir & Turmeric Extracts, and Yuzu Seed Extract. All of these ingredients are what you should be looking for when searching for products to add into your skincare routine! Overall, I would definitely recommend trying Shiseido Benefiance Wrinkle Smoothing Contour Serum! Love this serum!
