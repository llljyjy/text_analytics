I received this compliments of Influenster and highly recommend it. I have used many different kinds of hydration cream in the past and feel this is a great alternative to the Tatcha water cream. It has a very subtle scent and a light formula that keeps my skin from being dry but doesn’t leave it oily either. It comes with a small scooper so you don’t have to use your fingers to apply if you don’t want. I will continue to purchase this after my sample is gone. Wonderful product for all skin
