This cream feels thick to touch but when you apply it on your face it dries super lightweight and not greasy at all. I’ve been using it through the winter and it might be a better fit for less harsh weather since I have to apply another cream to more dry spots but it’s still a great cream nonetheless! Also the fragrance is little to none which is perfect for me. Great everyday day cream
