Went into the store thinking I was going to walk out with a super goop sunscreen because it’s so trendy right now when this one caught my eye. This sunscreen is the best I have ever tried, immediately after putting it on before my makeup my skin felt and looked so dewy and it helped my base look amazing. The formula isn’t sticky or heavy and makeup applies nicely on top. This is my new go to and I will keep on purchasing! AMAZING
