White cast and pilling. I saw mixed results on women of colour with respect to whether this product left a white cast but I wanted to try it because I am interested in sunscreen that also provides moisturisation. Unfortunately, this does not play well with my daily skincare regimen when compared to the Ultimate Sun Protector Lotion spf 50+. My trial run included applying the spf 42 in 2 parts to allow it to absorb into my skin. The end result was quite a bit of pilling along with the white cast. Wanted to love it but itâ€™s not for me.
