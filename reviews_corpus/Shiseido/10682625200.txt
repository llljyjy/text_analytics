I loved this because of the texture its not at all sticky and has powerful ingredients like Hyaluronic acid which helps to retain moisture. This has lightweight white creamy texture like a liquid moisturer. It is water resistant for 40 minutes and Its free of oxybenzone & octinoxate. Its super hydrating and leaves skin dewy. Lightweight
