I have combination skin (oily t-zone / normal to dry rest of face). My biggest pain points with sunscreens are that they sting my eye area, and I taste the sunscreen throughout the day. I don’t know if I taste the sunscreen because of the ingredients being absorbed into my cheeks or because of the scent. Either way, I really dislike that. Most sunscreens are so uncomfortable around my eye area that I have to remove them with a cleansing balm within the first 15 minutes of applying. This one, however, didn’t sting my eye area and I didn’t taste it as much as other sunscreens. That said, I’m still not a fan and here’s why:I applied this the first day without moisturizer all over my face. It left my face feeling greasy, heavy and yet dry.The second day I applied it without moisturizer and not to my t-zone. I applied the Oil-Free Sunscreen to my t-zone. They both left my face feeling greasy, heavy and yet dry.Third day I applied moisturizer first and the sunscreen to my normal/dry areas. I applied the Oil-Free Sunscreen to my t-zone. They still left my face feeling greasy, heavy and yet dry. I also found they made my most flexible foundation look bad. So I’m not a fan.Plus this wouldn’t be economical for me as I’d need to buy both formulas for my combination skin. That’s not ideal. I also prefer SPF 50+. So I’m back to searching for my perfect sunscreen. Still searching...
