As a avid sunscreen user (and collector, it seems), I have tried many sunscreens. This one is by far the worst. The texture was great - non sticky and absorbed quickly, making it easy to apply and reapply. However, it left the worst white cast and I have fair skin!! The white cast got worse as I got in the pool on vacation, and I returned it right away when I got back. nan
