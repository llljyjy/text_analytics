After weeks of trying this sunscreen I have completely fell inlove with it! Highlights:☀️It is SO lightweight: the consistency is a little more runny than other sunscreens I’ve tried which makes it very lightweight and seamless on the skin☀️ No white cast! ☀️No strong chemical or “Sunscreen” smell. It actually smells like fresh flowers and that’s one of the things I liked the most☀️hydrating without the OILY face result I get with most sunscreens. Every time I use this sunscreen I feel my skin nicely hydrating but I don’t get greasy throughout the day as I would with other sunscreens ☀️wears beautifully under makeup New favorite Sunscreen
