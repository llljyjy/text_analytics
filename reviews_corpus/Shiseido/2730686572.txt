I am so glad that I received this from influenster. It is now going to be my go-to moisturizer for the daytime. It leaves my skin feeling plump and hydrated. It went on easily and absorbed right into the skin without leaving my skin feeling heavy or sticky. The SPF did not leave a white cast. It gave my skin a subtle glow. I will definitely repurchase this. My go-to daily moisturizer
