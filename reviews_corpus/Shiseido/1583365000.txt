I received this product for free fromInfluenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review.This is actually a decent sunscreen. Being a mineralsunscreen there is a bit of white cast but it blends awayeasily on my fair skin (cannot speak for darker complexions). Lightweight and does not interfere with the rest of my skincare. Didnâ€™t cause any issues with my sensitive skin either. The biggest drawback is the amount of product. If using the recommended amount I foresee going through this rather quickly if using on a daily basis. Good mineral sunscreen for combo/oily skin
