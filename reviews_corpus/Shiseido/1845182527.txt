I’ve tried a lot of eye creams but this is by far the best one and absolutely worth the price tag. I personally like to invest more into my creams and save on things. Like serums and retinols. I will forever love this eye cream, I’ll even put it over under eye concealer if the skin there gets dry as the day goes in and they are immediately plumped. nan
