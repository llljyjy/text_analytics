I appreciate a good sunscreen that is both a good level of spf protection as well as amazing at keeping skin hydrated. This Fresh Moisture had a nice very light fragrance. Texture was nice and creamy, not to thin not to thick. It is a chemical sunscreen bug also was gentle enough on skin. The only real downsides here is it on the pricey side for the amount we get. With reapplication every couple hours this wonâ€™t last long at all. Overall So So
