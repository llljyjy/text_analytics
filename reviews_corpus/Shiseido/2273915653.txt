I received this for free from Influenster, and was a bit nervous because I have terribly dry and sensitive skin, so finding a great, long lasting moisturizer is a must for me. This stuff is GREAT (but that’s obvious as shiseido has amazing stuff always). It’s moisturizing and long lasting, with a very light scent that doesn’t bother my skin. It doesn’t make my skin greasy, while keeping it hydrated, which usually doesn’t happen for me. I absolutely recommend and will buy to use again. 5 stars!!
