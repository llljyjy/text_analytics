I was sent this product to review by Influenster. It’s easily become a new staple product for me, especially in the summertime because it’s so lightweight. It doesn’t get sticky on application and you can feel how hydrating it is when you put it on but it doesn’t make you oily. Since I struggle with dry/combo skin, that’s really important for me. I’d easily purchase this myself for daily use. nan
