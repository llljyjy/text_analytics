I loved the original Urban Environment sunscreen and had been using it for years, until it got discontinued. I was excited about the new version because so many people said the white cast was gone. The bottle looks very similar to the old one, plastic and white, the texture also seems similar. Good thing is that it’s true, it leaves no white cast, yay! However, it’s way too oily for my oily skin. I wish I could love it but I can’t. It probably is a good match for those who have dry skin, especially those who are looking for hydrating sunscreens. Not a bad product, just not for me. Oily
