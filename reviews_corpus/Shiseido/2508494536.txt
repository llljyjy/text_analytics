I added this hydrating cream to my skin care routine. I now use it religiously in the mornings or when I feel my skin becoming dry. As someone who has very acne prone skin I use many products, this one is definitely my diamond. It’s lightweight and doesn’t have a strong smell. It warms up in my hands and instantly relieves my skin. Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream revives my skin from the long Texas days full of heat. I recommend this product to anyone who loves smooth, soft, and moisturized skin. Skin Reviver
