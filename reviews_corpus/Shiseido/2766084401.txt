I had to return it. It felt nice going on and it didn’t clump under makeup or anything but I wasn’t noticing much of a difference. I bought it because I had been struggling with dryness around my eye area. It was getting itchy and I found myself rubbing it a lot. This didn’t help with the dryness in fact I feel like it might’ve made it worse because I started to feel a dry patch on my eyelid. Anyway this has fragrance in it and it’s pretty strong so that led me to my decision to return it but it might work for someone with less sensitive skin perhaps. ehhh
