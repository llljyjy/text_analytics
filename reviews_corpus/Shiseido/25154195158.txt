I was hesitant to try this because I have sensitive skin, and I usually get skin irritation from chemical sunscreen. But, I tried it anyway. My skin likes it so far. I have used it for several days now, and I have not experienced any irritation. It is lightweight, and it does not leave any white cast. I love that it has hyaluronic acid, so my skin feels hydrated. Hydrating Sunscreen!
