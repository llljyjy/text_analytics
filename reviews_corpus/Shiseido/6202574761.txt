I got this from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Personally, I’ve always been a fan of Shiseido. My mom and aunt loves it as well. So I was very excited to try this. I have been using this daily for over a week now and I really love it! It’s a huge jar and you only need a little bit so it will last you a while (a great value!). Definitely does what it suppose to which is providing hydration. Its light and gentle on the skin. Doesn’t make my face oily. Smooth and easy application. Highly recommend! Love it!
