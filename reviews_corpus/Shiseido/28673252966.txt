This one is great for the days I am staying home and working outside I keeps me moisturized and protected from the sun. It is a bit heavier then the oil free one but It doesn’t bother me because I have grown up always wearing sunscreen, I feel like it is protecting well because I still feel it there. I used this everyday, except 1 day) for the past week doing yard work and working in the garden in the direct sunlight and I didn’t get sunburnt once! Great Protection
