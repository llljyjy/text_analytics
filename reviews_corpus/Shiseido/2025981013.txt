I’ve always been a fan of Shiseido products but this one is truly great. The texture is wonderful — it goes on like a moisturizer and is not greasy at all. The scent is also quite pleasant. There’s enough of a scent to be nice but not so much that it’s unpleasant. I’ve had a lot of luck with putting it on first thing in the morning and it keeps my skin fresh and protected all day long!! Love it
