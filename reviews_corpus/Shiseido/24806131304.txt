I received this product as a free sample  I love this moisture. It absorbs faster than my other creams.  moisturizes well, the skin after it is velvety and tender.  There is SPF, which is very good, since the skin always needs to be protected from the sun!  especially in Arizona!  I liked the smell, texture, absorbency and consistency, I definitely recommend nan
