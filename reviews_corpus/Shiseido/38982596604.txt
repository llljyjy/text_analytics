Without a doubt, the best facial sunscreen in the entire beauty market. Hands-down. I now see why this is the #1 rated sunscreen by Sephora.Lightweight, liquid texture blends in literally as smoothly and seamlessly as moisturizer. TRULY MATTE... This sunscreen leaves the opposite of a heavy, greasy shine to your face. Gives skin a refined, smooth texture similar to primer (pores minimized, fine lines reduced, overall even skin). Perfect for grease ball, sweaty faced people like myself, while still light enough for the most mature skin.High SPF with PHYSICAL SUNBLOCKERS (zinc/titanium dioxide rather than modern chemical sunscreens) provides immediate and powerful protection from sun. No need to wait the 15 minutes for it to sink in like most sunscreens... Because it uses a physical UV blocker rather than a chemical, your skin gains protection the second the product sits upon your skin.The most suitable sunscreen Iâ€™ve ever used allowing me to apply a FULL FACE of makeup on top of it without any trace. Virtually no white tell-tale sign of sunscreen.My only word of caution is this... After applying to your face, allow it to dry until its dry to the touch (few minutes). Avoid EXCESSIVELY tugging at your skin post application, as this can cause the product to ball up/leave a white cast (something I found out the hard way trying to apply my tacky thick Make Up For Ever mattifying primer on top). A regular primer and liquid foundation/makeup will not cause this.Thank you, Shiseido! Miracle product.Redefines the concept of sunscreen
