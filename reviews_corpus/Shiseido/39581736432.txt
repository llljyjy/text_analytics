I received this product from Influenster in exchange for this review. The opinion expressed is my own. I was  excited to receive this product and on my birthday no less!Overall I really like this product and will continue to use it. Everyone needs a good facial sunscreen if they want to stay healthy and slow the aging process. I feel like this product works amazingly well for protecting against sub exposure.The mattifying oil absorbing effect is spot on and remains effective even after I wash my face. Litteraly no sebum or oil all day long. I’m a shinny dude so that’s awesome. The only reason I dont feel 5 star impressed is it has a pigment to it. I’m not a make up wearer but I can handle a little pigment if it’s the right shade. The bottle I received is too pale and I think it makes me look palid and pale though others assure me that it doesn’t. Good, Almost Great
