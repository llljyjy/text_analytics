This cream really surprised me . I have very sensitive skin with rosacea and acne, so trying new products always worries me . This cream didnâ€™t break me out at all and gave the perfect amount of moisture that looks great under my makeup . The spf is an added plus as well as the soft scent . I really enjoy this and will continue to use! Win for acne/rosacea
