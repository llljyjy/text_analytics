I love the idea of this sunscreen and how it’s a liquid consistency… but it definitely left a slight white cast. I have a fair skin tone so it wasn’t much of an issue for me but for someone with a darker skin tone, I probably wouldn’t recommend it. I loved how lightweight it is and how it didn’t dry out my skin (which mineral sunscreens usually do) so I like it for myself! It’s definitely a little pricey for the size but it lasted me all day, I didn’t even have to reapply and I didn’t get sunburned. good sunscreen
