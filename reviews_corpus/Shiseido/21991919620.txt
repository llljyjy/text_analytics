I was excited to try this, but it didn’t give my skin the hydrating/moisturizing feel that I was expecting. My skin is probably closer to the drier side overall. The texture felt a little thin to the touch. It’s soft and it smells nice though. The application was smooth, but an hour later my skin was feeling dry. nan
