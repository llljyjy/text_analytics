This Shiseido Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 42 is great but in my personal opinion, would probably work better for someone with dry-er skin.Pros: I like the level of SPF this has, that it’s non-comedogenic & Paraben free. The sunscreen scent is not overwhelming & completely disappears soon after it’s applied. It goes on easily so no tugging on my skin to get it worked in. And it leaves my skin looking dewey, actually a little too dewey for my dry/combo/oily t-zone skin.Cons: These are personal to me of course but my 1st issue with this is that I tasted sunscreen in my mouth the entire rest of the days after I applied it. Even when I wasn’t wearing it outside,  sweating.  It also leaves a bit of a whitecast, even after it’s all rubbed it in. For reference my skin tone is Fair to Fair-Light depending on the time of year. So if I’m seeing a hint of white-cast then anyone with a deeper skin tone than mine probably will  as well.Overall: I will use this up but I prefer the other new release from Shiseido better. The Urban Environment Oil-Free Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 42. It’s not overly glowy but left my face looking naturally healthy and without the literal bad taste in my mouth. Probably Amazing for Dryer Skin Types
