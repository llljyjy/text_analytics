I’ve been using this serum for a little over a week, and so far have noticed a more supple look in the morning, along with a slight glow to my overall skin tone. I’m mostly using it for fine lines, so I’m hoping I’ll see more results with continued use! No overwhelming fragrance, no adverse skin reactions, and the texture isn’t too heavy or light. Liking it so far!
