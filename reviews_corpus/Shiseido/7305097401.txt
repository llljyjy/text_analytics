I received these the Urban Environment sunscreens from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review… and my honest review is that I’m loving them!I’m typically not a fan of the sandy, gritty texture of some American sunscreens I’ve tried, so Asian sunscreens are my go to because they are way more cosmetically elegant, have moisturizing benefits and leave minimal white cast. This Shiseido Dual Care with Hyaluronic Acid sunscreen is a prime example! It’s an SPF 42 sunscreen that has a gel-like texture and sinks into skin like an essence or a gel moisturizer. It leaves no white cast and is barely visible on my skin. Because it feels very hydrating due to the hyaluronic acid, I’ve actually been wearing it just by itself, forgoing my usual morning moisturizer, and my skin still feels great!I’d highly recommend the Urban Environment line for fans of Shiseido, of Asian sunscreens, or even just those of you who have been wanting to wear more sunscreen but dislike the textures of the ones you’ve tried - trust me, try this, you’ll start wearing sunscreen way more often! Shiseido Sunscreens are the Best!
