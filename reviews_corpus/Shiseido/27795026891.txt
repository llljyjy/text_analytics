I love the feel of this sunscreen on my face! it goes on smooth just like a regular face lotion and leaves my skin feeling nice and moisturized. it didn’t leave any white cast on my skin and it didn’t pill at all. Even though its super moisturizing it didn’t leave my face greasy either! I absolutely recommend giving this a try if you have dry skin. nan
