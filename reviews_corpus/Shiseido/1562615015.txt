This sunscreen went on beautifully, felt silky and made my skin look really smooth, but left a horrible whitecast immediately. For reference, I have medium-brown skin with very yellow undertones. It looked slightly better with my blush and setting powder, but slowly went back to being ghost-white as the day progressed and my skin started getting oily.If you’re not super pale, I’d only recommend this if you’re wearing it under foundation, or if the whitecast doesn’t bother you :) Feels nice, but awful whitecast
