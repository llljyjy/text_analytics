First impressions for this product were that the packaging is quite hefty and rather unique. Definitely not the type of product I would typically go for but after testing it out for a few days now I have some opinions to share. This cream is really rich and thick in the jar. They are kind enough to supply a tiny plastic spatula to decant the product. My first impression after applying it to my skin is that it definitely has a strong and lingering scent. The smell is powdery and reminds me of a mashup between sunscreen and grandma. I’m not a fan of the scent; some may loathe it and others might enjoy it. Application was smooth for a sunscreen. It doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin. Goes on a bit dewy but eventually fades becomes almost matte within minutes. Skin feels a little more bouncy and plump after application. However my skin does feel a little itchy and look blotchier with some redness after applying this product so some ingredients are not getting along with my sensitive skin. That is the main reason I am giving this product 3 stars. I think this formula is just too complex and harsh for my reactive skin type. Others have said this is a good base underneath makeup and if you are a diehard chemical SPF wearer this might be a really good product to add into your routine. One thing I do love is that the inner pan is removable and refillable so that contributes to a little less plastic waste over time if you choose to buy the inner refills and not an entirely new jar. I think more brands need to offer that option going forward so I was happy to see that. Overall I am delighted to have had the opportunity to try out this product and give an honest review. This would be a hit for some but it’s a miss for me. SPF 20 day cream
