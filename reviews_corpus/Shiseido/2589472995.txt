I really wanted to live this product and unfortunately it started to break me out. The packaging is absolutely stunning and I think that the product itself smelled really nice.The first week I used it the product did what it said it would do and was a great hydration support to my night routine. The second week however I started getting little spurs of tiny white heads. I exfoliated and thought that perhaps I needed to reduce the usage. The third week I only used it as instructed every other day and stopped using it when I noticed that it was still causing me to breakout. Just not for me. Made me break out.
