I was using a different sunscreen before purchasing this one. I had to make a change because the other sunscreen would burn my eyes even if I didn’t apply close to my eyes and was also breaking me out. A lot of people are reviewing it and commenting it’s an oil product, yes it is it’s not your typical white cream products it’s more of an oil. I shake before applying and I don’t apply more than a dime size for neck and face. So far doesn’t break me out and feels very light on my skin no eye burning. I have sensitive combo acne prone skin. nan
