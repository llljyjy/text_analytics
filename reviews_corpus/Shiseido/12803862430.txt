I like this serum. The first time I used it it felt kind of tacky, but after the first initial use it glided on like a second skin. It hydrated my skin enough to remove the dry patched I’ve been getting due to it being cold. My face feels more plump, and hydrated. I’ve been using it for a few weeks. My little wrinkles on my forehead and around my lips aren’t as noticeable. I credit that to this serum. You want to make sure you are using a moisturizer also for best results. I would recommend this product. More plump, radiant skin
