I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido for my honest review. Sunscreen is a super important step in my skincare/makeup, so I’m always on the search for a good one. This sunscreen worked great for me! It has a thin consistency that my skin absorbed really well, giving me a little hydration. There is a slight tint to the sunscreen but it was not apparent on my skin tone once rubbed in. No white cast. I also did not experience any pilling with my other face products, which is a huge win for me. I tried this on it’s own with just my usual skincare and under makeup and both worked beautifully. I recommend either applications. I am excited to keep using this bottle and would recommend this to others. Great Sunscreen!
