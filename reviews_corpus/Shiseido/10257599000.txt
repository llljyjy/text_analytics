Im really enjoying this moisturizer. I love the texture and the way it makes my skin look and feel. My skin looks slightly dewy after application. The packaging is absolutely beautiful and it’s pretty heavy. In the morning when I’m doing my skin care routine, I first put on my vitamin C serum, then this moisturizer. It works amazing under my make up. I feel like the price is a little high, but I kinda expect that from Shisedo. Overall I would recommend this product. I received this product to test from Influenster Nice moisturizer
