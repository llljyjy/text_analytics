This felt absolutely amazing going on. It was cooling, refreshing and ultra moisturizing thanks to the hyaluronic acid. It’s creamy, smooth, and it didn’t leave a white caste like most sunscreens. It made my face supple all day long. It has a light scent mixed with the typical sunscreen smell that I enjoy. I think someone who can tolerate a light scented facial product could tolerate this. I don’t mind at all. I might actually switch to this over my Supergoop! *Gasp* I totally recommend!
