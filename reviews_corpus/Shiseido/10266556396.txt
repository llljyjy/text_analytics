This sunscreen has some coverage on my skin. I only need to apply like 3 drops and looks white on my skin. Which is good if you want coverage but I prefer sheer look and not to be seen on my skin. It’s easy to blend, scent free, doesn’t feel oily.Cons: I can feel it I am wearing it on my skin. Easy to blend, foundation like sunscreen
