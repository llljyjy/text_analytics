This is an excellent sunscreen. If you have dry skin, I believe you will like this as it is moisturizing. This SPF has a light scent (I am not sure what it is, maybe coconut), but itâ€™s not overwhelming. It has a creamy consistency that glides really nicely on the skin. There is no white cast left with this product. I just wish this brand would be cruelty-free. nan
