I got this Shiseido Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 42 from Influenster for my honest opinion. I have been using this for a couple of weeks, and I love it. It smells good, covers well, and gives me good sun protection. You can wear it alone or under your makeup. Plus, with the extra anti-aging benefits, how can you go wrong? Good protection
