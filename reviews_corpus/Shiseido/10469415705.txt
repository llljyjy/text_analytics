This is by far my favorite moisturizer in my kit, and not only mine but my moms favorite as well. Keeps you hydrated for all day long. Only thing I didn’t like is quantity for the money is less. I’m done with both bottles and already my third one is about to get empty. Def would recommend for dry sensitive skin. Favorite in my routine! SPF 20
