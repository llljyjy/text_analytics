I’m extremely picky when it comes to sunscreen and wanted something mineral, in a fluid formula that sets down and doesn’t remain greasy or emollient. This one seemed to meet all of my criteria on paper, plus I appreciated the size of the bottle. Yes, it’s WHITE, even on my pale NC15 skin. I was concerned that my foundation wouldn’t match the rest of my exposed skin (neck, chest, arms) after applying the SPF to all of those places, but that hasn’t been an issue. At least on my skin, the white cast really does dissipate and settle down to a point where it isn’t even noticeable, so that’s been a relief. Overall, though, this product has really just fit the bill for me and works in every way I had hoped for it to. It’s not heavy or greasy, but still suffices as a moisturizer on its own. It sits beautifully under makeup, doesn’t break up my foundation or look shiny (both issues I had with Elta MD and Kinship), and has reliable, strong SPF for the Texas sun. I can see this being a flop for a ton of people, mainly due to the cast and individual skin chemistry, but for my pale self it was a total win and I am glad I discovered it. nan
