This facial cotton is so so soft, never used anything that compared and I will not be buying my target cotton pads anymore. Feels so gentle on the skin and I use it for everything from removing eye makeup to applying toners and liquid exfoliants. Wish the packaging was resealable though. The cotton squares are pretty thick which is great, feels so good on my skin and doesn’t feel like it’s being tugged or has lint stuck on it like from other cotton pads SO SOFT I LOVE IT
