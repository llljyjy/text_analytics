I received this in exchange for review so I didn’t know the price. After using it for a month, I think it’s a perfectly lovely product, but I use so many products that it’s hard to know of this one product is responsible for my skin. In combination with other products, I have found that there iare some dark spots on my forehead that are lightening.The serum is a medium consistency, not watery but not thick. The packaging feels luxe and the lump dispenses a good amount of product, not too much or too little. Overall a good product but I can see it being too pricey for some. nan
