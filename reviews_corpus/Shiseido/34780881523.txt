All I gotta say is when you pay a lot, it pays off a lot. My skin always got irritated with cheaper facial cottons, never realized how rough other brands were. Splurged on these and honestly its the best decision I ever made! I was skeptical but wow it really does make a difference. My skin no longer feels itchy and irritated from taking off my makeup, my redness went down a ton. Sometimes its worth to spend an extra buck :) fav
