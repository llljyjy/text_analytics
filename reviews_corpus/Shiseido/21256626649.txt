I received this for free for my honest review. The consistency is very watery so it sinks into the skin quickly and feels like you have nothing on. This did have an initial white cast on me but it got better after about 10 minutes. I would consider myself to have very fair skin so I don’t think it would work on someone with a deeper complexion then mine. It has a more matte finish so it did cling to my dry patches as well as accentuated fine lines I didn’t know I had. The tint on it does have some coverage so it looked like a tinted moisturizer. This doesn’t pill or move under makeup. I think if you have oily to normal skin and are of fair to light skin tone this would work for you. nan
