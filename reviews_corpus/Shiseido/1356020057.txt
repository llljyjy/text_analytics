If you are an outdoor runner, I cannot recommend this highly enough. In hot, humid conditions, it has stayed effective longer than anything I’ve tried. I am very sweaty and am very fair and burn easily—usually even a sweatproof 50+ SPF only has about an hour on me before the red sets in when I’m running. I can be on the trail for 120+ minutes in blazing sun before I have even a little pinkness or hyperpigmentation. It is very, very important to let it set though: the 15 minute rule is crucial for this one. Because of the price, I only use this for running and not everyday, but it does look nice on the skin when I put it on—can’t vouch for how it would wear over a day because I’m a mess not long after I apply.
