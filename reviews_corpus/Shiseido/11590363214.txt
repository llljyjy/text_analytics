This is my first time trying a Shiseido sunscreen and I was impressed. It has a lightweight and watery texture and it doesn’t leave a white cast. My face looks youthful after applying it. It has no scent and being a mineral sunscreen makes it ideal for sensitive skin. I would buy it again, it’s a bit expensive but it’s worth it. nan
