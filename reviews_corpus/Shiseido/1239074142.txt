I love this sunscreen so much. I must confess I’m a Shiseido fan girl, because their products definitely work for my skin and my family. My oldest has the fairest of fair skin and strawberry blonde hair. Sunscreen is part of our daily life. After a month of using this one consistently on him I’m noticing his freckles fading and we don’t have any accidental burns anymore. The sunscreen texture is more runny than most sunscreen I’ve used; this makes it very easy to blend into your skin. It has no white cast and feels so good on the skin - hydrating and comfortable to wear daily. It’s expensive but my take on it is that it is worth it because it is so effective. effective and sheer, so comfy to wear!
