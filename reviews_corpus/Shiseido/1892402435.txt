I received this product free for review. I love this cream! I use the spf 20 version as my day cream and this one as my night cream. I have early signs of aging ang combination skin… this cream is hydrating without leaving my skin oily. The consistency is luxurious and overall it’s a great product. I will absolutely repurchase. Great for Combination Skin!
