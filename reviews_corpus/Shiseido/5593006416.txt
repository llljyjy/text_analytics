I was given this product for free for review. I genuinely liked this cream. I’ve been using it almost daily for about 2 months. Normally, as someone with some very oily areas (forehead and chin), I don’t often try many creams because I’ve had several break me out or just lay on my skin and make it feel gross. This one did not do that. It soaked in within 5-10 minutes and found if I put it on before I did my hair or brushed my teeth, I could put foundation/makeup on with no problems like clumping, my make up sliding, etc. which is important to me when I’m trying to get ready in the morning. I appreciated that this has SPF 20. I haven’t noticed it show up in photos that I’ve worn it. My skin definitely feels more hydrated, but I can’t say there is a reduction in fine lines. I am for sure going to be purchasing this again! Pretty good, even on oily skin.
