I adore the packaging. It’s so pretty and comes with a little applicator that’s adorable and useful. My skin absorbs this right away and it leaves my skin so soft and moisturized without feeling heavy at all. It’s a thick cream with an spf, but a little goes a long way and works so well (all while offering protection from the sun), I highly recommend. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. A really lovely Day Cream
