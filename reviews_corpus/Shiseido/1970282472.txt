I wear this everyday and loving it so much. Doesn’t burn my eyes or face and blend in like a lotion without white cast or peeling. Very hydrating without feeling like it’s too oily or silicone feel. Feel more like moisturizer that’s very hydrating. Will definitely buy this when the winter month is near. Great for dry sensitive skin
