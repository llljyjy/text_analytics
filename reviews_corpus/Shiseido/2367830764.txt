Took this sunscreen on my recent vacation and I loved it. The blend was amazing and although it did leave a little bit of a white cast I didnâ€™t mind because I wore it under makeup and it left my makeup looking flawless! Excellent skin care, sun protection and a smooth finish? Definitely what I needed. Loved it
