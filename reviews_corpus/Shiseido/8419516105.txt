This isn’t as thick as the day cream with SPF version. Although I love any product with SPF, and do love the creaminess of the other, I prefer this version during the summer since I need something a bit lighter in this hotter, sweatier weather. This also doesn’t seem as strongly scented as the day cream, which will probably be better for those with more sensitive senses. Overall, I would recommend if you have a great face sunscreen to layer with it or only plan to use it at night. nan
