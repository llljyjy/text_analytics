I recently received this complimentary product from Influenster and was really excited to try this new day cream with SPF since I’m all about efficient products. It came with nice and sturdy packaging but a bit too heavy IMO (I dropped it a couple of times because I didn’t realize how heavy it was). The product goes on really smooth and it’s a bit lighter than most SPF creams. I say it’s almost perfect since the smell for the product isn’t the best. The moisturizer scent combined with the typical sunscreen smell was one of the drawbacks for me. Nonetheless I would recommend this product and it has been working great thus far! Almost Perfect SPF Day Cream
