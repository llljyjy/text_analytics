This is fine.  I don’t dislike it but it wouldn’t be a favorite or replace the sunscreen that I was previously using and enjoying.  It claims to be moisturizing and it does feel slightly more hydrating than my usual go-to sunscreen but with that being said it also definitely has a thicker texture, more like a traditional old-school SPF product would have.  There is also a familiar typical SPF scent which isn’t strong and dissipates almost immediately but it is still present. Due to the texture I’ve found that I have to be a little bit more selective about which skincare and primers I use with it because it will cause some products to pill (although not everything) and therefore it just requires some trial and error.As a sunscreen it does what it’s supposed to do but since it’s just a bit on the finicky side it isn’t one that I would repurchase immediately when my current tube is finished. For someone else who wants a basic, hydrating SPF and doesn’t necessarily need/want to layer it with other skincare and makeup this will be a great option. nan
