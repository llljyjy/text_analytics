If you’re sensitive to the scent of sunscreen this product may not be for you. It’s not a pure sunscreen scent but it’s definitely there and it lingers for a while after you put it on. With this cream, make sure you go in extremely light and add more to spots you miss. Initially I used too much (more than a pea less than a dime) and it left my face with a very greasy film. I’m thinking it happened due the sunscreen but im not sure. Once I got the amount right for me, i actually like this cream. As long as you dont use too much, it’s very lightweight and comfortable. I have dry skin and only need to use it once a day. If you have oily skin, I’d be careful with this product and use it very sparingly because of how easy to use too much. Easy to use too much
