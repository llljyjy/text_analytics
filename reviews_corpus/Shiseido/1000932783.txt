I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love this sunscreen. I have slightly dry aging skin, light medium skin tone, and I live in the humidity capital of the country (FL). I wear sunscreen religiously and am very picky. I prefer mineral sunscreen on my face bc it doesnâ€™t sting my eyes. This is a runny liquid with a slight peachy tint. It applies very easily and rubs in quickly leaving a slight purplish cast. Deeper skin tones would want to use this under makeup. I have been using this for the past 2 weeks and have really been enjoying it. It plays well with my other skincare with no killing or gunking up. It sits well under liquid makeup,however, I find that it does shorten the wear time quite a bit. I have no problems with powder foundation. I love the finish of it on its own. It is a true natural finish- not matte but not shiny either. It is comfortable to wear and lasts very well. My ONLY complaint is the price. It is very expensive, especially compared with other mid to high end skincare brands. New Fave
