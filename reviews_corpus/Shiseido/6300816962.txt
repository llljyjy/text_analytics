This is a must-have product for summer skin. I have oily skin and it feels like it takes forever for my face to cool down for makeup application in the summer. The mattifying and drying effect of this primer was amazing. I wore it under makeup for an event in Miami and my makeup looked great all day! There also wasn’t a white cast on my skin which is something I notice with a lot of sunscreens. It’s a great value and I absolutely will purchase again. MUST HAVE FOR SUMMER
