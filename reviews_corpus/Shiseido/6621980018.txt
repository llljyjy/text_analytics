I have dry, sensitive skin with rosacea. I feel no irritation from this moisturizer and I love the way it feels. It feels silky, smooth when applying to your skin. The packaging is also very nice. Feels heavy and looks chic. I love that it has spf 20! Shiseido products are definitely on my radar now, Iâ€™m happy I got to try it! nan
