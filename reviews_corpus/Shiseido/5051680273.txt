I’ve been using Shiseido since I was a teen since my mom touted the Asian beauty secrets of this line. I love the travel-friendly packaging of this great moisturizer that keeps my skin hydrated and glowing all day. I don’t tend to burn easily, but if I’m in the sun for long periods, I can get uneven dark spots. So, I like the protection and evenness of my skin tone when I use this moisturizing sunscreen formula. I received this product complimentary from Shiseido and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really love this product and I’ll continue to purchase it for summertime. Dewy glow all day
