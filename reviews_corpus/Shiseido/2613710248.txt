I love the fact that this sunscreen is oil free! I have sensitive skin, and I am always afraid to try moisturizers for fear they will break me out. This applied like a dream and did not make me break out! I was able to wear it under some foundation as well without it breaking the foundation up. Also, it doesnâ€™t leave a weird grey/white film behind on the skin. Highly recommend! Lightweight Sunscreen
