I was skeptical when receiving this cream because I’ve never personally tried anything from the brand. But this cream is actually amazing. I can’t comment on the sunscreen qualities yet because I haven’t worn it outside but the cream is so hydrating. Usually after washing my face, my skin is dry and tight. After applying this, my skin is soft, supple and not greasy. I love it!!My skin looks great with it on and it hydrated my face better than other moisturizers. Highly reccomend for my dry skin beauties. Great for Dry Skin
