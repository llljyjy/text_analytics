Loving the Shiseido Ultimune Infusing Concentrate! Absorbs nicely and quickly into the skin with no sticky or weird consistency. It has a nice natural scent that would be good for anyone sensitive to fragrances as it’s very light and almost non existent. I haven’t been using this for super long but feel like I’m already seeing results. It really helps with other skincare products and increases their effectiveness without a ton of extra steps. I’ve also used this product on its own and am extremely impressed with its hydrating and moisturizing abilities. I feel like it makes my skin feel and look more youthful right away! I always feel refreshed when I use this and you only need a small amount as a little goes a long way! I would recommend this to anyone looking to amplify their skincare routine or if you’re looking for a little extra hydration with anti aging benefits. For those with sensitive skin, this will be great for you because it doesn’t cause any irritation or burning whatsoever when applied. My skin is on the sensitive side and it’s also dry and it’s perfect for me. Also the packaging is beautiful which is a huge bonus. I love using a product that not only works beautifully but looks beautiful as well! This will be a new staple in my routine and I highly recommend it! Try it now if you’re on the fence, I hope you love it like I do! Loving the new Ultimune Power Infusing Concentrate
