i received this product complimentary for a honest review. I really wanted to love this product but it didn’t do anything for me. I used it after I showered and before I moisturized for a few weeks and didn’t see any dramatic difference. It may work for your skin type though, but for the price point I’d recommend trying samples first before buying the full sized bottle! Didn’t do much for me
