This mixture is thin but wow it literally melts flawlessly into your skin. I used it alone one day and an hour later caught a glimpse of my skin in the mirror, I was glowing as if I had put on a BB cream. It works wonderful as a primer BUT also great for those minimal summer days where you just want some stronger skin protection for the whole day. It seems very waterproof and held up well while swimming. Leaves skin feeling moisturized and not greasy what so ever. I really love this sunscreen and would buy this brand again. Melts into skin perfectly zero white cast
