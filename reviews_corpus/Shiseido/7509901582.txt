I have been trying this sunscreen for a week now and I enjoy using it. It has a very lightweight texture. It makes me feel nothing on my skin. This leaves a semi matte finish and works well under makeup. Shiseido sunscreens always sacrifice my needs for sun protection. Definitely will be repurchasing another one in the future. nan
