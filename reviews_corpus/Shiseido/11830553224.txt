This product is amazing! I have tried Shiseido sunscreens in the past, so I knew the products are good. But this sunscreen is definitely my new favorite from the brand. At first, I was out of by the consistency. It has a glue like consistency, so I was worried I was t going to be easy to blend but I was wrong. The sunscreen is blendable, moisturizing and it doesnâ€™t leave a white cast! love it!
