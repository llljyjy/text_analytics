I love it I love it it’s so amazing it’s actually so hydrating which is huge for me but not super greasy the smell doesn’t really bother me and normally I don’t like the smell of sunscreen on my face it usually gives me a headache but this one tho is beyond amazing and it doesn’t break me out I have very sensitive skin and this doesn’t bother it Amazing
