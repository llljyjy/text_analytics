Really like the fact that this is a moisturizer and sunscreen in 1. It absorbs nicely and isn’t heavy like some others that I’ve tried.  It has a nice light fragrance. The only thing I don’t love about it is the bottle. It falls over easily in my cabinet, but wouldn’t not get the product because of that. Great 2-1
