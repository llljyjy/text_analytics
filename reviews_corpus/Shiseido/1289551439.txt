The Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream is super creamy and luxe feeling! Shiseido is a company I can rely on to have quality products. This super hydrating cream is great for those with dry skin, I like how smooth & hydrated my skin feels after using. The only con is the added fragrance, which is a bit strong. Fragrance can often be aggravating for those who are acne-prone. Overall, definitely a great quality moisturizer! Creamy & luxe!
