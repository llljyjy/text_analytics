Not only does this contain a good amount of sun protection, the Hyaluronic Acid will help to plump the skin and hydrate for a healthier looking complexion. This is meant to protect the skin from harmful UVA Lights, UVB Lights, and pollution. No oxygen oxybenzone, oxtinoxate, parabens, or cyclic Silicone. Non comedogenic, Dermatologist & Ophthalmologist Tested.  My favorite has to be the Fresh Moisture Sunscreen from packaging to formula. This one leaves a dewy complexion without the greasy feeling. It looks and feels very close to a Cream, but still feels like water and applies smoothly on the skin. I feel like this one slightly blurs out my texture and acne and is great for combo to drier skin types due to its high Moisture content. The tubing is upside down so you don’t waste product and you don’t have to shake the bottle! Best of all this leaves the skin looking and feeling smoother with not a trace of white cast for my brown skinned girls! The Perfect spf for brown skin Beauty's
