This cream is so hydrating without leaving a lingering heavy feeling. I live in the desert so SPF is a must, so I love that this provides hydration and protection all in one. My mom was here in vacation and tried it and agreed it’s the best cream she’s ever used. Only thing I would change is the fragrance, it’s not pleasant and I hate using products with fragrances overall. Best day cream I’ve ever used
