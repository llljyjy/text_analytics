I received this product free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. I decided to give this the ultimate test and wear it for an outdoor protest as it’s a chemical sunscreen and an SPF 42.  I wore it in place of my normal moisturizer as the reviews I’d read said it was very moisturizing, (perhaps too much) and I figured it would be a good base under a light tinted foundation. Lolol. I ended up looking like Casper the friendly ghost.  To say this has a white cast is an understatement.  It went on pretty thick.  Definitely more like a sunscreen. It had a pretty harsh sunscreen scent that never went away and is pretty off putting.  Unfortunately, as I was sweating outside it also ran into my eyes and stung like a sunscreen.  All bad.  Definitely not something you can wear on your face, so this is a highly confusing product.  That brings me to my next issue.  I don’t have sensitive skin and this broke me out.  :/I went to the reviews when this happened and found it wasn’t uncommon.  Bummer.  The sunscreen worked ok. I was a little bit pink when I got home after an hour and a half in the sun. I did like the bottle and applicator.  Sadly, I wouldn’t recommend this to a friend or purchase it.  #shiseidosuncare #complimentary @shiseido @Influenster White cast/oily
