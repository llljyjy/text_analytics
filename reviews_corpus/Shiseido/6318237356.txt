I received this product free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love getting new skin care to try so I was definitely excited to try these. I used them for about 2 weeks before leaving this review. I have no complaints about this product! Very light weight, I used it under my make up, and I actually love the smell. The smell reminds me of being at the beach so it doesn’t bother me- it’s not an overpowering smell either. I would buy. nan
