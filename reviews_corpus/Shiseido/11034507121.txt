Used the day cream for about a week and could already see a difference in my skin. It feels very refreshing. Very convenient for these cold and dry days of winter where your skin needs a boost. The only thing that I really did not like was the fragrance it has. I am very sensitive to fragrances so that was a bummer. But overall product meets expectations. Very Hydrating
