This is a very nice sunscreen. I live in a hot climate so I always need to protect my skin. This applied evenly and blended in, no white spots. It has a pleasant light fragrance and feels hydrating. My skin has a nice dewy glow from it as well. I like the size of the bottle too, itâ€™s the perfect size to slip into your purse. Fresh Hydrating Sunscreen
