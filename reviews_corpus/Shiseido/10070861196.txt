I was truly excited to receive this voxbox and couldn’t wait to try this sunscreen. After trying it daily for the past week I’ve found that it has great protection with its SPF 42 and gives a nice hydration to my skin. Its lightweight, it doesn’t leave a whitecast, I reapply it every couple of hours if I’m in the sun all day and doesn’t leave my skin oily or greasy looking or feeling. This is a great mineral sunscreen with hylaraunic acid. Great sun protection and hydration
