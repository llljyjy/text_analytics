Excited to get this, but it’s not too different from the Oil free one. Just the applicator is different and consistency. The Fresh moisture one is just white and a bit thicker. Disappointed that it’s a chemical sunscreen and only for the face though. However I do always need protection from the sun since I burn quickly and I’m very pale. I definitely like the Oil Free one more, because it mattes down and my combination skin doesn’t looks so greasy after applying. Which is an issue for me with other sunscreens. Unfortunately I don’t think I will buy again, when I run out, because of the price. Also it’s only spf 42 so I’m reapplying often. I always use spf 100. Not my favorite.
