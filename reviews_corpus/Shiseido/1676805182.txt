I want to start off by stating that this will be a new staple in my skin-care routine. It does not have that typical sunscreen smell or feel. Iâ€™ve used this in conjunction with my other serums and moisturizers as well as just on its own, because it feels that nice.  It helps keep my dry face moisturized all day, and the best thing about it is it is not greasy AT ALL. Absolutely love this product. Seriously Amazing!
