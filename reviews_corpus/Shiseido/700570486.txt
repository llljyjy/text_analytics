I admit fault for not checking the ingredients before purchasing but ugh! This product contains fragrance. Why? Why put fragrance into a facial sunscreen? You’re probably wearing this to exercise, or go to the beach, or otherwise get sweaty - all adding fragrance to the mix can do is cause irritation. It’s just so not necessary. Since I developed rosacea I have to avoid products with fragrance - a difficult task! But there are several products I’ve whiffed on due to the fact that it just never occurred to me that they would contain fragrance. This is one of them. I could put up with the chalkiness and the difficulty blending if this was fragrance free. Sensitive skins need SPF too! Fragrance? Why??
