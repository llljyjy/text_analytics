I received this product free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. I was surprised and excited when I received this in the mail. It feels great on my skin and is fast absorbing. It has Hyaluronic Acid which is great for the skin. I love that it protects against UVA and UVB rays. It does not have a bad smell and it wears so well. I love this SPF
