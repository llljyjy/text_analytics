I received this product for free from Shiseido & Influenster for my honest review. Pretty good sunscreen. Lightweight feel on the skin. I wish it was fragrance free but it doesn’t last. I prefer mineral sunscreens because of my sensitive skin. I would definitely try more from the brand. I’m a daily sunscreen wearer because I work outside. I have combo/sensitive skin. nan
