My experience with this product is very limited, but I wanted to add my first impression as a word of caution for people with more sensitive skin.I couldn’t wear this sunscreen even for 10 minutes.At first it was the strong scent; I expected Shiseido to use fragrance in their skincare, but the scent is just too much. After that it was the pasty thick consistency that makes it hard to apply; it also has a pearly sheen which can look perfecting under makeup for some and tin-man shiny for others; I applied the same amount I usually use for sunscreen, it was too much to look well so I had to wash and reapply a tiny amount (most likely not enough for actual sun protection). Third, 10 minutes after applying the thin layer I had to wash my face again because my eyes were watery and my skin was itching. It wasn’t that bad, but sincerely at that point I couldn’t stand the scent anymore. I do acknowledge I’m more sensitive than most people, so my bad experience might not be yours. Not for sensitive skin (and nose)
