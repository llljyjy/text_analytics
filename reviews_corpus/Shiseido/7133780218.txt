I received this product to try for my honest review from influencer and shiseido. I love the amount that they sent us for the free samples. I also love this brand. Although I can’t really tell the difference between this one and one containing SPF, I do really like them both as they don’t make me break out with my acne prone skin. Doesn’t have a very strong fragrance thankfully and absorbs well into the skin but does it take a little bit to absorb fully. Love it
