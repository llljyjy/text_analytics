If you’re looking for a higher end facial sunscreen, this could be a good option for you! The formula was thinner than I’m used to, but I found that made even application pretty easy. My face didn’t feel greasy after using it, and there was no white cast left behind! I wore this sunscreen alone when I went to the beach, and I was sunburn free after 2 hours in the florida sun. The only real negative to me is that this small 1oz bottle retails for $35. I can confirm that you get what you pay for though! Wonderful Facial Sunscreen
