This product seemed like a decent product. I like it… but don’t love it. I don’t think I would by this product for the price of it. I don’t love the fragrance of it either as well. Had a strong alcohol scent to me. It felt very nice on my skin though. I really liked the consistency of this serum it wasn’t too runny like some serums are. I did feel like my skin was a little more vibrant after using for a few days as well. nan
