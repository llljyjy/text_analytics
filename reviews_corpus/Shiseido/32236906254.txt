I recieved this product free from Influenster and Shiseido for my review, but I will honestly say I didn’t want to do this one because I don’t like doing negative reviews, and I am being generous with giving this 3 stars. For the postives: It comes out white but it does rub in to the skin completely, not leaving any type of cast, at least on my light skintone. It also is hydrating enough for my dry skin without leaving it greasy or being continuously sticky throughout the day like some sunscreens can be. Now with that said, in a weird way I can still feel it on my skin all day and it is not comfortable. Also, it has such a strong sunscreen smell that irritates my eyes all day long. I have been wearing it for 7 hours as I write this review, and my eyes are still watering from it and I can still feel it on my skin. Because of that I can not imagine having to reapply it several times a day like you are supposed to. I would put this on par with just an ok drugstore sunscreen, and will be using the rest on my body but not on my face.   I really really wanted to love this sunscreen, especially after getting this for free from a brand that I have heard so many great things about. I was extremely excited to recieve this, along with the other sunscreen they sent me in the same box, so you can imagine my disappointment when I didn’t like either of them. I know that their Japanese sunscreens have rave reviews, so I am definitely not writing the company off all together, but I do really feel that they shouldn’t have put out a product that is not up to their normal standards. I look forward to being able to write a positive review on one of their better products in the future. nan
