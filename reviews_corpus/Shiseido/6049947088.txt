I spent too much time looking for a moisturizer but this one was sent to me to try and let me tell you I just love it. It is so light and makes my face feel soft and moisturized. You don’t know how many times I tell the hubs to touch my face so he can feel. I use it mostly when I know I’m going to be indoors or even after a late night shower before bed. I love how they have this lotion also available with spf for those sunny days. I would recommend both, as I switch back and forth between the two. Light moisturizer
