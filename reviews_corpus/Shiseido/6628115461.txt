I really enjoy this cream because it is lightweight, smells great and has SPF. Because it has hyaluronic acid, it feels moisturizing. Packaging is also so pretty. However, I have pretty dry skin, so in the winter, itâ€™s not enough to use by itself. I can see this as being a staple in the summer! Lovely
