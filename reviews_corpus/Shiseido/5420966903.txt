This is my all-time favorite sunscreen. The product itself is quite liquidy during application but dries down, nearly immediately, to a matte, almost powdery finish. This sunscreen leaves no white cast or oily sheen, and has never broken me out! The product plays quite well under makeup, there is never any product pilling nor impact on the longevity of my foundation or powder. Holy grail sunscreen! Perfect Sunscreen
