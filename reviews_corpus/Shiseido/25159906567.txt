I received this product to try for free for my honest opinion. It’s a light weight sunscreen that blends seamlessly, doesn’t leave a white cast on the face and works really well with makeup. This is the first Shieshido product that I’ve tried and really like it. Will be my go-to sunscreen for this summer! Lightweight sunscreen
