This sunscreen is way too thick and greasy to be used under makeup for my skin. It never dried down the entire day I wore it on bare skin and was very shiny. It seems like a good product overall though. The smell is pleasant and not at all chemical. There was no white cast. It didnâ€™t burn or sting my eyes. I would use this for a pool or beach day but it will not be my everyday facial sunscreen for wearing under make-up. Recommend but not for using with makeup
