I was thrilled to receive the Shiseido Fresh Moisture Hyaluronic Acid as a free sample. While it feels a bit thick when you initially apply it to your face, it soaks into your skin with ease—giving a nice, dewy look. I love that it’s a relatively high SPF (compared to some popular 15 spf brands), and love that it doesn’t leave your face looking super white or patchy. My only complaint is that, while I like the dewy look, it can also look slightly oily/greasy, which is why I prefer the Shiseido Oil-free Hyaluronic Acid sunscreen. This one is still in my top 3 favorites! I’d recommend giving it a try! Top 3 favorite sunscreens!
