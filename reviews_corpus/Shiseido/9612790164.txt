This serum has been my favorite part of my skincare routine! I had some dry patches before I started using it, and my skin had been looking a bit dull, but after only about a week of use, I have noticed somewhat of a difference in my skin texture and an improvement in dullness. And on top of that, it feels sooo nice, I love the texture of the serum and my face feels very refreshed after using Super soothing, love the texture
