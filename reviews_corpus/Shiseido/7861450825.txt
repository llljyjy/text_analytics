This was my first time using a mineral sunscreen. The texture of the sunscreen is a little watery, so you have to be careful when dispensing it or it drips. It did not leave an oily residue and there was minimal white casting because the product is tinted. I have dry skin, so it does leave my skin feeling dry unless I apply a face oil beforehand.
