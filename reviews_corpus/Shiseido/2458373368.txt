This SPF absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy on my skin; the hyaluronic acid makes it feel hydrating. It does have a light scent that’s not overpowering. It doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin at all. I wish that it came in a much larger size, however - I’ll use this up it just a couple applications! nan
