I’m received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I think this is a good product. I live at the beach so sunscreen is a staple in my morning routine. I did not burn with this one so it essentially did it’s job. I did not like the consistency, it was very watery for some reason. Also I did notice a very slight white cast. Pretty good!
