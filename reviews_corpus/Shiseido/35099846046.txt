Let’s start with the good! Amazing packaging, I have the 7.oz one. Very small and compact. Easily stick it in your purse or makeup bag. The application is it glides on your skin and its clear. SO for all my melanated ladies like myself, it works well with your skin tone. And the SPF is greatNow for the bad. It has a smell. It smells like citrus. So it’s not fragrance-free & I wouldn’t say it’s okay for sensitive skin. It caused a bit of irritation & left me some bumps. Questionable?!
