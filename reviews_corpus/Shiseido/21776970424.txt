I have been carrying this around in my purse and it is perfect for reapplication on the go. I love the consistency and that it doesn’t leave any pasty residue. There is a scent to the sunscreen but more of a cleanser smell than a sunscreen. Definitely not overpowering. I 100% recommend this product to anyone looking for a great sunscreen. The only reason I dropped a star is because I do think it’s very pricey for the size, but sun protection is worth the cost for many so that may not be an issue. Great Sunscreen
