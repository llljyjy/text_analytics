I received this product free in return for my honest opinion. Overall, as a sunscreen product this is really nice - good SPF, lightweight and no flash back/white cast. However, as someone with oily skin, this isn’t the best option for me because the “moisture” part really holds true, so those with dry to normal skin may fare better. That being said, the ingredients are pretty good/healthy (as we have seen more and more come out about the risks with many cosmetics and sunscreens). Overall, this should work for others just not my skin favorite. nan
