Because I have really dry skin, I am incredibly picky with the moisturizers that I use. The Shiseido  Essential Energy Hydrating Day Cream has become an integral step in my day routine. After applying my toners and serums, I apply a generous pea-sized amount all over the face. The cream comes with a small spatula that makes scooping product sanitary and clean. My only dislike is that I need to keep the boxed packaging in order to not lose the spatula. I highly recommend for those with dry skin!! Perfect for dry skin
