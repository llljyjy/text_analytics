I really like this product! Iâ€™ve used it daily for a few weeks now-my skin feels smoother, and it gives me a nice glow when I use it under my makeup. It is not greasy, not heavy, and easily layers with moisturizer and makeup. It does have a slight smell, but the smell goes away quickly and it is not overpowering. Another win from this brand! Great product
