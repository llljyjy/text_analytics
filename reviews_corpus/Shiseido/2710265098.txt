Well this does prevent any type of sunburn when used correctly, it definitely does leave a white cast and it’s hard to blend into the skin. It’s very oily/liquidy. I’m not sure it’s worth the price for the small amount that you get. However if you need any sunscreen that you know Will work it does do the trick. It’s just ok.
