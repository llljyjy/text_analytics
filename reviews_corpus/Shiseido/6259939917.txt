The winter can be brutal on our skin, especially when you’re pale and have incredibly sensitive skin like me! I’ve been using this Ultimune Power Infusing Serum daily for just over a month now, and I am in LOOOVE with it! It has been giving my dry winter skin the extra hydration it SOOO desperately needed! It’s light floral smell is so refreshing and feminine and I’m loving the improvement I’ve been seeing and feeling in my skin’s appearance!!! Can’t wait to see what continued regular use does for me In love with this product!!!
