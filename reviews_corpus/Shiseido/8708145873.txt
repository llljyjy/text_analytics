I received this product complimentary from Influenster. I can be somewhat picky on my moisturizers because I have pretty dry skin, especially in the winter, so I would normally choose a thicker cream for this time of year. However, I am actually impressed by how hydrated my skin feels after using this and all day. My only beef is the packaging. Although it’s beautiful, I hate jars and much prefer a tube of some kind. Even with using the applicator, its much simpler to sqeeze the product out than to keep cleaning the applicator. That’s just me. I do love this brand and have honestly been impressed by all of their products that I’ve tried so far. Great lightweight day cream
