I got this Shiseido Fresh Moisture Sunscreen and it has 42 spf in it. It seems more like a moisturizer than just Sunscreen. It made my skin feel soft. There is a slight Sunscreen smell to it but it is not bad. My skin soaked it up almost immediately. You really do not need to use a lot as it spreads well. it is more of a thinner cream. I didnâ€™t have any issues with it. I definitely recommend as it is important to protect your face. I did get to try this for free but the opinions here are based on my own experiences. Very hydrating and worked great
