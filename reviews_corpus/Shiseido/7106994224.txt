Love the packaging it is very chic and heavy duty. I like that the container inside with the product is removable, hopefully that means that you could get refills and that they jar is recyclable. It comes with a little scooper to help with application, but I wish it had a place to be stored in the container soo I don’t lose it or have to just leave it on the counter. The moisturizer is thick and seems to work well leaving me hydrated, but for it to be spf it needs to be reapplied every 2 hours if You’re in the sun and with hours high the case is I wouldn’t say it’s the most travel friendly. Leaves my face feeling smooth and plump, not sticky at all. SPF, thick and hydrating
