This was a great formula for moisture, I didnâ€™t get to spend much time in the sun yet to be able to speak to the sun protection it offers. Only took away 1 star because I also received the oil-free formula and I thought it was much better and would recommend it over this one. Other than that it is great! great moisturizer
