I love Shiseido’s Urban Environment Oil-Free Mineral Sunscreen! Usually, I layer sunscreen under my moisturizer because sunscreen doesn’t have skincare benefits, but this little beauty has hyaluronic acid, so it’s moisturizing and acts as a primer. It doesn’t leave my skin looking shiny. It’s SO good! Don’t go out without this one!
