In the realm of “good for you“ sunscreens, this is definitely a good contender. My only issues are that I have oily skin, so even though this is “oil free“ it does still get me little greasy feeling (could be the extra hyaluronic acid) and the color/tint - this gives me a white cast I just don’t like and don’t have to try to mitigate with my usual product (La Roche Posay Anthelios Mineral Sunscreen Fluid SPF 50). So, while this is a nice product, it’s not nice enough for me and my combo skin to change from what I have now. LOVED IT
