The sunscreen is NOT worth the price. The tube is very small. I applied it to my family of 4 and the tube is gone after one use. I would suggest just keeping this tube for your face, because if you use it all over the body for sun protection, it wonâ€™t lash long. I received this item complimentary, for testing purposes. Not worth it
