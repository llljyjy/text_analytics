I have been using this serum on my combination, sensitive skin as part of my nightly routine. I absolutely love it! The serum feels luxurious and cooling. It has a pleasant smell and leaves my skin feeling so soft. The most noticeable impact has been an improved skin texture and increased skin hydration without negatively impacting the oily zones on my face. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to invest in better, softer skin! I will absolutely be repurchasing when I run out. Holy Grail!
