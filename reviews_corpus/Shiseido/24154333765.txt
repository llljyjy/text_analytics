I really liked this product. It makes my skin feel moisturized. I have a dry spot right between my eyes on my forhead and this has been clearing that up.  The only thing I don’t like is there really isn’t any scent and I am a scent kind of person. I love things that smell good. Overall extremely happy with this product. nan
