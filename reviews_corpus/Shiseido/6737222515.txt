I was surprised when I received this to try out and I was very excited because I never had this brands products before but I heard good things. I am turning 26 this year so anything to prevent early aging, I am always willing to try! First, I have acne prone skin and with every new product I always have to worry about breaking out, but with this one, I didn’t! I’ve only tried it for a couple weeks so I’m not sure if I see a difference or will anytime soon since I’m using it as an age prevention. It leaves my skin supple and that’s probably what’s its suppose to do Impressed so far
