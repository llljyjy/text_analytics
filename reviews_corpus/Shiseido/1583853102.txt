Have been using for 2 months. I have found my cleanser! I had been using a Benefiance product that was discontinued, and it took my skin a week or two to adjust to this cleanser. For my dry-but-still-acne-prone skin, it is better than Tatcha rice wash, and Caudalie Vinoclean. At night I use Dermalogica pre-cleanse cleansing oil, then Shiseido’s amazing clarifying cleansing foam. Perfect balance between cleansing and protecting my skin. Couldn’t be happier with this product! So nice to know I have a facial cleanser I can count on. This. Is. It.
