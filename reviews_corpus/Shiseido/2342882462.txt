I was gifted this product to test out and review, and I really love it. This actually surprised me because I had previously tried a skincare product from this brand and I wasn’t too impressed. Results were noticeable in the first 3 days, and prolonged use makes my skin look radiant and more hydrated, and doesn’t leave my combo skin looking oily.It’s definitely on the pricier side but, I would purchase this for myself, or as a gift. nan
