I received this product complimentary to share my unbiased review.  The Shiseido oil free mineral sun screen with spf42 was new to my regimen.  The liquidy consistency was too watery for my liking as an everyday staple in my skincare routine.  I was cautious of it leaking when squeezing onto hand.  I also found it too ashy for my medium complexion skin to wear alone.  However, it did not pose a problem under my foundation.  Altogether, I will continue to use daily as a protectant under my foundation. Hit or miss
