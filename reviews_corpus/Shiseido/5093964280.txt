this moisturizer is fine, i have struggled with it pilling up on my skin. even just adding spf or liquid blush on top makes it ball up badly on me. the component is beautiful, though, and if it wasnâ€™t for that it would be a lovely moisturizer. just not for me! thank you to influenster for providing me this product for review. Two point five
