Great face cream.  I love the way it makes my face feel smooth and hydrate.  My face does not look oily after applying compare to other moisturizing creams.  I could use it under my makeup and my foundation goes on smooth.  Also use it without and perfect for everyday use.  I love the that is SPF 20 so it protects your skin from sun damage. Will highly recommend. Moisture Rocks
