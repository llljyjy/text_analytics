In the summer I always keep sunscreen in my bag and this has been my new go-to. It has a great scent and absorbs into the skin really well. It only takes a few seconds to apply and goes on more like a light lotion. As for the protection I feel that it works very well but you should re-apply when needed. Great sunscreen
