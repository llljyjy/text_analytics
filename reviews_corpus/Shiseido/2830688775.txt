The Shiseido Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen is a bit thick it takes a while to fully blend it in. It does not leave a sheen, but it also does not mix well with makeup. My makeup felt like it was sitting on top of the sunscreen and it made my face oily. A little bit goes a long way and I found that to be one of the few benefits of this sunscreen. It is on the pricey side. If you are looking for a Shiseido sunscreen, then I would recommend this. nan
