I used this sunscreen once was concerned that one of the 5 words on the back label was “flammable”. It’s very rare for a sunscreen to be flammable when it’s a lotion and not an aerosol. I didn’t burn and it smelled nice, but I wouldn’t use it again or make it part of my routine since the ingredients are flammable- that can’t be good for you. It’s okay
