I used this product multiple times while doing various things in my yard. The sunscreen is very watery, which I wasn’t expecting. Even though it’s watery it goes on very easily and kind of adds a glow to your skin. It’s easy to apply and protected my skin from the sun. After using it multiple times I ended up really liking it. nan
