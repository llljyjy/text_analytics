I’ve been looking for items to help cut down the number of steps it takes to get ready. This packs a punch moisture wise. I apply it and go about my morning so when I apply my makeup it’s not tacky. It sits well under my makeup and I love that it has spf (one less thing I need to apply and worry about white cast) Amazing daytime moisturizer
