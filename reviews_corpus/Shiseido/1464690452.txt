I received this from Influenster and after trying it for a few weeks I was not truly impressed. It wasn’t oily but did take a while to dry down. It left my skin much lighter and you could tell I’d put something on so I wouldn’t wear this alone. I wore it under makeup and by end of day my chin was dry and breaking apart when that doesn’t happen with any other product of used. I have dry skin so maybe the matte formula didn’t agree with me skin. It didn’t break me out but it’s just not going to a go to for me. Good not great
