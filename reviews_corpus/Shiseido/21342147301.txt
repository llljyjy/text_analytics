This sunscreen leaves my skin looking dewy but not greasy. I have oily skin and this product works great with my skin. This sunscreen works great with other products. It does not sting my eyes. I even used it before a day at the pool. I have never found a sunscreen that does not get into my eyes from water splashing at the pool. This sunscreen does have a scent until it is absorbed. nan
