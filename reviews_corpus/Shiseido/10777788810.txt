I have fell in love with this product! It smells nice, the packaging is cool, the way it feels on my face is amazing. I have no bad things to say about this product! It makes my skin so soft after every use but I’ve noticed after using it for a month now the hydration of my skin has improved so much. I love that I have this serum to use throughout the winter months. I have sensitive skin too and this hasn’t caused me any problems. Definitely try this serum out and see if it works for you! Great product!!
