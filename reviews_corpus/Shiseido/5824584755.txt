I really loved the cute packaging and they are the perfect size to fit in your handbag or even pocket! It dispenses the perfect amount with one little squeeze, I hate when products release far too much. It smells gorgeous! Like a summers day at the pool in the Bahamas! Glides on and absorbs almost right away without absorbing so fast you can’t rub it in correctly. Doesn’t leave any greasy film. Protected my skin for hours. Great!
