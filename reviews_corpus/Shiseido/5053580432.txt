I really enjoyed both versions of the sunscreen but this one was definitely my favorite I favorite I don’t really need an additional moisturizer with my dry skin if I use this 1 and it goes underneath make up really really well and I don’t notice any break up throughout the day I would definitely buy this again if I ran out New favorite
