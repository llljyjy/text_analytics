I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. As a redhead with pale skin and freckles I have used just about every sunscreen for my face, but somehow missed this one. I’m so glad I got to try it out! The formula is really milky and smooth, and is actually hydrating since it has hyaluronic acid in it also. Most mineral sunblocks I’ve used have left a white tint (even on my pale skin) and have dried my face out and caused breakouts, but this one does not do either of those things. I also love that it is sweat and waterproof. I sweat a lot at work in the summertime and this actually keeps my face from sweating as much as it normally does. It almost has a antiperspirant-like effect on my face, but not in a bad way. I love the high spf in this formula as well. If you use any anti-aging or dark spot treatments, spf of 30 or more is a must, and this product has spf 42! This is absolutely my new favorite facial sunscreen now! Perfect facial sunscreen!!
