I really like this sunscreen because it absorbs nicely and doesn’t leave me skin feeling greasy. This one doesn’t have a tint like the other one but this one does seem to add a bit of a glow. This one does also feel a bit more hydrating compared to the other one. The scent isn’t bad either, it does have that strong sunscreen scent. I can actually see myself using this sunscreen. nan
