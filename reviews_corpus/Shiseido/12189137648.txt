This is my first time using a mineral sunscreen and I am so impressed! The formula was lightweight and non-greasy - but most importantly, there was no white tint visible on my skin! I absolutely love Shiseido skincare and the sunscreen is no different. Very happy with this and will purchase in the future - Asian brands do sunscreen best! Asian brands do sunscreen best!
