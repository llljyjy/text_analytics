I am a sunscreen junkie since I’ve moved to Florida. Finding ones that don’t leave me with a super greasy face has been really difficult since I am someone with really oily skin. These two sunscreens that Shiseido has sent me has been great! This one is nice and light and goes on easy with a little rubbing. Doesn’t leave my face super oily and I like that my skin looks nice and hydrated while being protected throughout the day. nan
