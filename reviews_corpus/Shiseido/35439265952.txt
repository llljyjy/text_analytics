For removing eye makeup these are fantastic - because the texture does not pull at the fragile skin around my eye area. Never before had I imagined that normal drugstore cotton pads were not adequate for this purpose until I purchased myself a pack of these. Now I use only these to remove mascara, eyeshadow and eye SPF, and have absolutely zero redness or irritation which I used to experience quite often with normal cotton pads. I don’t use these for the rest of my face as they soak up a lot of the micellar water I use and I can find myself going through a bottle much faster. For other areas I just stick to regular drugstore cotton rounds. The other use I have for these is when I have a troublesome patch - rough/dehydrated area or acne mark. I simply cut the pad down to size required to cover the area, soak it with the right watery serum for the purpose and place it over the area. The pad adheres well so long as I’m not moving about and by the time I’ve removed it 10 minutes later I’ve had an intensive spot treatment that no amount of layering products would have achieved!~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
