First of all, I absolutely love the oil free version, as I have combo leaning toward oily skin. However, I only gave four stars because it’s pricey and on some days I got a slightly white cast- nothing crazy. It may be more suitable for lighter skin gals. The bottle doesn’t contain a lot of product- but I’m a firm believer in you get what you pay for- which is why I tend to buy higher end. No wonky side effects and skin usually improves overtime. I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Good for dry skin?
