I’ve use a lot of mineral sun screen products, and this is by far a favorite. The finish is very sheer, and absorbs completely for a nice matte finish. I used this under makeup and my liquid foundation looked great over it. I’d recommend this to anyone looking for a mineral based sun screen to use with or without makeup. Truly Sheer!
