The Shiseido Power Infusing Serum is such a delicate serum. So a light, slight milky appearance with a watery texture. This serum absorbs into your skin quickly without any heaviness. After about a month of using this serum in the winter, when skin is prone to drying out, my skin felt so smooth and reduced those morning lines you get after sleeping on your pillow drastically. I feel that my skin is much softer and has a nice glow after using this serum for a month, and excited to see the full results! A tiny amount goes quite a long way with just two pumps. I also like the pump design of this serum bottle the serum is not wasted but is able to be applied without any complications or messy. Overall a very elegant serum to help make you have a special self-care facial. Very impressed overall. Noticeable Difference
