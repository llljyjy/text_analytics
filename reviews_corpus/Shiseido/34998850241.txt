I absolutely love the product, here are few positives that I discovered: 1. The bottle it came in was of good quality itself that speaks about the quality of the product we are getting 2. The serum I felt is light weight , easy to apply, optimal way for daily hydration and works perfectly as a primer.I definitely did notice my skin getting smooth.One slightly negative aspect which I found was: 1. The retail price was on higher end , I understand the quality of product is good but I still feel the price could be decreased to make it accessible to more buyers. Light weight hydrating serum
