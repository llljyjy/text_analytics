A bit of background about my skin. I have dry to normal skin. I don’t generally break out but my skin can be sensitive sometimes and then break out. My skin is sometime dehydrated but I generally can tell because I have dry skin. I would consider my skintone in the medium deep category. Ok on to the review. This is a great sunscreen it feels great on the skin like a very rich moisturizer.  It doesnt leave any white cast and it absorbs into my skin really nicely leaving a very evident glow. It smells like sunscreen and has a citrus scent I would say. It plays well with the makeup I wore it with however it does change the finish to a more luminous/radiant finish. It’s also looks good on it’s own without foundation but I would say that oily skin people might find this to glowy or oily looking on there skin. Overall a definite great sunscreen for dry skin. Got me glowing
