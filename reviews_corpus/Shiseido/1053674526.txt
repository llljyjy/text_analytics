I was lucky enough to try this. Unfortunately it is not for me. It leaves a white cast and it was drying. Absolutely you cannot use this u ser makeup. If you don’t mind the pinkish/white cast, then this is for you. I will continue using this so it won’t go to waste but I will moisturize and maybe mix a skin tint with it to make us useable. #complimentary #shiseidosuncare @Influenster @shiseido nan
