I received a sample for my honest review. I wear a lot of sunblock due to having an autoimmune condition that is affected by the sun. This blends into skin really quickly. It has a nice light fragrance. I also like that for your face it almost gives that make up primer feel. I will definitely use this sunscreen for my face. Love how this blends into skin. Perfect for face.
