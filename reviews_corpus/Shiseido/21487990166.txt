I have been in love with Shiseido Ultimune power infusing serum for years, as this product works wonders on my face. It makes my face feel young and alive. I bought each and every upgrade in the last few years. And I really loved this 2022 upgrade. It is lighter weight and easier to absorb and layering than the previous version. I love layering serums, so this is really a great upgrade! The serum is not too light, not like water texture. So it can be used alone as a serum, too. nan
