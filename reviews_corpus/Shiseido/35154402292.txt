I received this product as a complimentary Gift for my review. And I couldn’t get over the texture of it. I feel like it was lightweight but it was a mixture of an oil and cream texture that I wasn’t a fan of I suppose. I mean, it’s a serum so it’s not either one of those but it wasn’t my type of skin care. Not my type of texture consistency
