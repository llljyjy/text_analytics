Love  this one more then the waterproof one! Both formulas are great but this one has a more sunscreen-y texture that absorbs into the skin quicker. A little goes a long way with this product, and the spf is high and lasts long enough to  reapply minimally. I think the price is fair for the protection and quality, but it is a little steep for my desired price range. Would definitely reccomend as a splurge for people who are heavy into sun protection though. 10/10
