The Shiseido Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture sunscreen is very velvety, dewy, and applies smoothly. It has a light fragrance, but not too powerful. I enjoyed the application and it wears well. It does feel very moisturizing. However, it’s a bit too dewy for my preference. I like a matte face, so I don’t like this for daily wear beneath makeup. I’ll save it for the poolside and days at the beach. fresh, dewy, and moisturizing
