I loved that this cream was easy to apply, smells great, and lasted all day without feeling oily. My make up was easy to apply on top of it, and it did not make my skin look dry. It was also easy to apply, and the container is a great size with a lot of product inside. I would definitely recommend! Lasts all day without feeling oily
