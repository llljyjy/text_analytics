It has become a morning ritual for me since I got this. It actually makes me looking forward to the morning routine even though I want to go back to bed. It provides great hydration. After a week of everyday use, I can see the difference. My skin hasn’t been so plump and dewy for a while. I have been using this one instead of Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair serum. If you are a fan of Estée Lauder ANR, give this a try. winter savior
