The Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream is my new go-to moisturizer. I am absolutely in love with it! It soaks in right away and makes my skin so soft. It is nice and light (non-greasy) and has a very pleasant scent to it. Iâ€™ve also noticed some of my dark spots fading, which is amazing! This has definitely become a staple in my skincare routine and I will absolutely be repurchasing when I run out. If you are on the fence, go for it, you will not regret it! My new go to moisturizer!
