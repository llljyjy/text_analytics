This day cream is top notch! The jar has some weight to it and looks and feels luxurious. The cream itself is a very nice texture. It left my face moisturized but not greasy. It held up well under my makeup. It seems a great choice for my 35 year old skin. My only complaints are the strong sunscreen smell it has, which is normal for an SPF moisturizer, and the little spatula is inconvenient. I wish the lid had a place on it to store it because it’s so small and I don’t like just laying it on the counter. nan
