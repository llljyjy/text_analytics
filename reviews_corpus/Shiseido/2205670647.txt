This was gifted to me by Influenster and it came in time for my trip a few weeks ago. I love the SPF coverage, but do not care for the texture. After applying, you have to rub in very quickly, otherwise it will leave a ‘cast’-like finish. I have chocolate skin, so the results on me a different. It’s a good sunscreen, but do not care for how it ‘sits’ on my skin. Arrived in time for trip
