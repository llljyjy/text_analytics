I’ve been using this serum as part of my daily skin routine - after face wash, toner, and my spot treatment - before my eye cream, moisturizer, oil, & SPF. I like the design and look of the bottle. It has a secure cap and it encloses the pump so it won’t leak or spill while traveling. I think it does a great job of doing what it says it does - prevent against signs of aging, environmental factors, and daily stress. It helps achieve a healthy and vibrant look. I would definitely recommend this product to others! Luxury in a bottle!
