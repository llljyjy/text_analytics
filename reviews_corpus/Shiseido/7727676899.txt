This is really nice and lightweight. It interacted weird with one of my foundations so it probably just wasn’t compatible with an ingredient. I would use this for a day at the pool or beach. It’s translucent and doesn’t leave a white cast. Didn’t break me out which is what I struggle with most with sunscreen for my face nan
