I’ve been using this for about a week now and I’ve really been enjoying it! It glides easily over makeup and doesn’t cause too much shifting. It feels light on the skin and leaves behind a subtle glow (I have combination/oily skin). The texture is a little sticky but it doesn’t really bother me. It holds up really well in the heat and against sweat. I like to apply it on my face, ears, neck, chest, and hands. I’m going on a trip to San Antonio, TX this summer and I’m planning on bringing this sunscreen along for reapplications. Great for quick reapplication
