I received this product as a free sample and I’ve been wearing it every single day since. It’s perfectly moisturizing and gives such a healthy glow because of that. It sits beautifully under my makeup, too. It is lightweight and doesn’t leave a white cast. I find that it absorbs nicely into skin but I do think I can feel it a little throughout the day. I don’t know if I’ll repurchase solely based on the fact that it’s not cruelty free. Been loving!
