I already had a Japanese sunscreen I’d been using for quite a few years when I received this,  so I wasn’t sure what--if any--function this would serve for me, or how it would compare. The sunscreen I was and do use functions as both a daily primer and broad spectrum coverage; it also delivers a beautiful glow, and plays nicely with all products. So, this product had a lot to live up to!I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it for the first time, in quite a rush and not expecting much, merely slathering some over my gel moisturizer and waiting for it to set before dabbing on the lightest layer of my low-coverage BB cushion. I only put on that, and a reddish lip tint, and left the house, and honestly, I looked so good! When I looked in the mirror in grody LED light, my complexion looked glow-y and lovely!With that said, I didn’t have any blemishes or much hypermigmention, perhaps a few enlarged pores. The only con of this was that it did cause one of my products to ball-up with it and become a bit greasy later in the day. So, I wouldn’t wear this if I intended to go to work or do a makeup look! But, for minimal makeup or running errands or just around the house or vacation or so on...what a lovely product! It will take me a while to use this, since I use my other sunscreen for my “makeup“ looks, but I would repurchase this when I eventually use this up for other days. (With that said, I really still don’t leave the house much. Lol! And I’m very pale/not one for the beach!) nan
