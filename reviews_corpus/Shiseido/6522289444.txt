I liked using this as a daily sunscreen. It is the consistency of a normal lotion and has a faint smell of sunscreen that fades quickly and doesn’t last all day. This is a huge plus for me because I don’t want to smell sunscreen all day and I don’t want others to think I smell like sunscreen all day either. It does leave a slightly shiny, hydrated skin type of look. I applied it first before primer and makeup. My makeup still stayed on all day. I have dry to normal skin and only got one pimple after using this. Maybe that pimple was from hormonal changes or maybe from the product. Either way I really liked this product and would definitely recommend it. great daily sunscreen
