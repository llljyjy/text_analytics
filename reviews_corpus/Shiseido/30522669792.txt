I’m starting to use Sunscreen more often, so receiving this voxbox with great spf was a blessing. I like that you only need to use a little to cover your entire face and it is easy to distribute from the container. I love that it has Hyaluronic acid in it and absorbs quickly into my skin. I no longer need to apply a moisturizer when using this as it is both a sunscreen and moisturizer in one. After applying my skin feels moisturized and smooth. It’s lightweight, oil free and doesn’t leave your skin sticky or greasy. It has a nice very light scent that’s barely noticeable and a nude tint that doesn’t leave a film behind on my skin. This container is small enough to carry on the go in your purse or bag easily. Moisturizer and Sunscreen in one
