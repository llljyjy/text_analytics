The Shiseido Fresh Moisture with hyaluronic acid is my favorite sunscreen so far. It’s a little on the thicker side, has a pleasant scent. Gives so much moisture you won’t believe it’s a sunscreen. You can feel the hyaluronic acid when smoothing onto your skin.  I can apply this as a moisturizer with sunscreen as a bonus protection. Holy grail hydration
