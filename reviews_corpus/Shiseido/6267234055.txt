This is my new go-to sunscreen! It smells great and doesn’t leave a greasy finish after applying. had to take a moment to jump on here and review this product. I wear sunscreen on the daily, but I always wash my face before I go to workout because sunscreen sweat in the eyes BURNS. Well, today I went to workout and I forgot to take my sunscreen off before taking class. And guess what? My sweat went straight into my eyes and it didn’t burn. Seriously, this stuff is amazing. I’m so thankful I found it. nan
