It can sometimes feel terrible to put sunscreen on my face but Shiseido Urban Environment was a pleasant experience. Please I was headed out to go on the TMZ Hollywood tour so I applied the sunscreen with some mascara and light makeup and headed out for the day. My skin felt good. Never dried out and my skin was protected all day. I would recommend this product and even for those  with mildly dry skin like mine. Nicely moisturizing
