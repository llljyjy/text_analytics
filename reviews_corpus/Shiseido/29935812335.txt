This sunscreen makes my face feel so good. It feels more like a moisturizer then a sunscreen. It absorbs well, without a white cast. It doesn’t make me feel greasy or gross. There is minimal sunscreen smell. It’s a bit on the pricier side for a smaller sunscreen but a great choice if you’re willing to spend a bit more. Very hydrating
