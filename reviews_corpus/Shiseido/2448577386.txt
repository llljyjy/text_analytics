First off, the packaging itself is very classy! The serum has no chemically smell & does not feel greasy on skin at all. Goes on very smooth and absorbs perfectly into your skin. I’ve only been using for 2 weeks so I can’t add anything about the claims the product makes but so far I would still recommend the product. Light & Smooth
