I was really excited to try this because I know it is a luxury brand with a hefty price tag. The packaging is beautiful and the concept behind the product was appealing to me. However, it smells strongly of alcohol and made my skin feel super dry. I have used it every day for a month and havenâ€™t noticed any improvement. I would not buy this and instead would stick to my Sunday Riley serum. :( nan
