I think this is a great everyday sunscreen. It has a thicker moisturizer texture but not overly thick. Is very hydrating and has no scent I can detect. My sensitive skin gets along great with it. It doesnâ€™t leave a white cast.if you want to wear makeup under it you can it does good under it as long as you give it like 20-30 minutes to sink in first. nan
