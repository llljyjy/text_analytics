I was so excited to try this product! I had been eyeing it for a while but kept putting it off because there was no way it was going to live up to the hype.  I have just started getting fine lines under my eyes and on my forehead, and after a month of adding the serum, I swear they are less noticeable. My skin looks slightly more radiant, and it works well with my combination skin. It’s hydrating enough for my dry patches but lightweight enough for my more oily zones. I use this after cleansing and toning, and then follow with a moisturizer. It absorbs nicely but leaves a slightly tacky feeling, although that disappears after I pat it in. The price is a big con, but if you can afford it, it’s a very lovely serum! luxury anti-aging
