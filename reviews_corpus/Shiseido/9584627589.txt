This is a really nice sunscreen! It has an SPF of 42. It also has Hyaluronic acid which helps increase and trap moisture. 2 things that work well for dry skin. This has a very slight scent. Its like a sunscreen meets skincare scent but it’s not overbearing and dissipates through the day. It’s very lightweight, the oily feeling goes away after a couple minutes and it then feels nice and smooth. It is nice but for the price, 38$ for an 1.8 oz, I am sure this one will get used but for the price idk if I will get it again. If you have the money and dry skin and this may be your thing! I highly recommend it! Sunscreen meets skincare in a bottle
