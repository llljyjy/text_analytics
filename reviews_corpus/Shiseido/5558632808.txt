I am loving this new oil-free sunscreen with Hyaluronic acid. My skin does not feel oily, and it feels refreshed, even with a day cream underneath it. Mind you my day cream is also not very heavy. I love using this under my medium to buildable foundation. I really donâ€™t mind the price, honestly. I have been a Shiseido girl since I was a teenager and this brand always pulls through for me. nan
