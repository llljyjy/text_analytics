I received this in exchange for my honest review. I’ll start by saying that I prefer the oil free sunscreen over this one. This one has a heavier “lotion” feel. They have similar light floral scents which I found to be nice but those who don’t like fragrance might be sensitive to the scent. I applied after my morning skincare routine & waited a few minutes before applying my makeup as normal. I noticed some pilling as I applied my foundation so maybe I didn’t let it dry long enough. I didn’t have this issue with the oil free version though. I love that this has hyaluronic acid to keep my skin moisturized but I don’t think that this formula was right for me. Personally, I would not purchase this product. I think the price point is a bit high for 1.8 oz. Not bad but prefer oil free version
