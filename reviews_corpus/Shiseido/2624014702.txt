I found that this sunscreen blended into my skin without the typical white cast you can find with sunscreen. Worked well as the last step in my skincare and my foundation applied great with absolutely no pilling. I would definitely recommend this sunscreen to friends and family. Sunscreen thatâ€™s like skincare.
