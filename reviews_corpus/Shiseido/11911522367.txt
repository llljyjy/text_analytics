I have only been using this product for 2 weeks. It is a good product. It feels nice and goes on nice. It doesn’t feel thick or tacky after it has settled in. It plays well with other products. I don’t like that it has fragrance. I don’t think products need fragrance. The “experience“ is seeing the results. It isn’t a “hit you in the face“ smell. It is pretty light but you can definitely smell it. I wouldn’t say I have seen super dramatic results but I have only been using it for 2 weeks. My face does seem smoother and glowier. So, I will finish the bottle and see how I feel. It’s pricey, so I want to see some wonders. It's good
