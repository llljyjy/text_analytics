I don’t like this one. It works for it’s intended purpose, which is sun protection. However, it does require light application and I wouldn’t wear it under makeup. It pills up a lot- on its own without makeup. I also have really dry skin so I thought this one would be perfect for me because of the ingredients in it. But it’s just not. If it didn’t pill up I’d like it. But the only way it doesn’t pill up is if I use a very miniscule a amount and apply it very lightly, and don’t touch my face at all afterwards. But, it does provide great protection. After a day in the sun at the lake, I had no sunburn and not even a tan. So it does it’s job! I just wish something in the formula were a bit different. There is also no flash back in photos which is an amazing thing! Pills up a lot
