I received this item free for review and have been using it for a few weeks now. I absolutely love the fresh moisture hyaluronic acid. I have dry skin and a lot of the time sunscreen dries it out more but not this one. it has SPF 42 and keeps my face hydrated while getting some sun. would definitely repurchase in the future. nan
