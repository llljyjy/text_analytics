I received this product complimentary for my honest opinion. I was a bit worried trying this product due to having sensitive skin. I didn’t break out. I love this product. It doesn’t leave me greasy or sticky like other sunscreens. It doesn’t have a weird smell either. I apply it before putting make up on. nan
