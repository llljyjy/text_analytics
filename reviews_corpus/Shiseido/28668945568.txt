MY review on Shiseido sun care! I LOVE it, I like the oil free better than the other one as my skin is oily but they both work great! I brought them to Rocky point with me knowing we would be in the sun all day for a few days and I applied a small amount in the morning and if we made it back to the hotel during the day another small amount but even if we didn’t it still lasted! My sister had fair skin and she used the Shiseido fresh moisture with Hyuronic acid and she had no problems, didn’t get any type of sunburn while we were out and didn’t leave her skin oily or anything, applied makeup over one day and left by itself another and had loved it! I applied the oil-free with hyaluronic acid both with and without makeup and I loved it as well! Thank you Influenster for this complimentary gift! 10/10 will purchase once Im out of this! #shiseidosuncare #complimentary @shiseido @influenster 10/10 LOVEEEE it
