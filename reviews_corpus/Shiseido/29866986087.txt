I love this product. I have rosacea and after the first few days of using this I did notice a change in redness. It is lightweight and not oily. I didnt breakout and my skin was clearer. It does have a floral smell to it so if you have a sensitive nose you might not like how it smells. I l love how this makes my skin feel. Awesome product
