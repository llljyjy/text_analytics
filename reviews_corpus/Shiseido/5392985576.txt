This formula is a little thick like actual sunblock, and smells just like it which is fine and it did protect my skin. I gave it 3 stars because this did make me break out right after the first time I used it and I haven’t had acne in a very long time. This might be a little too thick to put on under make up, I would say to wear this by itself, over all it’s ok. Just ok.
