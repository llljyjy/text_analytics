This serum has a great feel on the skin and it gave my skin more radiance within days. I havenâ€™t noticed any difference on my fine lines after two weeks of use. I also had to stop using it in the morning because it made my skin more oily throughout the day. If you want a serum for glowing, radiant skin, this is a good option. It might be better for normal or normal to dry skin types rather that normal to oily or oily. Radiance approved!
