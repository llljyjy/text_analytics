This  Sunscreen is hands down one of the best products I have used!  Not only is it broad spectrum and safer to use, it is so extremely light and has great coverage.  It also doesn’t have a pesky sunscreen smell.  It smells inviting and fresh.  I love the container and how easy it is to use and distribute the product.  It’s the perfect weight for face and neck and décolletage! Lovely sunscreen!
