I read the reviews and thought I truly must be missing something... but I tried this for 2 weeks and had to return it. It dried out my skin even more than it already is, despite not changing anything else in my routine. The smell was STRONG and musky (?) and if i got it on my lips... i would be smelling and tasting it all day. But i truly just think it wasn’t for me... it did make my skin look amazing so i was pretty sad it didn’t work out. I would recommend it for people who have normal skin. My sensitive and dry skin just couldn’t handle it :( nan
