Bought with my own money, not sponsored. Shiseido Wrinkle Smoothing Eye Cream is pretty good at moisturizing and hydrating. I have not noticed any effect on my fine lines so I wouldnâ€™t say this is an eye cream I would buy again. However, its much better than many other creams I tried on recently because this was the only eye cream, that keeps my under-eye area moisturized till morning well enough. Its pretty good not the best
