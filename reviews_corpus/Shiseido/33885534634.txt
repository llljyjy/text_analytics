Absolutely LOVE this sunscreen! It was super easy to apply. Very light and airy. Not like typical sunscreen. It wasn’t super heavy, oily and cakey and didn’t cause me to break out. The scent was super nice too. This was the first time I’ve tried it and loved it. My new favorite sunscreen! I'm in love!
