I waited few weeks to write this review because I wanted to see if I see a difference on my skin or not. pros: my skin absorbed it well and fast, it smells nice and it really provides sun protection while not making your face sticky or white like a normal sunscreen; which is fantastic!. I went to a park for Easter Sunday, I was using this and no any Sunscreen on my body and got sunburn everywhere except on my face. Also, my skin feels hydrated a little after applying it.Cons: I donâ€™t see any change on my skin other that it feels hydrated after applying it. For example, my fine lines remain exactly the same weeks after using this. It protects against sunburn
