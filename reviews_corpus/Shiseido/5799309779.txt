I received this product to try from a sample company and I was really surprised. As a pro make up artist I am very very picky about my skin care. I love the fact that this has SPF in it but doesn’t leave my skin greasy or oily because I have combination skin. I found I only needed about a dime size amount and it absorbed right away. I only needed a tiny bit of primer after and I only needed it in the areas where my pores are a little bit larger. It has a very nice consistency that thick but not too thick. I would highly recommend this for people with oily skin who are afraid to use moisturizer. I’m a Pro Makeup Artist And Loved It!
