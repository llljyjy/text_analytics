I use this product as a daily skincare before my make up. I use two fingers of amount to cover my face. This sunscreen doesn’t leave any white cast on my face, so is really good.The consistency is very liquid. And is light on your skin, I like how soft my face feel after applied.I replied every 3 hours for recommendations of the dermatologist.I really like this mineral sunscreen Light consistency ✨️
