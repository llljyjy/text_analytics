Unlike the version of this cream with SPF (which I’m obsessed with), I don’t find myself reaching for this one that often. It’s lightweight and hydrating; but the smell is a bit off putting, and I tend to prefer a thicker cream if I’m going for one without SPF. Might just be personal preference but I don’t see myself repurchasing. just OK
