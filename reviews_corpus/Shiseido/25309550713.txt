I got this product free for testing purposes. I have sensitive dry skin and rosacea so my skin can be picky about products. Most of the time this Moisturizer did the job however on a rare occasion I would get some irritation from it on my skin or if I got it too close to my eyes some extreme watering. I also did not feel like it sufficiently hydrated my skin for the price point. It still left me feeling dry after application. It's okay but not worth price
