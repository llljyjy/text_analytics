If you use premium J-beauty skincare, these cottons are a must. I use a thick, milky hydration product, and these cottons make application a dream. They’re incredibly soft, and you can use them to apply toners or remove point makeup as well. After switching to a cheaper brand, I quickly returned to Shiseido and won’t use anything else in the future. Perfect companion for K-beauty and J-beauty
