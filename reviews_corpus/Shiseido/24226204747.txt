I was not expecting to like this product as much as I do right now. I did receive this complimentary product for my honest review and I can for sure say itâ€™s now part of my daily routine. Just one pump gives enough product to cover my entire face. I apply before moisturizer both in the morning and at night. The product is very lightweight. My face is so much smoother since constantly using this serum. The one downside is that the packaging is a bit large, which makes it not easy to transport. Now Part Of My Skincare Routine
