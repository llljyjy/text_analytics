I recieved this complimentary for my honest review. I loved this sunscreen.  I love that it has spf 42 and it is water resistant.  It is also oil free which is amazing for my acne prone skin. This has a little tint to it so it doesnâ€™t leave a white residue. It goes on silky smooth and leaves your skin soft with no tacky residue. Love this sunscreen
