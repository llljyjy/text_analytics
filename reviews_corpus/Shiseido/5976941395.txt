This is undoubtedly the best sunscreen for my sensitive skin. I’ve tried dr. Jart which broke me out and made me super red, supergoop which made me greasy, Alba for sensitive skin… so on. This goes on perfectly, it’s a bit greasy feeling going on but as soon as it settles on my skin it’s an amazing texture and look. I tend to be on the greasier side in the summer and dry in the winter, this is accommodating regardless. Best sunscreen for my sensitive skin
