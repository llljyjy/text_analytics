I really really enjoyed this serum! i fid wait 1 month to see some difference i didnt BUT i love how it feels on my skin. I have it in the fridge to tighten my pores while applying , it goes on smoothly smells nice. I mostly wear it in the mornings with or without makeup‚Äù it doesnt work with some foundations I wore it with the tarte tinted moisturizer and the tint was rubbing off easily. Morning serum!
