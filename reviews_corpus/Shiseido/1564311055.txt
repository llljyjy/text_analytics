Shiseido has done it again! I love this product. It’s hydrating, lightweight, not sticky, doesn’t sting your eyes, and protects this fair skin beautifully. I’ve see other people say it smells bad, and that hasn’t been my experience. Does it smell like a chemical sunscreen? Yes, of course, but it isn’t strong and it disappears a bit after applying. The smell isn’t an issue for me because I’m so incredibly fair and burn prone that mineral sunscreens don’t cut it for me. It works well under makeup too! The best!
