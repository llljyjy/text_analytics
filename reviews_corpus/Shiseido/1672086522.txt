This sunscreen feels like a moisturizer when applied. My skin is often dry, so it felt nice and smooth going on. The scent is very pleasant and not overpowering at all. Even after being in the sun for a couple hours, my skin still felt refreshed, and I didn’t burn at all. I’d definitely consider using this product again. Fresh and Moisturizing
