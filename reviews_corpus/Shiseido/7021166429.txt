Firstly, love that this sunscreen is spf 42–I’ve found a lot of face sunscreens are less than that. Goes on clear, and keeps my skin hydrated rather than drying it out like some sunscreens do. As a plus, I had no irritation or breakouts when using this. Overall, a great option I’ll be using this summer! Great everyday sunscreen
