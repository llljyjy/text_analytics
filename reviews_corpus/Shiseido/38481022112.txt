The last 2 years I have been trying to find my “Holy Grail” DAILY SPF for my face. I have tried well over a dozen of popular to niche recommendations. I was given this SPF, so of course I did not oblige.   The only thing I can think of as a reason that this Shisiedo Urban SPF is currently not on everyone’s bathroom counter is possibly due to the price, as I do understand this product wouldn’t be considered “budget friendly” .. other than that - this is hands down the best SPF product that I have tried in my entire life. From the moment I put it on the back of my hand to test out- it was not only an experience for the senses, but it disappeared after two swipes! I thought “Okay! Well this may be a winner.”  ..PROS: -So lightweight. Lighter than a facial serum -Sweat proof. I am unfortunately a facial sweater -Did not disturb makeup. Neither before application, or after during reapplications with a beauty blender. - Able to apply the correct amount, for full benefits of sun protection. This is a first. It’s so lightweight with immediate absorption that it is a bit addicting to keep applying. -It’s a silky liquid which is quite enjoyable -The bottle lasts much longer than one would initially assume. Currently I’m on WEEK 5 of daily use, and it’s still not empty-Doesn’t break me out or cause blackheads..Nor the times I fell asleep in it🤭-0 stinging in eyes-White cast is ZERO-Last but most definitely not least it has kept me fully sun protected on even the most sunny and humid days. CONS: xI did it. I finally found my #1. My go-to. My ride or die! With EVERY SINGLE box checked off that anyone could want and need in an SPF!! Please keep this version around Shiseido! It is truly a winner. She’s a 10
