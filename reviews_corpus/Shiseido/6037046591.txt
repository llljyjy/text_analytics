Usually after using a moisturizer, I cannot go to sleep right away because my face will stick to the pillow and make my pillowcase greasy. This moisturizer soaks right into my skin and I’ve noticed a definitely difference in brightness. This is very pricy so I’m unsure if I’ll continue, but so far I like it. High marks!
