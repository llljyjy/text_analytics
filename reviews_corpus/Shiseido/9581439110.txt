To start off, I love the fact I got two full size samples in this box all because of a supply issue delaying it getting here. The packaging is gorgeous! And definitely feels like you get a lot for $50 worth. I also love that it comes with a spatula and that it has SPF 20 in it because this girl burns like a lobster. I also like that the packaging is recycled material and can be recycled after use. I like the texture of it even though it’s not quite like my tatcha water cream it comes awfully close when soaking in. It does also have a slightly greasier feeling that my tatcha cream. From a first time go of it, I’ve had no issues with it. I have really dry skin and It goes on smooth and doesn’t feel greasy after it soaks into the face. I also let me mom, who has sensitive skin try it and she loves it too and it doesn’t burn her like some products she’s tried….. The only negative if found after two weeks of use is, that it is heavily fragranced. Get it now!!!
