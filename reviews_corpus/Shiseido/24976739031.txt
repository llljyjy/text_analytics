This is my first time trying a tinted sunscreen. Overall I would say it’s a pretty good product. Not too greasy and stays on the whole day. It does leave a tint on your face but no white cast. I don’t know if it’s just because my face is dry but there was a little bit of patchyness. Maybe it’s the sunscreen and the tint spreading but that would be the only downside. It’s not as visible though, only up close. I would recommend this 4/5 if you like tinted sunscreens. Pretty Good
