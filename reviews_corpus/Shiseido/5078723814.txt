I received this product “complimentary“ fromInfluenster for my honest opinion. This sunscreenreally has a lot to offer for your face and neck whileprotecting your skin. I did reapply after I came out of the pool. I was well protected from the SPF 42. My face did stay hydrated from the hyaluronic acid. The fragrance is a nice fresh scent. I had no breakouts using this on a daily basis with and without makeup.Perfect for everyday use. Amazing sunscreen with or without makeup
