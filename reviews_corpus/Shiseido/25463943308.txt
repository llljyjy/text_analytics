Let me start by saying I have sensory issues and I don’t like a large majority of creams . This cream is perfect for me . It absorbs so quickly and doesn’t leave any residue. I love the one I got before this one as well that has the SPF and the down fall of that one is you can really smell the SPF in it … this one has such a lovely smell and I love that I can have the same benefits for the other cream but not worry about wasting the sunscreen that I’d rather use while I’m outside . I will definitely be purchasing more . Amazing
