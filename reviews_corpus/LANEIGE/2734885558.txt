I mean really what is in this stuff. My skin just DRINKS it up and it feels so hydrating and soothing. Skin is drier due to colder months and this made it feel better immediately. The texture is super cool. Itâ€™s liquid at first but the more you rub it in the more milky/lotiony it feels. Great product. On my second bottle. nan
