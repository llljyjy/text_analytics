omg first of all, this mask is sooooo good! The other day I was just absentmindedly scratching my chin until I realised that I was doing it and stopped but felt bumps materialising on my chin. I was really desperate so I decided to try the mask because I had just got it and I wanted to try it out. Omg I’m so glad I did because the next morning everything was super smooth and glowy I totally did NOT expect that and it also got rid of my slight acne and dry patches. I can’t believe it!!! P.S.if you have any open cuts or you’ve popped a pimple or have a opening into your flesh a lil bit it will sting a little but it’s not terrible it feels kinda good and I feel like it will heal faster too :) WORKS WONDERS
