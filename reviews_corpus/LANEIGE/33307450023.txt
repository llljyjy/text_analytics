WOW i love this sleeping mask! the consistency is a lightweight, gel-like, cream that glides onto the skin. a little goes a very long way and feels cool and refreshing. you wake up with luminous, glowy skin that is moisturized without feeling heavy! i love the dewy finish your skin is left with, and i donâ€™t feel like this product is clogging your pores. a must have for dry skin! DEWY, HYDRATED SKIN :)
