Back in maybe 1990, the Body Shop had lip pots. They were all the rage and I’m pretty sure I had all of them. THIS! It reminds me of those but better. B.S changed their formula decades ago and I don’t care for that product, but this!!! This is before bed, lip moisture perfection. Will buy again! Better than 1990 other brand
