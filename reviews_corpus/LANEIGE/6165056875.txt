I got to try Laneige Retinol Firming Treatment for free #freeproduct #trywithtopbox . I used a small amount the first time using to test on my skin and I did not have any concerns or irritation so started off using every 3 days and built it up to daily. After washing my face at night I applied a small amount to my fine lines and wrinkles. My skin has been tolerating it and Iâ€™m the morning my skin feels refreshed. I can definitely notice a difference after a couple days of using it! using it at night before bed and have noticed a huge improvement in the texture and tone of my skin. The retinol formula has helped to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and in the morning my skin looks renewed and refreshed. It has a very mild scent and quickly absorbs. I would definitely recommended trying this product! New routine!
