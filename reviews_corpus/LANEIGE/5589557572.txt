The first week I used this product, I wasn’t convinced but over time I noticed how soft my skin felt. It’s really a great cleanser and moisturizer. It’s not heavy duty, like mascara doesn’t come completely off but I am okay with it since it leaves my skin so soft. Plus, I don’t know what other cleansers are strong even to fully take off mascara. Love it!
