I love a good sleeping mask, but this made me break out so badly a few days after use. I got the mini as a free product and was so excited to test it out but honey, if your skin is oily and easily irritated do not try this at home. I have had great skin most of my life, but never has a product reacted so badly. I literally have white heads ALLLLLL over my chin and lower face from this. It’s taken me weeks to clear up, currently on week three and hating myself for trying this product. Wearing a mask has been drying out my nose so I thought it’d be a miracle, but it’s been a nightmare. nan
