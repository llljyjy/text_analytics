I personally love this product because I have very dry dehydrated skin!  This makes my skin look and feel light-weight and luminous at the same time.  I would definitely recommend this product for dry skin that isn’t super sensitive and even if you have normal skin type and you are looking for that clean gorgeous glow this is it!! I also love how hydrating this is, it is like a moisturizing sunscreen. If you are scared to be to glowy then you could definitely try skipping your daily moisturizer in the morning and just go in with this at the end of your skincare routine. I wouldn’t say that this sunscreen is heavy, I think it is very lite-weight and long lasting with no white cast which I love!!The sunscreen does have a little fragrance but honestly it doesn’t bother me, I have sensitive skin and sense none of my other products have fragrance this just adds a elegant floral smell! I wouldn’t  recommend this product for super sensitive skin that gets irritated by using fragrance, but if you don’t mind it and you want a sunscreen that is light-weight and makes your skin have a beautiful bright glow then this is definitely the product for you!!   I understand that people with more Oily/Combo skin type would not enjoy this sunscreen, because of how oily the product could be with Oily/Combo skin! I am definitely re-purchasing this product!! I also am very interested in purchasing more products from this brand because I have Heard really good reviews! Also I loveeeeeee the packaging!! SO PRETTY AND GLOWY
