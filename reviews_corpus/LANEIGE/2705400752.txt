Pros: smells like fresh juicy mangoes Cons: -leaves a yellow tint on the lips (looks weird to use during the day) -formula seems different from the original berry that I have. The original seems thicker and more hydrating. The mango one doesn’t feel as thick and I felt like it just sat on top of my lips and didn’t really absorb into them. I’m torn on whether if I should return it or keep trying it out to see if it’ll grow on me. Different Formula than Original?
