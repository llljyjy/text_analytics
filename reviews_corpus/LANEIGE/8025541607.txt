Super cute packaging, love the satisfying click closure!A little goes a long way. It’s a medium texture, applies nicely and sinks in quickly.There is a light scent, it’s clean and fresh, but not noticeable after application. I have fairly sensitive eyes, but have had no issues with this. This is so hydrating, it actually lasts all day, and my under eyes have never looked so smooth! I have very creasy under eyes, but from day 1 I’ve noticed an improvement, and it’s only getting better. My makeup application looks much nicer. I haven’t noticed much of a change in brightness, but I do thinks it’s improving the longer I use it.Overall really love this eye cream! Definitely recommend. Smooth & Hydrated!
