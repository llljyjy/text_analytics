Received this #freeptoduct from #trywithtopbox. I love the details of this packaging. I feel like this ‘twist up’ bottle is more convenient and hygienic. Another amazing point is that you are able to check the residual serum through the hole on the bottle. I’ve been using this serum for about a week. This serum has light texture, but not too watery, more like gel cream type. When I apply this serum, it feels immediately refreshing and cools down my face. It is very hydrating and this moisture last pretty long on my oily skin. But if you have dry skin, this serum might be too light during winter. For people with oily skin, I definitely recommend this product as a daily serum. For dry skin, I recommend to use it during spring and summer! Daily serum for oily skin
