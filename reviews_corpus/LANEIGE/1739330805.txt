Received this as a sample and was skeptical- who needs a lip sleeping mask, you say? The first time I used it, I applied a thin layer like I would lip balm and I was underwhelmed. Then I read a review that said to really slather it on like a night mask and that made all the difference! A little goopy and sticky so just make sure not to get it all over your pillow if youâ€™re a side sleeper like me. My lips were not dry to begin with but now feel super soft and lasts throughout the day. Buying the full size in Mango :) treat yourself to this luxury lil lip product!
