I got the sample of this and the water bank moisturizer. I love the moisturizer! I ran out of it quickly as I have dry skin. Not having purchased a moisturizer to replace it I moved onto the sleep mask. My face dried out so much that even my lips stayed chapped despite wearing lip balm. I thought maybe I was doing it wrong and I was supposed to apply the sleep mask under the moisturizer but come to find out some people only use it as a moisturizer. It appears work for many, but if you have dry skin it may not be enough. Not for very dry skin
