I have very sensitive skin, cannot tolerate anything scented, and my skin sucks up moisture leaving me usually dry, so I prefer a thick cream to thin ones. This mask is amazing. Unscented, the perfect thick-but-not-too-thick consistency, and despite my tossing and turning and smooshing my face into my pillows when I sleep, it always leaves my skin feeling quenched, plump, and soft in the morning. Highly recommend, especially for those of us who are dying for more unscented products. A Go-To for sensitive Skin
