I’ve been wearing generously and consistently for 3 weeks now, I see absolutely no difference. no change in appearance / brightness, skin doesn’t feel more hydrated, I see get patchy foundation. I am actually breaking out more (although that could be due to my changing diet so I won’t pin it on this). the only benefit I’d say is this smells amazing and relaxes me before bed.... doesn't do anything lol
