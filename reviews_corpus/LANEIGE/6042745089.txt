this formula is amazing per usual but i wasnt the biggest fan of the mango. i purchased it the day it came out on the app. its very lightly scented almost nothing there so if you dont like intense smells you will like this but for almost 25.00 i expected to smell stronger. i wasnt a fan of the color on my lips it leaves a slight yellow tint so this isnt the best for daytime (i like to wear these as lipgloss). the peach iced tea is still my favorite one ive tried. love the formula but the mango isnt my favortie.
