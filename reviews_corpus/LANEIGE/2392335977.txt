Love the smell and consistency but I broke out horribly around my lips. The Lip Sleeping Mask does the same thing and I had hoped this version would be better, but every time I use it I end up with 4 or 5 little pimples right along my lip line or the corner of my mouth. Great Product - Just Not for me!
