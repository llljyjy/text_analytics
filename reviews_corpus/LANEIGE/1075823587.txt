I’m one of those people that always has eight lip balms but hates six of them. My lips aren’t particularly chapped but I go nuts if they feel dry at all. If a product has absolutely any drying ingredients (ahem MINT) I detect it immediately and my lips feel like they’re shriveling. Anyway, I’ve now purchased about a dozen pots of this, I use it all the time. It’s super silky and comfortable. The scent and color are pretty negligible but the two I’ve enjoyed most are Gummy Bear and Gingerbread. A staple.
