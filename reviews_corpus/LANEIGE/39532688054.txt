Received this #freeproduct through #tryitwithtopbox 3 weeks ago and Iâ€™ve been using it every night and so far loving it! I am very sensitive to fragrances but this one is subtle which I love. The cream has a nice consistency (not oily) although I wish it was slightly thicker to lock in the moisture overnight. Overall good product, would buy again and recommend. So far so good
