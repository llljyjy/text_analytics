I got this as a part of the 2021 Sephora birthday set.  I applied this over essence, toner, serum, benzoyl peroxide or AHA, eye cream, and moisturizer.  I have oily skin and my skin gets oily very easily.  This made my skin very dry.  I reapplied it 2 more times for a total of 3 times and finally felt a bit moisturized but my face was somewhat sticky.  Definitely not worth it.  I also found that their lip mask is even more drying. Drying even for Oily Skin
