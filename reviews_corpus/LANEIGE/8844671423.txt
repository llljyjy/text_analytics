Received as part of the birthday gift set. Made my lips much worse; super dry, cracked, painful and started to discolor my lips. I gave it a good try for a few weeks. I finally had to stop using and went back to my previous routine and my lips healed up after a few days. It must be one of the ingredients that is common in these lip masks that just donâ€™t work for me, because I have tried others from cheap to expensive and all of them make my lips worse. I give am giving up on lip masks.
