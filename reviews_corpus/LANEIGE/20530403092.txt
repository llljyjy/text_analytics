Wasnâ€™t expecting a lot based on reviews, but fell in love with the packaging and the in-lid applicator, so bought on sale to try. Compared to my previous bio balm/mask from Bite Beauty, this one hydrates almost just as good. The scent is a nice mix of pineapple & coconut which is lovely but does tend to get very strong if a lot of product is put on the lips. So I tried using less (just one thin layer top and bottom lip) and was surprised it still kept my lips moisturized by morning. There is a slight cooling/minty sensation which is nice, and I find it very versatile to use underneath other lip products or as a sleeping mask. Overall liked the product minus the strong (but non-irritating to my nose) tropical-fruity scent. nan
