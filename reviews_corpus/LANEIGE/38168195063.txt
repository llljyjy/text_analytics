Girl are you kidding I used to reapply Carmex every second, wish I knew about this sooner! At first I didn’t like it, it felt weird when I put it on but you gotta wait and then it melts into your lips like butter and makes them soooo soft and moisturized. LOVE LOVE LOVE. A bit overpriced though. But I’ve never used something with this great of a result before. honestly a must have 👏 cures my dry lips.
