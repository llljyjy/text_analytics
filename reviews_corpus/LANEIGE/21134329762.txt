I wanted to like this so bad, but it did nothing for me. I don’t know how to describe it, but I felt moisture outside of the lips, but not inside. It felt like putting water on my lips and how it feels good for a second, but then nothing. Also after waking up, my lips felt and looked more dry than they were before. I was really upset about this after all the good reviews I have heard, but everyone’s body is different. This just didn’t work for me. Did Nothing
