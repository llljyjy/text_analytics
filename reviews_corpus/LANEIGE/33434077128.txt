I got this #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox. I absolutely love the blue series by Laneige cause it’s so light and for the most part fragrance-free. Same was this product, very light to use under the eyes and super hydrating. I use it at night around my eyes, and it’s excellent for daily use. It didn’t help me with lightening/brightening but it’s something one would want for consistency as it’s super light and can be used without fear of reactions. Hydrating but not for brightening
