I was so lucky to be gifted this full size sample from #trywithtopbox I added this yo my routine 2 weeks ago on my clean face twice a day am/pm  and I’m so glad I did. My skin feels so soft and my dry patches are no longer dry. What an improvement in such little time. This serum is not watery or sticky and absorbed quickly into my skin, there is a light fresh scent nothing overwhelming at all. Not only is the serum beautiful but look at this new packaging, just a simple twist and a push of the pump on top and serum comes out. It keeps everything clean and less contamination with my fingers. It’s a must try #freeproduct softer skin
