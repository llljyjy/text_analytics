Using hydration products can be hit or miss for my combination skin but this one has earned a permanent spot in my nighttime routine. I received this in my Ipsy bag and was hesitant because I am super picky about the products I put on my face before bed because if it is too heavy or goopy, it usually will clog my pores in my sleep. This mask is really light so it pairs well with my other serums and creates the best texture for my skin. I wake up with bouncy, radiant, and SUPER soft skin every morning. It has also done a great job of fixing my redness and discoloration. Overall, I understand this product might not be for everyoneâ€™s skin type but if you have combination skin and are looking for a product to add some extra hydration over night: this is the one for you. Great product. Perfect for combination skin types
