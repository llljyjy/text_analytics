I received a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and I was so happy to try. I have light bags under my eyes and I had the chance to try this product. I saw a slight improvement after 3-4 days using it in the morning before makeup and at night before bed. The cream is light and applies well. I love the gel texture. It is an odorless cream which I like a little less because I like scented products. I highly recommend this cream. nan
