i am so sad. i have used this product for years and years, i use it every night and even during the day at times. i have always thought this was expensive for what it was and that vaseline was basically just as good lol, but i continued to buy it because i loved the smell and it was SLIGHTLY more juicy than vaseline. I just finished up my tub and i bought a new one and i am sad to report that its not the same.. i put it on and it feels different. within a minute, it feels like my lips are already drying out and i need more. before I would put it on at night and it would feel just like how i did after waking up in the morning, so plump and hydrated. I found out they reformulated this past year and it is definitely noticeable, and not in a good way. personally, I am going to return. they changed the formula :(
