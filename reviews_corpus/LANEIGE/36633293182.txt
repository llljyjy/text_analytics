I received this #freeproduct from TopBox to try out! This serum is quite light and easily absorbs into the skin. I wouldn’t really recommend this to dry skin, since it is not the most moisturizing out there, and fits normal/oily skin way better. The packaging is definitely a new thing to me, and kind of fun if I were to be honest. I was so excited initially to try a LaNeige product since I could never afford a brand like this, but it was honestly a little underwhelming. I don’t feel like this is worth the cost. I didn’t really feel any differences in my skin, but if you have the money, this could replace your light drugstore serum for sure. Probably has better ingredients. Treat yourself! nan
