I used to love the old formula but this one is better for my combo skin. In my late 20s I’ve suddenly got more dryness in my skin and it’s been hard to find a moisturizer that hydrated withou making me oily. This is the one. It’s really light and absorbs so easily, but it’s the ONLY gel (in this price range) I’ve used that doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight. The beads melt away super easily and I don’t get very oily after. It also layers well under makeup and it doesn’t trigger my sensitive skin.The old formula was heavily fragranced and I found sat on top of the skin. This is better in every way! Better than the old one
