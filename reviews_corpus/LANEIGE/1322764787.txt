Laneige is easily one of my favourite skincare brands as their products are effective yet gentle on my sensitive and dry skin. This water bank blue hyaluronic eye cream has done wonders for my skin and area around my eyes. I have been using it daily and I have noticed results. At 36, I am getting fine lines and wrinkles, and this wonderful cream has smoothed those lines and helped with the puffiness I sometimes get under my eyes. The skin around my eyes also appears brighter now. I like the subtle, gentle scent it has and how a little bit goes a long way. It also cools the skin which feels nice after sunshiny days. I have my new favourite eye cream and would highly recommend it if you are looking for something to help brighten, smooth and hydrate the skin surrounding your eyes. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. Smoothes, hydrates and brightens
