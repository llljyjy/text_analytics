This product was gifted by Laneige for an honest review(the views are all my own). I truly liked this product because it wasnâ€™t too heavy on my skin and wore well throughout the day despite being a creamy and thick formula. My skin is still recovering from a dry winter and this has been heaven sent right now! My skin feels soft, supple and moisturized without the heaviness that I get from most creams. It feels good on my skin and worked well with makeup and other products. I will repurchase to use during times when my skin is drier. Great for dry skin!
