The product itself is fine and I like the fine mister, but the packaging is terrible. I have used it less than a dozen times, but I only have 30% of the bottle left. Every time I spray, it leaks heavily. One time it sat on my counter—I kid you not—and at least half an ounce just dripped out onto my counter. The next time I went to use it, there was 1/2 an inch of liquid sitting inside the cap, which of course poured out when I opened it. No clue how it even happened. Very frustrating, and I’m afraid to purchase again because of how much was wasted. Faulty packaging= wasted product.
