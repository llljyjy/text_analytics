I’ve tried a lot of toners and this is honestly the one i’d consider my holy grail! I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin and this shouldn’t be the only this on your roster for acne it is AMAZING to have in your collection especially for sensitive, dry skin. Using this in combination with the cleanser has made such a visual change in my skin over the past few months. It’s visually softer and more moisturized than ever! Definitely pick up if you need some moisture in your life and your acne products are turning you into the Sahara Desert!! Must have!!!
