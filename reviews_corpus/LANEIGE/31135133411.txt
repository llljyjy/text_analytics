I have been using Laneige Hydro UV Sunscreen for over a week and its great. Aside from the necessary sun protection, it also provides hydration for my face. Despite the cold winter days, i didnâ€™t typically need an additional moisturizer while using this SPF. It goes on lightweight and absorbs easily with no white cast. It leaves skin looking a little dewier. I may have found a new sunscreen to put into my regular rotation! nan
