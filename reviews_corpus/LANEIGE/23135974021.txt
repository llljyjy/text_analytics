One of the best products I’ve ever used. Been using it for about three years now if not longer and it’s the only lip mask that is hydrating, smells amazing, doesn’t taste synthetic, and is worth ever penny. You do not need a lot for this to be effective. I use it once when I wake up in my AM routine and then in my PM routine before I go to sleep. One package lasts me almost exactly a year. So worth it. nan
