I received this #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox - I have been using this Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Serum for over 2 weeks - A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!  This serum has such a beautiful ’slip’ when applying over your face - just glides beautifully!    No scent, absorbs very quickly and leaves your skin feeling so hydrated!   I have used many different hyaluronic serums before, but this one is by far my favorite!   The bottle is so cute, when you turn it, up pops the dispenser and when you turn it back - it all closes back up.   The bottle is easy to hold, and the pump dispenses just the right amount with two pumps to cover your entire face, and I used another pump to go down my neck.   I will definitely order this to add into my skincare regime. Ummm .... AMAZING!
