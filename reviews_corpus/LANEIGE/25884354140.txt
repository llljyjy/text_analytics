As a teen growing up in the Southeast I always had super oily skin, but after getting into my mid 20s and moving to the Northeast my skin has been SUFFERING this winter. This product is amazing, incredibly moisturizing and single handedly helped bring my skin back to being bouncy and moisturizer. I sometimes even use two layers when it is especially cold. I use it as a toner after I cleanse and just layer on top of it. Can be sticky after application but once you start layering it goes away. Incredibly Moisturizing
