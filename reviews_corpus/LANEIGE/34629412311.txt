My skin has always struggled with texture, pimples, blackheads, etc. I was in Sephora trying to look for ANYTHING to help my skin. The lady I spoke to led me to the Laneige Exfoliating Toner and have used it for about 3 months and I saw changes in my skin almost immediately. My blemish-prone skin started feeling smoother and looking brighter. This is definitely my favorite brand to use. I will forever live by all Laneige products. Highly Recommended!!
