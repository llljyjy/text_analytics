As an avid sunscreen user, I get excited trying out new products. I like that this sunscreen has no white cast. This is lightweight, yet I find it very moisturizing, something my skin needs right now during dry weather. I have applied this under my make-up with no problems. This does feel a little greasy, but I find this with a decent amount of sunscreens. I havenâ€™t had any breakouts nor sensitivities. I was gifted by Laneige and am happy with its performance. No white cast and very hydrating
