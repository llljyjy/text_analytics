This product was gifted by Laneige for my honest review.The packaging I love so much.It comes with the cutest little spatula for easy application.The texture of the product is awesome.I love how it quickly absorbs into my skin.It has a light scent but doesnt last long.I applied in the morning and the product kept my skin moisturized all day long. Awesome Moisturizer
