So I was sick, severely dehydrated and have been in the hospital for a week being prodded with needles that left my lips in terrible condition to the point where my lips were dry, cracking, peeling (like skin hanging off), on the verge of death, like I’ve been in the desert finding my way to civilization for two weeks a 12 oz bottle of water. I didn’t really snap photos at the time because I didn’t feel good but as I recovered and once my family dropped of my lip mask, it was about to say goodbye crusty damaged lips! I put it on overnight, and woke up to check them, it was a as if they were never cracked, heeling so fast! The difference overnight alone can sell someone on buying it. It does exactly what it says and I even use it throughout the day now (just not as much on as when applying before bed). I posted the best photos I had with lighting  to show the difference it made. I think it’s worth buying especially if you suffer from severely dry, cracked lips or just want to keep good care of your skin and hydrate! I’ve purchased the product before but these results while in the hospital sealed the deal that Laneige will have me as a loyal customer for years to come for this lip sleeping mask.
