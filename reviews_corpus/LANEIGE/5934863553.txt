This lip mask dries my lips out like no other, and I’ve been using it for 2 months now, trying to give it as many chances as it needs. Even upon application, I feel my lips shriveling up underneath, and I have to constantly reapply every hour maximum and I’m left with even drier lips than I started with. In all honestly, vaseline works better. One star for how good it smells and another for how fun it is to put on. Cannot understand the hype
