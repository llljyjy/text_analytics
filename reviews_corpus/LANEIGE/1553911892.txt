Awesome product! They make my lips look great, nice and glossy. The product doesnâ€™t feel tacky-sticky it feels smooth and creamy. And best of all consistent use of the product has healed my dry lips. I noticed with regular use my lips stay looking soft and fuller. And as others stated, the gummy bear does smell like grape but I like it. The peach one smells like nothing at all!! Hope they never discontinue these!
