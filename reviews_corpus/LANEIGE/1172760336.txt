I love this night mask! I have dry skin that sometimes get irritated in winter. This takes care of it. It has a light gel consistency that is smooth and cooling when applying to skin. It glides well so you dont need lots to cover you face and neck. This mask absorbs fast and does not leave residus on your pillow. It does make my face smooth and plump in the morning . Favorite winter mask! #freeproduct nan
