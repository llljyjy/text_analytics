I applied this through out the day and had ok results, but when I applied at night I would still wake up with dry lips. The applicator is cute but it gets pretty disgusting after a few uses, meaning you have to constantly clean it (same with the little pouch). Honestly it just made my lips feel sticky?  Vaseline works way better. I also recently heard that Laneige tests their products on animals. I will definitely not be repurchasing or supporting this brand in the future. Sad I didnâ€™t know about the animal testing before hand. Donâ€™t buy. Vaseline > laneige
