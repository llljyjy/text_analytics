I am so, so glad I came across this spray. I have dehydrated skin and was searching for a toner or water spray to work with my e.l.f. Holy Hydration moisturizer. I needed something that didn’t have hyaluronic acid in it, since the moisturizer already does & I needed a water-based product for the moisturizer to grab onto. This product is a godsend! So hydrating & works perfectly with my moisturizer. I cannot recommend this product enough for my fellow dehydrated skin folks, or anyone using a hyaluronic acid based moisturizer or serum. Quick tip: this size is a better deal than the spray version, so my rec is to buy this one & put it in your own spray bottle (if that’s your jam)! Works beautifully!
