My favourite hydrating toner that I’ve tested out thus far. Definitely recommend this for the winter months. I pour it on my palm and apply it to my face. There’s little viscosity so be careful when applying as a lot of liquid will come out. I found the white tea scent to be very pleasing and calming. Would recommend using this after you wash your face if you’re in a rush and don’t have time to complete a thorough routine. nan
