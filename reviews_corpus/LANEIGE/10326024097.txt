I wanted to love this product but it’s not worth the hype. I struggle with dry lips and tested this out over a few months. I’d apply the mask overnight, wipe it off the next day and my lips would be crusty in an hour. I’m not sure the ingredients do anything at this point. Save your money and buy a regular chapstick. No Visible Difference :/
