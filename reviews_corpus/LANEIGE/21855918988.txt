I have very dry chapped lips in the winter and was hoping this would help them not crack. I’ve used this for a few weeks now, and it feels nice on and does make my lips soft but I don’t feel like it’s that much better or different from slathering on some vaseline at night. I’ll use it up but won’t repurchase. It's ok.
