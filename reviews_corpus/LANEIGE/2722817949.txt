Love this 2-in-1, great for those with combination and/or dry skin. Moved for school and my skin has had a hard time adjusting to the new weather, and I have some dry flaky skin around my nose and mouth. This product has helped bring back moisture to my face without being too heavy and most importantly, without clogging my pores and causing whiteheads. Definitely a new staple to my routine. Moisturizing and non-irritating
