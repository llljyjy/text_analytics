First of all, let’s talk about this packaging! Love the beautiful blue colour and love they way you twist the top to open it! So classy! I have been using this serum morning and night. A little bit goes a long way. My skin’s texture has really improved. It feels soft and smooth to the touch. This serum does not feel sticky or greasy. The texture feels nice. I will definetly purchase this when I run out. I really recommend this serum. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Amazing serum!
