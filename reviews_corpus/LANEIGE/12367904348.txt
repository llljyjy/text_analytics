I received this product for my honest review complimentary from Laneige. I love the cube shaped packaging, it is very adorable. The moisturizer absorbs into my skin easily and leaves a beautiful glow without looking too shiny. The only thing I donâ€™t like is the scent, it is a tad strong for my taste. It smells like white flowers. nan
