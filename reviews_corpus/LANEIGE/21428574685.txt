I got a mini size of this product with Sephora rewards, and bottom line is I wish I’d picked something else. I have dry skin concerns so I always use moisturizing products on my face, but instead of feeling smoothly moisturized it just feels sticky. So much so that it makes me want to wash it off my hands after applying it instead of letting it soak in. It’s also so runny that it slides off my hands into the sink before I can apply it to my face. While it is moisturizing as advertised, it’s so inconvenient and unpleasantly sticky to use that I can’t recommend it. 2/5. nan
