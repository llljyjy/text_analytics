I’m a huge fan of the Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer. I didn’t get a chance to try the previous versions of this so I can’t make a comparison. I debated between this and the gel/lighter version but ultimately decided that I’d rather have my skin more hydrated than less. This feels so good going on but it is on the thicker side so I use a lighter moisturizer on really hot days. My skin feels plump and hydrated all day and the finish is a glowy satin (not matte but not overly shiny). The scent is incredible, but doesn’t linger more than a minute or two after application, and I would use this as a perfume if I could! Perfect Moisturizer!
