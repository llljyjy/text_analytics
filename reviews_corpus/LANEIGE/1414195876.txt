Vaseline Rosy Lips Lip therapy is an exact dupe for this product. What I do like about this product is that it’s in a tube rather than a pot so I don’t have to dip my finger into it. Other than that I will stick to the Vaseline when this runs out. Minus one star because it’s more expensive than the Vaseline lip therapy. Expensive version of Vaseline Rosy Lips
