Everyone needs to use this. I tried a sample and fell in love. I battled cystic acne for years. Moisturizers always made me break out. Now I have a toner AND a moisturizer that I love. I use this then a squalene oil afterwards, in the morning and at night. No breakouts or irritation. Easily layers with foundation and other products after a few minutes. You need it!!! a must for combo skin and acne prone skin
