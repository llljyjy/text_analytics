I’ve only used it for 2 days and I missed last night and used it this morning and the other day in the evening before I went to sleep for the first time. I’m also using Fenty Skin products and this I must say, is awesome!!! I want to buy the actually product. The only issue is my oily skin but like I said in another review, it is gladly working out for my acne-prone and oily skin. There is so much smoothness and brightness I must say because of this product in conjunction to Fenty Skin Pre-Show Glow (for my face of course) and Cocoa Cleans’r All-Over Soothing Bar concerning my face (even though I use the bar for my body too). I got this as a sample when I picked up Fenty Skin products the other day. Worth it and will buy the product. I recommend it highly much. This will Brighten and Smooth Your Skin
