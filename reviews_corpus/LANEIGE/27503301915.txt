I received this product in exchange of my honest review.I have religiously used this water sleeping mask at night for the last 3 weeks and I can say that I am loving it for my combination type skin.I would say that it is definitely hydrating and is formulated with squalene which definitely made my skin feel so hydrated and moisturized.I would recommend using this mask at night only for combination or oily skin types but dry skin types can use this any time of the day because this mask is so hydrating.I would highly recommend this mask if you are someone who is looking to improve your skinâ€™s moisture barrier.If you are thinking about it..just buy it!!! Amazing water sleeping mask!
