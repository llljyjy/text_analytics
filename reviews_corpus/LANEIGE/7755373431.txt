The Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Serum has a milky gel consistency and a prominent floral fragrance.  It absorbs quickly and makes my dry skin feel hydrated and refreshed, but also leaves behind a sticky residue immediately after application.  That residue disappears after moisturizer is applied, and my go to pairing is the Laneige Water Bank Cream.  This serum extends the life of the moisturizer, hydrating my skin for many more hours compared to when I use the moisturizer on its own.  Any exfoliation from the green tea enzymes is extremely gentle.  As someone who has sensitive skin, it didn’t cause any irritation, but rather serves to further smooth and soften my skin.  The packaging is very modern and intuitive to use.  You twist the top half of the container to reveal or conceal the pump.  This is a great defense mechanism to ensure no serum is accidentally spilled.  There is also a window on the back of the container that will turn red when the serum is running low so you know when it’s time to restock.  I wish all products adopted these useful features!!  Gifted by Laneige. Superb packaging and results!!
