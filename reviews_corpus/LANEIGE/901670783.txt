I have serious dry lips in the California winter and this does not touch them overnight.  Itâ€™s fine as a shine over the course of an hour or so, but overnight, aquaphor is so so much better as an overnight ointment.  This does absolutely nothing to soothe chapped lips long term.  Disappointed. Not a fan
