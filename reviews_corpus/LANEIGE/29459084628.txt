I received this product for free from topbox in exchange for my honest review. First of all, I’m in love with this product and the packaging, it’s such a vibrant color. I’ve been using it twice daily for 2 weeks. I’ve started seeing results right after the first application. It has a lightweight formula with a water-like consistency. I’m using 3-5 pumps for each application and find it easier to use with a cotton pad than with bare hands. It absorbs quite nicely and the scent is not at all overpowering. It hydrates and brightens up the skin very well. I’m going to continue using this product to deal with some hyperpigmentation on my face. I’ll definitely recommend this product and would buy it again! Must Have - Highly Recommend
