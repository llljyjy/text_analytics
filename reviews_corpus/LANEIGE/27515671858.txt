I love this lip mask, I haven’t seen massive results but it does hydrate my lips. Smells yummy just like a strawberry gummy kind of smell, or a lollipop. Not sure how to explain the smell lol but it does smell like candy, I’m a bigger fan on the sweet candy scent than the berry. Not that the berry scent is bad, it just got old quickly and I got sick of it. But this lip mask is great, one of my favorites, stays on all night. good lip mask :)
