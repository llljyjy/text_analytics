Okay okay so I was not expecting myself to like this so much! Itâ€™s seriously super hydrating especially when I spray my face with a little Avene water before applying this toner (make sure your face is lightly damp not soaking wet). My skin gets dry especially on my cheeks so this has been great to put some hydration back into my face. I love it! hydrating & lovely
