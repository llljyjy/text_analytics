I do not recommend, I’ve tried 3 different kinds now & all of them make my lips more chapped then they were before. This product is so highly rated which made me keep trying but the final bottle I tried was “Gingersnap” and that one ended up burning my top lip & making me break out all around my mouth. I will be sticking to vegan/clean beauty products from now on. NO!
