Amazing! I was very sceptical at first, as the last time a Sephora employee recommend something to me, it did not work out great. I have super sensitive combination skin, especially this winter it seems extra dry in areas but when I try to treat the dryness I break out. Sleeping masks tend to cause the worst breakouts the next day. But this stuff not only left my skin feeling soft but it actually helped with a dry skin break out I was having and doesnâ€™t leave my skin feeling oily. nan
