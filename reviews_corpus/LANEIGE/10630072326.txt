I love this stuff a lot. I never bought the full size because of the price. That’s the only reason I WAS going to give 4 stars. However, this product actually works for me. I thought about it, and realized the little .10 oz lasted me a REALLY long time. So, I decided to buy a full size in Vanilla because it will most likely last me more than a half a year, and for $22 plus not having to buy any other lip care products.. It’s now my holy grail. My lips are so soft and never cracked anymore, and I wear it during the day as well. My fiancé always gets it on his lips when we kiss and he says his lips become soft so he ended up liking it too haha. ALSO I love the little applicator it comes with, especially handy when I have my nails done! :-) Holy grail!
