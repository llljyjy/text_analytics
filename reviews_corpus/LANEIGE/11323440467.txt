I have had dry, chapped lips on and off for awhile now, they are the worst especially when I wake up and it makes wearing lipstick not so fun as well. I tried Vaseline and other lip creams and they just didn’t do it for me. I bought this and was skeptical at first as the formula looked like lip gloss and didn’t feel like anything special. However when I woke up my chapped lips were completely gone!! I am honestly amazed and this will be a new staple in my skin care routine. My new staple in my nighttime skincare routine!!
