I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.The instructions mention 3 ways to apply the essence: sweeping it on like how you would a toner, soaking cotton pads, or placing in the palm of your hands and patting it into the skin. I tried all three and I liked the last method the most since it has vitamin C so I want to ensure it absorbs, and sweeping it on doesn’t feel like it would provide maximum impact. I’ve definitely noticed my skin look and feel more hydrated after using this essence recently. I think it’s also lightened an acne mark on my face, but will have to continue using to see if it brightens the rest of my face overall. I am liking the way my foundation looks lately though, which is a good sign about my base. The timeline on the side of the bottle is also super handy (and innovative!), since it denotes how long you’ve been using the product and when you can expect to see results. The packaging is great in that respect, but the dispenser is just awful. The opening is far too wide and I had to knock off a star because it’s becoming a nuisance. I typically use about 2 pumps and clasp my palms together before attempting to pat it in, but the essence is quite watery and it sometimes drips down my arm or I have to be careful not to spill it. Given how watery the formula is, I’m not sure why the dispenser opening is so wide, as other Laneige serums I’ve used don’t have this problem. Anyway, you probably won’t have this issue if using the cotton pad method to apply, but I thought I’d call it out since they mention multiple ways of using it and so, should accommodate diverse application methods.#trywithtopbox #freeproduct Change the dispenser opening pls
