i love laneige lip sleeping masks i have 4 of the full size and a couple of the minis and for the price you get a good amount of product. this is more expensive than their other lip masks and it’s only 10g for $32. don’t get me wrong it’s smooth and smells great but definitely not worth the price for the amount of product you get :( this is not it
