I received a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and i have been using it for a week now. I was always looking for an eye cream that will do magic on my puffy and tired looking eyes and this really helped me a lot. I am using it night and day and I can see visible improvements on my under eye.  Less dark circles and puffy under eyes and helped a little bit with my fine lines and wrinkles. This is not the best cream that I used, but this is my second choice. My previous eye cream is still the best and I can see results in few overnight applications. Other than that, nothing bad to say on this. Laneige is still Laneige! A very good brand with this modest packaging. I love it! Amazing cream!
