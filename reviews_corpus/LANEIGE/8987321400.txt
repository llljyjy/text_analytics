#freeproduct I am so happy I got to try this product thanks to #trywithtopbox. It is definitly a new member to my skin routine. The feeling on the skin is smooth an refreshing. I only didnâ€™t love the mechanism, it is a bit messy. A mist or a drop would have been better. But the product itself is great. I used it day and night (each the recommended amount) and I definitely saw the improvement on my skin. New member of the routine
