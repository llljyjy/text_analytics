Mixed feelings on this serum for me. The packaging is absolutely so cute and unique, but I worry I’m gonna get product everywhere with the lift top. The serum is gel-like and provides hydration, but it’s a little sticky and the fragrance is  potent. I can smell on my face for at least ten minutes after applying, and when checking the ingredients, fragrance is halfway up the list. I worry for my sensitive skin.
