Love the smell of this moisturizer! Smells like an orange creamsicle, so for people who don’t like fragrance this may annoy you.  Absorbed quickly into the skin but minus one star as I used up the whole jar and didn’t notice any results in terms of clearing up dark spots or making my skin glow.  I’d rather use a different moisturizer and a vitamin C serum seperately. nan
