this has been my go to for years. i am extremely picky when it comes to lip products, and hate more than i like. the consistency is very thick, and smells lovely. you will wake up in the morning with hydrated lips and product still left on! this tub will last you a long time, as a little goes a long way. i also like to use it as a gloss in the daytime, and put it on before i do my makeup. this is a cult favourite for a reason! long lasting and great hydration!
