I absolutely love this Retinol Firming Cream because I have dry/ sensitive skin and most of retinol products irritate and dry out my skin but this cream is suitable for dry sensitive skin and also have hyaluronic acid in it which makes it hydrating and this is the only retinol cream that I can include in my night time skin care routine without having any issues and my skin looks super smooth and fine lines also look less visible. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Suitable for sensitive skin
