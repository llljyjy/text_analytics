The best thing you’ll ever buy and it’s an understatement. I first had it as a sample and it did wonders for my lips. I live in Minnesota and the cold always had my lips extremely dried and cracked. I just have to put it before bed and I’m literally good for 3, 4 days no need to apply it again. My lips are so smooth and moisturized. Even my boyfriend tried it and thinks it’s wonderful, just get it!!!! JUST GET IT!
