I absolutely love this balm! I bought it because Jessica Braun told me to haha! I use this through out the day but most of the time I feel like I only need to apply it twice a day. Your lips stay moisturized all day long. It is one out of the two lippies (Aquaphor being the other) that I can use! I have super sensitive skin and this doesnâ€™t cause any irritation. Highly recommend! My Absolute Favorite!
