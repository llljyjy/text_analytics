My skin abosutley loves this, I wouldnâ€™t recommend anyone with dry skin to try and use this as their stand alone moisturizer as this is what I refer to as my pre-moisturizer layer. I always notice how hydrated/dewy my skin looks after using this, I prefer to use it during my night routine instead of my day time one. Skin loves it
