Absolutely adore this mask! I started back on retinol and we all know how dry and flakey our skin can be. This has soothed and calmed my skin so much. It is incredibly moisturizing and I look forward to the nights that I use this. A little goes a long way too so I imagine it will last me many months. Soothing Mask
