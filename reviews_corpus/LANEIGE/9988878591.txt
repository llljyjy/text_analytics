I received this serum from laneige for free in exchange for my honest review. I have been using it along with its moisturizer and i have to admit its one of the best serums to date i have ever used. The texture is smooth and quickly absorbed into the skin. I also love the packaging and the twist opening of the bottle its new and impressive. I see visible changes in my skin like smoother and more firm. Love it!
