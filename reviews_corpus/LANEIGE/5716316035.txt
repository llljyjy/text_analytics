I got this as a #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox. Feels great on the skin although I will admit I haven’t seen too much of a difference over a couple of weeks. My skin feels good the morning after application though so I’m excited to see the long term results. The pump is pretty aggressive, even just one pump is more than enough to cover my face, neck, and then some. nan
