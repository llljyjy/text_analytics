For reference, I am in my mid 40s and have dry aging wrinkly lips. I need to use a product to deeply hydrate them, specially because my favorite lipsticks are the ones that are matte, and therefore, more drying on my lips. I need to prepare them so they can stand that. My lips have never been flaky again after using this product, but they will be flaky again if I stop.PROSIt is deeply hydrating: the mixture of oils and butters make this product so nourishingIt has vitamin C, great antioxidant, which is always great to have in your skincare routine.It smells so good! And there are different “flavors” to choose from.A little goes a long way. A full bottle lasted me for over a year using it once a day everyday, so I find it very reasonably priced in that regard.It is a thick product but it melts once applied to the lipsIt is not sticky at all, so it is very comfortable.Can be used at any time, not only as a lip sleeping mask.CONSI can’t find any. This product is excellent I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador Pure hydration
