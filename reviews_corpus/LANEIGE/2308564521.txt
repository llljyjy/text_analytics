absolute favorite flavor of life! tastes like Japanese purple grape candy/gum. (i tried last yearâ€™s holiday mini set, so this is new to me). comes with a teeny little silicone applicator- looks like an old school sponge tip eyeshadow applicator, but silicone instead of the foam, and has its own little sleeve. nan
