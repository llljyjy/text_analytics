Although this was a gifted to me by Laneige, that does not sway my opinion in any way. I have combo skin in the summer and dry in the winter, so I love a light and thick cream which is what this is.  Instantly my face was more plump. I did not like how it made me more matte, as my skin dehydrates easily through the day and I live in a cold, dry state. This might be better suited forsummer or humid locations. I did not notice new breakouts and I loved that this does not pill under makeup either! matte finish very plumping
