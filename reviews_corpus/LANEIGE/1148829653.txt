Love using this mask to refresh my skin when it feels extra dry. I use it as a last step to my skincare routine and in the morning I wake up to super hydrated, soft skin. I’m not a big fan of the scent though but the product itself is bomb so I can easily look past the smell. The price is also reasonable IMO cause i don’t apply it everyday so it lasts me a long time. Overall it’s one of the best overnight masks out there on the market for sure! works great!
