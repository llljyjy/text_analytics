I have been enjoying the Retinol Firming Cream Treatment from Laneige. I have noticed my skin is more hydrated, supple, soft,  and smooth. It absorbs easily in to the skin with no irritation. You only need a small amout a couple times per week. The cream has a nice texture. I feel like my skin is really starting to improve in texture and slight decrease in fine lines. Hoping the lines will continue to improve with use. Nice packaging. Would recommend. Excellent product
