I used the OG version of this product RELIGIOUSLY as it is lightweight, hydrating without being heavy for oily/combo skin, and does not irritate my sensitive skin. So, like everyone else who loves this product, I was shocked to see that it had been reformulated. Cautiously, I decided to give the new formula a try and I was NOT disappointed! I love this formula way more than the original. It does everything the old formula does, but better, in my opinion. The ONLY con I agree with is that it does leave an odd film after applying (feels tacky, almost?) but this goes away after a few minutes. If you have dry skin, I do not think this would be hydrating enough. This is definitely best for oily skin as it is a water-based gel moisturizer. BETTER Than the Old Formula
