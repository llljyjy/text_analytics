So I have extremely dry lips since I’m on accutane and NOTHING I mean NOTHING would work. My lips are so bad that they split, crack and bleed all day everyday. Now I’ve tried aquaphor, Vaseline, Burt’s bees, lamer, etc. This is a literal god send. It’s smells great as well and is cute packaging so that’s always a plus am I right? Anyways, if you’re looking to buy this, don’t hesitate. Buy it fr. Incredible.
