This Radian-C Essence was gifted by Laneige to me. Laneige is one of my absolute favorite skincare brands and this is yet another product that I can add to my must-have list. I use this after I tone my face and I feel like it does an amazing job at priming my skin for the rest of my skincare products. On first use, my skin was immediately more hydrated and supple. The longer I used it, I could see my skin tone evening out too! I have dry, aging skin and would recommend it highly to others with a similar skin profile. Loving this new product!
