Agree with others that the original formula is fabulous and this new formula does not compare. The new formula smells almost glue like and is oddly more drying? You also have to use more for your skin to feel moisturized. Would not recommend if you have sensitive skin based off smell alone. I also donâ€™t like the packaging of the new formula. Hopefully they always have the original also available for purchase as it is amazing but harder to find now. Original is BEST, New formula NO
