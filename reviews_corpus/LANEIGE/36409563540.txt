Thank you @topbox @laneige for sending me this Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Serum for free to review. I absolutely loved this Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Serum so much! It kept my skin hydrated all day and night and it made my skin feel so soft. I used the serum in the morning and at night and would use the Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer after it. I also love that this serum is Hypoallergenic, dermatologist-tested, & suitable for sensitive skin! Blue Hyaluronic Acid instantly absorbs for deep, lasting hydration. Peptide helps visibly firm while green tea helps to strengthen skinâ€™s moisture barrier. I definitely would recommend this Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Serum to anyone and definitely will be buying it. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Amazing Product!
