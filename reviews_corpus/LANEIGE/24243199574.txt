This flavor is amazing!!  I like it better than the peppermint and berry flavor.  It does not smell too sweet and the smell is so light that I don’t understand the negative reviews on the smell. I feel like for some reason it is “creamier“ than the peppermint.  Makes my lips so soft and the light pink color is adorable.  Love the smell!  Probably my new favorite.  Please do make this part of the permanent collection! You Need!
