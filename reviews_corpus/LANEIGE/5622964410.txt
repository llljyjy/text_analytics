I love this stuff. Shake a little in your hand and spread it on your face and you’re golden. Not literally—it’s the consistency of skim milk and looks about the same, but you feel golden. I have some pretty Karen-esque skin that tends to find fault in a lot of things, but this has done wonders on keeping the judgments quiet. My rosacea and eczema spots are chilling out ever so slightly over the time I’ve used this. I’ve had it for about 5 months, use it twice a day, and am down to about 30% of the bottle left. I think I use too much every time, too. This product lasts a while, and it’s wonderful. I would absolutely recommend this to someone looking to add in a good hydrating step in their skincare routines. nan
