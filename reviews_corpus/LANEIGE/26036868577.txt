I have been waiting for the Waterbank moisture cream to be back in stock to only find they have changed the packaging and formula. I was hesitant, but desperate as it’s what I use daily. It does not smell the same, and it make my skin feel worse! It doesn’t nourish and hydrate the same, my skin will get patchy and red dryness- It’s like the quality overall is much cheaper now. So disapointed I will be returning. Unhappy - should have kept the original formula!
