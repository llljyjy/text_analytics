Everyone raves about this balm but I am not impressed. I got a full size Apple Lime for free a year ago. It’s feels heavy, sticky, tacky and sits on top of my lips without absorbing. An hour after application it’s still sticky, so I don’t know how we’re supposed to sleep in it? Feels more like a cheap thick lip gloss from early 2000’s. My husband won’t kiss me if I have this on. I’m a lip balm fiend but I’ll stick to Kiehl’s #1 for skincare, which has been my fave for 10 years. Heavy & sticky - Overrated
