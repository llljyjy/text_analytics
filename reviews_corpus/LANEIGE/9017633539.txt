My favourite for a simple natural gloss or to protect my lips at night. I have never tried the formula that is in the little jar, but I personally prefer tubes as I feel they are more hygienic. If you have extremely flakey lips, this is not going to solve that issue , but if your lips are fairly normal, this will just help to maintain that level of moisture. The flavour is very nice and not disturbing like other lip balms iâ€™ve tried. nan
