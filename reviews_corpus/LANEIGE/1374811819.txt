I tried a sample of this and I’m in love! My have combination skin with areas that are very oily, dry and flaky, and my nose has both problems. I wasn’t sure what exactly this product was supposed to be. After hearing about it from a blogger, I finally decided to use my sample as applied it after cleansing like an essence, before serum. It initially felt slightly sticky, but not in a bothersome way. I decided to try it on my oily forehead and was shocked this actually removed most of the shine overnight! I applied a light layer under my makeup and it was amazing! My forehead abs nose were less oily than usual l, and my dry areas were smoother. Even street removing m makeup, my skin feels nice. I usually wait longer before ordering a full sized product, but this was too good and don’t want to run out of the little sample. Try this! I don’t think you will be disappointed. Amazing!!
