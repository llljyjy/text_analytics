I don’t know it just doesn’t work the way I want it to. So I exfoliate my lips and put it on generously before I go to bed. It seems nice and soft, and smells good, I like this part. But when I wake up in the morning my lips are still a bit dry. Usually with other brand I use, I rub my lips with a face towel in the morning to get rid of dead skin created over night and they’re all gone, leave my lips soft and smooth. But this Laneige hasn’t quite done the job... I would say it’s not my best option. nan
