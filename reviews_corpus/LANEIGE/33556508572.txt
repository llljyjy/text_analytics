I received this complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest review. I have dry skin, so I look for heavier moisturizers, especially when it’s colder outside. This cream does not feel as thick as others I have; however, it is still very hydrating. It has a very faint smell but it’s not bad. I would recommend this for dry skin types. nan
