Overall it works great, leave it overnight and it will soften your lip like magic, but the applicator I found out was bit of disappointed, it is impossible to clean after every use, leave the pocket and the applicator greasy ,also if you wipe it too hard , the rubber head will break down and separated from the stick, such an awful design nan
