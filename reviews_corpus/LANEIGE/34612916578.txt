Really moisturizing for bed and keeps my lips nice and soft in the morning. I also find that you donâ€™t have to use too much and smells pleasant. However, you have to keep up with this every night but it is moisturizing for the moment. The lip mask also gives a tint of pink to your lips which is cute in my opinion. Great
