I love this product. It definitely feels thick like a mask so you know it is staying in place. When I wake up the next day and rinse it off, my skin feels so soft. I love the smell of it too. Not sure that was a feature of this product, but I sure enjoy it I love that it comes with the little plastic beauty spatula. Love it!
