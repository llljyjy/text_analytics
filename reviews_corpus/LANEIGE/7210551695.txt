Absolutely amazing serum! I have sensitive dry skin and this serum keep my face smooth and moisturized all day. The only one complaint I have is actually the packaging. Although it looks nice and fancy, it’s really hard to tell how much product is still in the bottle and it’s just too bulky to bring it when traveling. Would be a 5/5 product if the bottle is lighter (and more sustainable really). only ONE MAJOR complaint
