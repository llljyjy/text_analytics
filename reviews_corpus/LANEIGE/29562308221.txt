I love chemical sunscreens for everyday use and this one did not disappoint! I prefer my skincare to be non-fragranced as it can be irritating sometimes, but the scent of this one was pleasant and non-irritating. It has a light powdery scent to it that goes away once it’s absorbed into the skin. The texture is on the thicker side, like a cream. But it blends into the skin beautifully, leaving no whitecast behind. Doesn’t clog my pores either. A bit greasy since my skin leans more on the oily side, but not greasy enough to where I don’t feel comfortable wearing this outside. Since it’s very hydrating on its own, I feel like I can skip applying moisturizer in the mornings. I can’t say this is my new holy grail, but it’s a great sunscreen overall. I received this product complimentary from Laneige. Slightly greasy, but works well
