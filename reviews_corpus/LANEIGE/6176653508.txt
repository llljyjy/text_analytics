I got this product because I wanted to check out the built in applicator. I like this just as much at the night lip balms. The applicator is pretty cute. It smells very fruity with a strong pineapple scent. Overall very hydrating. At the price point it is an expensive lip balm and I think people should try this out at least once and then stick to the night lip balm. Fruity hydrating balm!
