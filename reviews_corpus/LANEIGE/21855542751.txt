Ok this is literally my favourite of all the lip masks!! I will probably have to buy a few of these seeing as the sweet candy is a limited edition flavour :( This smells like sweet strawberry candy (but not sickly sweet!! if anything it smells more like how I expected ’berry’ to smell), it’s SO lovely and I use it all the time and as always I have never noticed a quality difference between any of the flavour/scent options, they are all equally great and work amazingly especially during Canadian wintertime <3 sweet candy is my new favourite!!!
