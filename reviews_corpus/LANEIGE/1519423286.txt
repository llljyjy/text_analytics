I received this as #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and I’m in love! It’s the perfect eyecream for the summer as it feels light on the eye area. You can incorporate it in your morning and night skincare routine and the application is very smooth. It’s perfect if you apply eye care with rollers. The consistency of the product is a hybrid of gel and cream; I do not use an eye serum beforehand. I’ve noticed that my undereye area is much brighter after 2 weeks of use. No to mention that the packaging is very cute and satisfying to handle. Brighter undereyes
