Got this as part of the 2021 birthday gift set. Love the water cream, as well as this water mask.My skin is normal but a bit on the dry side, and this mask feel so good on the skin, it’s very light and smells pleasant. I’d say though bcuz it’s really light, it’s not enough hydration on dryer days and I’d use it with another face cream. really like this
