Like everyone else, I’m really sad that this was reformulated and the only positive update was the new packaging. I even found a backstock of the old formula online and stocked up on as much as I could use before the expiration date because the change was so drastic. In the meantime, I also tried the Caudalie Resveratrol Lift Firming Cashmere Moisturizer and it turns out I actually like it better. It’s more expensive and it’s not exactly the same consistency, but if you are looking for a decent replacement option, I definitely recommend it. Hopefully LANEIGE will listen to all the sad reviews for the new formula and change it back. please change it back :(
