I’ve been using these religiously for years now. I’ve tried almost every flavor: coco mint, peppermint, lemon sorbet, gingersnap, grapefruit, apple lime, vanilla, berry, gummy bear, sweet candy, mango…and I loved all of them except for the mint flavors. But that’s just bc I had a preference in the smell. Gummy bear and gingersnap smell so amazing. They are my all time favorite scents. Vanilla and berry you can’t go wrong with. They last a full year even when I applied it day and night. These are amazing and my lips haven’t been cracked since the day I started using these. I completely recommend it. Smells Amazing and does the job
