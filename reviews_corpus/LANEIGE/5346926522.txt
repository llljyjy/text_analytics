I was literally obsessed with the old formula, put so many people onto it and recommended it to everyone. I was so disappointed when I purchased the new one. The scent is different (the old one was perfect and heavenly), the new moisturizer is more tacky, requires more, etc. Iâ€™m so bummed because the old formula was a holy grail, perfect product. Old formula pleaseeee
