This is a great hydrating moisturizer for even those with sensitive skin. It also comes with a scooper so it is very hygienic despite being in an open container if you always use the scooper and keep it clean. My favorite way to use this is to apply it 5-10 mins before makeup and it almost serves as a great hydrating primer that makes my makeup dewy. This was gifted by Laneige. Great Everyday Moisturizer
