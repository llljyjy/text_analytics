Just like the LANEIGE Cream Skin Mist, it’s smooth, but it didn’t absorb, not even after a few hours. It’s better to use it on the body, it did absorb on body, but not on the face. It’s extremely sticky and greasy during the summer time. This product probably works better in cold/dry places. Not for combination skin or in the summertime
