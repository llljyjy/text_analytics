So good! Great thick formula just like the lip mask, nice scent, and doesn’t seem to have that much of a tint to it which I really like. It is a little bit tacky though which is why I gave it 4 stars. But overall very good and worth the price seeing as I haven’t been able to find anything like it. Now I just hope they make a vanilla version! Very Good
