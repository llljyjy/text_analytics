In the winter, this was my holy grail....and in the summer, it’s still working for me on days where my lips are cracked and bleeding. I’ve purchased this at least 7 months ago and my bottle is STILL half full. A little goes a long way. It fixes my dried lips in 24 hrs, isn’t cakey, and has lightened my lips into a pink from a dusky gray (which is something I wanted since sheer lip oils don’t show up on my darker lips). I would HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone who is over trying every lip balm under the sun. This stuff WORKS!! amazing for dry lips
