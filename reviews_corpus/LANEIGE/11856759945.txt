Nice immediately after applying, gives a nice shine to lips if wearing during the day but wears off quickly. Personal opinion but I really don’t like any lip products in a jar I prefer a tube. And maybe it’s just Canadian winters being what they are but I still get quite chapped lips throughout the day despite using this product daily good not great
