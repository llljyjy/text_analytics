I literally just bought this product today and used it in my night routine thinking it’d be the same or better than the old formula— wrong. It’s dries down very sticky, has too much fragrance, and isn’t near as moisturizing and juicy as the old formula. I fell in love with the water bank moisturizer after I got it in the 2021 birthday gift, but I will be returning this ASAP. The trash quality of this new formula would also explain 90% of the reviews being incentivized. NOTHING Like the Old Formula
