Gives an initial juicy gloss and shine which makes your lips feel plump.  After using it nightly for two weeks my lips feel so dry they burn.  My mistake not looking at the ingredients,  synthetic waxâ€™s/emollients arnt going to make your lips moisturized.  You will be better off buying a cocoa butter based lip balm for $3. Not Good
