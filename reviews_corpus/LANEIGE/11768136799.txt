I received the Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer complimentary from Laneige to test and review. The packaging is a very pretty light blue, I enjoyed that the product was completely safety sealed and came with its own spatula. This felt very luxurious on the skin. My skin is more on the dry/dehydrated side and I did notice some immediate hydration when applying to the skin.  It absorbed into my skin quickly and there was continued hydration throughout the day. I have really enjoyed using this moisturizer and I would totally purchase on my own. Very Moisturizing
