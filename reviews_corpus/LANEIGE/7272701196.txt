prior to recently revamping my skincare routine, i had extremely dry and troubled skin from the dry midwest winter and still struggle with dryness from being on tret. this product’s contribution to my skin repair deserves recognition! yes, the product leaves a slightly tacky residue upon application but it absorbs into your skin within an hour or so and does not make your skin appear oily. also, a little goes a long way as it is very spreadable when applied with your fingers rather than a cotton pad. i’ve used this moisturizer 2-3 times a day for over a month and have barely made a dent in the bottle. i adore the subtle glow this product gives me when i apply it in the am! personally, i use it in the am under spf and in the pm immediately after cleansing but before the rest of my skincare regime. it is perfect for giving your skin a quick drink throughout the day and before applying makeup! photos taken within 10 minutes of applying LOVES IT
