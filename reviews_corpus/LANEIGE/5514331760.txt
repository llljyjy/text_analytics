Love this cream! My skin was in dire need of hydration when I started using this and it has saved my skin (along with a better cleanser). I have eczema and this cream has not broken out my skin at all. It makes my skin super soft and does not leave my feeling greasy like other thick moisturizers do. The scent also isn’t so strong that it’s bothersome. The biggest negative is the packaging, which feels very wasteful for the amount of product Great moisturizer!
