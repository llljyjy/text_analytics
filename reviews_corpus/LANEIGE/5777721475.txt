First day using it and so far I’m impressed. I use the mac studio fix foundation and it did not separate my makeup, just a tiny bit but it doesn’t bug me. It leaves a healthy glow after 7 hours which I like.  I definitely recommend if you have combo skin. Leaves the skin feeling hydrated. Going to to use it again tomorrow just to be sure. Recommend it 100%!!!
