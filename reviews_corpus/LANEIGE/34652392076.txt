#freeproductPros : feels lightweight .I have very acne prone skin and i did not have breakouts after using it so i was happy about that.Overall good but nothing giving me a wow factor.Cons ; the packaging is very fun but SUCH A DISASTER FOR THE PLANET abusive wastefull use of plastic  impossible to recycle because of the imbeded parts  , made me feel guilty about using it.The price is also very high for the results and quantity, i prefer the hydrating cream does the job
