Used this product for one week and some white bumps appeared on my lips. I initially thought it was a lip balm (that was I was wearing during the day). This product has such good reviews and I thought it would work out for me. I threw away my lip balm. The white bumps spread out and my upper lips was red and had a burning sensation that lasted 1 week. Once healed, I used the LaNeige Lip sleeping mask and the next morning the white spots were back and my upper lips was red and had the burning sensation again.The product is not eligible for a refund anymore. I did try the Vanillascent sample and it was fine. It might be only this one that doesnâ€™t go with my skin. I wish I tried the sample before buying the whole thing!  Highly recommend getting a sample first. Try a sample first before buying!
