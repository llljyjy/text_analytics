No. Opened the jar, peeled back the film and immediately closed it. Had no clue Laneige changed the formula as I was still finishing up the Hyaluronic Cream and was excited to try the gel. I had the old formula in one of the value sets and couldn’t wait to get a full jar…ugh. Why change the original formula? Laneige Marketing, read the reviews. I hate when companies create a problem for themselves and then “solve” it with a new product. The hydro gel was PERFECT. Please go back to that ASAP. Declined. Returning Immediately.
