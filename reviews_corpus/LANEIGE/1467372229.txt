I never been a lip balm type or person. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m getting older or maybe because I got my lips done with filler that I have felt an increasingly amount of dehydration on my lips that has forced me to try a lot of them. I tried the store brand, I tried expensive ones, I tried some that were like pure grease…. (Yuck) and as much as i love some of the brands on here that have lips balms nothing has compared to this one. I bought over the holidays a few years ago a kit where they had the sleeping mask and the balm. LIFE CHANGER! The sleeping mask is more of a thicker consistency and although I don’t care for thick consistency this one is completely hydrating and comfortable. The lip balms is amazing yo me! Comfortable. I reapply of course with the whole mask thing and all but it makes my lips feel completely hydrated and it lasts a while. If you are feeling like your pout needs some TLC look no further… you won’t regret it. Complete Hydrated Poutness
