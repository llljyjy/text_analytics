PLEASE go back to the old formula! The old bottle, the old formula…it was all perfection. Not sure why they decided to go and switch it up? Why not make an additional product offering rather than ruining something that was so high quality and luxurious? This formula isn’t great and clogged my pores unlike the old formula. Super disappointed and retuned it. Now I’m back to trying to find the perfect moisture barrier moisturizer… UGH…
