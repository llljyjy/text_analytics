As someone with oily skin, it’s frustrating when my lips are the only chronically dry part on my face. I bought this while out with some friends as everyone and their mother seems to own this lip mask. After a few weeks of testing it out, here are my thoughts!Pros:Super moisturizing and soft - see pictures below Scent is subtle, sweet, and realistic - doesn’t irritate my lips and dissipates after a bit A lot of product (a little goes a long way) Cons:A little expensive My lips are paler than usual when I wake up after using this the night before? But they’re still super hydrated so I don’t mind at allBelow are my lips prior to trying out this lip mask and the day after (sorry for the closeups) 10/10 overall! Healed My Cracked Lips
