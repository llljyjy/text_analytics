Hydro UV Defense is a broad spectrum SPF 50+ sunscreen gifted by Laneige for review. Adore this brand and was considerably excited to try their new sunscreen.First of all, it has a clear finish and more importantly: no stinging of the eyes! Unsure if this sunscreen is water resistant but it held up great during outdoor exercise. A big plus since I’ve unfortunately had painful experiences with other sunscreens. Application leaves my dry skin looking dewy and hydrated. It layers well with other skincare and has a light non-irritating scent which disappears quickly after application. It’s also dermatologist tested and hypoallergenic. nan
