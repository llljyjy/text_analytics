I received this #freeproduct thanks to #trywithtopbox and this serum is very light on the skin, suitable for anyone, although it has a scent to it that lingers. For this reason, I used it as a body serum and the smell lasted all day! The pump on this product is great and doesnâ€™t cause anything to spill, which can happen with other serums. nan
