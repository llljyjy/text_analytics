Age: Almost 28Usage: Once on faceTexture: Lightweight, watery creamI received this sample with my order. I immediately applied it to my face after searching reviews pertaining to milia, which I’m prone to getting when I use the wrong products, and found none. My skin thanked me for quenching its thirst after I skipped my skincare routine the night before. I instantly felt hydrated and saw a slight brightness/glow to my skin. It left my skin feeling subtly sticky/dewy, but I didn’t mind since I wasn’t applying any makeup on. I might purchase this in the future. Instantly hydrated
