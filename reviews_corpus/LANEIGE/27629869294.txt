I received the original formula as a trial and fell in love, and was looking for the full size version as it had become a needed staple. Realized it was reformulated and was worried based off of all the reviews. However, I do think the new formula is pretty good. Some of the cons: bulky packaging which seems unnecessary and a bit wasteful. The sample original was same ml and packaging was half the size. The fragrance is a bit stronger and lingers a bit longer than original formula, but both have a strong fragrance. The new formula takes a bit longer to sink in but I kinda like that as my skin feels extra soft (it sinks it but the plumpness last a bit longer). Overall I feel it works just the same as the original, which Iâ€™m happy about because this is my go to moisturizer now. Go to moisturizer
