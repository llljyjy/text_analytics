I purchased the new formulation a few months ago and it does not compare to the original formulation. The new formula feels much less hydrating and sits ontop of your skin instead of being absorbed quicker. The fragrance is also quite strong, and does not feel as “lightweight”. Please bring back the original formula Laneige! Miss the old formulation :(
