I am already a serious fan of the overnight mask, and this is definitely a more wearable options for daytime. Compared to the mask, this is a little thinner on the lips which makes it more comfortable to wear. And the difference stops there- you don’t compromise on the softness and the delicious scent. This stuff seriously works on dry, cracked, stinging lips, doesn’t hurt and I feel relief within a day or two of wearing consistently. I’ve heard complaints about having to reapply it- I don’t care about that because it literally works so well and I love another hit of the fruity scent! The gummy bear is youthful, yummy and fun, truly enjoyable to use. My Ride-or-Die Balm
