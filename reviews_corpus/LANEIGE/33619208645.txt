I fell in love with Laneige cleanser and lip mask a couple of years ago and I have finally purchased a moisturizer. I have never been disappointed by their products and this one is definitely my new nighttime moisturizer!My skin was noticeably different after a couple of uses and it feels so nice all day. Makeup goes on great afterwards. Will definitely buy again. New Favourite Moisturizer!
