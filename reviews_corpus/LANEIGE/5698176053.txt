I have a hard time finding a cream moisturizer for my dry skin that leaves it hydrated enough during the winter months. This moisturizer is perfect though! I love the cube packaging because itâ€™s cute but it can be hard to open and close. It comes with a spatula for hygiene. The moisturizer is lightly floral scented and the texture is a light cream that keeps your skin moisturized for hours! nan
