I will admit this is overpriced. I buy the laneige lip mask for the experience. I love doing my skincare routine at night and sleeping with this mask. The LE Mango smells just like a mango Hi Chew and doesnâ€™t disappoint. When I was on Accutane, laneige and aquaphor were my holy grails. Aquaphor works just fine but laneige gives the luxury experience. make mango permanent!
