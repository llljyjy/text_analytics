I was expecting some really great results but this just didn’t do it for me. Especially for $26! I wanted to see if I was being dramatic so I put Vaseline on my lips overnight and to me my lips felt better waking up with that. & Vaseline is much cheaper so I’ll stick with that. I will be returning. Not Worth The Hype or Price IMO
