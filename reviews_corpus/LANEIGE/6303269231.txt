I finally caved in and bought a full size after years of just using sample sizes (ya girl was broke lol) and it has changed my skin for the better. It calms my redness and gives me a nice glow without looking sticky and greasy. A little goes a long way so itâ€™s definitely worth the money Saves my irritated skin
