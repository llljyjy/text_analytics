I used the old formula religiously for years! I loved the old formula and purchaed a bottle about every 6 weeks. Sadly, this is nothing like the old formula. The old formula really helped moisturize my face and clear my skin. This actually dries out my skin. It also comes in a plastic container vs the glass jar that the previous container came in. Why would Laneige get rid of a good product?? I used to be such a Laneige fan but I now need to move on to a different skin care line. Very sad that Laneige has done this.  PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD WATER BANK CREAM! NOTHING LIKE THE OLD FORMULA!
