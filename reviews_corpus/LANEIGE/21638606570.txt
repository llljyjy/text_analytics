My new night time face moisturizer. It’s so hydrating and feels cooling on my face (when it’s in my skincare fridge). You get so much product and for $29 I think it’s definitely worth it. I suggest using after you wash your makeup off for the day as well to make your face feel refreshed and soft. I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. SOOO HYDRATING
