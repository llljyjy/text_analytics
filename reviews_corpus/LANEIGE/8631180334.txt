I received this #freeproduct through topbox!  Only tried it out a couple of days so far. It has a water consistency so it is best to use with a cotton ball. It does sting the eyes a little if you go too close, but it could just be my sensitive skin. It leaves a brightening complexion, and skin feels super soft after wearing it overnight. I also tried it underneath my makeup and no issues there!  #trywithtopbox #freeproduct
