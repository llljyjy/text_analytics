I love this lip mask. $22 may seem steep but you only need the tiniest bit to drench your lips so I know it will last a long time. I got the regular mini as a birthday gift and loved it so much, so decided to go for a larger one and keep the mini in my purse. I typically avoid using fragrance in my skincare routine because I have sensitive lips and skin but this hasn’t caused any irritation on my lips or the surrounding skin area. If you don’t like anything with fragrance or smells I would still definitely recommend the original. The original has a pretty dull, but pleasant smell. The gingersnap smell is so amazing and genuinely brings joy to my life - I know that sounds crazy but it’s so true. When using this lip mask overnight I wake up with super hydrated lips. I previously used aquaphor, which is nice, but I realized is really just a barrier. This actually works to hydrate your lips and acts as a barrier as well. I didn’t realize this came with a lip applicator wand but it’s a really nice touch and prevents me from having to wash my hands for the millionth time throughout my skincare routine. I also really enjoy wearing this during the day as a lip balm/gloss because it really gives off a glossy look also. Definitely would recommend! I had this in my basket for so long and am super happy I decided to bite the bullet and go for it. The attached photo is what my jar looks like after consistently using the lip mask for a few weeks. So hydrating for dry lips!
