I received this product for free from TopBox Circle in exchange for my honest review. Let me start off by telling you this product is AMAZING. I use the mask as my last step of my skin care routine and leave it on all night and wash it off in the morning. I have extremely dry flaky skin and have tried every product you could think of and nothing has worked until I tried this mask. I wake up with glowing and hydrated skin that lasts for DAYS. Go buy this now you will not regret it! worth every penny!
