I have been loving this product. It’s my first time purchasing the lip balm in the tube instead of the jar- the tube is far superior! I also find that the “berry“ scent gives me pimples around my lips. For whatever reason, it contains an ingredient that doesn’t work well with my skin. I’m not sure if this is formulated differently, but I don’t have that issue with the peach balm. Additionally, I personally don’t experience the issue of this balm drying out my lips with overuse. I use it like a regular lip balm, and it is the only product that works in the harsh winter weather and truly protects my lips. I definitely recommend this product and maybe try the peach scent if you have issues with breakouts using the berry scent. Glossy & hydrating
