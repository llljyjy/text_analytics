It’s not a miracle product by any means. It does keep my lips protected but I don’t feel as though it adds any moisture to my lips. I need to use La Roche-Posay Baume B5 underneath this in order to actually add moisture to my lips and eliminate the dryness. I would recommend this product if using something underneath that actually nourishes the lips. I bought the Gingersnap color but all of the colors felt the same so my choice was made on smell. The scent is absolutely 5 stars. Not the best, not the worst
