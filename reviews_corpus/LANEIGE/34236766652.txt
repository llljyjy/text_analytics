I got the deluxe sample box for a birthday reward and I loved the formula. I guess it was now what is the older formula. After I went through that sample size, I wanted to buy a bigger size. I saw that they did rebrand/reformulate the product and I was skeptical. I looked at the reviews and saw that it had predominately negative ones about the new formula. I trusted the handful of positive reviews that I saw so I took a chance because if I didnâ€™t like it I could return it if it was slightly used, and I have to say the formula is actually just as good as the older one! it still smells great, feels good on the skin and I can see a real difference in my skin after about a week of use. Take a chance and take advantage of the return policy! Still a good product!
