I am flabbergasted that there are any less than 5 star reviews for this amazing product. I am 40 with chronically dry lips and have purchased just about every lip balm in existence but this is the first time that I’ve not only made sure to use every single drop in the tube, but made sure to re-purchase before I ran out. This balm is hydrating, smells and tastes great, and makes your lips feel like they are being hugged by cashmere. When it wears off it doesn’t leave my lips feeling dry again like most other lip balms do. The Ilia lip wrap, Fresh sugar balms, nars afterglow balms and even Rare Beauty lip balm all leave my lips feeling dry for reference. I pair this balm with the sleeping mask at night and my lips stay smooth and hydrated enough to not have to exfoliate them. It also kept them from being chapped for a good 6 months which is a record ( my dry skin gals know what I’m talking about). The berry balm is very nice and I can taste a hint of banana in it. The gummy bear balm is almost tasteless compared to the berry. Either way, it’s always pleasant to use. These are 100% worth the price. Holy Grail Alert!
