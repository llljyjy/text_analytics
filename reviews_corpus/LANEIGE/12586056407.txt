Love this product. I have super dry and sensitive skin and I put this on whenever my face feels dry or in my routine before my moisturizer. It keeps me hydrated and smoothens the skin and you can barely feel it at all! Definitely recommend this product. Will be buying again! Pictures taken after about a month of useâ€¦ left is no makeup, right is concealer and mascara. Goes great before makeup to help hydrate the skin. Great Product for Dry Skin
