I love the Laneige lip sleeping mask for keeping my lips hydrated, especially during these long, cold, dry Canadian winters.  But this balm just didn’t do the trick for me.  I’ve had it since Christmas, and every time I use it, my lips are dry, tight and chapped within hours.  Felt good going on and gave a nice, albeit brief shine, but that’s about the best I can say for it.  I won’t be buying this again, especially at this price. Disappointing
