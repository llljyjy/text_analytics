I received this cream in a Sephora Favourites Set.  It is the old formula with the darker blue bottom and white lid.  It is scented which would probably be an issue for others, but I enjoy it.  It reminds me of Nivea cream.  It is thick and moisturizing so I only use it before bed.  My skin feels soft, supple, and not at all dry.  Highly recommend (but sadly you canâ€™t buy it anymore). Old formula is great!
