Iâ€™m only 25 (26 in a few weeks), so general fine lines/wrinkles are not a main concern for me. What is pressing, however, is the very prominent line across my forehead from wrinkling my brow one too many times. While a product like this takes ample time to work, I do notice a plumpness to that area that is undeniable. Iâ€™ll need to give it more time, but so far, so good ðŸ˜Š nan
