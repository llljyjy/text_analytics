I got this because I was using the old one and I loved it! I have oily skin and it was perfect. Itâ€™s been around 16 days since I bought it and I have been using it twice a day, this is not like the old one, this makes my face look oily and feel sticky and heavy, my pores are clogged and look huge, why did they change it? I was so happy I had finally found a moisturizer gel for my skin type, I will return this and start looking for another one :( Not like the old one
