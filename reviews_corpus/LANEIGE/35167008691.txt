I’m not entirely sure if this is the exact product that’s been clearing up my complexion and acne, but it certainly hasn’t made it worse! I find this mask very moisturizing and I defiantly notice when i’ve used it the next morning when my redness is a bit more tamed :)I take off one star because this is more of just a moisturizer, doesn’t really feel like a mask which is totally fine but I just prefer my masks to be thicker to hold in all my products. Regardless I think this product is great at doing what it claims! nan
