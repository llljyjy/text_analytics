I love this lip mask so much! It feels so amazing and especially in this Peppermint flavour! I discovered this by trying a tiny sample jar in my birthday kit last year. It was Berry flavour (which I am not a fan of, but I feel hard for the texture!). I kept wishing for a mint flavour and here it is! So I ordered this and adore it! Perfection in my opinion - feels fabulous, light minty flavour without being overpowering and light cooling effect without tingling. I scooped some of this in my little lip balm jar I had gotten to have it with me on the go! Very easy to do since this jar came with a tiny silicone applicator! I highly recommend and now will order a back-up. Please make Peppermint a permanent flavour! Love this lip mask so much! Especially Peppermint!
