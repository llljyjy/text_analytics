I like a lot of Laneige products but this one was a miss for me. No matter what I tried--using it alone, using it as a last step in my nighttime routine-- it didnâ€™t seem to do anything for my dry, rosacea skin. I was bummed. I guess if you have combo/oily skin maybe give this a try? Didn't work for me
