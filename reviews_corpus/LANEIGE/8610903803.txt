I’ve been trying to find the best sunscreen to use under makeup and by itself. I have combination and sensitive skin so I have to be careful with the products I put on my face. This hydrates the skin without making it greasy. Doesn’t disturb the foundation and smells very clean. Why i love this product!!!
