I know the ingredients are fairly basic, so I cant tell you what makes this lip mask my favorite lip mask…but it is. I’ve bought this mask 3 separate times. The scent is nice and doesn’t irritate, and the balm is perfect to apply at night. I’ve even layered it over cerave cream for extra moisture. Perfect sleep lip mask
