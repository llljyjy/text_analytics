i have very acne-prone, sensitive and dry skin because i use retinol (tretinoin to be specific). i used to use the laneige water mask every night, but when i ran out, i decided to try this. it’s much richer and very hydrating. you only need a tiny bit of product to cover your whole face, which i appreciate. it says to use it a few times a week, but i use it every night and haven’t had any issues. this hasn’t caused any breakouts or irritation, and settles into my skin very nicely. it’s not a miracle (no product is), but it’s a very solid addition to my routine and worth the price tag. i definitely prefer this over the water mask. replaced my laneige water mask as a "night cream"
