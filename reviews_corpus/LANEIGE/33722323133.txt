I got both vanilla and mango. The mango smells so good but it is pretty faint. You can still smell the mango pretty strong at least I can, but the smell kind of goes away after a couple minutes after you apply. But that happens with the vanilla as well so I think itâ€™s normal. Love both and will always repurchase this item! So comfortable on the lips! Mango and vanilla.. amazing
