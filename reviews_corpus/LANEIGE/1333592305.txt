I’ll start by saying I’m a huge fan of these and own nearly all of the flavors but the Mango was such a disappointment. There is no scent to it at all, it is too subtle for my liking.  The mask formula is the same we all know and love but this may as well be fragrance free. So sad. Mango is a let down. Don’t bother.
