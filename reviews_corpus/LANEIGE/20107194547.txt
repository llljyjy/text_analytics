Laneige gifted me their Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer, and oh my gawsh is it impressive! From the beautiful baby blue pastel color of the packaging, to the uniquely shaped jar.. to the silky soft texture and consistency of the cream itself, and how amazing it nourishes and hydrates the skin. The scent is amazing, the long lasting hydration is amazing, the gorgeous dewy glow it leaves the skin with is just so good. I live for how plump and glowy my skin looks and feels after using this moisturizer. Hands down 10/10 recommended! Wow wow wow!!!
