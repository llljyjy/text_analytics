I’m absolutely in love with this lip balm! I tried this on a whim after getting a sample of their overnight lip mask; I’m in love with it! It keeps my lips moisturized and plump. I tend to struggle with dry lips even more so during the winter — I can usually get away with only applying this maybe tops two times a day without my lips getting super dry. Definitely worth every penny! IN LOVEEEEE
