I was gifted by Laneige this product. I’m a long time Laneige user but this was my first time trying this cream moisturizer and I’m a huge fan! There’s a plastic spatula included and the packaging is adorable. The moisturizer itself isn’t sticky or too thick and super hydrating. Light enough to apply in the morning before makeup or at night if you’re looking for something hydrating but not too heavy. nan
