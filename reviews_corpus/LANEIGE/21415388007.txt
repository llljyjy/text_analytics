I have very dry lips even in the summer time, to the point where my lips crack and bleed. I apply this every single night and wake up with soft lips with some product still on. I also like applying this throughout the day as a normal lip balm but it isn’t very long lasting when i use it that way. Regardless it’s the best product I’ve used and i have seen better results on myself compared to Vaseline and Aquaphor. Also i love this scent. You can only smell it if you put your nose close to the product so it’s perfect because i don’t like fragrances Heals my chapped lips
