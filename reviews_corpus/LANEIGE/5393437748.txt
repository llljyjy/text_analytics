I’d passed on buying this for a long time because I thought maybe it was just an overhyped product. I was wrong! I have some serious acne and scarring, and this sleeping mask has helped smooth out the coloration of my skin and reduce the appearance of scarring (thanks to the squalane, I assume) while also hydrating my skin — I live in Southern California, so hydration is pretty important. nan
