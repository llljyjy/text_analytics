This product is EVERYTHING I wanted the Lip Sleeping Mask to be! It is super glossy and pearlescent on the lips which I could not achieve with the other Laneige lip treatments. It effectively hydrates my lips and feels pleasant and cushiony. It is not thick or sticky at all but there is a very slight cooling sensation. I wouldn’t call this “plumping“ but it does help with the overall smoothness and appearance of your lips since it is so hydrating. The best part is the built-in applicator which is a rubber doe-foot. All products that come with little spatulas should come like this because there is no use in a loose applicator. I have tried a lot of lip treatments and this one is my favorite so far - I can’t say enough good things about it. Get This One Instead!
