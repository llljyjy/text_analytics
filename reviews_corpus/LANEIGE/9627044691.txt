Reallllly enjoy this product smells good. It’s a great skin prep for make up. Helps my dry patches on my face alottt. I have a travel size that I use this one to constantly refill. Only reason this gets a 4 because of price point. However it’s more like a 4.5 because you do get a lot of product. here we go again.
