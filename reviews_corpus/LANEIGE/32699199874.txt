I’ve been addicted to chapstick since I was a young teen, meaning if I leave home without chapstick and I’m going to be gone for more than a few hours, my lips will be so dry and I will be miserable. I have to keep chapstick in many rooms in my house, as well as in my car and all of my purses, so that I don’t ever go without it on accident. This lip sleeping mask isn’t meant to be used as chapstick and I understand that. When I first started using it, I used it as intended. However, I just really grew to love it and, slowly iver time, I began choosing this over my Burt’s Bee’s chapstick that had been my favorite and only kind I would use. Originally, I bought this mask in a kit, so it was a smaller container. The full size container is too big for me to carry around and I don’t want to contaminate it. So what I did was I kept the small container and cleaned it and then I added some from the big to the small. Any time I need to add more to the small container, I clean it/sanitize it beforehand and do my best to avoid contaminating the big container (especially since it’s going to lay me a really long time!). My new favorite “chapstick”
