Honestly, I expected much better results especially for the price. I have been applying this mask regularly right before going to sleep every night for over a month now. I wake up with a little residue (which is totally ok, it seems to absorb in or rub off on my pillow), and then I go on with my usual morning routine and my lips are dry all over again. I have also noticed a more significant amount of breakouts around my mouth area. I will personally stick with my tried and true Aquaphor for actual results for a much better price. I see this product as a fun little gimick to do here and there, and not an actual staple in my skincare routine. Could be better
