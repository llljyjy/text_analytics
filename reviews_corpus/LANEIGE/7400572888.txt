By far my favorite sunscreen! I have medium/tan combo skin with olive undertones and this disappears beautifully following cleansing and toning with zero white cast. At times I forget to moisturize on top of it and nothing slides off of it all day. Even with moisturizer it does not make my face oily, which is a godsend. Many users have commented on the scent but quite honestly, I think it smells fresh and quite lovely and not at all like the typical sunscreen smell. The scent disappears within a few minutes for better or for worse, though. Couldnâ€™t recommend enough! My favorite sunscreen!
