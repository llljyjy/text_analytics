I love the Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer. This rich cream has a thick texture that blends into my skin. Gives my skin a deep hydration that lasts for hours. It has a clean scent that doesn’t irritate my dry sensitive skin. I’m very happy with this moisturizer and the hydrating end results. Received complimentary from Laneige. nan
