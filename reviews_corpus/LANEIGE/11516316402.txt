I got this #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox and have been using it for the past week. There is an endless list as to why this product is so good! The re-branding of this product is eye-catching and adds a feeling of luxury. The fragrance used in this product is not as overwhelming compared to their previous generation ‘Water Bank’ line-up (would recommend it to those who are sensitive to smell). Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a simple yet effective serum. And if you can, do buy the Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer with this serum! This Serum along with the Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer is a match made in heaven! I mainly use the two products together at night because of their cooling effects (will be great to use in the summertime). This serum is lightweight and doesn’t feel tacky on the skin. After applying, my skin feels moisturized and has a light glow. nan
