If youâ€™re looking for an alternative to the dr jart tiger balm because it irritated your skin, this is perfect! Brown girl, combo skin, oily t zone with sensitivity. This is great! I also use the sleeping mask, mostly during the winter. I switch to this one during the summer (east coast humidity & skin change). A little goes a long way dr jart alternative
