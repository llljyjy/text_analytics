I’ve always been a big fan of laneige products! I was thrilled when I received this for free from topbox circle to try in exchange for my review. I love this water sleeping mask as it’s very lightweight and non greasy. The smell is amazing and I love the gel/cream like formula. I use this during night after my face cream and it has improved my skins hydration. My skin is less dry and my complexion has improved from using this product. Overall, this is a great alternative to sheet or wash off masks. #freeproduct nan
