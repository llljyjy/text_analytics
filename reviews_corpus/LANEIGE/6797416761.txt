I was given the Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Eye Cream to try for free in exchange for my honest opinion and I have really enjoyed using it! I use it both day and night and found that it has really helped decrease the puffiness under my eyes… especially in the morning! When I use it at night I find I look much less tired in the morning and way more refreshed. When I apply it in the morning before my makeup I find that it helps moisturize my under eye area also making me look more youthful, radiant and awake! The product is simple to apply and I’m delighted that a little bit goes such a long way. The .8fl oz container will last a LONG time because such a small amount is needed to cover both eyes. It absorbs into the skin quickly and is easy to spread. I love the addition of the Hyaluronic Acid as it’s one of my favourite skin care additives. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a way to decrease under eye puffiness while achieving a bright and radiant glow! Incredible Eye Cream!
