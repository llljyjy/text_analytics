I am 47 with dry skin and I love sleeping in this mask. Itâ€™s so cool going on and works beautifully throughout the night. I am an esthetician, and this is very similar to a gellee mask. I wash my face in the morning as usual and apply my normal serums. This leaves the skin so hydrated and bright. Great Sleeping Mask
