I really love this product! I use it all day long as well as at night. I love the smell of this it’s not too strong it’s just right. It’s very moisturizing for my lips it’s also not sticky or tacky like other products i’ve tried in the past. the only downside to this is the applicator i wish it was like the tacha moisturizer where you can store it on the lid instead of in a pouch. but overall i love this product i will be purchasing again!! nan
