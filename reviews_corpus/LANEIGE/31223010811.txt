I received this Laneige Hyaluronic Serum #freeproduct  #trywithtopbox in exchange for my review.First of all, I have been using it with the same cream for almost three weeks so far.  The product is a lightweight whitish serum with a nice mild scent.Next, the serum absorbs by the skin quickly, leaving it soft and very hydrated. I believe that both the firmness and elasticity of my skin have greatly improved.  Nowadays, even without makeup my skin looks radiant and healthy. In addition, the serum has not provoked any irritation or pimples. All individuals with the sensitive skin will understand me. That is why I will recommend this hydrating serum. Wonderful serum
