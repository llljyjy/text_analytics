I have combination dry/oily skin and this gel moisturizer works great for me! Lightweight, super hydrating, no need to add anything else during the day. It takes a while to fully absorb (leaves my skin a bit sticky), but my skin is super smooth and soft without breaking out! The container is very cute too. The foil lid was a bit of a nail breaker to remove, and I’m not a huge fan of the little beads in the gel (kind of feels like I’m applying a facial scrub at first), but they melt quickly. I received the product complimentary from Laneige. nan
