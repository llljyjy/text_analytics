super cute packaging (great size for travel), lovely applicator (reminds me of La Senza and Vic Secret glosses) and silky smooth formula (similar to Glossier’s Balm Dot Com AFTER it settles) but its nothing I haven’t tried before! Given the $20 price point I wanted this product to be the creme de la creme, I wanted it to be life-changing... but... in all honesty guys this balm is nothing crazy. def hydrating and def more than just vaseline like some pricier balms on the market right now but don’t fall for all the hype surrounding Laneige and this product. Your money is going into cute packaging and sweet scent, not a never-seen-before formula. not really any difference between colours either. nice overall tho! I like that it goes on smooth and doesn’t take a min to warm up/settle on your lips. if I could 50% recommend I would, if you’re getting this product for free/as a gift I 100% recommend but if payment is coming from your own pocket I’d skip out! $20 is lowkey a lot for a balm/gloss! great balm, nothing special (esp given the price)
