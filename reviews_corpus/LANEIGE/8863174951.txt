I am writing this review as someone who has NOT tried the old formula. I think it goes without saying that reformulations can be beyond disappointing for those who loved a product exactly as it was (I relate with different products). However, I can only review this as a stand-alone.I like the packaging in some ways, but I agree with those who are disappointed (especially in that this was apparently formerly in glass packaging). While the aesthetic of this current packaging is appealing, I really think it would be best for Laneige to at LEAST figure out how to make this a refillable system. We need less plastic for the sake of this planet!As for the cream, I like the texture. It’s that unique light/spreadable consistency that still feels quite hydrating. Lovely under makeup and/or sunscreen as it sinks into skin rapidly, but leaves it feeling nourished and soft. Laneige is highlighting their own form of hyaluronic acid (looks the same on the INCI) which is interesting but hard to speak of long term results. In the short term, I do feel this gives a plumping result on my skin.The smell is a little strong to my nose, but perhaps that is because I’m used to fragrance-free skincare products, and this contains fragrance.Overall, I’d give it 4 stars in comparison to other options at Sephora. The texture is actually really nice IMO, but the scent and packaging lose it some points. nan
