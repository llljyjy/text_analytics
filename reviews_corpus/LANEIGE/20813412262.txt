I have other Laniege products and I’ve been satisfied. Love their lip masks. Night cream’s. Day cream’s. I got to try this #freeproduct thanks to #tryitfreewithtopbox. I find this cream hydrating and I like the smell. Great for these cold winter days. My favourite to use it is at night. So when I wake up, my skin is glowing and fresh. Great for dry winter skin
