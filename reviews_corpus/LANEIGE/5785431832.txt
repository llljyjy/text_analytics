I bought this with my own money since I didn’t trust the reviews when they got this product for free. There was no white cast which was great but it’s definitely strongly scented. Overall it felt heavy on my skin so I didn’t enjoy that. You could still feel product on your face even after it settled down. It’s not the most sophisticated texture so I’ll be returning. feels heavy
