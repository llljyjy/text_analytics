Laniege hits the spot once again, and as a proud user of many different Laniege products (lip sleeping mask, Radiant Vitamin C Cream, Sleeping Mask) this is now one of my favorites! Not only is the packaging super unique and aesthetic, the product itself is immaculate. I have combo to oily skin and I feel like this lightweight, gel cream is perfect for hydration and smoothing. My skin instantly absorbed this cream, and felt so smooth and glowy. I was gifted by Laniege this cream, but I can say it is absolutely worth every penny!!! Laniege does it againâ€¦ RUN DONT WALK
