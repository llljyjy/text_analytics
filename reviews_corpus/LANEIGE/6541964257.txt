I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review and I’m sooo happy I chose this mask! I know it’s for sleeping, but it’s so hydrating and I’ve been using it during the day as well! It is lightweight and makes my skin feel so soft! I even purchased the lip mask and the duo is unmatched! Perfect for your winter routine! So hydrating!
