Read some reviews saying that the different “colors“ weren’t as effective than the original but thought that it couldn’t be THAT different and purchased the Sweet Candy one anyways.... It’s garbage. I have been using it for months and even when I cake the product on my lips and sleep for 12 hours, my lips look just as bad the next morning. Only way this product does anything for my lips is if I use it every night without breaks and even then the difference is minimal. I purchased the full size after using sample sizes of the original on and off for years and finding it to be the only thing able to rescue my lips overnight. If I ever purchase this product again, no matter how tempting the fun scents are, I will buy the original.TLDR: stick to the original! NOT all created equally!
