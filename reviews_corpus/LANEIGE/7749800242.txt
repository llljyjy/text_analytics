I ran out of this for like a week and I was suffering. I have rosacea so I am super sensitive to a lot of things that I put on my skin and this is something that 100% helps the sensitivity. After I cleanse itâ€™s what brings my skin back to normal and it just feels amazing and I swear immediately makes my skin look so soft. I will always repurchase this I can't live without this product
