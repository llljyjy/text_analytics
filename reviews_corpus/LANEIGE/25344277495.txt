I have had dry cracking bleeding lips most of my life. If you were to name a lip balm or mask I have probably tried it and nothing has really worked. Well I got this in the birthday gift box (December, so it was the only one left) and was expecting it to be much the same and the standard price was just outrageous in my opinion. But three weeks since I’ve started using it and no splits, cracks, or bleeding! Even with a major temperature drop. Despite my self, I will probably be buying a full sized pot once I’m through the mini. I hate that I love this so much.
