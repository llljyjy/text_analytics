i really do like this product i love the outcome after applying but i don’t really see an ACTUAL difference in my lips. when i apply this it moisturizes for about a half hour and they feel dry again. i was looking for something that’ll actually attempt to transform my lips but i’ll still continue to use this. i like it as a gloss too! cute!
