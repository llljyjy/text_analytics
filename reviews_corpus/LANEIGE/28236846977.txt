Does not feel sticky at all on the lips (hair will still get stuck though in the wind, as it happens with every glossy lip product), and the scent is amazing! Exactly like grapefruit, itâ€™s very pleasant to put on the lips. Leaves a glossy shine, and it almost feels the slightest bit tingly as well, making it feel even nicer. I definitely recommend this flavour or the gummy bear flavour, which is a lot sweeter and candy scented. Definitely give it a try!
