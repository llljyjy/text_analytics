Loved this sunscreen!! I have quite oily skin and I live on a tropical island in the Caribbean, which is extremely humid and extremely sunny. As I write this, the humidity is at 70% and the UV index is at 10. This sunscreen absorbed super quickly into my skin, left no white cast. Has a faint floral scent when first applied but quickly goes away. It does leave a slight sunscreen scent for a little bit, but goes away. I was apprehensive because of my oily skin but my skin felt perfect and non-greasy all day. Canâ€™t recommend enough! Loved this sunscreen and I have oily skin!
