I didn’t purchase this for 3 months because of the reviews saying it was nothing more than glorified Vaseline. However, I kept seeing it pop up and finally took a look at it when I happened to be in the store. There was a sale on the product and it cost about the same price as a tube of Vaseline on Amazon. I use Vaseline so if it did turn out to be a bust I wouldn’t really be out a lot of money. Well, Vaseline this is not. Not even close. It doesn’t feel like Vaseline. This is much more luxurious. And bonus, it doesn’t taste like poison. I put a nice layer on my lips before bed and my lips are moisturized in the morning. It is also giving my lips a pretty pigment. I didn’t even realize I needed a lip mask until I started using this. My lips get very chapped especially in the winter and this soothes and keeps them nicely hydrated. Luxurious Lips
