Drying for my sensitive, combo skin. I like a bit of a stronger cleanse in the summer months, but this was surprisingly a bit too drying for me still (skin felt taut after wash). I even purchased the matching hyaluronic acid toner but skin needed quite a bit of moisturizing to even feel comfortable. Definitely disappointing as I was really excited to add this to my rotation for the summer. 2 stars only because the packaging and scent is right up my alley. Ehh.
