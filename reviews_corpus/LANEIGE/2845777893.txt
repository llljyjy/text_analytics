I use it only when my face has redness, and it really helps. As I’m oily skin, I apply it only on my problematic areas, because it’s really hydrating. For exemple, I apply it on my cheeks but on my forehead I apply my regular cream. I wouldn’t put it under makeup, it’s really for my night routine. Help reduce redness
