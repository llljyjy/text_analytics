This is very gentle. Not irritating, and good for either summer or winter. It leaves my skin feeling wonderfully plump and moisturized. It’s not a miracle worker by any means, but it is a solid product and I use it regularly. It’s not going to magically clear your acne, but it does make my dry patches far more comfortable and shorter in duration paired with my FAB Ultra Repair Cream. One star off because it kind of smells like rice water/milky rice(?) to me? Idk. It’s not a strong smell, and goes away once applied but it’s there, and it’s odd. nan
