I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and I’ve been using it for 1 week and am very impressed! It’s a very easy product to incorporate to your skincare routine. Simply after a good face cleansing routine, prep you skin with LANEIGE Radian-C Brightening Treatment Essence using a cotton pad. This product is water like consistency and very easy to apply. Continue using this product twice daily (morning and afternoon skincare routine) and you will have an awesome result in a week. RADIANCE IN ONE WEEK!
