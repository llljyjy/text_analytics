I’m a huge Laneige fan, so I was curious to try this upon hearing one of my favorite moisturizers being revamped. Luckily, I received this product complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest review. I’m always nervous about reformulations of products I love, but Laneige did not disappoint! It’s packed with hydration that keeps my skin hydrated all day long. While the formula is thick, it absorbs quickly and doesn’t feel heavy on the skin. Instantly I noticed my skin was hydrated and plump. It also provides a luminous finish without being greasy. Laneige Water Bank Cream Moisturizer
