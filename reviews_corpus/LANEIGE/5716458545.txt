“Complimentary from Laneige“ I’m a huge fan of gel moisturizers and was so  excited to be able to try this Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel moisturizer. The first time I put it on I instantly loved the white almost mircrobeads in the gel, and how they melted in my skin so fast! The gel it’s self has a very light scent, and felt like aloe Vera when applied minus the sticky feeling. It left my skin feeling very moisturized which was amazing. The next day and every day since I’ve used it I keep breaking out! I know normally things make you break out on the first few uses but it’s been two weeks now! It should have been okay by now, but it’s not and I can’t keep using it! It really saddens me it just wasn’t for my skin, after the build up of so many great reviews. Won’t be using again. Not for me
