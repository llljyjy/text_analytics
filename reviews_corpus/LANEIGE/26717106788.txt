I have very dry, cracked lips that get worse in the winter. This and the OG overnight mask are the only things that heal them. I will use these for ever and ever! You won’t be disappointed. The only critique I have is if you’re supposed to smell peach, you can’t but  other then that this product is PERFECTION!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!
