This product truly deserves to be rated 5 out of 5. First of all, you DO NOT need to apply much, so this mask WILL LAST! It smells so good and it feels very soft. I usually apply it once before going to bed, and most of the time it’s still on my lips the next morning. It’s very hydrating and it gives the same shine a lip gloss would. I love it so much that I plan on buying the Vanilla one very soon! This way I’ll apply one in the morning and the other one at night! HOLY GRAIL!
