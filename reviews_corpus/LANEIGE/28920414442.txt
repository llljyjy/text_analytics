I received this water sleeping mask for free from Topbox.My skin is combination type.But during winters it gets more dried up.I started using this mask and I feel its amazing and doesnâ€™t dry up your skin.It has a small spatula/spoon too.I use it 5 times a week as a mask in the night after applying moisturiser.My skin is well hydrated with it.Also it has Squalene which is a hydrating agent.And yes I cannot describe how much I love the scent and Its definitely a must try product #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Totally Recommend
