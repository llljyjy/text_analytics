I have pretty severe eczema/dry skin so I’ve been looking for a lip product with far more intense hydration than regular lip balm. While I don’t think this product is anymore hydrating than Vaseline or Cerave healing ointment (best product I’ve found for chapped lips) it has helped with the appearance of fine lines and faded hyperpigmentation on my lips. I still have to use another lip product during the day, but adding this into my skincare routine has definitely made the appearance of my lips a lot more plump and even toned! Great for fine lines and hyperpigmentation
