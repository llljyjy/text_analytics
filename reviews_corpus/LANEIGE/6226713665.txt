Got a sample of this and quite enjoyed using it. It’s very slick and a little goes a long way, I didn’t feel the need to use much to cover my face. The texture is nice and smooth and it made my skin feel very nice. Removed 2 stars cause of the fragrance. It is HEAVILY fragrance and smells like I’m rubbing perfume on my face. If it wasn’t so fragranced, I’d give it 5 stars. Didn’t break my out either. Great cream but heavily scented
