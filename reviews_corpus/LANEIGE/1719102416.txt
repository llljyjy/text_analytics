I recieved this product for free from TopBox Circle for my honest review. I love the packaging, itâ€™s actually one of my favorite colors! I have been using this product for the past three weeks and have noticed a significant change in how hydrated my face felt. The serum went on smooth, and my face felt smooth instead of greasy or oily. This product is incredibly great for dry skin. The scent of the serum is light and not overpowering. This is one of the best serums I have used to date. Highly recommend! Fantastic Serum!
