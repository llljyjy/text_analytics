This stuff is amazing. I usually donâ€™t see much results from face masks, but this one always blows me away at how great my skin looks the next day. I use it in place of moisturizer once a week or whenever my skin needs it. I use tretinoin and have acne prone skin. This calms my skin, makes my skin glowy, makes my acne less red and helps my acne start to heal overnight. The sample size has lasted me several months! nan
