If you have dry lips, look no further. I have always had naturally dry lips. On top of that, I sleep with a cpap which dries my lips out even more. I started using this mask and BAM! My lips are as smooth as ever. All the flakey mess I had on my lips is no longer. I had tried everything to get my lips to feel this way for years. The bottle is a good size for the amount you use. It also comes with a tiny applicator. The texture it’s very tacky, it’s thick so the more you layer it on, the thicker it is, but it’s not uncomfortable. I’ve put this on every night when I get out of the shower and it’s made a huge difference. I highly recommend this mask. My lips have never felt better
