The formula feels nice but it does nothing. I always still have to use another makeup remover and wash my face after so this is just an additional step that doesn’t have a benefit. I barely wear any makeup (concealer and mascara only most days) so it’s disappointing that this couldn’t remove it. Sad I wasted my money on this :( Save your money and skip this one
