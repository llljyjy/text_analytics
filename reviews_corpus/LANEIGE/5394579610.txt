This was my first time using this product, so I started off carefully following the included instructions. On week 1 I applied it as a spot treatment on every other night. Then on week 2 I did the same but every night instead. I have just started week 3 and decided to do a thin layer over my face, since I did not notice any skin irritations, and feel that it is safe for me to do so. So far, I really do feel there is a noticeable difference especially with evening out the dark spots I have been targeting.  It has a light, non-greasy texture but, still provides a nice hydration. It has a pleasantly fresh scent, that does not linger once applied. Overall, I think itâ€™s a great product and look forward to continuing to use it! Awesome retinol product!
