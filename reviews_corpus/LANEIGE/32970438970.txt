I was skeptical buying this toner since the first aid beauty oat toner has better ingredients, as well as cheaper and you get more product. But there was so much hype so I ended up buying it, it works really well and I absolutely love it, I will continue to try new toners but Iâ€™ll keep coming back to this one worth the hype
