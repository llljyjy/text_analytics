I got this as a sample so I decided to try it in place of my other HA that I use in my AM routine. Never felt like it sank in, just sat on my skin. Within hours, my combo skin was extremely oily looking. I will go back to my tried and true TO HA serum! (I gave it 2 stars because it smelled nice) Not for me
