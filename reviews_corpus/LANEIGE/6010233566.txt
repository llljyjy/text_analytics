I was sent this product from Topbox for my honest opinion.  I had never heard of Laneige, so I was happy to give it a try.  This eye cream contains hyaluronic acid and niacinamide, and doesnâ€™t contain sulfates SLS AND SLES.  It feels very silky when you apply it and you can tell that it really moisturizes the delicate under eye area.  I love it! #trywithtopbox Very Silky Feeling
