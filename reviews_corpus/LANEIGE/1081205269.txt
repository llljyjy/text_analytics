This is a wonderfully moisturizing toner. While it has moisturizer in the title, this is not moisturizing enough on its own for my dry skin. I still follow it up with a serum and cream moisturizer. It has the consistency of water/normal toners, so I like to pour a little in the cup of my hand and just use my fingers to apply on my face. I tried using a cotton ball but the cotton just absorbed it all. While this has helped keep my skin hydrated, I havenâ€™t noticed anything spectacular otherwise which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I still really like it though and will continue to buy. nan
