I donâ€™t see the hype with this product? I have used it nightly and it was fine but honestly no different then using petroleum jelly on my lips. BUT for a week a had a really bad cold which caused my lips to be really really dry! I used this product like crazy thinking it would do wonders based on all the great reviews...Nope! It did nothing to improve my lips! Based off that experience I would not recommend nor would I buy this product again. Doesn't do much to improve dry lips
