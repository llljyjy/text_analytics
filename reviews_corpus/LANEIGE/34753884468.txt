I received this as a #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox. This product has a gentle smell to it, and applies well. If I applied it at night, I woke up with fresh, clear skin in the mornings. If I used it as a moisturizer after a shower as a friend suggested worked well for her, I broke out with a bit of acne. Overall itâ€™s a nice product, and I would probably buy it again. It's nice.
