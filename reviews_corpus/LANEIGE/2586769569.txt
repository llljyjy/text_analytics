This is a great lip balm with an awesome array of scents no doubt. But the price is a little much for how often you have to apply it. I use chapstick and lip balm A LOT. If you apply often like I do, I would go with a regular lip balm and save yourself the cost in lieu of not having fun scents. Goes too fast for me.
