I wanted to knock off one star, because I can’t knock off half a star, but decided against it because the product itself is one of the best of tried. It’s a large pot and I know it will last a long time. Worth the price for that. The consistency is perfect. There’s many balms out there but some are too thin when you apply it. I want it to be thick! It’s thick but super sticky, feels very creamy. I heard the hype and decided to try it and it came through. Now…the complaint, which for some may be a plus, or no biggie…it doesn’t taste or smell like vanilla. I want to try another flavor to see if it’s just this particular flavor that’s weak, but I saw a review for the berry one and the lady said the taste and smell were very faint. I was expecting this yummy flavor and was so disappointed. Overall, great product! If you are ok with the faint flavor and taste, even more so. Great product, can’t taste or smell it though
