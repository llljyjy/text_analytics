I use this Essance after I wash my face like toner and over the past few weeks I’ve noticed my dark spots fading and my face started looking brighter. I won’t like though, I’m not a big fan of the fact that this product has fragrance listed in its ingredients (as a personal preference I stay away from products with fragrance) but it has helped my skin so for those who don’t care too much about fragrance in their products, I recommend. Buy it! (If you don’t care about fragrance)
