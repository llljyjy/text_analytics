I purchased this product.  I believe many of the 5 star reviews were incentivized.   I want to give an honest opinion from a buyer.  This product is just eh.  I love other Laneige products but this is not impressive.  With so many moisturizer options, this is a pass for me.  I will continue to use it until it is gone as I have no adverse reactions.  The moisturizing properties are the same as drug store products.  The cream does absorb well but there is no real lasting effect.  This is certainly a better day cream but even under makeup it simply doesn’t do much.   I’d pass on this. Actual buyer here - don’t make my mistake
