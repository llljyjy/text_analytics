I’ve been using Laneige’s products for years and nothing seems to compare to them. Attempted to use this new formula and it DOES NOT COMPARE TO THE ORIGINAL!! It goes on rather greasy instead of feeling moisturized. Needless to say I’m incredibly disappointed. Message to the brand: if it ain’t broke don’t fix it New Formula Disappointment
