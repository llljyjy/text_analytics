I have  received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox. At first glance, I was very impressed with the packaging!  Using this serum along with the water bank blue hyaluronic cream moisturizer for more than 2 weeks, I have noticed that my skin feels and looks healthy and hydrated. The serum has a lovely scent. Itâ€™s not sticky and does not irritate my usually sensitive skin. I found it works great in duo with the water bank blue hyaluronic cream moisturizer. Great Serum!
