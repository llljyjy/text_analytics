If you’re on the fence about buying this - just do it ! Firstly - it’s GIANT. It’s perfect for everyday, and even better at night with a thicker application. The vanilla smells amazing, and the scent is pretty subtle. I’ve heard a lot of people rave about this and I had to see for myself. No regrets! nan
