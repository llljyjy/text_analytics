I am sad because I really wanted to love this moisturizer after reading all the good reviews! The moisturizer was ok, but unfortunately the scent was too much for me. It smells like paint in my opinion I had to wash it off right away because it was giving me a headache. If you’re not sensitive to smells it’ll probably work great for you! Strong scent
