Complimentary from Laneige. This gel moisturizer is so very cooling and hydrating. I have combination skin and this works really well for me. It’s fast absorbing and doesn’t make me look oily. What I experience is hydrated and dewy skin. The packaging does not allow me to close the lid easily although it is super cute. nan
