This is by far the best glossy lip product i’ve ever used!!! It’s not sticky whatsoever unlike all my other lip products (even though this isn’t a gloss). It has the most beautiful slight tint to it and i love the way it fills in the crevices in my lips and makes them look so smooth and shiny. The only reason i didn’t give 5 stars is because it doesn’t last the longest but it leaves my lips nice and hydrated. Favourite lip product by far
