My skin is combination, a little bit sensitive sometime. After using this product for almost 3 weeks, I think it is a pretty good Vitamin C product. It is not sticky, which I like a lot. I use the Vitamin C Essence in the morning, and used Vitamin A serum in the night, they are working pretty good together. Love it!
