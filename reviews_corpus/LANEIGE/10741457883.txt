I really really enjoyed this cream! I had received a sample of it a while back as a birthday gift and never used it. I just now got around to using it and definitely regret not using it sooner! I have very dry skin and find that using this as a moisturizer before makeup or my nighttime skincare routine really does wonders. I find that it soothes my skin and makes it feel soft and glowy so I definitely recommend. I know technically itâ€™s a mask but I do have dry skin and the gel texture feels so good! Wears really well under makeup as well I have pretty large pores and some texture and I actually see that it does a good job of smoothing and hydrating before makeup! amazing!!
