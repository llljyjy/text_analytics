I got a sample of this, and I just bought the full size because it is amazing! I have oily skin normally, but I am not sure if it is the winter weather, a new face wash that I tried, or a combo of these that had made my face so dry. My face was so dry that when I smiled, I literally felt my skin crack! I tried other moisturizers and face oils and nothing worked, until I tried this. My face instantly felt hydrated and that cracking feeling went away, also woke up with soft skin. Highly recommend especially for the winter months! Amazing!
