love this!! it’s very moisturizing and hasn’t caused any breakouts. i haven’t had a toner like this before and i’m glad i bought it randomly. the only thing i don’t like is the packaging. i feel like the hole is smallso i moved it into a spray bottle to mist my face and to spray onto a cotton pad. worth it
