First off, this retinol is great because they actually specify how much to use and how long to use it the first few weeks which is great! I followed the instructions and so far after three weeks I’ve actually seen results! It’s not really scented, it hasn’t broken me out or caused redness either. I strongly recommend this to anyone who is new to retinol and struggles with finding a formula that isn’t too intense. I’m now using this every night and love my outcome! Awesome results!
