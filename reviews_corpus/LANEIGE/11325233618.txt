I’m so thankful for the opportunity to try this amazing essence. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, and very pleased with the results. My face feels and looks hydrated, healthier with a natural glow to it. I love the light citrus scent. It comes into a beautiful glass bottle, with a pump which makes it really easy to use. It has a watery consistency, so I personally find it easier to apply it on a cotton pad and gently pat it on my face. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Beautiful results, gentle on sensitive skin
