A very basic lip balm. Performs exactly as you’d expect a lip balm to. Just know that it is sticky and it is very drying and dehydrating. However it looks great on the lips - nice and juicy! I got gummy bear (purple) and there is not much of a tint which I like and it does have a light scent that smells pretty good.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn’t find it the least bit moisturizing and actually really dried my lips out. If you’re looking to spend a bit of extra money for a very ordinary lip balm then this one is a nice one to try, just don’t expect it to be any better than any other lip balm out there. Basic, Nothing Special
