I have dry skin with occasional redness and acne flare ups. I use benzaclin (clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide) and tretinoin .05% at night, which contributes to the dryness.This mask helps me with redness and irritation, and I use it whenever my skin seems stressed (eg, after a long flight, or after dermaplaning). It is hydrating, although not the MOST hydrating mask ever - I probably would not rely on it as a primary treatment for dryness. nan
