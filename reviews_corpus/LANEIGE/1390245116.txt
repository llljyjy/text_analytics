I used this product for a while, I love the product  it’s a staple in my routine. I notice my skin feels more moisturized when I use versus when I don’t. my gripe with this is the packaging is terrible. there’s an indicator on the side to tell you when you need to refill but it doesn’t work at all. one day it will be empty with no warning. nan
