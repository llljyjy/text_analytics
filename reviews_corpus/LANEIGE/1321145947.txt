Absolutely brilliant eye moisturizer. I use it day and night and have basically thrown away my $300 eye creams and replaced them with this. It is a great mask for night, absorbs overnight into the skin and my eyes are still hydrated by morning which helps reduce fine lines that get worse when you sleep. It works great under concealer and lasts most of the day. I have dry skin around my eyes so believe me when I say that this one actually works at hydrating. The lip mask from Laneige is also amazing and is what motivated me to try this eye cream from them as well. Excellent moisturizer for the eyes!
