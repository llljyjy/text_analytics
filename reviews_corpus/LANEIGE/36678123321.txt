The texture of this cream is somewhere in between a gel and a cream texture. It’s not too oily, so it’s perfect for if you have oily/combo skin and are looking for that. I did find this gave my skin a glow, but I stopped using it in the middle of the pot to try a different moisturizer so maybe I didn’t use it long enough for it to fade acne scars. But, overall, I like my creams rich with some oils in them, so that’s why I’m giving this 4 stars. It’s just not rich and thick enough It gave my skin a glow, but wasn't rich enough
