I received this as a birthday gift, and I must say, this lip balm has become such a staple in my skincare routine that I must write a review for it. When used in conjunction with the sleeping mask, my lips feel so amazingly moisturized and supple. The berry-flavored formula feels thick in order to seal moisture yet lightweight and nonsticky, which makes application comfortable. Emphasizing the berry flavor, it’s so delicious and pairs well with the berry lip sleeping mask! Overall, Laneige did not disappoint me.And, I understand the packaging is small and a little unjustifiable for the price, but if you’re looking to splurge on a lip balm, this is it. So soothing and has a great scent!
