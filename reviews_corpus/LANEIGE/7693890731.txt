The LANEIGE Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Serum is super hydrating and light. I noticed my skin immediately soaked in the product which for me that is a win! I put it on after my essence and it works perfectly. The only thing I wasnâ€™t too fond of was the scent. It has sort of an old smell but it did not break me out. The packaging is so innovative, twist to dispense product and never lose a top again! This was gifted by LANEIGE. Hydration overload
