I’ve had this mask for a few months now but I’ve only recently discovered its real use. During spring summer I would only use this once or twice a week. But the recent weather change had my skin irritated, red, dry, itchy and flaky. I started using this everyday and my skin especially around my neck started calming down. I’m so glad having this on hand when my skin needed it. God send for dry, sensitive skin during winter!
