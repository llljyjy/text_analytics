[Gifted by Laneige] When I saw the color of this packaging, I was absolutely smitten. This moisturizer is so unique. It doesn’t have the scent of most of Laneige’s other products, rather it was unscented (at least to me) which was nice. The beads are so fun and the moisturizer is like a burst of water on the face. For my oily skin, it works well, but it probably wouldn’t be enough for drier skin types. However, I am really enjoying this moisturizer! nan
