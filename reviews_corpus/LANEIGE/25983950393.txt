A fellow Sephora employee recommended this to me and I absolutely love this sunscreen. I have acne prone/slightly dry skin (especially the chin area) and this sunscreen feels amazing on my skin. It’s hydrating (not greasy) and leaves absolutely no white cast. I’m in my late 30’s and now I’m recommending to all my friends! My fave sunscreen!
