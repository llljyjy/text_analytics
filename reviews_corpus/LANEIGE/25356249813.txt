This lip balm smells absolutely amazing and provided a great tint and gloss on my lips without being sticky. It did exactly what you would expect, until you notice over time that it’s the reason your lips are dry.  I 100% would not recommend it if you’re seeking something to bring moisture back to your lips, but does everything else perfectly. Don't let the scent throw you off
