I just bought this during the sale and I had a severe allergic reaction from it. About 2 hours after using it at night while I was trying to sleep my throat started to close up, I was stuffy, and my eye itched. Luckily I had an inhaler or I don’t know what would’ve happened. I took Benadryl and that helped. I tried the moisturizer again the next day to make sure I knew what product caused the allergic reaction and once again I got sick. It sucks cause I’ve heard great things about it and it smells soooo good. Worth a try but be careful, I have no idea what caused the reaction in the product. extreme allergic reaction
