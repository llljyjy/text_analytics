Seems overpriced so I bought on discount and I was actually sort of blown away.  I love the flavor and texture.  It actually lasts on my lips and moisturizes.  It’s cute and overall makes me happy.  I like the packaging a lot and I prefer this over pots or wands.  I like it enough I’d buy the gummy bear one at full price but not the other flavor I got (pink berry one). I Would Pay Full Price
