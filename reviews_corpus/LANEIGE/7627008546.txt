I have to say this mask is better than the Water Sleeping Mask with Squalane. I feel like the mask stays more on my skin, but, it’s not enough for my dry skin in winter. I’ll use it as a night cream in summer :) The smell is neutral, like not bad but not good. Better than the Water Sleeping Mask with Squalane
