I received a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and i have been using it for the last few days regularly day and night. Product comes in a nice container,packaging is soooo cute I canâ€™t get over it. It comes with a spatula to apply it. feels great under the eyes. I need eye cream for rejuvenation in the eye area without irritating the area anymore. Blue hyaluronic acid-fermented with deep sea algae and a 10-step microfiltration process-immediately absorbs for intense,lasting hydration. I have dark circles around my eyes and they get puffy. I also wear under my makeup.I find it to be very effective for my puffy eyes and dark circles.I look like more fresh! Highly Recommend!
