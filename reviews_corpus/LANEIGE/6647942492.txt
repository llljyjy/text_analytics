You needed this lip balm yesterday! This product is on the thicker side, but is not overly sticky, which I love. It feels super smooth on, & a little but goes a long way. Has a beautiful natural tint, and always leaves my lips feeling super moisturized. 100% worth the cost. Iâ€™ll definitely be purchasing again. AMAZING!!
