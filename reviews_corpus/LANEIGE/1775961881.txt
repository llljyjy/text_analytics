This product was gifted by Laneige for reviewing purposes. Let’s start off by the packaging, I think it’s cute and different than other moisturizers on the market at the moment. I also like that it includes a little spatula for the product. Now let’s talk about the actual moisturizer it has a light scent that goes away after applying which I appreciate since I don’t like scents that linger. My skin is dry and this moisturizer is heavy in a comfortable hydrating way. If you have dry skin this is a moisturizer I’d definitely recommend. Comfortable and moisturizing
