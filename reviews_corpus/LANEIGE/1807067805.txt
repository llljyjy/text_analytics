How do I say I love this cream without sounding like a mad person? Well, it’s hard to contain because I try a lot of skincare and rarely do I ever like something enough to get a second one. I think I just might have to break that pattern with Laneige’s Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream. Contrary to its name, the cream itself is not actually blue (lol). BUT the packaging is so cute and aesthetically pleasing and although I usually don’t like the heavy fragrances in many skincare products, I really enjoy the scent of this one! It’s like a lightweight sweet scent that doesn’t linger. The cream itself feels very light on the skin and easy absorbs into the skin without leaving a residue. It works with all my other steps in my routine because it proudly boasts hyaluronic acid as its star ingredient which works with whatever I’m having problems with at the moment, whether it be breakouts or dry areas or even peeling from retinol use. This is a dependable staple that I can see myself using over and over again. I’ve been using it for a month now and I’m loving the moisturized feeling I get from it. My skin feels soft and supple even hours between washing my face and putting on skincare (it’s such a bad habit).  Gifted by laneige nan
