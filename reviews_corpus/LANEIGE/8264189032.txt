Woh dude. I’ve never used a toner before so I didn’t know what to expect. I’m very fair and blonde, I’m 29 and my skin is very sensitive. This toner was gliding on my face, it feels so soft and gentle. It feels like water practically but with a cooling affect. It also smells really good. I’m in love I’m so glad I took a chance on it nan
