I love the fragrance-free and super gentle soft feel of this cleanser, the formulation is great and it cleans my skin well as long as I use this as a *second cleanse* so beware this will likely not do much for your full face make up or daily sunscreen unless you use 4-6 pumps and rinse between each scrub. I use it in the mornings and as a second cleanse after an oil cleanse int he evenings and it works really well. A great ultra gentle cleanser
