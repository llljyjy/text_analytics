I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I’m obsessed. It’s a great consistency and left my skin felling really good the next morning . There isn’t a strong scent and it’s not too thick. It’s honestly perfect. I’ve only used a couple of Laneige’s products prior to getting this one but I’m glad I tried it. Will def get it again. it’s perfect
