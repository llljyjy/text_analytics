So I was using an aha serum that dried out my skin bad. I tried 3 other moisturizers to try to calm my skin down but every morning my skin was tight and flaky. I received this complimentary from laneige, and omg within 30 minutes of applying my skin felt 100 times better. I woke up to moisturized skin. It felt soft and plump and flakes and irritation was gone. Love love love this. Wow
