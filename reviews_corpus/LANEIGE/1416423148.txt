I first purchased this on a whim back in the fall of 2017 and 5 years later it’s still a staple in my beauty routine! I apply it every night before bed and sometimes during the day if I’m at home, and my lips are always super soft and smooth. I’ve tried almost all of the flavours and they all work equally well, but the original berry is my favourite flavour. Each container lasts a fairly long time as well, at least 6 months each. nan
