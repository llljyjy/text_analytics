The product itself seems to be working very well with my skin. It is very moisturizing and doesn’t feel too harsh. I do have some complaints though starting off with the scent. It smells awful, like very chemically. It doesn’t linger for very long, but it is a challenge to have it on my face while it’s drying. My second complaint is the jar. The opening of the jar is smaller that the widest part of the jar. So to use that last bits, you have to curl your fingers into the inside of the jar. Even with that, it’s very difficult to get all of it. Great, but with some complaints
