I saw immediate hydrating results with this essence that was gifted by Laneige. It absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves a lovely glow. There is no residue or tacky feeling left after applying, my skin feels smooth and hydrated. I like how thin the product is, it immediately skins into the skin and hydrates, which allows the rest of my skincare products to apply better. After a few days I saw a noticeable difference in how my skin tone looked, my dark acne spots were starting to fade and my skin appeared more even in tone. I really like this essence as it has worked very well and hasnâ€™t irritated my dry sensitive skin. I will definitely purchase this product once I run out! nan
