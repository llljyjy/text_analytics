I’ve been using this Lanegie Retinol firming cream treatment for a few weeks now & I’ve seen a dramatic improvement in my skin! Lanegie makes some of the best skin care products out there & this is no exception! I’ve noticed my fine lines have started to even out & become smooth, my skin feels more hydrated & the hydration lasts all day/night! The texture is so lightweight you don’t even know it’s there but it goes to work upon application! It absorbs so quickly too! I like that it doesn’t really have a fragrance & the packaging is easy to use! If you’re looking for something to help hydration, to help those fine lines & wrinkles & to keep you hydrated this is a great choice! Highly recommend this product! Great firming treatment!
