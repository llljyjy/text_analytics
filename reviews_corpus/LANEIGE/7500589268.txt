I am a lip balm collector, I have tried almost every lip balm at most beauty stores. This one just wasn’t worth the hype for me! If you have money to burn and are looking for an average lip balm with delicious scents, Laneige is for you. I have both the “Sweet Candy“ and the “Berry“ flavor. It hydrates initially and feels (and looks) great on the lips, but after a short while it dries out your lips. I’ve found much more superior lip balms for less money. Again, I will say this one does smell AMAZING, is a fun texture, and the little applicator is great as well. A solid lip balm, but not worth the hype or the price. Not worth the hype or the price. Smells delicious.
