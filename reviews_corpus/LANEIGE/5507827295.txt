This cream sort of retains moisture better than the previous formula, it’s ok, I don’t love it. BUT I do need to point out, after I apply it, if I massage my skin just briefly, it rubs off like eraser bits...and I’m positive it’s not dead skin lol.Does this happen to anyone else?! Hmmm now sure how I feel about this new formula
