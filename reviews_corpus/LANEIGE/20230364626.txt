This is a different formula. It is slightly more opaque, less blue in color and more hydrating. The scent is not the same. It performs wonderful! Great sealant for the last layer of your night routine. I loved the previous formula and had to make some slight adjustments because of the additional hydration, that is okay. Itâ€™s a great mask. The only reason I took off the star is because the scent is not as intoxicating as the previous water sleeping mask, without squalane I suppose. I LOVED the scent and it helped lure me to sleep. That is the only reason I took off a star. Fantastic sleep mask for a fantastic price. I have sensitive skin and rosacea. Recommend, hydrating and sealing.
