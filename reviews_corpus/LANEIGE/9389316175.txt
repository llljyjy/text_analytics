I was gifted by laneige and water bank blue hyaluronic gel moisturizer. It is quick absorbing moisturizer for super hydration which is very good of your definitely in a hurry to get out the door. It left my skin super soft and without any dry patch patches. I use this under my makeup and it doesn’t break it up and won’t leave a greasy look throughout the day if it was just used by itself nan
