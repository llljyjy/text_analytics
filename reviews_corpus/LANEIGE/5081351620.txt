I actually got the apple lime flavor, which isn’t shown here. Anyway...I’ve had dry lips my entire life (including as a kid) and am always on the lookout for products like this. I’m not sure why, but this lip mask leaves my lips flaky and even drier than before putting it on! Honestly, I have used the product for weeks at a time just to be sure this is truly happening, and every time I go back to my $7 rosebud salve lip tube, my lips instantly improve. So no, I cannot recommend this product at all. On the plus side, I love the scent and I love the consistency. It stays on my lips all night. These would be major bonuses if I didn’t feel it was sabotaging my lip care. Has the opposite effect as intended on my dry lips
