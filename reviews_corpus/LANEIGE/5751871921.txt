I have dry skin and live in a dry climate and thought this would provide a nice boost to my routine. On application it seemed to hydrate and felt very refreshing but definitely was not enough to moisturize my skin on it’s own, so I would layer a thicker moisturizer on top of this. Over time I noticed my skin was actually getting drier and drier. I also had been breaking out for a while and couldn’t figure out what was causing it until I stopped using this product and stopped seeing new acne flare ups. I tried using it on my décolletage and sure enough started breaking out there too. The heavy fragrance smells lovely but two of the fragrance ingredients (limonene and linalool) are known to oxidize on air exposure and become allergenic aka not compatible with the jar packaging, and those are just the ones they listed and not the fragrance ingredients hidden under “parfum.“ This just wasn’t compatible with my skin and so far every Laneige product I’ve tried I liked at first until I realized it was doing more harm than good. Not hydrating enough, caused major breakouts
