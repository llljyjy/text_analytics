This was gifted by Laneige in exchange for my honest opinion. I am super happy to have the opportunity to try this. I have just started to incorporate essence into my skin care and  this one is really nice. The texture is very thin like water so I just pump a little into my palm and pat it into my face. It has a nice citrus scent and leave my skin hydrated and fresh looking. I like that it absorbs nicely and does not leave behind a sticky feeling.  I use it under sunscreen. I heard vit C helps the potency of sunscreen. Lovely
