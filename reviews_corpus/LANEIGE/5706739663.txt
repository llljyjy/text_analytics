I wrote 3 stars for this one. It’s nice and hydrating for a couple of hours but then I realized towards the end of my day I always go back to my aquaphor. Personally, I suffer from dry lips & I wanted to like this product but to me, it’s not so effective. Nice packaging, and smells great but there’s other products cheaper on the market that works better than this one.. just saying. This product will last you a long time though. eh.. it’s okay…
