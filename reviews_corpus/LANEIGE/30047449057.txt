i love laneige products and decided to try this. the texture is smooth like aloe vera, and the formula is cooling and lightweight. it brings a lot of moisture to my skin, and always makes me have a glow without feeling greasy. i haven’t seen anything bad from this product, as i’ve recently been using it. pretty good!
