I was gifted by Laneige,  the product has nice packaging, quite bulky, and semi moisturizing. I have combination skin but more on the dry side, there are small beads that spread out into a smooth plump texture onto the skin. Immediately after my skin feels plump and a little sticky after a couple minutes after it’s soaked in I have to apply a second layer because it’s not the most moisturizing at night. However, in the morning before my makeup it’s perfect, I usually rinse my face with water and apply, let it dry, and put on my primer, because it Doesn’t leave a sticky feeling on the skin and soaks in immediately it’s perfect for primer.  Overall it’s a good daytime moisturizer, but if you have dryer skin perhaps look into a more hydrating product. Good daytime moisturizer
