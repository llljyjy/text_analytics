I received the Laneige Water Sleeping Mask as a #freeproduct from Topbox Circle in exchange for an honest review. I have added the water sleeping mask to my night time routine. It absorbs nicely in my skin and leaves my face feeling soft and hydrated. It does have a scent but it is very subtle and does not irritate my skin. It comes with a small applicator to apply the product and is very handy! I would recommend the water sleeping mask by Laneige to anyone who wants a water based sleeping mask that is gentle and leaves my face hydrated. Hydrating & Smooth Face
