I have never written a review, but I had to for this product. It is so moisturizing, and unlike so many other lip products Iâ€™ve used, it lasts for such a long time. The formula feels so good going on, and it makes lips look slightly plump because it fills in lines. It has a really pleasant, light smell, and has a very subtle iridescent effect that makes my lips look even more moisturized. The little applicator stick is really convenient and more sanitary than using a finger. I loved this so much that I bought them for all my friends and coworkers for Christmas, and everyone is obsessed! This is a must-have for me, highly recommend! The best!
