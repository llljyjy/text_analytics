I got this as a complimentary from Laneige and so far I’ve been really enjoying using this Water Bank Blue hyaluronic serum . Let me start by saying that I love using this because my skin gets too dry all the time and with the kind of weather we are having the more it dries my face out. This helps hydrates my face and nourishes it. It is very refreshing and I love how it feels smooth and soft easy to absorb . I use this day and night in my makeup routine to minimize my face dryness and its doing a lot for my skin. It is easy to carry around with me and its actually cute enough that it can go in my purse. This is just what my face needed for this cool and at the same time hot season in my area. It will definitely boost my skin’s moisture and Im having less irritated skin.I just love this Water Bank and would surely recommend this to my family. Very useful and Hydrating
