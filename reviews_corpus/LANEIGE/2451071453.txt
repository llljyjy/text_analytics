I used to love the old formula! I had finally found a face cream that didn’t make me break out, but within two weeks of using the new formula, I’ve started breaking out :( unfortunately, I will be back on the hunt for a new face cream. Wanted to leave this review in case anyone is wondering how different the new version is. The smell also isn’t as nice as it used to be. Wish they didn't update the formula
