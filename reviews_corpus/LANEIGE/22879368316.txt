I received this #Freeproduct from TopBox circle to give honest review.Ever since I started using it I saw an instant improvement in my skin the next day.was amazed the next morning to see how fresh and glowing my face was when I woke up after apply this sleeping mask the night before. I can say that was the instant visible result I’ve seen from this product, and I believe the long term effects are good. Of course repurchase chances are high.It goes from being dull and tired to plump, hydrated and glowing! It’s a great option for a lazy night when you’re too tired to do your full skincare routine or you need an extra boost of hydration for next day results. However, wouldn’t recommend it to anybody with sensitive skin as it contains alcohol and fragrance. Nonetheless, I love it! Worth Giving It A Try
