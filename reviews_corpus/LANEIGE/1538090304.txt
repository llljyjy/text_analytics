I had the opportunity to try Laneige’s Retinol Firming Cream Treatment from Topbox in exchange for my honest review. This is a retinol product that helps with minimize any fine lines and wrinkles. As anyone who has used a retinol product before you know they can be very drying and taxing on the skin. This product aids with that in two ways with 5-D Hyaluronic Acid complex to help with hydration and Madecassoside to help soothe the skin. I use this product a few times a week on my problem areas but it can also be used on the full face. I noticed a small difference after a few weeks. You have to be dedicated to using the product to see it’s full effectiveness. You must use an SPF during use of this product. nan
