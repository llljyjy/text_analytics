Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer is so new and different from all the other moisturizers out there.  It’s packaged in a blue square jar and it has a useful spatula for cleaner and easier use. The product itself is also blue but it’s not dyed with some artificial dye.  I like that it’s a gel and not a cream. It feels so hydrating on my skin. I can tell a huge improvement in the smoothness of my skin and my fine lines look softer.  This is the perfect moisturizer for combination skin like mine. I will definitely purchase it again.
