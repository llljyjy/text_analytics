I received this product as a free sample. I have dry eczema prone skin so I was a bit weary when I opened the product and noticed it had a slight hint of fragrance. Normally my skin is not a fan of any kind of fragrance but I didn’t have any kind of reaction to this product which surprised me. The cream is a thick gel watery consistency, doesn’t feel heavy or greasy on the skin. I dabbed a bit on my dry spots on my face as well as my under eyes and found it sunk right into my skin. My skin felt dewy and refreshed. I really enjoyed this product and will continue using it. Hydrated Undereyes
