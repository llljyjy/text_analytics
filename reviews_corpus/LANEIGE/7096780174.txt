I was pleasantly surprised by this Serum. I get pretty dry skin in my t-zone and especially on the sides of my nose during the cooler months, nearly nothing helps it. After a day, maybe, all my dryness started clearing up. That’s saying a lot because the side of my nose alone I have to usually scratch off the dry flakes and I have zero now. The formula is super light weight, it blends right into the skin and doesn’t leave you feeling sticky. I really enjoy the component too, it’s simple and unique and can be refilled so it’s also helping the planet! Must have for anyone with dry or dehydrated skin. I did receive this complimentary from Laneige but these are my own opinions. nan
