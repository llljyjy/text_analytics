got this for christmas and was SO excited bc i missed out on the other bts ptd collab. iâ€™m in love with this set! iâ€™m usually not into eclectic flavors in lip balms so i wasnâ€™t sure how iâ€™d like the butter scent but girl, sheâ€™s GOOD! to me it smells like kettle corn but the popcorn note is faint. again, not a scent i would typically like at all but itâ€™s a+! candy and peach iced tea are lovelyðŸ’œ and if you look at the total amount of product you get in grams (24g total) itâ€™s really not badly priced, before this dropped i was considering the tatcha lip mask which is $28 for only 9g of product. ik yâ€™all wonâ€™t but make this a permanent set plsss
