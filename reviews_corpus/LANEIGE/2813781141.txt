It’s amazing. I don’t normally leave reviews, but I had to with this product, because YOU NEED IT!! I have dry skin and this is the only moisturizer that makes me have glowing skin in the morning after using it at night. I can tell it’s improving my skin over time too. I think it’s totally worth it for the price, you get a pretty large jar and you only need to use a little bit to get great results! nan
