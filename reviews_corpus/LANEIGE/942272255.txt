As someone who cannot stand having dry lips, I’ve tried so many lip balms, from inexpensive drugstore brands (Carmex never fails) to high end (Clarins lip oil -- no thank you), this is a favorite. As other reviewers have noted, it’s slightly different from the mask, both in terms of texture (this one is just a little slipperier, but not in a bad way) and wear (it leaves a glossy finish), but it’s every bit as good. It’s not at all sticky, nor does it have a taste, and it never dries out my lips. The packaging is great in that a gentle squeeze yields the perfect amount of product -- no oozing out in a gloopy rush like some products do. As others have noted, it smells amazing, very sweet and almost with a hint of a summery scent. I don’t notice the scent at all once I’ve applied it, though it smells so good that I wish the scent were a little stronger. It’s definitely pricey, but a tiny bit goes a long way. Highly recommend! Another HG Laneige product!
