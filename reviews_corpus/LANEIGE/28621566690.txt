JUST REVIEWING THE MANGO SCENT! I love the formula (it’s the same as all the others) but I don’t love the scent. I was expecting a very sweet mango scent but it’s very light. It’s good if you’re sensitive to smells but if you’re expecting a sweet smell don’t get this scent. The color is also not as refreshing as I thought it’d be. I guess I was expecting a very light yellow-clear but it’s more yellow than I thought it’d be. I’m still in love with the berry scent and definitely not this one sadly. nan
