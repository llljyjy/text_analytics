I use to use the previous formula but since they came out with the new one I canâ€™t use it at all, does not help my skin at all and does not work at all under makeup. My makeup would not stick to my skin at all and was splotchy. Every time I used this I had to redo my makeup until I realized this moisturizer was the culprit. Bad Formula Change
