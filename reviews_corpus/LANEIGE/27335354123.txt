I have pretty sensitive skin and am always a bit skeptical before I try masks, I tried mini version from the rewards just for fun, and was pleasantly shocked! Even after just the first try my skin felt moisturized and had a healthy glow, it also helped with some of my acne. I purchased immediately after the rewards size was gone! If there is any product I would recommend it would probably be this. Especially good for colder months. Best product Iâ€™ve ever tried, my holy grail!!
