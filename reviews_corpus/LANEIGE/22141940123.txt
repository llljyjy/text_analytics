This gel like moisturizer is packing a punch. I apply it at night after washing, toning, and using serum. I tend to have very oily skin in my T-zone so I avoid putting it there. The blue squarish container it comes in is very simple and pretty. I’m a big fan of cute packaging and it comes with a sturdy plastic stick for application. It only takes me a very very small amount to cover the parts of my face I want it on. There’s virtually no smell and it soaks in fast. Highly recommended for combo and dry skinned beauties. It will be a staple in my skin care routine now but I don’t think it’s FANTASTIC for oily skin. Burst of Water
