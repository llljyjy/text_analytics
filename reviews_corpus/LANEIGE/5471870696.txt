We all know we should be wearing sunscreen on our face to prevent sun damage, but most of us don’t. My struggle with sunscreen has been the white cast is leaves and that SPF smell (you know the smell). Laneige is the first facial sunscreen that I have found that doesn’t leave a cast and smells nice. It is very lightly scented and once applied to the face, I can’t smell it at all. It starts off a bit greasy, but absorbs into the skin and wears well under makeup. A must have in my daily routine!
