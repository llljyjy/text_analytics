Wonderful Laneige! I love the packaging and felt that this product is really nice for morning use and evening routine. It definitely feels hydrating and absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling sticky (as Vitamin C products can sometimes). The scent is a little perfume-y/fresh but dissipates quickly. I recommend using a cotton pad to dab onto the face. I use this product after cleansing and before using Laneige SunScreen  I received this product complimentary from #topboxcircle nan
