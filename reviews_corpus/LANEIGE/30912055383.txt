I was gifted by Laneige, the Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer in exchange for my honest opinion. Well firstly Iâ€™d like to say that I really really loved the packaging..right from the shape, the pleasing color..everything about the Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer appealed to me..The cream is light, airy and super hydrating..My skin dries very badly in winters, I can say I can see visible results with just 2 use..The cream is marketed as a cream thay hydrates for upto 100 hrs, I reapplied almost every 12 hrs so I cant vouch for that..The cream absorbs very easily..The cream also has an amazing texture..Overall I loved this product nan
