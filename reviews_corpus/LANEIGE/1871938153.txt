Oh this is yummy, hydrating and the perfect lip mask!! It comes with a little spatula to prevent fingers from contaminating the container. The amount of product is very generous, I barely made a dent and have been using is every day for a month. It’s a sweet smell and taste (duh, it’s called sweet candy!), perfectly hydrates my lips. It is thick though, it’s a night time lip mask. I wouldn’t wear this during the day. I’ve never had my lips so soft and subtle, I totally get the hype now! This should last me a year, so it’s worth every penny. I want other flavors! Just yum!!
