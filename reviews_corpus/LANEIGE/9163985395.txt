I ABSOLUTELY recommend this!! I love in Canada so my lips get super dry during the winter and this is my favourite lip balm to use, and I’m a lip balm fanatic!!! I barely need any to cover my lips and it lasts a long time before I need to reapply! I sometimes wear it overnight when I’m too lazy to use the laneige lip sleeping mask. I bought this specifically because of the gummy bear flavour and although it doesn’t have the gummy bear taste, it smells like it! Laneige never disappoints!! nan
