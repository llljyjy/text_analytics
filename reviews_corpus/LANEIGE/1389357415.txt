I’ve fallen in love with Laneige! This is another wonderful product. I use in the morning (after serums, before SPF) love the brightening glow and moisturizing. This jar, however, I don’t love. And it seems others in the line are shifting over to this style instead of the more generous sized containers. get your glow up!
