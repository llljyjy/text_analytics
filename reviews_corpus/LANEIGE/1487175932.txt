This serum is amazing and the packaging is my favourite of any serum I have used. A little bit goes a very long way so I can see this lasting for a while. The moisturizing effects from the hyaluronic serum is the best and fastest absorbing moisture I have experienced. My skin looks pretty dull especially in the winter months and this serum gave me nice dewy skin with out feeling sticky or leaving any film on my skin. This paired with The Blue Hyaluronic Moisturizer and you have a excellent soft skin combination.I received this product for free for my honest review. #Freeproduct #Trywitihtopbox Very soft skin
