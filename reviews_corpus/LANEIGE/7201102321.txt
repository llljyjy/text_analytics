This is the first time buying this lip mask. I waited until the fall sale and used a gift card because I was hesitant to pay full price for the product. Now that I have received it and have used it several days, I see why it has so much hype. It’s really helped to repair and smooth my dry, cracked lips. I’m now a fan and won’t hesitate to buy again even at full price. The pumpkin scent isn’t overwhelming and reminds me of a “fall” flavored coffee drink. Love this lip mask!
