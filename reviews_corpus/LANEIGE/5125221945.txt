This was gifted to me by Laneige in exchange for my opinion, and wow! I am obsessed with this moisturizer! I have incredibly dry skin and I’m always looking for something deeply hydrating but that won’t have my makeup sliding off my face, and this is IDEAL. The packaging is lovely - a beautiful blue container that closes tightly for no leaks. You get an applicator stick too because the cream is very thick and you don’t want to waste any. This immediately sank into my skin and felt unbelievably velvety. My foundation didn’t slide at all, but I didn’t have any flakiness that I usually do at the end of the day. If you struggle with dry skin, this is a fantastic product! Amazing for Dry Skin!!!
