I love this mask whenever I wear it, but when I don’t have it on my lips I found it to be drying. Unless I have it on my lips constantly I didn’t find it to be super moisturizing. Overall, I did like the product but I will not be repurchasing because they test on animals and I would encourage everyone to do the same. The product is good, not great and you will get better results from Bag Balm as a cruelty-free alternative! Meh
