I am very pleased with this cream.  I have combination skin with a few but noticeable dark spots.  Where my skin is dry, it is very dry.  This cream is very moisturizing and I can already see some diminishing of spots after two weeks.   I use it only at night because I have a day cream with SPF.   When I wash my face in the morning, I cannot believe how soft it is.  Aside from dark spots, my entire complexion is so much brighter.  The cream is light in texture.  I highly recommend this cream.  antion skin wiht a few Great for brightening and moisturizing
