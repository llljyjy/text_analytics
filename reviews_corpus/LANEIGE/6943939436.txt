I have gone back and forth between FAB Oat toner and the Cream Skin Toner. The Laniege toner is more hydrating than the FAB toner, so if you have dryer skin I would totally recommend this product. I use it right after I wash my face and then while still damp will apply hyaluronic acid and vitamin c booster and it works perfectly. Product does not pill in combination with others. nan
