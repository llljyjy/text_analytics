I used this moisturizer for months and my skin was greattt. but then i decided to experiment and try others but none of them worked for me, the way this one did. i have oily skin but i like to feel really moisturized and i feel like this is perfect for that. it’s not too light but also not to think to the point where it feels greasy. i think it’s an amazing basic moisturizer and 100% recommend for someone with acne prone skin returning favorite!!!
