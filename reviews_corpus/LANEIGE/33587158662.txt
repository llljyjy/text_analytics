as someone who is very sensitive to scents, i was really worried about it being too over powering. trust me, it’s not like that!! i absolutely love the scent and literally everything about it. i find this product so moisturizing. it doesn’t feel too heavy on the lips at all. i even use it as a lip gloss sometimes because of how shiny it looks :)worth the price. 100% recommend!! love it!
