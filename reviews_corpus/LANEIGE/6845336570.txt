I purchased this set on the recommendation of a friend who really likes the reformulation. So far, I feel it has made a slight positive difference in my skin tone and texture. It seems to mildly reduce the appearance of my redness/rosacea and most products wonâ€™t do that at all even if they claim to be targeted for redness. I really want to keep using this and see if the results are lasting and worth buying full-size versions. I will update my review as I continue to monitor my progress using this set. might actually be doing something!
