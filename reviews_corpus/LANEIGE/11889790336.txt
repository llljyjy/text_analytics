Iâ€™m grateful for receiving this Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream gifted by Laneige in exchange for my honest opinion. I have used Laneige products before that are now a staple in my skincare routine. I was really excited to use this moisturizer as it was very soft and silky during application, and absorbed quickly into the skin. It did not leave a cast or skin but rather matte finish. My skin stayed hydrated for hours especially in dry weather. Definitely recommend! nan
