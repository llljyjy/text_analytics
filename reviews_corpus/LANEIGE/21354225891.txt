I would love this SPF if it didn’t burn my eyes almost every time I wear it. Even though I have oily skin, I’ve noticed that a lot of sunscreens tend to dry me out. This feels amazing on the skin, but somehow it’s irritating me eyes even if I don’t put it near them. I like it enough to use it and get my moneys worth, but I definitely won’t repurchase. NICE BUT BURNS EYES
