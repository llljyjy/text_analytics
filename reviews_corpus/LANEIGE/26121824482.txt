I absolutely love this gel Moisturizer. It has the moisture that I need in my skincare needs. I was missing the hydration and know I have found it. This gel moisturizer spreads well with its little applicator, just like water to touch. Jelly feeling but goes on extra smooth. Left my skin feeling amazing. Dried quickly after washing my face and applying toner and serum before applying product. You just need a little because it goes a long way. Definitely a great product . This was complimentary from Laneige. nan
