I was so excited to receive this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox! I’ve used Hyaluronic products before and never really got the hype. However, this is a game-changer. Not only has it has kept my skin moist and hydrated, but it’s also helped my acne. Been using it twice a day for about 2 weeks and don’t know how I’ve lived without it. Both my skin and makeup are looking so much better thanks to this serum. My New Favourite Skin Care Product!
