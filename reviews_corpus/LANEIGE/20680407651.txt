i like the product. It’s hydrating good for dry skin and winter. Helps repair skin barrier. Squalane is anti-ageing and prevents cancer. So it is naturally found in the skin, I think it’s good for the skin barrier. I like the texture. The bottle is cute. comes with an applicator. I use it before sleep. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct nice
