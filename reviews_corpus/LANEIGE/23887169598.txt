I received this #Freeproduct from Topbox circle to give Honest Review, I thought water sleeping masks were not my thing and weren’t effective enough and I was wrong.Not because I recently discovered they do are my thing but also because my skin felt already healthy and soft the morning after.This is the best night skincare ever! In the morning my skin feel really hydrated and healthy. Also it didn’t makes my skin break out and greasy, The cream really fast absorb and didn’t sticky at all. I really like the texture and the result! Definitely repurchase . Great Sleeping Mask
