This is a great lip balm. I wouldn’t say it’s 100% perfect as it does NOT leave your lips moisturized all night and does not prevent dry lips.. but it does stay much longer than other lip balms, has beautiful scent (Gummy Bear) and has slight pink undertone. There are better lip balms for sure. But I love the shine and the scent so I will be purchasing it again. My son loves it too. Very nice lip balm
