This works so well I repurchased twice now. I usually use aquaphor since it’s recommended by dermatologist, but I’ve seen them using this on Tik Tok and saying good things about it. I love that it has vitamin C and HA in it. Not only that but it actually works so well at hydrating my lips. I’ve tried the ilia balm after I ran out of this and noticed a huge difference as that one did not last compared to this one. The bite one is also great but it’s so thick and feels like a mask, this one is light but you feel that protective layer. Great product. nan
