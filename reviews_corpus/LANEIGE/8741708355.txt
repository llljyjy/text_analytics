This serum works well for my combo skin. It’s a lightweight gel-like texture that absorbs into the skin quickly. My skin feels hydrated and looks so glowy! I love that it has peptides and green tea enzymes to help my skin look healthier and smoother. It does have fragrance, which isn’t my fave thing, so sensitive skin types beware! The packaging is awesome and I love the twist top pump! Gifted by brand. Like a drink of water for your skin!
