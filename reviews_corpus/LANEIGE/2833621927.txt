I have big lips and must wear chapstick to bed every night or my chapped lips wake me up! I used this as a sample and i want more. I only apply a little which goes a long way. Lasts me all night into the morning and even after washing my face my lips are still soft and not peeling or cracked. Iâ€™ve used my fare share of chapsticks or balm like products and this one got me. Pricey yeah but worth it in my opinion nan
