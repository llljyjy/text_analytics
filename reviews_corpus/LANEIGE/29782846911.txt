I was recently gifted this sunscreen complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest review.  This is a wonderful, lightweight yet hydrating sunscreen.  It has a thick formula, but absorbs easily and there’s no white cast when you apply it!  It’s very soothing and moisturizing for my dry skin, and I love its light scent. With 50+ SPF, I’ve found it’s the ideal daily protection for when I’m outdoors during these cold, drying winter months. Great Daily UV Protection!
