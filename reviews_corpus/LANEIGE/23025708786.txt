At first thought upon opening box I liked the packaging. It was appealing to the eye. At first I did not see immediate results but it did feel really refreshing to the touch. After just a couple uses I notice it started to make my skin feel hydrated again and smooth to the touch.  Itâ€™s lightweight which is usually what I look for. Great moisturizer and would be willing to purchase in future.  Complimentary from Laneige. Hydrating
