Love it. I have oily skin so when finding a sleeping mask I wanted something that wouldn’t leave me feeling gross, this is really great for that. The texture is like a thick gel? Like you can definitely feel it, but it’s not at all too much. If you have really dry skin I don’t think this’ll be enough for you though so, yeah saur nice
