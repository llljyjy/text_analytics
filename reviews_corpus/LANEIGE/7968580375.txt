I like that the application of the eye cream goes on really smoothly, does not leave a sticky feeling and is transparent when it dries. A little product goes a long way so youâ€™ll definitely get a lot of use out of the product. After incorporating the eye cream to my skincare routine for a few weeks, I found that it does brighten my under eyes but does not provide amazing results for the puffiness under my eyes. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Eye cream
