Bought this product while I was on accutane because I needed something gentle and hydrating to cleanse my skin and help remove makeup. Works so well. My skin texture became noticeably better within a week of using it and much more hydrated. It removes makeup well you just have to make sure to get it in all of the crevices of your face. I will say if you use waterproof mascara that it works best when applying and leaving this on for a minute or two to let it melt into everything. I usually apply, brush my teeth, and then wash the cleanser off. Very happy with it and am in my second bottle post accutane! MUST for dry skin
