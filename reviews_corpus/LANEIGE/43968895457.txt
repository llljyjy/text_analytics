i really wanted to love this... it looked super appealing and i heard great things, but it just kind of sat on my lips. i tried every way, but just ended up using it as a gloss instead because it didn’t exactly nourish my lips. it’s great if it works for you, but i am not one of those people umm... not worth the hype :(
