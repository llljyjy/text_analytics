Pros: The Laneige lip sleeping mask is a life saver with the hot/cold changes in weather that so often dry out my lips! Really love the scents and flavors. I like the applicator wand included with this purchase so that I don’t have to stick my fingers in the jar. A little product goes a long way (great value). I wake up with my lips feeling soft, supple and moisturized.Cons:Can’t think of any. Tips: A little product goes a long way. Wash your face and apply before bed. Wake up with gorgeous lips.
