I initially bought this for a friend but was tempted to try it and pick up another for her -- I’m glad I did. I’ve been looking for a replacement for the original Bite Beauty lip mask (RIP) for the past few years now. This isn’t quite as good but it’s the next best lip mask I’ve found. It doesn’t taste like mango but it smells pleasantly fruity. What I’m most impressed with is the performance -- it’s substantial enough that it stays on my lips and conditions them overnight, but it’s not thick or goopy if you use it sparingly. I wear it during the day too and it gives a nice balmy glossy glow  to the lips. The applicator that comes with it is super helpful. Worth the hype IMO
