I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review. This is a good quality, very nourishing, hydrating and moisturizing serum. I have mostly used it in conjunction with the cream moisturizer from the same range. I honestly like the cream much more than the serum, because of its rich texture. But nonetheless, considering its cost and quality, it’s still a worth-try product. Especially if you have dry, sensitive skin and live in a cold environment. I have not seen any changes in terms of skin firmness, but for sure it’s a great product to tackle skin dryness issues. I love the bottle design with its twist open feature as well. Awesome packaging and quality
