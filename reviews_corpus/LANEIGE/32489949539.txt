I had been using a trial size of the old formula for a while and really liked it. I have to say, I like the scent and packaging of the old formula better. It has a very similar scent, but more toned down. Normally I do fragrance free, but the scent of the old formula just ended up being so nice. Neither irritated my skin at all. This one’s packaging is prettier on color, but it feels bulky. It all oozed out when I broke the seal and I almost broke a nail trying to get it off. The lid is just very large which means it takes up more space in my bag. I know the new formula technically has better ingredients. Even though it’s the cream, not the gel, it still has a very light weightless feel and absorbs quickly, so it’s nice for in the morning, especially in the summer. Wears well under spf. Not sure if I’ll purchase again, just because I have other moisturizers I like, some of which are more affordable. All in all, it’s a good product, but I’m not sure if it’s worth all the hype. I like it
