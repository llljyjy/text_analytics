One of my all time favourite products. I actually apply this every night, and I have never needed to rinse it off in the morning. It applies easily, and works well with facial tools such as massagers because it is very slick. Itâ€™s lightweight and never breaks me out, but adds the perfect amount of moisture to my mid-twenties skin. Plus the volume of cream you get is reasonable for the price point! nan
