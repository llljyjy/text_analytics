Love the product, but I hate the smell. Its overbearing and it just doesn’t do it for me. Works really well on me, I have combo skin, mostly oily in my t-zone. But anyways, I know the formula has changed but it’s alright still for me, just bring back the old frangrance if they can or make it no fragrance. PLEASE! GREAT.. but FRAGRANT
