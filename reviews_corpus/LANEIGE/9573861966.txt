This moisturizer is amazing!! The smell is light and beautiful, a little floral. The texture is perfect! It’s rich and moisturizing without being too heavy or feeling like you’re being weighed down. A little bit really gives your skin a lot of moisture and it melts into your skin like butter. Plus the packaging is super cute too!! Definitely buy this!I was gifted by laneige for my honest review. Smells and feels amazing!
