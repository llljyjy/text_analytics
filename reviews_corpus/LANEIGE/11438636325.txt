Does exactly what is says it does. Wear overnight and it hydrates beautifully. I’ve gotten split lips and it heals it within 24 hours. Looks nice if you want to wear it during the day. It doesn’t perform miracles, like plumping or enlarging lips, it’s just an excellent moisturizing lip mask. Must have every night
