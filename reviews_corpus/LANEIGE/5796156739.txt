The previous version of this line was my absolute HG moisturizer, but this new version doesn’t live up to that status. It is thicker, doesn’t sink in as well, and doesn’t leave my skin feeling hydrated like the previous version did. The smell is light and lovely - it actually smells like the English roses in my garden! But I am so sad that this changed so much from the previous one. Definitely going to have to find a new HG moisturizer now. Laneige, please bring back the old version! nan
