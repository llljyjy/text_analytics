ngl this lip mask was pretty mid I liked the the Ulta Beauty Watermelon Wonderful Lip Jelly better if you’re looking for a better sleeping lip mask I would go for the The Kissu Lip Mask (tatcha) it’s couple bucks more but worth it in my opinion. overall I think this isn’t a bad lip sleeping mask it’s just not as good as everyone makes it out to be. the jar is huge and I won’t run out anytime soon but I won’t be rebuying. Good but overhyped
