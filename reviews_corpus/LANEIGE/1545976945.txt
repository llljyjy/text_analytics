I’ve been using this for a couple of years now and it’s such a versatile product. I use it as a stand alone moisturizer when my skin is sensitive, a layering toner to seal actives and essences before an occlusive, a setting spray to soften makeup and to keep moisture in at the office, and a perfect base for makeup when I want a smooth finish. Sephora doesn’t carry the mist version which is also amazing. I have both and often get a better deal off of k beauty retailers. Gentle, Multipurpose Skin Solution
