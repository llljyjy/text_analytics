I literally do not know HOW this is not talked about more. Hands down far and away the best moisturiser I’ve ever tried in my life. Under makeup it’s perfection, on its own it’s magical! This stuff has TRANSFORMED my skin over the past few months. My ONLY complaint is the spray mechanism it comes with isn’t great. It sprays out a little heavy/splotchy. I put mine in a spray bottle I bought on Amazon. I genuinely don’t think I’ll ever purchase a different moisturiser ever again. I don’t know how anything could ever be better than this!!!! HOLY GRAIL! RIDE OR DIE! BUY THIS NOW!
