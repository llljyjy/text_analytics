I really struggle with dry and chapped winter lips. I’d been using Aquaphor and Vaseline constantly throughout the day but with no lasting relief. So I decided to try this after reading all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, I find myself disappointed by it. It’s not terrible by any means, but it hasn’t really done much to help or repair my lips either. I still have to constantly use other balms throughout the day because my lips get dry and painful within a few hours of being up. I was expecting to wake up and notice a significant difference after a few nights of using this. But I’ve been using this almost every night for weeks now and I can’t really say I’ve noticed any significant difference. It feels nice and soothing while it’s on, but I’ve noticed no effects beyond that. Also, while it does have a nice sweet smell, it’s very sticky and goopy. I was expecting a thicker balm or something ointment-like; not a sticky glossy feel. Overall I’ll continue to use it since I paid for it and it doesn’t make things worse. But it’s just an over priced chapstick. I’ve since had way better luck with the Blistex Lip Medic that I got for $2 at my local grocery store. nan
