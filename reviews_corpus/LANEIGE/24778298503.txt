The packaging is very cute. The finish is very pretty and scent is so nice. BUT thats it. I have normal to dry lips. Some days they need more hydration and some days they’re fine. I finished an entire bottle using it every night since it is a sleeping mask but throughout the day I still needed vaseline or chapstick because my lips were dry. I think this product just feels nice and looks nice but isn’t what a person should buy if they are looking to heal and deeply hydrate their lips. Vaseline works better for me. Price is expensive but lasts maybe 4-5 Months so if you want to try it, you will get your moneys worth but don’t expect a true transformation. This will just sit on top and temporarily relieve your dry lips. Cute but not hydrating
