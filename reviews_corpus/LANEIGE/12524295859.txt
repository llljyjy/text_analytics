This product is very beautiful. It has a very rich texture that it can also work as a moisturizer. I don’t put moisturizer anymore when I use this given that, I don’t skimp on my sunscreen. This has zero white cast and leaves my skin glowy and well-protected from the sun. I just wish this has 4 pluses like a lot of chemical sunscreens from S. Korea. I’m just nitpicking on this area so it has something to improve on! Lol. Other than that, try this. Also, if you have oily skin, you might wanna use this only for cold months. GORGEOUS FORMULATION.
