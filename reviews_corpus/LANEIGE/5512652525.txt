This is, by far, the best lip balm I have ever used. I have been looking for something like this since the Dior Creme de Rose lip balm was discontinued in 2018, and I was introduced to this via the Laneige birthday gift. I now refuse to be without it - I have one in my office, one in my bag, one at home - I truly don’t think I can ever use another lip balm again. Absolutely recommend. The texture is so soft and hydrating, and your lips don’t look dead afterwards. I have tried the berry, sweet candy, and mango scents, and I love them all but my favorite so far is the berry. Can't live without
