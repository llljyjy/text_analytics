I didn’t realize how much I actually love this. I went on a trip and didn’t pack it in my bag, and after a few days literally nothing would hydrate my lips. I was constantly putting balms and ointments on but nothing did what this lip mask does.I use the vanilla at night before going to bed and the mango in the morning while I do my makeup/morning routine. Both scents are divine. I do kind of wish there was an unscented one. A Sneaky Necessity
