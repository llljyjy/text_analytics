This product was ALL over TikTok, so I decided to give it a try. After using it every night for about two weeks I noticed myself reaching for chapstick during the day and/or licking my lips way more frequently, which I almost never do. I realized this product was the only thing different in my routine. I went back to using Vaseline or Aquaphor at night and my lips bounced back to normal. This is overpriced for no results. Iâ€™ll stick to the basics. Fell for the hype, but it's a no from me
