I received this product complimentary from Laneige for my review. I’ve been looking for a daily sunscreen forever and I think I found the one! It feels lightweight, goes great under my makeup and doesn’t leave any white cast. It has a nice but not strong scent. I’m so glad I tried this. Great product
