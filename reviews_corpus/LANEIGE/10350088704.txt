I bought this off the Laneige site but came here to save it because I actually love this line! I’d agree with the other review that the moisturizer can feel a tad sticky, but I find that stickiness goes away after about 10-15 mins of setting into my skin.  The eye cream/syrum has worked wonders in the few weeks I’ve used it too!For reference, I have an oily T-zone but normal to dry everywhere else (combo-ish skin).  Would probably not be the best line for folks with VERY oily skin, but Laneige does have a line for those skin types as well. nan
