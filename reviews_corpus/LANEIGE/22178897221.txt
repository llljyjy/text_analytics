literally the best product I have ever bought. this does more for me than the la roche-posay b5 balm or the cosrx propolis ampoule in terms of healing - it calms breakouts overnight so well! I started using this when I started the differin adapalene and I had barely any irritation as a result. it’s pretty lightweight and a little goes a long way, and I wake up with such smooth/soft skin. a lot of cica products aren’t as effective this one - this one does exactly what it says it will. definitely will not be dropping money on other sleeping masks, etc. when I can just get this. absolutely recommend for acne-prone/oily skin!! best product for acne-prone and oily skin!
