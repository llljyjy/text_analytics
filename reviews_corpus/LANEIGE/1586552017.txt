Old formula was way better. This new formula is heavier which is unfortunate because the lightness of the old formula was my favourite part. There is also a noticeable scent to the new formula.

This also feels like it sits onto of your face for awhile and takes some time to absorb into your skin. Old Formula Was Way Better
