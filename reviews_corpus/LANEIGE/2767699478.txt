Stick with the lip sleeping mask. The spatula and product formula is 100000% better than this. The applicator isn’t very great to use, it’s the wrong shape. The product itself is overly fragranced and isn’t very hydrating. Too much product during the day will leave you with weird sparkly white lips. nan
