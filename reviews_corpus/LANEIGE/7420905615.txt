I received this as a #freeproduct to try and absolutely love it! I have been a big fan of the laneige lip masks for years and this is the perfect compliment for the entire face. The light, gel texture feels refreshing on the skin and is light enough to use as a daily moisturizer - I often use it under a thicker oil or occlusive for extra moisture at night or just under SPF during the day. It has a really nice clean smell that isnâ€™t overwhelming. I love the addition of squalane, which works great on my skin. The packaging is lovely and the little spatula is great to make the tub style more hygienic. This is a super versatile moisturizer so I would recommend to anyone as it can be fit into both simple and more complicated skincare routines. Amazing moisturizing mask!
