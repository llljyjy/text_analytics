I bought this hoping it was the BTS edition in the special Permission To Dance packaging, which you have advertised on your US site. The price was $2.00 more than the other flavours, so I thought maybe it was a safe assumption. But, alas! I was mistaken, and all I received was $2.00 more expensive lip mask in the ordinary packaging. Why aren’t you offerung the BTS promo for the Canadian market, Sephora? Plenty of ARMY here, too. I haven’t tried the product itself yet but I’m sure it’s fine. Not the BTS Permission to Dance version
