Please go buy this!!! ESPECIALLY if you’re a makeup wearer looking to incorporate a sunscreen into your base!! No white cast. No left over gunk. It literally feels like a moisturizer. I’ve even been able to layer a primer on top of it without the sunscreen peeling apart. makeup lover’s best sunscreen <3
