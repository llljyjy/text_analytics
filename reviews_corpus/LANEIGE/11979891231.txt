This product has been a stable in my skincare routine for quite a while. I was skeptical at first when they launched the new formula but it did not disappoint. I find the new formula more hydrating, doing a better job at retaining moisture and gives my skin a healthy and glowy look. When I was having peeling and flaky skin as a result of a reaction to another product, I only cleansed my face and used this mask and it healed my skins super quickly. Although it’s called a mask, I use it as my daily moisturizer because I think it has better value and result than the Laneigh water bank moisturizer.My only complaint is that I often have to apply 2 layers of this mask or reapply after ~1hr, especially in dry areas like around the nose, nostrils and around the mouth. I also had this issue with the old formula but the new one does improve hydration. I find that if I apply enough my skin will be perfectly moisturized and my oily T-zone would not be too crazy. However, I don’t think this mask will be beneficial to you if you very dry skin. Lightweight formula for glowy skin
