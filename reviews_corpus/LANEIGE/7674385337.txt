I have this balm in the gummy bear, and the pear and they’re my only truly daily balm! They’re lightly glossy, but the gloss eventually fades, and leaves you comfortably moisturized! My lips are super sensitive and most everything makes them peel- but these are on the short list of my favorite products! Would absolutely rebuy for anyone with sensitive lips/skin who struggles with eternal chapping. Not really pigmented in any discernible way, which to me is a plus. The smells are both really nice, but fade after 5 minutes or so. I do wish they were flavored as well- that’d be fab! I have a hard time picking between which is my fav of the two, both super fresh sweet smells. Nothing artificial about them. Always in my purse! My go to balm!
