This product is so versatile beyond just acting as a sleeping mask. As someone with very very dry lips, it is really hard to find lip products that donâ€™t make me want to wipe them off immediately. The lip sleeping mask is extremely hydrating and the amount of product you get for the price is 1000% worth it. Plus, the grapefruit smells AMAZING! My Holy Grail for Dry Lips
