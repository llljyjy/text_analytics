Love it! Great product, was already a fan of the berry and this one is just as good. The tiniest hint of color and keeps my lips super moisturized. I use this at night and all day. Love the scent and have already bought a 2nd as a back up as I assume itâ€™s a limited scent. Would be hyped if they were to bring the mango out in the lip glowy balm as well! Buy it!
