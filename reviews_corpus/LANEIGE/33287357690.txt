I received this #freeproduct from Topbox as part of their #trywithtopbox campaigns I love the packaging of this product. It’s ergonomically designed and I appreciate that it just feels really nice to handle- especially with the lack of sharp corners or edges. I also like how the product was sealed with a foil lid before opening, and you also receive an applicator to apply the cream. The product itself is lightly scented and a nice texture to apply under the eyes in that it’s not overly greasy or heavy. I apply this both day and night before my heavier creams, and I like the extra hydration it provides my under eye areas. While I don’t think I’ve seen a difference with my dark circles, the cream is still a welcome addition into my routine. It works well with other ingredients and under make up to. Water bank eye cream
