Got this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox. I absolutely love this eye cream and this will be my go to from now on. The packaging is very nice and sleek and you get a lot of product that will last you awhile. It has an amazing scent that is not overpowering. It keeps the undereye moisturized and makes it look brighter. I definitely recommend this product if youâ€™re looking for an eye cream that does exactly what it claims. Best eye cream I've ever tried
