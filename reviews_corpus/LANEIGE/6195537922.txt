I got this #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox and was so excited to give it a try because Laneige is a brand I’m familiar with and trust. First of all, I love the packaging! With an easy twist of the top part, the applicator raises from the container allowing you to press down to pump the serum out so there’s no need for a lid or risk of spills if you take it traveling with you. Only a small amount is needed for the whole face and it applies really nicely and has a nice scent as well that’s not too overpowering. Great on sensitive skin and combination skin (my skin type) and it’s left my skin feeling moisturized and smooth. Love this serum! Lovely serum
