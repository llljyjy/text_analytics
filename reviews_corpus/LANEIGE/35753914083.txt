No more crusty lips!! I used the mini Vaseline jars for years but still always had small patches of dry skin. I hesitated on getting this product because of the price but decided to give it a try. I’m so happy I got it! It’s thick and smooth, and smells so yummy (kind of like gushers!). I have it everywhere I go. YES
