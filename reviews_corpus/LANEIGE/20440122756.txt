This was an impulse buy after I saw about 300 recommendations for it online. Let me tell you, it’s EVERYTHING that everyone says it is (and more)!! I’ve tried just about every lip product on the market (just finished a round of accutane and my lips get SEVERELY dehydrated)... and this one is right at the top of my list. I mainly use it at night before bed and I usually wake up with a thin layer STILL working on my lips. I also take it with me throughout the day sometimes and it seriously lasts hours, looking like a sheer gloss. Added bonus: it smells great! 10/10! AMAZING product!
