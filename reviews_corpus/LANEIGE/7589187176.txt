This is the perfect rich and nourishing moisturizer for nighttime! I am a nurse and have suffered with horrible irritation and dryness from the constant mask wearing and I look forward to slathering my skin with this when I get home from work . I know I will wake up every time with smooth , soft, and calmed skin. The price is honesty pretty affordable compared to similar night masks and one jar lasts me months cause a little does go such a long way! This mask is a dream and I hope to never be without it :) holy grail for dry sensitive skin!
