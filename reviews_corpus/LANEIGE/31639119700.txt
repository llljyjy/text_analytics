It’s a nice light weight sunscreen! It doesn’t have the sunscreen smell and it doesn’t leave a white cast at all. However, be careful when applying too close to the eyes because it stings a bit if you apply too close ! But over all it’s a good sunscreen! And I have acne prone skin and it did not break me out when I first started using it !! Good Buy!
