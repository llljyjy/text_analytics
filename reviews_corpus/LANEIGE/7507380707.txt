I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this product. I first tried it as a sample size, and I was immediately impressed. I have combination skin that’s prone to acne and is very sensitive, and normally heavier creams like this break me out. This cream hasn’t caused me even one breakout. It has a very minimal scent which is good my my sensitive skin. It has a lovely thick consistency when you scoop it out of the jar, but it doesn’t feel heavy on the skin. I apply it last on top of all my other skin care products, and I wake up with refreshed, soft skin in the morning. I’ve been using it nightly with no issues (I only recently read on the package you’re supposed to use it a few times a week). My skin hasn’t been this moisturized and healthy in a long time. The price tag isn’t actually that bad, as the jar I got is huge, and the small sample I had lasted me about two months ( a little goes a long way with this cream). If you have sensitive, acne prone skin and you need moisture but you’re afraid of breakouts, maybe consider giving this cream a try. I really feel like it’s made a difference for my skin personally! nan
