Not sure how to feel about this moisturizer. I do feel like it hydrating, but I also think it may dry or irritate my skin in some way. I noticed a few breakouts and it may be because of the fragrance. My skin does look very glowy though when using this! Definitely would make a great day tike moisturizer though if you are not sensitive to fragrance! This was gifted by Laneige! nan
