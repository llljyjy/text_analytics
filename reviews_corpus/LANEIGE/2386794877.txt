Bought this product on the recommendation of an employee after discussing how sensitive my skin is and my allergy to perfume. I have been very dry lately. Just tried it for the first time and I hate it. It makes my eyes itch and water. It is a few days after the deadline to return it so now I am stuck with something I canâ€™t use. nan
