Been using this product two times a week for the last three weeks I would say. It is suggested as 1-2 times a week but I decided to just go with two. Honestly, when you put it on, the hydration is spot on and the next day you definitely see a difference-- your face feels more hydrated and moisturized-- but I don’t think it’s worth too crazy of a hype to give it 5 stars in my opinion. Good for Hydration!
