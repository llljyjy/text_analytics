Big fan of all Laneige products I tried in the past and this one was no different. Has a very nice texture which is light weight and absorbed really well. It does have a strong smell so wouldn’t recommend if you’re sensitive to that. Otherwise felt like it really kept my skin moisturized and hydrated! #trywithtopbox #freeproduct nan
