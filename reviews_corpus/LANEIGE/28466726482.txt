I really wanted to like this considering the fact that it’s expensive and I cannot find any other sunscreen that won’t break me out and this one seemed promising. It smells like straight up perfume and it was very greasy to the point of uncomfortableness. This resulted in breakouts. This is the first product I want to return or give away because I am pretty disappointed. Not Great
