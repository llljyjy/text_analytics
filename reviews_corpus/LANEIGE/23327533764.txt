I received the Radian-C Cream from Laneige complimentary for my review! I’ve been wanting to try this cream for an extremely long time, so I was definitely excited to try it out! My skin goes through periods of time where it’s dry, and this cream is moisturizing, but not too heavy. I also love how light the scent is, and I look forward to seeing brightening results! love!
