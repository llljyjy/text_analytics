I bought this product because a salesperson recommended it to me because of my dry skin. I have sensitive and dry skin with dermatitis. It’s something that makes me insecure because of the flakiness of my skin and so I usually feel the need to carry around a small container of moisturizer in my bag on the go just in case. Since I work with kids, I don’t really have the opportunity to step away and run to the bathroom to apply more moisturizer. When I told this to the salesperson, she quickly suggested this because it’s a product that I can spray and go. After using the product for a week, I was so impressed. My face feels softer than ever and my skin doesn’t feel dry and flakey. I love the convenience and the fine spritz of the sprayer. I can fit it in my fanny pack and it doesn’t leak. There are too many good things to say about this product. If you have dry sensitive skin, just buy it and see for yourself! For the girlies with dry sensitive skin
