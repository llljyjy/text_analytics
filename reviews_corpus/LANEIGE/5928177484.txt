I got to try out this product from the birthday gift kit I received last year. I can definitely say this is one of my favorites. My lips get quite dry in the winter months and lip balms are a temporary fix. HOWEVER, this product, when I put it on at night, it keeps my lips moisturized until the next morning. I love this product and would have never tried it out if I hadnâ€™t gotten my hands on the sample first. Exceeded my expectations! nan
