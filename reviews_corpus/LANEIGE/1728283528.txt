It’s genuinely a bummer that they replaced the original formula. The container shapes are pretty cute and easy to use, but the inside isn’t the same. Not a very thicc hydrating moment if you’re down for it. Suitable for anyone who prefers light and fast-absorbing formula instead of heavy and slow-absorbing, it’s definitely for you. I had been loyal to those products, but it’s not the same and not really working for my skin anymore. Gotta bail those Laneige products. Hope to be able to find the dupe of the original formula, please lemme know if there’s any dupe! Bummer news for folks who love heavy cream
