I received a 10ml size pot of this  product from my earned points. On the first week I tried it twice as a sleep mask. The next day of the first application, my face felt so tight after rinsing it off. On the second attempt, I applied a good goopy layer. But next day after rinsing well, my skin still felt really tight. I’ve used other sleep masks, this one seems NOT hydrating at all.  On the following week, I gave it a go and used it as just an evening moisturizer. I did it for only two nights. I just couldn’t do it any longer. I have oily/combination skin…on the mature side and no other product has even made my skin so dehydrated. Thank goodness for sample sizes. Not for mature skin
