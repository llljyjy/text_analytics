As a picky individual, I absolutely love this product!I’m not a fan of most lip products. I don’t enjoy feeling something sit on my lips, and I don’t want to worry about perfectly reapplying something once it fades. I also don’t enjoy “milky,” tingling, or shimmery lip products. I struggle to find a product that avoids all of these things. The lip glowy balms, however, live up to my picky standards!They have the perfect liquid lip balm texture! They give me a nourishing, cushiony feeling on the lips without being heavy or sticky. I never feel them unless I rub my lips together. They give my lips a glossy appearance and fill in my lip lines without being a lip plumping/tingling product. They also give a perfectly sheer, non-milky and non-shimmery tint that lasts for a decent time on the lips. Once they fade away, they sink in like a normal lip balm would. They don’t leave behind a weird residue that other similar formulas often do. Reapplication is therefore super easy and unproblematic! I have all five flavors/shades and I truly use every one of them! I typically use Berry (pink tint), Grapefruit (pinky-orange tint), Peach (orange tint), or Gummy Bear (lavender tint) when I wear makeup, while I wear Pear (clear) at any time. (I think that Laneige is discontinuing Pear, so I stocked up on it from the Laneige website directly. I’m heartbroken!)Each scent is perfectly fruity/juicy, fresh, and subtle. The scent also fades away after application, so there is no worry about headaches. The tints are all beautiful, but they are quite similar, so you don’t need every one. The packaging is also perfect. It has a smooth, mess-free applicator that can be used to apply the product directly to the lips. The colors of the tubes match the flavor/scent, and the tubes themselves are standard and functional. Overall, I highly recommend these to anyone, especially to my picky people! Perfect for everyone!
