Got this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox. Initially the packaging looks big and a bit bulky for an eye cream, but thats mainly due to the lid. It is cute! I like the light scent and way it applies. My undereyes def look well hydrated and helps with dryness and fine lines! I like this product overall and this laneige line! nan
