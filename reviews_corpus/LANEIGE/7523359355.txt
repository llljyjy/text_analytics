I’m really surprised to read negative reviews about this lip sleep mask because I absolutely love getting the sample sizes with my points or for my birthday every year! I hate dry cracked lips and other than Medicated Blistex.. nothing seemed to work until I found this! Even my fiancée is pushing me to get two of the new flavours in full sizes since he has started using it too! We wear it through the day as well not just over night. We do NOT wash it off EVER and our lips have never felt better! We are a pretty affectionate couple so we kiss a lot and his whiskers often chafe up my lips and surrounding skin but …this gets rid of the lip irritation in no time! If my lips become super dry & peely.. this lip mask seems to slough off peeling skin at the source and seal the little nasty paper like cuts the peeled skin leaves. I’m so excited to get the new flavours and I hope they actually taste good! I’m out of samples now so .. I’m going to jump in like Hubby wants me to and order 2. If they are not up to standard.. I’ll return them but I really hope that’s not the case.  He said doesn’t even care if there’s a pigment .. that’s how much he loves this!  I’m really hoping that the full size is actually the same quality as the sample size since there have been some comments in that regard. It’s not cool to lure us with a great product if you are changing the amount of certain ingredients in the full sizes. The last thing I want is drier lips. Summer is just around the corner so we will be all set! OH… I kept my sample sized pots so that I can put some product from the larger sized pots in there and it’s easier to toss in my purse or beach bag when travelling.  I’ll try to post reviews on the different flavours after I try them! Happy Spring everyone!! I’m in love with this MIRACLE LIP MASK!
