I recently finished using my moisturizer and I was looking for a new one that does not irritate my skin. It was so hard to find because so many moisturizers had reviews saying it broke them out really bad. But this one, I am absolutely loving it so far. I got the package yesterday and I applied it before sleep. The next morning my skin is feeling so soft and moisturized like this is insane. This one does smell really pleasant but I was kind of worried because I did not know how my skin would react to fragrance. I searched it up and it says it has less than 1 percent of fragrance, and it did NOT irritate my skin. Also, some of yâ€™all are saying that they think the plastic container would be bad for the environment. Guess what? It is biodegradable! Not sure how my skin would react after using it for a long time but after one day of using it, my skin is feeling greater than ever. wow
