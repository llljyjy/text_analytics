First off I love the packaging of this cream and that it comes with its own spatula to keep things as sanitary as possible. My second love is how it smells and how that makes it enjoyable to use. I have super dry skin though and while I do like this cream I think it would be better suited for someone with combination or oily skin. It absorbs into the skin very quickly and I’ve found it to have a very matte finish to it, which I don’t love for my skin. Overall I think it’s a good product, just better suited for other skin types than what I have. nan
