Love the texture and smell! A little bit of this cream goes a long way, if it pills maybe use less product. It has a faint floral scent that is pleasant and is not noticeable once the cream is on. I have not had any drying issues with it nor any negative skin reactions. I find it very hydrating and calming to my skin. I tried the prior water bank formula briefly years ago so I can’t  really  compare this to the old formula. If you’re looking for a good every day cream for dry skin this is definitely it! Feels like butter
