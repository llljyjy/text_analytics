I got this #freeproduct from topbox. I have sensitive skin and this product did not irritate my skin at all. I use it at night time and followed the instructions to apply a little bit on targeted areas every other night the first week before using it every night. I think that was a great way to introduce retinol into my nightly routine without irritating my skin. I do notice a bit of improvement on my skin after 3 weeks. Hopefully it’ll be even after after the 5th week. Its quick absorbing without any tacky/oily feel. Lightly scented which I really like. Retinol that’s good for sensitive skin
