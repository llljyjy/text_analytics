I have a LOT of Laneige products. I was a huge fan of their previous water bank cream so of course I got this one. I have to say, I like it better than the original. The fragrance is toned down a lot and it really keeps my skin moisturized for over a day. This will be a staple in my skincare routine. Better than the original
