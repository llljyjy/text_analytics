I’ve been using a sample of the old formula and LOVED it - cool and refreshing with a light scent, but it’s no longer available. Purchased the new formula assuming it would be as good, if not better. Terribly disappointed & annoyed that the new formula is completely different - strong scent, sticky, not at all refreshing and makes my dry skin feel itchy and tight. Old formula > New formula
