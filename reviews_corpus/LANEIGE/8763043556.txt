If I’m being honest, I was disappointed. I was expecting more based on what I heard about it. Yes it was nice while it was on, but as for moisturizing and healing, my lips felt no different when I woke up in the morning after having it on all night. I used up the whole container and didn’t find it ever did anything for me. I have simple lip balms that make my lips feel way better! I wanted to love it :( nan
