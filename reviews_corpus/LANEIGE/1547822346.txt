I wanted to like this but am really disappointed. The formula is very thin, and doesnâ€™t actually hydrate my skin for more than a few minutes. After applying, it dissolves into the skin, and my face feels dry again very quickly. An overnight cream/mask should do much better. Not moisturizing at all
