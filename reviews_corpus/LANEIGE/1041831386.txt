This was sent to me by #trywithtopbox as a #freeproduct for exchange of my honest review. Firstly, I LOVE the packaging! The twist bottle made it very convenient to use. The serum was light and smelled really nice with over powering. It absorbed into my skin quickly and instantly my skin felt smoother and hydrated. This is especially great to use at night after cleansing since my face tends to be very dry after a shower. Overall, I really liked this and will purchase this when I run out! Feels so good!
