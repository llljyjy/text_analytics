I got this product as part of the birthday gift. I would not have ever bought this on my own. The claims of this overnight moisturizer is to hydrate, brighten, and soften. As far as hydration I do feel that this is a lightweight hydrator. However I keep needing to apply more and more as my skin will suck it all up in about 5 minutes and then I continue to apply more layers and my skin absorbs it. So although it is hydrating I do need to use a lot of product to get there. I did not notice a brightening effect. My skin does feel extremely soft after using this product. I think this is the strongest supported claim in my experience. There is a fragrance in this product which smells very generic fresh/clean smell. I don’t think a fragrance is necessary. I am also confused about why this is a sleeping mask. This doesn’t really seem to be very hydrating unless a ton of product is used I think it would need to be locked in with an oil. I have sensitive skin and this product did not sting my face. I will not purchase this item but I didn’t mind using the sample. It was nice but not special to me. just okay
