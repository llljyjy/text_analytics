The Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask with Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C is probably the most life-changing product I’ve ever used, so I bought this one just in case it was even better. It’s fine, but the lip sleeping mask is so much better - it’s way more hydrating and nourishing. If you have dry, chapped lips, go with that one. Meh
