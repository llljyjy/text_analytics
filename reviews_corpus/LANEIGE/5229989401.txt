Best chapstick known to man. This and the overnight mask are to die for. I’m a red head so already sensitive skin, plus being on accutane and having eczema! This stuff makes my lips feel like BUTTER. It is more of a lip “gloss” than chapstick obviously but as long as that doesn’t bother you, this will replace any chapstick you’ve ever tried. HOLY GRAIL
