I received this product for free from Topbox to try it and give my honest review. I have been using it for the past few weeks and I have been loving the product. I have especially loved the unique packaging of this product; it is very different and unique. I have been using this product in the morning and evening after some toner. It has a gel/cream-like consistency. I use about 2.5 pumps for my face. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves your skin feeling very hydrated, radiant, and smooth. I notice immediately that my skin feels much softer after using this product. After applying moisturizer on top of the serum, my skin feels hydrated for the rest of the day. Overall, I have been loving this product and how it has made my skin look and feel. #TryWithTopbox #FreeProduct Best Serum Ever
