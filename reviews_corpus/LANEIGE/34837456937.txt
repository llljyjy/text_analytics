I’ve been using this product for more than three weeks, and I can state with certainty that I adore it. The first week was a little discouraging because I didn’t really see any results, but as soon as I switched my application method and started using cotton pads rather than my bare hands, I could instantly feel how much hydration it was giving my skin, making it glowy and healthy! The $50 price tag is a downside, but overall I do recommend. Quite hydrating!
