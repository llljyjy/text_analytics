This is an excellent toner, which is in fact is more like a light watered down lotion.  After I wash my face I apply it and pat it in.  Once it soaks in, I either apply my moisturizer or a bedtime masque.  Side note, Iâ€™ve put it into a small spray bottle and it works even better (no waste of product on a cotton square).
