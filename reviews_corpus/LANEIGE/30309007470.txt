Only used it once but my lips feel nice and moisturized. After getting this mini berry one in a Sephora favorites set, I ordered the 5 mini Laneige lip mask set so I’m excited to try out all the different scents to see which I would buy in a full size. Berry smells good but it’s nothing special. It’s good!
