I received this product in exchange of an honest review through Top Box Circle. The product is easy to use, and comes with easy to follow instructions right on the packaging. I have been using this product at nighttime on my forehead after washing my face. I have already noticed a slight difference in my fine lines being reduced after two weeks of use, but will continue to keep using it since Iâ€™m already liking the results. My first time using a retinol cream has overall been a success! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox So far so good!
