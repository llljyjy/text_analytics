The first time I tried this mask I received as a mini in a Sephora favourite. First they smell great, I like that you don’t need to use a lot. Honestly if I did not lose it My first one it would still be so much product. I apply this on my lips all the time. Its great to use on matt lipstick. Specially the one that leaves your lips crusty… would I use this on my lips after my lips are cracked and bleeding no. However, I use it all the time it keeps your lips nice and soft. Its just not the product you wear in -30 or high 30. I have purchased almost every single color/flavour available. They are just that good. make my lips feel plump
