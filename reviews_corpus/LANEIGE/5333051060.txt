I was willing to give this a try since I normally love anything laneige and even got my husband to use and love their products. But, to say that I was devastated by how different this was from the old formula (which was an incredible god send) would be an understatement. This is not nearly as moisturizing and is overall immensely lackluster for the price tag. Def skip this, and keep your fingers and toes crossed that Laneige brings back the original water bank hydro gel, cause this is NOT IT. Not moisturizing. Not a good texture. Not good packaging (I mean come on, why would you make something harder to open?). Truly, any other drugstore brand would probably be better than this. 10x Worse Than the Original Formula
