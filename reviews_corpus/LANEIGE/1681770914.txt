I regularly use the original water sleeping mask from laneige on a daily basis. But since receiving this as a #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox, I’ve switched up my routine to include this instead. Dare I say it’s more hydrating than the original formula? Yes! It pairs amazingly with the laneige cream skin and moisturizes my face and neck all night. There is no weird film or greasy residue, and the scent is light and refreshing, which is great since I prefer a lot of my skincare to be fragrance free. It does not work as a standalone product for me during these winter months as I have extremely dry sensitive skin, but I find it retains moisture better with a heavier oil based serum. Within the past 2 weeks, I’ve used this product on the daily and I’m thoroughly impressed with the light texture and the splash of hydration you feel immediately after you layer this on your face. Highly recommend! It would work as a standalone product for warmer months so please try this out! great hydration for your dry skin!
