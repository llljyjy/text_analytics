This product and packaging is really nice and unique. It does seem slightly bulky for what it is but I donâ€™t mind it and I appreciate that it comes with a scooped for the cream although I will most likely lose it.  The cream itself is lightweight and slightly gel like but very moisturizing. It holds hydration better than any of my other moisturizers in a gel consistency. I love how it feels on my skin and it absorbs pretty quickly. This has a very light fresh fragrance. I have dry skin and I think this is a perfect everyday daytime moisturizer. I would definitely recommend this. Holds moisture on dry skin
