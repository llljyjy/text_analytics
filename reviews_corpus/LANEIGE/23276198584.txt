I can’t find anything that even comes close to the epic hydration this brings to my lips!! I moved to Oregon, where its surprisingly dry for how green it is, and my lips were BREAKING OUT like crazy and getting the absolute worst rashes of my life around my mouth. I kept trying to use chap sticks and natural and organic lip balms, but none of them worked. I originally got a sample of this and got hooked!! This stuff actually worked and I haven’t broken out around my mouth ever since. My only complaint, is some of the questionable ingredients, but if it works then I’m not going back to getting rashes or having dry lips again!! I got some for my mom, but it gave her some sort of allergic reaction so be careful and read the ingredients first!! Not organic, but nothing else works as well...
