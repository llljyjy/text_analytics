This feels like a moisturizer going on which is really nice in my opinion.  I think the scent is very mild, and my skin didnâ€™t sting at all putting this on.  I would recommend not putting it to close to your eyes or on your eyelids.  Once you begin to sweat, your eyes will sting just like any other sunscreen.  You will have a slightly oily or slick feel to your skin, but my makeup sat well on top of it. nan
