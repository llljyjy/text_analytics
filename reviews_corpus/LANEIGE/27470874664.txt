Firstly, I didn’t know I needed a water mask until I tried  the Laneige Water Sleeping Mask !! I’ve been using this sleeping mask for the past 3 weeks as a part of my night time routine with my Laneige water bank moisturizing cream and I’ve seen an incredible difference with my dry skin. I love how this mask is soft and feels so cool on application. In the mornings my face feels hydrated,  moisturized,  lifted and looks so radiantly bright! This sleeping water mask is definitely one of my favorites to add to my winter skin routine. Thanks to #topbox for giving me this opportunity to test this #freeproduct An Amazing Product
