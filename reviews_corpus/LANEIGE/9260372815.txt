So I first got this directly from the Laneige website but because I needed just this and they weren’t offering free shipping I decided to get it from Sephora. I couldn’t believe it was a knock off. The box came with the blue stripe at the bottom which is the first indication, the originals come in an all pink box. Also, the original comes with a neatly folded paper with ingredients, instructions etc. I opened my box underneath to see if it was there but there was nothing. I mean, if I didn’t know otherwise I’d think it was the original because it feels almost as good but the scent is off and the consistency is different. Can’t trust to buy anything else off of here.
