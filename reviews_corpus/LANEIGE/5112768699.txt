I have 3 other laneige lip masks: sweet candy, mint choco, ginger snap. I love mango anything so I had to get the new one and it’s a bit of a disappointment. The scent is not as strong as the others at all. It’s a very faint mango scent. The actual product seems to feel the same on the lips but if you’re looking for a burst of mango this isn’t it. nan
