I was using the previous version of the Water Bank Cream which was a silky and luxurious moisturizer that provided perfect hydration without making my oily skin feel like an oil slick. I decided to try this new gel version thinking it would somehow work the same for my oily skin. What a disappointment. It really doesn’t do much of anything, and certainly doesn’t provide enough hydration. I just don’t understand why brands change their formulations so often, because in most cases the newer formulas pale in comparison to the better performing older formulas. Average and over priced
