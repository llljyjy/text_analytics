A good lip moisturizer! I used to wake up to frequently chapped and peeling lips, especially in the cold winter mornings, but after using this product for the last month, my lips really havenâ€™t felt chapped at all.I do recommend applying some before applying lipstick to provide a hydrating barrier between your lips and whatever lip product you want to use.In terms of scent, however, the gummy bear and sweet candy scents are way better than the vanilla in my opinion. The vanilla smells a little off! Super hydrating, and smells great!
