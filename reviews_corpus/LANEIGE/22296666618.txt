I already loved this product, but just got a holiday set with the pumpkin spice scent and about died over the deliciousness of the scent. It doesn’t taste like pumpkin. It simply smells great. And, it’s tremendously moisturizing. I have dry lips and this stuff keeps them soft and supple. It also provides a glossy shine which I really appreciate when I don’t want to wear lipstick but do want something with a shine. I truly love this product. Can we talk about pumpkin spice? So good!
