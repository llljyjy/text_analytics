After seeing this product all over TikTok I was super excited to finally try it and see what all the hype was about. The product itself is super cute, smells amazing, and is easy to apply/ smooth when put on. I used it for about three nights in a row and honestly it did nothing but dry out my lips. I have semi sensitive skin so this could also be a reason why this didn’t work for me. In my opinion, if you have sensitive skin or lips that are more prone to being dry- save your money and just buy some Vaseline. (This is just my personal experience and what does/ doesn’t work for me may differ for you!) Not worth the hype
