This product does calm my skin but I donâ€™t find that they hydration stays through the day even with adding a moisturizer before applying the mask as directed and after rinsing the mask off the following day. If you need to eleviate redness more than adding moisture to your skin, I would recommend this product but if you are looking for hydration over redness relief, I would not recommend this product. Calming but not very hydrating
