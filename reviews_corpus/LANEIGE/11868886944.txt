I actually really enjoy this! I use it as a regular moisturize under my makeup during the day and at night as part of my skincare routine. Iit’s lightweight, non greasy and doesn’t really have a smell to it. My skin can be picky when it comes to products and I had no issue with this whatsoever!  I got this free from topbox and it will definitely be buying  some when I run out! #freeproduct Would recommend!!
