Good, really pretty and fun applicator but it doesn’t stay in like and basically evaporates off, it’s sort if moisturizing , I use it more as a lip gloss. But it’s really pretty on lips and I love using it. Minus one star cause it slides off really easily. 4 stars for nice applicator, pretty in lips, and the moisture pretty product, eh turnout
