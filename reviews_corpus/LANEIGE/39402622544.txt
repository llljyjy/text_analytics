#freeproduct #trywithtopbox I try this product as part of a TopBox campaign, i was so excited because I have read very good opinions about this korean brand.Firstable, I used it at morning, the first thing that called my attention is the package which brings a small applicator, so you donâ€™t need to put the cream with your fingers, second it has an unnoticeable scent that I like, and the texture is like water gel very gently with the skin and as soon as you applied it you see you skin more shiny and moisturized, after using it for a week I can say that the skin around my eyes looks more relieved, soothed and brighten.
