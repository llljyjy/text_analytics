If you aren’t used to essences, the watery texture is a surprise, but it works the same as a serum. I put it in my hands rather than a pad so I don’t lose product to the pad and pat into my face. It gives a really nice glow with a only slightly tacky finish which I feel plays nicely with my sunscreen or other actives, but it is not oily in the slightest which can be an issue with a lot of vitamin C serums. Great for acne prone skin, or if you are combining with another active and don’t want to get too much weight on your skin. It’s doing a nice job evening out my complexion and I love the glow without a dewy finish. An oil free vitamin c option!
