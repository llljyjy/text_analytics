I received this product complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest review. I am in live with the cutest bottle it come in. First step to attract customers is good packaging and it scored 10/10 for that. The bottle color and design are soothing and  eye catchy. Coming to product, it has semi liquid texture and small amount is enough to do its job. I have oily/combination skin and definitely needs good hyaluronic acid products to compensate for all oil control products I use. The product claims to improve elasticity and smooth texture,l and made of ingredients that can be absorbed into skin easily. It seems I have found my holy grail ptoduct as it does exactly as it claims. My skin looks hydrated and healthy after using it. No heaviness and skin can breate and nourish at the same time. Love it!
