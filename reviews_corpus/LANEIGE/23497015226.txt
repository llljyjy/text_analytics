I got this as a #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox. I think this sleeping mask has been reformulated, but this is my first time trying it. It absorbs into my skin pretty fast which I like because I know it’s not my pillow case absorbing everything. I usually use it on its own, but if my skin feels extra dry I’ll put a moisturizer before using. I really like the smell of it, but beware if you have sensitive skin. nan
