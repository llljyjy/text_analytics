So I really love Laneige as a brand! I am sad that they no longer sell the pear scented glows balm at Sephora! That one is my absolute favorite. The peach one is okay. I do not think it really smells like peach. It does make my lips feel nice. Although a little sticky in the beginning but it goes away after the balm warms up on your lips. This also has a bit of tint in it. I don’t feel like it goes well with my lip color but most people are not seeing it anyways so it doesn’t matter. As I stated In the beginning I love the brand however I do not think I will be purchasing any more of the these unless they bring back the pear (which is the best one in my opinion). Soft lips
