This cream is lovely for firming skin, it is a bit small for my liking. Almost like an eye cream size but for your entire face. I believe this is more of a spot treatment sort of thing. Iâ€™ve been using around my eyes exclusively and I can see a plumper effect for sure. So keep that in mind before purchasing. Works but is small
