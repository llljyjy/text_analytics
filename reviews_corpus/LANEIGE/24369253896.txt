I received this product for free from Topbox. I am not usually someone who uses a lot of serums, but this one was so smooth and light on my skin. It’s water based, which I am learning I am a huge fan of. I love the packaging and bottle too, it’s quite fancy and elegant haha. Overall, I had a great experience with this product. It pairs well with the moisturizer as well. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
