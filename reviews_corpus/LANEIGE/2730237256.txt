I received a complimentary Laneige Water Sleeping Mask in exchange for my honest review.LANEIGE, you did something here! I was quite impressed with my results after using this sleeping mask. After cleansing & moisturizing , I applied the mask all over my face & neck. In the morning, my skin was so incredibly soft, and hydrated! The mask absorbed into my skin, and didn’t transfer onto my pillow. It was also non-greasy & came with a mini spatula so you don’t have to dip your fingers into the jar. How cool?! Overall 5/5 - Will def be continuing to add this mask this to my skincare routine going forward! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
