Iâ€™ve been using this for just a little bit now and honestly, it is such an amazing product!! I love how small and easy it is for transport (perfect travel size). It smells amazing and feels so nice on my lips!! After using, my lips feel so moisturized and nourished. I loved this so much. Downside, can be sticky, my hair will sometimes get stuck to my lips but not overly stuck. I definitely recommend!! FAV!! nan
