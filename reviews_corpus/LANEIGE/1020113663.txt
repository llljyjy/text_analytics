I am on my 2nd bottle!  I am pretty oily, and I use this in my nighttime regimen as more of an essence before my pm moisturizer. it would be too sticky for me to use during the day.  At night, it feels wonderful, a boost for my pm moisturizer.  I even stocked up on the travel size bottles. I am definitely taking this on vacation with me. I am 62. This is a wonderful product for mature skin too. very moisturizing!
