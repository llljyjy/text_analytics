I decided to try this as I had never used a lip mask at night. I find that it smells nice, pretty easy to apply, and does moisturize. However, I find that the products I was using before (drugstore lip rescue, lip scrubs, etc) have nearly the same effect at a fraction of the cost. Decent, but cheaper products do the trick
