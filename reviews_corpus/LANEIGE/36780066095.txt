I recieved this product for free from TopBox Circle for my honest review. I have used this serum in combination with the moisturizer and even without moisturizer, it simply works great. Itâ€™s very light in putting to the skin and gets absorbed quickly. I use it before going to bed too. My skin feels smooth and supple now. I love the packaging too. I have already recommended to my friend. First ever serum which was easy on acne and pores. Thank you topbox for letting me try the sample. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Smooth silky serum (SSS)
