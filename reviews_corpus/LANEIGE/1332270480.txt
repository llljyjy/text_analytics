I rarely fall in love with a product the first time I use it, but this is one of those times. I got the sample of this and tried it one night before bed; immediately opened the app and ordered the full size. I was skeptical before trying it, as I haven’t been that impressed with other Laneige products, but I’ve been using it every night for a couple weeks now, and I love how soft and moisturized my skin feels! I’ve been searching for a nighttime moisturizer for forever and have finally found what I need!! nan
