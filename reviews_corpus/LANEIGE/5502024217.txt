My favourite moisturizer. I received a sample of this cream and loved it so much that I purchased the full size. I have rosacea and sensitive skin and most moisturizers make my rosacea act up. This moisturizer hydrates my skin without irritating it and gives the most beautiful subtle glow without making me greasy throughout the day. Also a beautiful base before makeup. A little pricey but so worth the money. nan
