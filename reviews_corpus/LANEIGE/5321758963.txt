I got a valentine’s day collab last year that came with the mini size and the full size. A year and a few months later I’ve only now finished the mini size after daily use. This stuff lasts so long. I’ve found it to be silkier than vaseline and aquaphor. It lasts all night on your lips and you wake up with it still feeling super soft and moisturized. However in terms of long term effects, it’s comparable to aquaphor, just with prettier packaging and a flavor/color. Lasts forever and works well
