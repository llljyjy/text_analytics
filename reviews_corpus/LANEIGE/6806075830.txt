I really wanted to love this as I’m a huge fan of laneige but this didn’t keep my skin hydrated for more than 30 minutes. For the record, I have really dry skin and live up in a high altitude dry desert so this may work better for those needing just a regular amount of hydration. On to the pros- I had zero irritation or acne pop up while using this mask. My face more often than not has an acne breakout when I use sleeping masks or heavy overnight creams so I was happy to see this wasn’t the case with this one! It was easy to apply as well. I recommend it for those needing regular amount of hydration. For those with severe dry skin give this a pass. Good for regular hydration
