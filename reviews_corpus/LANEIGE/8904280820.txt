I was first reluctant buying the new formula after they’ve switched it AGAIN within the past two years,  it to my surprise this one is the best one yet! It is the most gentle and absorbs so well and fast into my extremely dry skin. I’ve tried many expensive American and foreign creams, and this is the only one that provides a plethora of moisture as well as causes no irritation to my skin. My skin is very sensitive, that even a little bit of acid or alcohol can make it sting and burn and because of it, I’m not able to use most skincare products. This cream and Kiehls moisturizer are the only ones that don’t burn my skin, but this one provides so much more moisture than the Kiel’s. I’ve been using this for the past 6 years and to this day haven’t found a cream that comes even close. Absolute savior for dry and sensitive skin!!
