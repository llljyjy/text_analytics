Let me start by saying that I don’t write a great deal of reviews. However, I’m actually very impressed by this product. Let me also say, I did NOT receive it as a promotion. I was a devoted Clarisonic user for MANY years. My dermatologist hated that. For many reasons but, most importantly because you couldn’t really get it sterile. I continued to use it without incident (thank god) but, I understood his point. When I saw this with silicone bristles, I thought, problem solved. But, would it work? It does! I actually love the way it cleans. It’s gentle on the skin but still cleans. As for the heating side? I honestly thought it was hype. But then I tried it after applying my serums and oil. I LOVE it! It’s truly a clever design and they do have great customer support. Which is great given there is no manual and the website is lacking. Definitely A Must Have Tool
