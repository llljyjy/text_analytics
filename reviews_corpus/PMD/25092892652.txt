I have NO REGRETS purchasing this! It’s been a long decade so I decided to treat myself to this and it’s what I didn’t know I needed. It’s super easy to clean and one full charge will literally last you a couple weeks to a month or more depending on frequency of use! Only thing is you need to really PUSH the charging cable down to charge it, so put some elbow grease when you’re getting ready to charge it. It’s got 2 continuous vibration settings and also 2 pounding vibration settings. The second setting to both is just a more intense version of the one before it. The stone side also heats up. A little too warm for my liking, but I got used to it so now I love it when I’m massaging my eye area right when I wake up. This will make your cleanser last longer too because you don’t necessarily need to use a lot of product; this beauty lathers your cleansers nicely! LOVE
