I purchased this because am a sucker for “cute“ little things and all things crystal. If you are too, like me and that is why you want to buy this - DONT lol. Maybe it is because I didn’t get this for free but I think any facial silicone brush will give you the same clean feeling as this. My face does feel clean after using this but it also does with any cleansing brush while doing skincare. It just isn’t worth the money in my opinion but I will be using it since I have already paid for it. I purchased an older model for my boyfriend for about $20. If you can find that type of deal, go for it. Ehhh - I feel fancy using it!
