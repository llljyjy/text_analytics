PMD Clean Pro is a really fascinating product. It breaks down dirt within the pores at 7,000 vibrations per minute! Powerful, yet gentle on your skin. Created with ultra-hygienic silicone to be antibacterial and odor resistant. Recommend for all skin types. The handle makes it easy to grip while in the shower (since it is waterproof) and the four different speeds for deep cleaning and massaging are great! I was very excited when I received the Jade PMD Pro from PMD in exchange for my honest opinion. Jade is a stone that is calming and balancing. I felt that it really improves my redness and sensitive skin. Since using Clean Pro, my husband notices how much more my face glows. I really love this product!!! Fascinating Skincare Device
