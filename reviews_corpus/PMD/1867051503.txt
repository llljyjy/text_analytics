This product was initially not what I was expecting, but rather I’m actually surprised at how simple and fool-proof it is to use this device!There are two attachment heads (caps), a smaller one for the face, and a larger one for your hand/foot area. How it works is very simple, there are different inserts (discs) that you have housed in the respect cap that’s slightly right below the cap opening. This rotates inside and the cap “vacuums” the skin to be physically moved near the discs to have a very gentle micro-exfoliation.I honestly recommend this if you have slightly texture in your skin, as it will be easier to manage and maintain your skin. I also recommend watching the tutorial videos if you’re not familiar with using high-tech tools on your skin. So easy to use!
