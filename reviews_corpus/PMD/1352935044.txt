After a year of using the FOREO Luna 3, I decided to try the PMD device for its “serum side” - a feature that doesn’t exist for the FOREO. I really wanted to like this but the FOREO is a much better cleansing device. The PMD is uniform all around so it’s about 1” all around so it doesn’t clean around my nose cause it doesn’t just “get there”. The FOREO on the other hand has a tapered end and covers 100% of my face. Wish there was a device that was the best of both. It’s not worth the price for a serum applicator. not as good as the FOREO Luna 3
