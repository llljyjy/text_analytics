I felt that the PMD pro was pretty easy to use. I inserted the softest disk first to practice on my skin to make sure that I wasn’t so abrasive with it. I had to play with it a little bit to fully understand how to properly maneuver the device around my face. It was easy to use after a while. I made sure  to press down so the disk could work it’s magic. After using it for a few weeks I do feel my pores look better. I also noticed my skins redness diminished too. Works
