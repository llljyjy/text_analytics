All I can say is wow! I have a sensitive skin and keratosis pilaris on my face and this product has made a world of a difference! Even the active warmth setting is gentle and does not irritate my face. I have tried many products but this one by far has been the most helpful in leaving my skin smooth and soft. I recommend it 100%. Game changer!
