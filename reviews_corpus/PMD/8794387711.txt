Let’s be honest… a facial cleansing brush or whatever you wanna call this doesn’t need 5 different pulse settings. The vibration doesn’t do anything special to your skin if you’re looking for a cosmetic difference. Maybe it increases absorption by a percent? But it’s not doing much for you. Actual ingredients like retinol, chemical exfoliants, and hydrating surfactants are going to do that for you — expensive face vibrator or not. I’m pretty sure this was made for rich woman to splurge on because they think the vibrations will do something and a lot of people don’t like cleansing with their hands. That’s understandable. But spending $69+ dollars for that? No ma’am. I got this in a subscription beauty box so thankfully I didn’t actually have to pay full amount. Makes an actual lovely vibrator though. expensive vibrator
