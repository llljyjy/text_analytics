I brought this for my sister after her Clarisonic stopped working and she though it was just okay and prefers her Clarisonic more. I’ve also tried it myself and felt the same. I wished the bristles are longer. It doesn’t feel like it cleans well. 3 days because I do like the multiple settings and it feels like a massage on my face. Just okay
