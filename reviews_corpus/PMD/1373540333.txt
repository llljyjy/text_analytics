I find this really easy to use and absolutely love the results. I was a little apprehensive of the suction at first as I get red and bruise easily, but was pleasantly surprised that I experience neither with this. I also have pretty sensitive skin that’s often irritated by exfoliation and this does not cause any issues. In addition to these I was absolutely floored by the results, I’m a huge skincare lover and have been lucky to try some amazing products and devices and the results from this are unmatched. It makes my skin incredibly smooth and leaves my skin absolutely glowing once products are applied. I can’t wait to use it more! Unmatched Results
