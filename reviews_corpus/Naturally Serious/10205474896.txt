This Mineral Sun Defense Moisturizer: Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30 I was recently gifted by Naturally Serious has a different texture than normal sunscreens do which I am not a fan of. It felt like a scrub or like I am rubbing a very fine sand on my face. It blends easily after working it out for a minute but honestly for me, it felt a little heavy.  I am happy that it fid not made me tear up. Itâ€™s definitely different and not for me. Gritty texture
