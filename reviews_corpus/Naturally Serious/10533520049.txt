Great mask! I have combination skin so I typically rely on mud masks only to overstrip/overdry this mask is great because it uses colloidal oatmeal which leaves your skin so soft and hydrated but also has kaolin clay to remove impurities, highly recommended if you have aging skin that is still acne prone like mine. Great for combination skin
