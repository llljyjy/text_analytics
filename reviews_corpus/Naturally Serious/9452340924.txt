The Naturally Serious Supercharge Anti-Oxidant Moisture Serum is a good product. I like that it comes in an easy to dispense pump bottle so you can control the amount you want to apply. The serum is thicker in consistency compared to other serums I have used. It has a thicker texture and is a milky white color which completely absorbs into the skin. Although it is thicker and creamier than some serums, it does not leave a residue or tacky feeling on the skin. The serum has a very mild herbal scent which is noticeable but eventually dissipates. Itâ€™s incredibly hydrating and my skin felt moisturized immediately. I had been having really dry skin so this helped to soothe my face and left it feeling soft and hydrated. Overall very nice skin care product. nan
