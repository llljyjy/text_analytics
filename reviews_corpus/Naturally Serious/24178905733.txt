Really surprised that this left my skin fairly matte. Which tempted me to try it on my face during my morning routine:) I didn’t feel like it was super hydrating but just enough for me. Extremely dry skin may want something heavier but for other oily people I would recommend it. I actually like the scent because it’s very light and not obnoxious or synthetic smelling. It a beautiful whipped texture too. I love that it’s all natural and it also makes a fantastic hand cream as well. It’s lightweight but it does leave a kind of slippery/silky feeling behind. The texture is wonderful
