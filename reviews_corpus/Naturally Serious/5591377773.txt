I love the bright, fun and stylish design of the packaging and the company’s commitment to clean product formulation. This serum is very lightweight, yet creamy, and absorbs into the skin quickly with no residue, leaving the skin velvety, nourished, protected and deeply moisturized. It has a rather strong natural scent straight out of the bottle, though it doesn’t linger and dissipates quickly. nan
