This cream is great for overnight barrier repair! The cream is very thick and nourishing, so I was super surprised that it had a such mousse-like light feel to the touch. It’s definitely thick enough to leave a bit of the white case, but because it’s an overnight product I don’t really mind. I think this would be great for all skin types, even oily! Great overnight cream
