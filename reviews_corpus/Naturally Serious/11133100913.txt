I was really excited to try this product. The color is so fun and different from other products. It doesnâ€™t have too much of a scent. It more so just smells clean. The texture is really nice. I like the volcanic pumice. It makes for a lovely scrub. After rinsing this product off. I really feel rejuvenated. All my dry flaky skin is always gone. I am left with a nice glow. nan
