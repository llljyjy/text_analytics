Iâ€™ve been looking for a new physical exfoliant lately and enjoyed trying this one out. The gritty texture was satisfying to use & did a great job making my skin feeling renewed. Clay is always a great ingredient to have in masks. If you have sensitive skin, be sure to apply minimal pressure when applying the product. I have combo/oily skin and loved it. However I would not recommend if you have very dry sensitive skin. Great for combo/oily skin
