I received the Skin Warrior Moisture Rescue Cream gifted by Naturally Serious for testing and review purposes. This cream is amazingly good for my skin, as well as for the environment.  This lightweight formula with its beneficial ingredients is suitable for every skin type, from dry and sensitive to oily and combination, and so I love to use this cream every day. his powerful daily cream with Hyaluronic Acid and Colloidal Oatmeal helps build your moisture barrier to defend against the aging effects of pollutants and save skin from dryness. This cream contains Magnolia and Mangosteen which help reduce the look of fine lines, wrinkles and uneven skin tone from environmental damage.I have already recommended the Skin Warrior Moisture Rescue Cream to many of my friends and family and several of them have already purchased and used it and they all love their improved skin after they started using this cream.  They all love the fact how the Hyaluronic Acid and Squalane present in this cream help increase hydration and save their skin from dryness. Skin Warrior Moisture Rescue Cream!
