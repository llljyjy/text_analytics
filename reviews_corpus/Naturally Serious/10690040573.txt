These pads are great to use after I have cleansed my face. I swipe the peeling pad gently over my face in circular motions to remove any remaining sebum and dirt. It gently exfoliates my skin without a tight or dry feeling afterwards. These pads give my skin a clean, soothed, and moisturized feeling. My skin looks radiant after using these pads. The oat extract really calms and soothes my skin. These pads visibly improve the uneven tone and texture of my skin and give me clear healthy-looking skin. I really love these pads and highly recommend them. Makes skin soft and smooth
