Pleasantly surprised with these! I think the value is great for what you get. I have sensitive skin and was hesitant to use these twice in one day so I eased into it - used one PM and then made my way up to using once in the AM and once at PM. They do not irritate your skin, I didnâ€™t experience redness or over exfoliation as I typically would, no breakouts, and it really felt (and looked) like it cleaned my skin deeply. I recommend! Great product
