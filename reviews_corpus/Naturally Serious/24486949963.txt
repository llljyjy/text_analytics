This serum makes my skin look instantly more plumped and awake after use. The gel-like texture is really smooth and silky on the skin and dries down really nice and doesnâ€™t leave my skin feeling tight or sticky! The coconut and moringa oil are so hydrating and definitely drew me to this serum. I also love the lavender, I find it so soothing and comforting on my skin and the light botanical smell it gives the product as well. The packaging is nice and easy to pump too! Overall I really enjoy this serum and think the price point is so great! Silky Texture
