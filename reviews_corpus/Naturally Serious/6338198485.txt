Was definitely intrigued by this productâ€™s inclusion of peptides, which are such a great ingredient for the skin that I have had great experiences with from other products. This product is on par with other things from my collection in terms of performance, however, I find the texture and smell are a bit off from what I prefer. I feel that the texture is a bit squeaky (not sure how to better describe), which is a little off-putting, and the fragrance is borderline unpleasant to me with its herbal-ish smell. I would say if you can get a sample to test out the texture and smell before purchasing to do so. nan
