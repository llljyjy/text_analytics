I have been using this serum for about 10 days, the experience is really good. I can see my skin becomes more hydrated, moisturizing, softer and brighter. Itâ€™s not greasy and absorbed quickly. Also, I really love the glass bottle of this serum, I think it could keep the serum more safe and stable. Recommended
