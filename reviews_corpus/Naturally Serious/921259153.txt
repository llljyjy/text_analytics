I liked the convenience of the tube packaging and was easy to dispense. The texture was lightweight but felt creamy and had a slight scent. It did take longer for it to be absorbed. When it did, I noticed the feeling of it waking up my eye area. I believe it was the caffeine that helped it. I enjoyed the hydration and how it woke up my eyes. Initially, I couldnâ€™t see a difference. The longer I continued the application 2x a day, the more I was able to see the benefits. Overall, this eye cream was hydrating and gave me a refreshed look by reducing my puffiness. Helped wake up my eyes
