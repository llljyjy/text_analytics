These peel pads smell so fresh and clean and made my skin so soft! I have very sensitive skin but decided to try these since a lot of reviews mentioned it was fine for sensitive skin, well i agree- they made my skin so soft without any redness or irritation! There was a slight tingle when i first used it but it went away after a few seconds. Highly recommend if for sensitive skin. Also works well on rest of body like shoulders and chest! Made my skin instantly so smooth
