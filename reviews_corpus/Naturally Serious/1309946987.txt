I really like some of Naturally Serious’s products but this was a miss for me. First off: not only is this the first time I’m trying an exfoliating scrub on my face in years (I’ve shifted to exfoliating toners instead) so I was reminded of why I don’t use them anymore but also Secondly: this stains. Perhaps better for the sink rather than showers. Can get everywhere Stains
