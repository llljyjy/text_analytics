I have never used a product like this. I kind of see this as a “toner” or like “serum” in my routine, although it does not work like any of them and provides different purpose. I have used this on different occasions, but like it most when I feel like I have had a lot of oils on my face through the day, or sweat a lot. It’s great for post gym use! Hydrating and refreshing! Leaves my face glowing
