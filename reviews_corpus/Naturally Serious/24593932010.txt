I received this mineral sun defense moisturizer sunscreen gifted from naturally serious and Iâ€™m so excited I received this chance . This product is lightweight and perfect for all skin types.  I used a small amount of  this product after washing my face and it left my skin feeling hydrated along with a beautiful glow. What I especially love is the clean ingredients and spf of 30 because it makes me feel confident my skin is protected from the sun. This product is perfect for the summer and I recommend it for everyday use. nan
