I love a quick 2 minute mask. This one definitely feels physically exfoliating while you apply (kind of sandy, in a good way).  Then I remove with lukewarm water and a wash cloth. Skin feels so soft and fresh! Love that this brand has effective products that work with my sensitive skin. Will be adding to my weekly round up! Adding this to my routine!
