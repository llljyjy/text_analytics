I was gifted the Naturally Serious Get Even Peel Pads in exchange for my honest thoughts on the product…here goes! I have texture hyper pigmented skin and over the years have learned that exfoliation is KEY to a smoother more even complexion. I love this clean alternative by NS because it is equally penetrating to my skin without harsh ingredients most products I’ve used in the past contain that are more prone to breaking me out. I would definitely recommend this product! Especially if you have sensitive skin like me! Great exfoliator for sensitive skin!
