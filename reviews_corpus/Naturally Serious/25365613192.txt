Gifted by fruit-tox! I received the mineral moisturizing sunscreen. I love the how many moisturizing ingredients it has for right now benefits and future benefits with continued use. It does have a pretty thick but buttery consistency so you only need a tiny bit at a time, only complaint I have is that I noticed after the day was over and I washed my face it did leave a residue that took a bit to work off the skin. Use very sparingly. nan
