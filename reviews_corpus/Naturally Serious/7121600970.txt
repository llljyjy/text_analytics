Iâ€™ve used a few different exfoliating pads over the years and most of them are about the same. But this one leaves my skin so refreshed and rejuvenated the next day, it really makes a huge difference. There is a strong ginger smell to these pads which took some getting used to, but now I find it refreshing and invigorating. nan
