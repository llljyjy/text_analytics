This cream is amazinggg! My skin is combo dry and oily and I am really happy with this. It has an amazing texture that makes me feel like I am using some really expensive and luxurious cream. It absorbs very nicely into my skin and does not leave it feeling or looking greasy at all. My skin felt really hydrated and very good after putting it on. Another thing I am a huge fan of is the clean ingredients. It has Hyaluronic Acid and Squalane, and Colloidal Oatmeal, Ceramide, and Shea Butter which are really great for my skin. They all work well together to lock in the moisture and protect my skinâ€™s barrier. I love!
