I use this night cream right after I shower and it has been a wonderful addition to my skin routine. The flaxseed peptide is new for me but it has helped with my dark under eye bags. I also have sensitive skin and this has not broken me out. I would definitely recommend this to those who are looking for a good night time cr√®me! Light and moisturizing
