If you are looking for a good for your skin alternative to a harsher manual scrub (like the saint Ives we all loved in high school) then this is it! The combo of volcanic pumice, red clay, and fruit ahas really helped my skin feel smooth and exfoliated. I also feel like it did brighten my completion as well. Ahas always do really well with my skin so I was pleasantly surprised with this product! I do suggest to use it while in the shower because it is a bit messy but other than that I really liked it! Great Manual Scrub!
