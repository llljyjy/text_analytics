This makeup remover left my skin so clean removing all the makeup including the mask! I loved it! It is complimentary from Naturally Serious. The smell is  pleasant, it literally smells like lemon. It contains vitamin C, a sensory antioxidant with lemon seed oil, lemon butter, and plant-derived ceramides which helped my skin and left it feeling smooth, refreshing and healthy. I recommend it! In love!!!
