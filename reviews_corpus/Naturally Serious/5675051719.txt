This Fruit-Tox Facial Remedy is amazing!! I’m currently struggling with adult hormonal acne and haven’t found a mask that I like in a while. The texture feels like grainy wet clay on your skin which actually feels fantastic as your rub it in. The red clay pulls out dirt and oil, while ingredients like volcanic pumice and natural fruit/plant acids exfoliate. The remedy does exfoliate extremely well, so make sure to be aware of how sensitive your skin is and adjust the pressure/consistency you use while applying/washing off accordingly. Washing off the product feels like a massage on your face and leaves your skin feeling smooth and extremely fresh! The red clay also makes the mask such a pretty color! Seriously exfoilates & leaves your skin fresh!
