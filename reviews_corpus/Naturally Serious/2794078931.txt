The Illumination Anti-fatigue serum is for all skin types! Iâ€™m always skeptical when something is described as a glass look for my oily skin. I gave this serum a 2 week test, and using this daily my skin looks so good and healthy. I love it because it has a clean seal at Sephora and it hydrates thanks to the coconut oil. It also has grape seed extract and lord ga oil that also helps for that healthy glass look. I was gifted Illumination Anti-Fatigue serum power serum by Naturally Serious for my honest opinion. Gives a beautiful healthy glow for my oily skin
