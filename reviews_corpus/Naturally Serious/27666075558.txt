Naturally Serious skincare has been one of my to go for my skin concerns . I do notice sometimes I get darker circles around my eyes especially in the fall thru the winter. I apply for few week this eye cream twice a day and significantly I noticed my dark circles disappearing . I love that this product is gluten free , cruelty-free,  paraben-free and vegan. Also it smells really good but not surprised at all after seeing what ingredients it contains pomegranate, goji berry, grape seed, green tea, red tea and white tea. I truly love this eye cream and would definitely buy this for my mom and will recommend it to anyone struggling within dark circles under eyes or fine lines. Amazing Eye Cream
