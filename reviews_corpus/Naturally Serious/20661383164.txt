Sunscreen is the most important step in my skincare routine and with sensitive skin, not alot of sunscreens are liked by my picky skin. This one is gentle and does the job. Thereâ€™s a white cast though and you have to sepnd some time rubbing it into the skin. Overall good product and my husband is liking it too! Good for sensitive skin but has a white cast
