This is my first introduction to this brand and I think it was a really good one. I love peptides in my skincare because my skin feels super moisturized after and this one is no different. The texture of the cream is really whipped and almost souffle-like. It’s such a beautiful product and it is also nicely priced. Definitely recommend trying this one out if you’re in need of a new nighttime moisturizer. nan
