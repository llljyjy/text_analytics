I have used peel pads before and I was really excited to try this one out. I really like that the pads are very gentle and they are not abrasive to the skin.  Skin is left appearing soft, smooth and luminous.  I always check for all the ingredients of each product that I use and one note I would say is that I donâ€™t like that fragrance is added, however because it is listed last it does not make a big impact to the skin so I do take that into consideration. nan
