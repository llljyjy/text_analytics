I have mixed feelings about it. The product end results are absolutely amazing. Itâ€™s a great exfoliator and my skin feels baby soft afterwards. But the grains/beads are a little harsh for my sensitive skin and I do not massage it well. I just give a little massage and let it sit for 3 minutes and still the results are amazing. Love the results!!
