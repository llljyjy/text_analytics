Your skin’s moisture barrier (the stratum corneum, or outermost layer of the epidermis) has a bricks-and-mortar structure. The bricks are flat, dead skin cells called corneocytes, and the mortar is a fatty mixture made up of ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids. This mixture keeps your skin healthy, clear, and resilient. If it’s compromised, it can lead to skin that’s simultaneously dry and oily, extremely sensitive, or acne-prone. Formulated for and tested on all skin tones, textures, and types, including sensitive skin. Suitable for men, too! nan
