I have always been pretty nervous to use peel pads or any sort of exfoliating product since I have sensitive skin. So I decided to try out these instead of an actual scrub and my skin texture has improved so MUCH! It has a nice smell to it which also made me kind of weary but I havenâ€™t had any sort of reaction to it. My skin has been so much softer and smoother since I added these pads in after washing my face and before my other products! Amazing for Sensitive Skin!
