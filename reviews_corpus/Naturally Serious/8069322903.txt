I love how effective and quick is the resurfacing mask, first time using this brand and I want more!!! I followed the directions massaged the mask into my skin and leave it on for 3 min, texture feel like a combination of a hydrating mask and a exfoliator, my skin feel clear and soft right after, feel like it clear out my pores too. My skin feels clear and soft!
