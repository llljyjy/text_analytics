These pads feel so cooling on the skin when first applied but then it turns into a tingly, warming feeling. They do a great job at getting rid of impurities and creating cleaner and brighter looking skin. The only downside is that it burns for a bit where I have dryness around my nose. Other than that, these are lovely. Get brighter, cleaner looking skin
