This is the first time I am using peel pads to exfoliate my skin and and I am very happy with the results. These pads are so easy to use and also travel friendly. They are so gentle on the skin and not like those exfoliating scrubs. It does not dry out my skin like some exfoliating scrubs too. It doesnâ€™t break out my skin either, makes my skin feel very smooth after I use these pads. With continuing usage it also helps to brighten the skin so I am excited for that.You get 60 pads in one tub so the price of these is actually amazing. I will continue to re-purchase. Gentle and effective
