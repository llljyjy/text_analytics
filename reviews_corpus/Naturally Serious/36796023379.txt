The texture was a lot thicker than I was expecting, but I surprisingly liked it. I feel like it actually will block the sun, as compared to thin sheer sunscreens. From Argon oil to vitamin E, the ingredients in this sunscreen are so clean, which is a major plus. Going to the beach this week and cant wait to see how this works! No white cast!
