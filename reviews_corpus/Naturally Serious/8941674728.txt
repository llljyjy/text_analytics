I love pre soaked pads and these are amazing! First of all, you get so many! 60 pads will last you months. They are very convenient for traveling also.I like to use these on alternating days to gently exfoliate my skin. I see an immediate glow after using this product, and my skin feels smoother after each use.They do not irritate my dry skin and feel soothing thanks to the oat extract (I just make sure to not over exfoliate).I also like to use these on my body, especially legs and underarms, to prevent ingrown hairs.Overall I really like this product. Great pre soaked pads
