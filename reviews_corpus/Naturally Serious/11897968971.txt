Gifted by Naturally SeriousThis is a good sunscreen I put it on in the mornings an it does great at protecting my face from the sun. It is a mineral sunscreen it didnâ€™t leave a white cast or greasy feeling it absorbs well into the skin. Definitely happy to have this with summer almost here. Good Sunscreen
