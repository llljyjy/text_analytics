This serum is beneficial. Removes puffiness and restores skin radiance. Bruises were hidden, but the skin was not particularly moisturized. It covers small wrinkles and conceals them, which is very appealing. The texture is light and almost transparent, not greasy on the skin. There were no allergic reactions. I believe that it is best suited for the summer because you want something more nutritious in the winter. nan
