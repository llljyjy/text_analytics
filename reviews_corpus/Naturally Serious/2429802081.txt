I received the Skin warrior moisture rescue cream complimentary from June jacobs labs.  It was hard opening but upon finally opening it had such a strong fragrance which I like but I like a fragrance from my skincare.  I believe I smell some lemon . My skin feels so refreshed soft and moisturized I can feel the moisture and truly think anyone with dry skin this cream really lives up to itâ€™s name Moisture rescue Moisture Rescue
