I have textured skin so I was really excited to try this product out. I was not expecting the exfoliant to be as fine as it was. It made the cleanser gentle and not too harsh on my skin. I usually have redness after using exfoliating products but this did not irritate my skin at all. I was left with a nice glow after use! nan
