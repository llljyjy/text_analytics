It is just like the name itself. Naturally Serious... It’s not a crazy heavy mask. It applies like a somewhat moisturizer. Very smoothly and Lightweight. It doesn’t have a stuffy feeling as if it’s covering the pores. After washing it out, my skin turns into a silky feeling that I would love it to be every single day. I love it!! Smooth and Lightweight
