I’ve used this scrub before and have always loved it so I’m really excited that it’s now available in Sephora website. This scrub has a red-orange color that is a clay texture with a grainy yet not super abrasive feel texture on the skin. I love how it leaves the skin really soft and moisturized! It’s very gentle on the skin as long as you don’t rub it hard since it does has some tiny exfoliating grains in it. I have combination, acne-prone skin and so far this has really helped brighten my skin & haven’t had any breaking out issues whenever I use it. I highly recommend it and I really love this brands products overall! Must have physical exfoliant!
