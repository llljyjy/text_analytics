I was pleasantly surprised how well I liked this serum. The serum itself has a thick texture (almost like lotion) but spreads easily on my skin. The scent is natural smelly, kind of earthy since this contains Shea Butter. Once first applied it feels a bit heavy on my combination skin but eventually absorbs leaving my face feeling moisturized without being oily. I have also noticed this serum calms down redness/ irritation on my skin . Its a great serum for most skin types. nan
