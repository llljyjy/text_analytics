I am really enjoying this serum! It is a nice not too thick consistency and I love that it’s light pink! It glides on the skin really nicely and hydrates and plumps very well. It also works well with my other skincare products. The only downside is that because there is no fragrance it has more of a natural smell if that doesn’t bother you then you’re good! Love this stuff!
