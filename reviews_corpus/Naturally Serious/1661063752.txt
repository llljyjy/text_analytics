I like these cleansing pads, they kind of remind me of the ones from Aveda. They have a nice smell to them and they don’t make my skin burn after using them which I appreciate. I have sensitive skin. They feel really nice and cleansing on the skin and didn’t make me break out at all either. Kind of a fun thing to use in between washing your face or if you just need a quick refresh. Keep them in the refrigerator this summer and thank me later! Good for sensitive skin
