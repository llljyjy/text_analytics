I was gifted by naturally serious the supercharge anti-oxidant moisture serum. The Supercharged  antioxidant moisture serum is a super moisturizing serum that is perfect for all skin types. It has hyaluronic acid Apple extract vitamin E and Shea butter has a few of the ingredients. You will love it for its intense moisture without making you feel greasy. Also it has a very light scent for those individuals who are sensitive to scents. You can apply this in the morning and afternoon to clean dry skin and you are ready to start or end your day. One thing I really like about this formula is that one pump is all you need it’s super thick and that one pump covers your entire face neck and décolletage. 10 out of 10 would recommend! Moisture to the MAX
