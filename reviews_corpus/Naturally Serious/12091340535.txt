I’d like to start out by saying everyone’s skin type is different, so even though this didn’t work for me, it might not have the same results for you. I have fair, combo skin. An oily t-zone, while the skin around my mouth and eyes tends to be more dry. I will say that I see a lot of complaints about this products smell. For me, personally, the smell isn’t terrible. Not the best, but it’s not something that would make or break the product for me. What DOES make or break the product for me, however, are the results. I was originally using a different night cream, but I wanted to try something else to see if I could receive  better results. I stumbled upon this. Sounded great. Reviews were okay. I used this product for four weeks. Within this four weeks, my skin dried up more than it already was. Flakey, dry skin. That’s not even the worse part. The worst part was the BREAK OUTS. I’m 27. I haven’t seen my face that bad in years. I had at least 6-8 deep pimples on my face at once. These were pimple types I’ve never had before. I’m an avid pimple popper (unfortunately) so my face was DESTROYED. The first pimple showed up by the end of the first week. I didn’t pay much attention to it. But by the end of week three I was depressed. I literally worked from home for two weeks. That’s how bad my face was. I finally switched back to my old night cream. Within days pimples have stopped appearing. Bless. Drying & Pimple Provoking
