I was gifted this serum from ILLUMI-NATION. I like this product! It has a slightly strong rose scent to it but it dissipates quickly, I use the serum two o four time a week and  I can see a difference already!!The texture is a thin creamy consistency (but not too watery).   Great Serum!! I love how lightweight this serum is, my skin feels hydrated  and love how well it works for my combination skin. Excellent serum
