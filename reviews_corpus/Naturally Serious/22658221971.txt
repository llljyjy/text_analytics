I’ve used this multiple times since I got it, but not been using it long enough to have any visible results. However, my skin feels so much softer and my makeup goes on better! It doesn’t smell overwhelming and I find it very gentle, it just lightly tingles by the time it’s ready to be rinsed off. My only complaint is that it stains the skin a bit when you rinse off, but it goes away! Stains, But Skin Feels Softer!
