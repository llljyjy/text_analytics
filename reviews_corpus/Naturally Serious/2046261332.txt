I received this product complimentarily from Naturally Serious for a honest review. I have dry skin so I’m afraid to use anything that’s going to dry my skin out even more. I started using this yesterday and so far my skin doesn’t appear to have any irritation. This cold pressed peel pads have pomegranate enzymes and oat extract to smooth uneven texture. I did feel like my skin was a tad bit smoother around my chin area where I have pimples (pops out during that time of the month). I will continue using this but once a week to be safe, and write an updated review. Helps with uneven skin texture
