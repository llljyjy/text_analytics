I REALLY enjoyed using this facial remedy! My skin has been going haywire since the mask mandate got lifted and after all the break outs Iâ€™ve been left to deal with, dryness, peeling, dark spots and the list goes on. I love a product that is naturally sourced and I really loved how this left my skin feeling incredibly soft! I have combination skin (dry, oily, normal and acne prone) and this one facial remedy has ingredients to target all my skin problems! I loved this and plan on keeping it apart of my skincare routine! A must try in my opinion!! A MUST try! Left skin super soft!
