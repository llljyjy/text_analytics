I love that this product is cruelty free which is largely why I opted to try it; I love the feel of the Shea butter in this formula and feel it is quite moisturizing for the night time. The flaxseed peptides are something unique I havenâ€™t seen in another product either! Definitely enjoy how my skin feels with this cream nan
