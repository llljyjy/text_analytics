I loved that it’s a clean beauty brand.  I liked the mangosteen ingredient and also the colloidal oatmeal.  It feels very soothing and smooth in my skin.  I didn’t like that it contained fragrance but the smell doesn’t bother me too much.  Great product and easily a good clean moisturizer! Good solid moisturizer
