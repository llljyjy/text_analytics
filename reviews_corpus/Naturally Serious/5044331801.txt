I like this product! It has a slightly strong rose scent to it but it dissipates quickly. The texture is a thin creamy consistency (but not too watery) and it sinks into the skin easily and quickly. I would say it brightened my skin with a subtle pinky pearlescent look thatâ€™s so pretty. I layered it over some thinner serums, and then added moisturizer over too, and there was no weird pilling which is a bonus. Pretty and feels good on the skin
