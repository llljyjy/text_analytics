I love this moisturizer it has a combination of ingredients that are perfect for the skin (Magnolia, Mangosteen, Hyaluronic Acid, Squalane, Colloidal Oatmeal, Ceramide and Shea Butter) each one provides something necessary to keep our skin healthy, healthy and hydrated.  It has a soft and pleasant smell, the smell only pervades it when applying it, it is absorbed quickly, leaves the face soft and not greasy, applied it during the day, also very happy with the results of this cream.  I recommend it nan
