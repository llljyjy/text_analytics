I have dry and dull skin. This product really exfoliated that first layer to give me hydrated, smooth feel. It can be a struggle to find effective products but the ingredients inside really work- from the red clay detoxifying excess oils to the volcanic pumice helping with the unevenness. I LOVE IT! nan
