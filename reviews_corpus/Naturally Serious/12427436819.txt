I was looking for peel pads to exfoliate my skin, and hopefully I found these cold pressed peel pads from naturally serious. After I apply for one week I see a huge difference in my skin texture. I use it am and pm after I clean my face. It also gives hydration. I love how these are easy to use. I highly recommend this if you have uneven texture skin works great. Very good peels
