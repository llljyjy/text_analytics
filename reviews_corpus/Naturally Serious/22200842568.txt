i love the texture of this serum it feels really smooth on my skin.  it definitely makes my skin look more glowy and feel more awake if that makes sense!  i like the smell of the product as well, it doesnt have any artificial fragrances but it has a light fresh scent.  the only issue i had was that the cap screws off super easily.  overall a great serum! great serum!
