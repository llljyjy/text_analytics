SPF is my best friend; I can never leave the house without it! I really like that this sunscreen is tinted; there are days I don’t even bother wearing foundation when wearing this product. I typically prefer using gel product for my skincare, so unfortunately, this sunscreen was a bit too thick for my liking. It feels sort of paste-y when I am trying to apply it onto my skin, so it doesn’t absorb that easily. SPF is my best friend!
