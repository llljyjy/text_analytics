I don’t think this was the right moisturizer for me. I had been looking forward to trying it - a no silicone, more “natural” moisturizer. It went onto my skin feeling fine, but a few weeks in I noticed new and curious milia. One of them looks like a pimple that won’t pop and is visible on camera, and another is less visible but still a new tiny waxy bump on my face. I like the amount of good ingredients in here, but I ended up returning it. Not the right moisturizer for me
