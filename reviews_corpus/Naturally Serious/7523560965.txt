I am super impressed with how well this lightweight serum not only moisturized but also helped to repair my uneven skin tone. I have a few areas on my forehead and I haven’t needed to cover them with concealer before applying my daily makeup and I’ve only been using it for 2 weeks! Apparently, it’s thanks to White Birch, the ingredient that claims to neutralize the appearance on uneven skin tone. I’m am thoroughly enjoying how hydrated and healthy my skin has become. All ingredients are natural and gentle. It has a very light herbal fragrance and this serum literally disappeared right into my skin and there was no tackiness. I have really started to enjoy my skincare routine now that I can actually see my skin improving. This is an excellent serum. I definitely recommend to all. Gentle and Effective and Eco-Friendly
