Iâ€™ve been enjoying this treatment alot, from my first application i noticed a difference in my skin texture.  My skin felt exceptionally soft. There was slight tingling at first but it subsided after a minute or so. The texture is a bit rougher than a sugar scrub but the end results of soft skin and smoother texture is worth it in my opinion. Left my skin feeling smooth
