I’ve been using Naturally Serious Mineral Defense Sunscreen and love it! I received it complimentary from Naturally Serious. I use it every morning after washing my face and love that it’s a moisturizer but also protects my skin in the sun with SPF 30. Not only is it a clean product, it’s also so good for my skin. It has a thicker consistency so a little goes a long way. I love that it’s tinted so it’s easy to blend in with my skin. Super easy to put on in the morning and makes my skin feel great! nan
