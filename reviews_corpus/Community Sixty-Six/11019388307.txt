I mean this in the best way: this is a very middle of the road, gentle, no-surprises moisturizer. Not too thick and not too runny. No distracting scents. The price seems reasonable. My only qualm is that it doesnâ€™t seem very gel like, especially compared to other popular gel moisturizers. This very much feels like a typical lotion consistency. Perfectly serviceable, nothing special.
