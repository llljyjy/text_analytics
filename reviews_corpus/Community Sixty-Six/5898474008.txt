Love the product! It’s super lightweight and kind of sits on the skin similar to a primer. It perfectly layers with sunscreen too! The only reason I knocked off a star is the scent. I could do fragrances or I scented but it did smell very similar to elmer’s glue. However it’s only when you’re putting it on. Lightweight and Layerable
