The idea of creating healthy habits takes 66 days hence, “Community sixty six“ really made me love the brand off the bat; the packaging is informative with a guided amount usage tool too! However, that’s the only positive feedback I have, as all the product formulations are very poor. I feel like they spent a lot of time coming up with a great mission but didn’t spend that same time and/or attention on the formulas themselves. With that said, this was the BEST product out of ALL of the Community Sixty Six line. As someone with oily/acne-prone skin this is a good option as it doesn’t contain any fatty acids, alcohols, and/or esters! Clinique Moisture Surge 100hr Auto Replenishing Hydrator is still my go to though (at the same price point) Community sixty sixes SUPERSTAR
