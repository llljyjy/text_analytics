This product does a good job of moisturizing, but price point is a little high. I did not find it was significantly better than drug store moisturizers. Application is smooth and absorbs well. The product is a little thicker, so I felt like I had to use more for adequate coverage. I think it will end up running out sooner than I think. Overall, it gets the job done, but nothing to write home about. Nothing to write home about
