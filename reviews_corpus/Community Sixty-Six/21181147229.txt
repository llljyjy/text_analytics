The Hydrating Eye Cream is my go-to product for my entire face and neck both morning and night. It leaves my skin feeling plump and firm with a dewy finish! It is one of the best products I have ever tried since I have a lot of dark spots on my face. I recommend this eye cream to everyone.Also,the packaging is a 10/10. nan
