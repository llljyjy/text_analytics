This moisturizer was great. It has a nice texture and melted into the skin quickly while still leaving my face feeling moisturized. I used this on top of the retinol night resurfacing product by Community 66 and it did a great job of balancing the powerful retinol and keeping my face from getting oily over night. I do wish that this product came in the tube squeeze container like the company’s other products, but that’s just my preference. nan
