I received this product from influencer and community 66 for my honest review. I’ve tried all the products received and I did like this product. It wasn’t as hydrating as expected given the name. I found it was to be slightly stingy. I also was very careful to read what ingredients were in the products. It’s important to know what you’re using before putting it on your face and I found I have a surprise it didn’t require you to wear sunscreen with giving it has lactic acid. The price point is good for what the product is made of I would definitely recommend this to a friend with more instruction. nan
