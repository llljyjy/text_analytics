I was so excited when I received my complimentary package from Influenster and to try this new product. I don’t think it’s been enough time to fully see the results so I will continue using but so far I like the way it feels on my skin and don’t have anything negative to say about it. The smell of the whole line of products is weirdly…cheap smelling? I know It’s fragrance free but it smells like the soaps they use in hospitals. Just…odd. Seem to be good products but smell off
