I received this free product from Influenster in exchange of my honest review. It is a very basic standard moisturizer, good for summer time because it is gel based. But it is a bit thicker than actual gel so I still use it as the weather turns cooler. It does it’s job as a moisturizer. Moisturizing, but that’s it
