A good, lightweight cleanser. Love the packaging, very sleek and with a pump. Leaves face feeling hydrated but not greasy.  While it is advertised as “unscented”, this line of products does have a detectable smell for me. I do not like the smell, it is a faint play dough smell that lingers after use. Good Lightweight Moisturizer
