This smoothed out my texture on my forehead in a few days, but it really burned my sensitive skin so I can’t say I’ll keep using it. I think this is better for someone who can handle a stronger concentration in ingredients like retinol. I’ll be recommending this to my boyfriend whom has a non-sensitive skin type. Not really for me.
