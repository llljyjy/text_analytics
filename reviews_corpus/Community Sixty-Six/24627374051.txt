I received this product free from Influenster and Community Sixty-Six in exchange for my honest review. I personally have very dry skin and this moisturizer just didn’t work with my skin. The moisturizer itself feels oily to me but upon putting it on my skin I notice it doesn’t give me much hydration at all. I also experienced slight tingling when I tried it out for a couple of nights. Not for dry sensitive skin
