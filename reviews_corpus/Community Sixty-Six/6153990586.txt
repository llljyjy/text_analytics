I received this product as a gift in exchange for my review. I’ve been using it every day for a few weeks and I can say I like it, my skin is pretty sensitive and it didn’t  cause me any noticeable irritation but it did feel slightly thick on the skin. I do have another moisturizer that I like that I probably would prefer over this one. nan
