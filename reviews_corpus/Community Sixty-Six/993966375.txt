Too soon to tell if I am in love with this moisturizer. It doesnâ€™t really have a scent to me, not one that is bothersome, but I would have been ok if it did. Again, perfect packaging- just love it! It seems a little heavy to me as a moisturizer and feels like it is sitting on my skin which is making me a little worried about breakouts for my sensitive skin. So, the word is out until I see how things go over the next week or so. Time will tell! Unsure about this one
