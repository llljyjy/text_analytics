I would say this is an above-average moisturizer that has one great advantage for me, which is that it doesn’t interfere with any cosmetics layered on top of it. It works well in conjunction with the C66 night cream and provides a light level of moisture. Definitely more for combination or normal skin than extremely dry skin. I like that there’s no extra fragrance added to it. nan
