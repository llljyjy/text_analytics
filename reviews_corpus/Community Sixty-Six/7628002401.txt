This is a really good moisturizer. It has a gel like consistency. It is a bit sticky after applying but that doesn’t bother me. The stickiness actually helps it be dual purpose as a moisturizer and primer. I love using it under my foundation and skin tints. It leaves my face feeling moisturized and looking glowy. The reason I only gave 4 stars is because the product doesn’t have a good smell. It has kind of a chemical smell. The smell does go away very quickly and doesn’t linger but it’s still weird that it has a slight chemical smell. The packaging is cute and very minimalist. The price is very affordable.  I have combination skin. I received this product complimentary of Influenster. nan
