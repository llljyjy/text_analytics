I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest/incentivized review. Unfortunately, I am pregnant, and didn’t feel safe using this because I couldn’t find any info on whether it is pregnancy safe. It contains retinol, which I know is NOT safe to use during pregnancy. So I asked my sister to try it for me. She has oily, acne prone skin like me. She liked that this has retinol in it, but she made the mistake of using this the same night as this brand’s moisturizer and that ended up giving her acne. From other reviews it looks like it should only be used a few nights a week, so that may have been her problem. She wasn’t a fan of the scent. nan
