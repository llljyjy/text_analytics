This cream had a thick constituency. It clogged my pores and caused pimples and blackheads. I normally don’t have issues when using products but this product just didn’t agree with my skin. I wouldn’t let that deter you from trying it though. Everyone has different reactions to products. I did like that it didn’t have a smell because I can be a little sensitive to perfume smells. I also thought the design of the container was great. It is easy to use and doesn’t leave a mess. Easy to dispense just the right product. I received this product complimentary for my honest review. Not for me, clogged my pores
