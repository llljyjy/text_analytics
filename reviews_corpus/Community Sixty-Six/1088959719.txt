This gel moisturizer is so light. Don’t let the word gel make you think it is thick. It is very lightweight, and there is not a scent. My skin had a lot of dry patches, but is also prone to breaking out. This moisturizer, in conjunction with this brand’s night resurfacing cream has restored some youthful appearance to my 45 year old skin. The dry patches have gone away! This did not make my skin breakout at all. A little goes a long way. Light Texture Moisturizer
