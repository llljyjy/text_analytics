I received these products from influenster in exchange for my honest review. It’s very moisturizing but also very oily and smells like glue. I liked using it with a retinol or whenever my skin was dry, didn’t cause any breakouts and worked well. The only thing that was really off putting was the smell, so if your sensitive to those type of things it’s better to avoid this product! nan
