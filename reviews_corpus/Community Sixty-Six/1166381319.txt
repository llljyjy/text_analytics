I received this product for free, an exchange for my honest review. This is a decent basic moisturizer. It doesn’t have much of a smell. Which is fine for me. It is a gel consistency but a little on the thicker side. It works good as a nighttime moisturizer. It seems to stick well to the skin. I have used it under make up and it seems to work fine. I just use a little less for daytime, because it is a little bit thicker. It hasn’t irritated my sensitive skin. It is hydrating but I haven’t seen a huge difference in my skin. So, overall it’s a good moisturizer for the price good moisturizer for the price
