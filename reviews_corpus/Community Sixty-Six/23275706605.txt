Someone recommended me this moisturizer with SPF because it was lightweight and good quality but upon receiving and trying on it’s extremely thick, hard to blend and rub in, leaves a white cast and I would definitely not recommend it. Totally regret buying. I’m not even gonna post a picture because it looks so bad. nan
