Wow! To say that I love this moisturizer world be an understatement!! This moisturizer is lightweight which is nice because of my oily skin type, I can’t have anything too heavy like creams, so this was great for me. It’s still very moisturizing, it soaked right in to my skin and left it feeling so soft and smooth! I’ve been using twice a day for a few weeks now and it’s been great. My skin tone seems more even and smoother, pores appear smaller and I’ve seen a reduction in the amount of blackheads I have. I can apply it in the morning without having to worry about having my face covered in oil within the next hour! It’s a great way to prep skin before makeup! Love this moisturizer!!
