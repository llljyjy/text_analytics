I have sensitive skin and many things make me breakout. This moisturizer is what it promises to be. It is moisturizing without being oily. My skin feels hydrated without a looking like a greaseball in south Florida summer. I used it under make up and it keep my makeup longer. Highly recommended. Moisturizer for sensitive skin
