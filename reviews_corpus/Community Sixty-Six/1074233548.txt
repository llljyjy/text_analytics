I was so happy to find this cream! Because I have sensitive skin with rosacea, I have to use mineral SPF. I also don’t have time for a multi-step routine every morning, so I prefer a combination sunscreen/moisturizer product. There aren’t too many out there, and many that claim to moisturize are still too drying. This one delivers! It’s a plush, soothing cream that leaves me feeling protected. I have dry cheeks and an oily t-zone, and I don’t feel that this is too shiny or heavy at all. Just dewy and healthy looking. I’m on the pale side, so YMMV on the white cast issue. Glad I found this before the dry winter weather sets in! Lifesaver for dry sensitive skin!
