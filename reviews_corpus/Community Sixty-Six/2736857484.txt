I agree with the reviewer below--give it a chance! I bought this in a pinch after running out of my skinceuticals daily moisturizer (3x the cost) and this does a way better job of keeping my skin clear and oil free. Yes the consistency is thick and goes on like sunscreen--but once it’s absorbed, it really works great. My skin is very soft and hydrated, it has not broken me out, and it’s not shiny or oily. nan
