I was very surprised by the positive reviews for this item. I would NOT consider this to be an “everyday moisturizer“. This SPF is much too thick in my opinion to be marketed as an everyday moisturizer - I would wear this at the beach or exercising outside but it is thick, heavy, tough to rub in. I really do not love it and will not repurchase. Will not buy again
