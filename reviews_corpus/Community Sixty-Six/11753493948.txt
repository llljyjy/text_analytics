Love that there’s no white cast or “sunscreen smell”. It leaves my face very dewy and is great under makeup. It’s actually very hydrating - a little too dewy if my face is oily but that isn’t an issue when I’m regularly hydrating my skin! No breakouts or additional texture and my skin is VERY sensitive. Overall definitely recommend! Definitely recommend
