I received this product complementary of influenster. Overall I was disappointed in this skin care line. It seemed to make my skin WORSE! However out of the 4 products I received this one didn’t have any negative reactions. Of course this product smelled horrible along with all the other products I received. The moisturizer didn’t seem to do anything to my skin at all. nan
