This product was iffy for me. I love the ingredients, but the application was a bit tacky for what I prefer for a moisturizer. It was a little bit sticky after applying and I donâ€™t feel it soaked into the skin as well as some other gel moisturizers I have tried. I really like the products from this brand, but I think I would prefer other moisturizers over this one. nan
