I loved this moisturizer!! I have oily skin, so I am overly cautious with what moisturizers I refer to others with the same issue. After I washed my face, I applied a small amount and waited for it to absorb into my skin. It dries down and sinks into the skin very quickly. It has a glowing appearance and doesn’t feel greasy AT ALL! I fell in love as soon as I applied. My skin didn’t hydrate over night, but I did notice a change in how my skin no longer felt as tight as it used to after I would wash my face with a detoxifying face wash. GREAT for oily skin
