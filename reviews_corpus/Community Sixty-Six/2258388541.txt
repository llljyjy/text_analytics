I’m loving this sunscreen so far! It’s hydrating but isn’t too dewy just a natural finish. There is no white cast, rubs in easily and hasn’t caused any breakouts, I have dry sensitive skin. I use Sunvisor most of the year but wanted to try something new for the summer that was a little more sweat and waterproof since I am heading to Hawaii. I rotate these 2 now depending on my needs for the day and am very happy I decided to try this new sunscreen. I plan to try other products from Community sixty-six in the future. Great sunscreen!!!
