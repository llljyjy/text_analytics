I don’t usually use moisturizers but this oil free moisturizer from community sixty six was a new one for me. I’m gonna give it a three star rating because I don’t really have anything to compare to but it did moisturize my skin on my face and my neck and I don’t feel any roughness and my skin is very smooth after a few minutes after applying. I would recommend this to others. Good moisturizer
