i just finished this moisturizer, and here are my thoughts. it’s a fine moisturizer - not great, not terrible. i wouldn’t purchase again though. it has a very lightweight consistency. this would be a perfect moisturizer honestly for anyone with oily skin - however, as someone with dry skin, i have found that it is not hydrating enough at all for me. my skin typically prefers a thicker, more moisturizing cream to really hydrate my skin and this just did not do it for me. especially since i choose to wear mineral SPF, whenever i apply this in the morning under my SPF i find it leaves my skin extra dry. i think people with oily skin would really enjoy this moisturizer, but for me, it’s a pass. love the brand concept but formulations feel a little rushed. i do enjoy that the formula is non-comedogenic and it doesn’t have a strong fragrance. not for dry skin - good if you have oily skin
