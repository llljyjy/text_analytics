Complimentary from innisfree. While this has been out for a while, this is my first time trying the jelly cream. Cherry blossoms are my favorite flower so I just had to try this out. Having tried the spray and the cleanser previously, I had no worries walking into this one and I was not disappointed. This jelly cream keeps my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. It absorbs into the skin rather quickly without leaving any sort of tacky feeling. OBSESSED
