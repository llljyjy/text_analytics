I love this hyaluronic acid cream so much! I have normal to dry skin, to begin with, and now that it is winter my skin feels even drier, but this cream is a game changer. I apply a decent amount at night and in the morning as well and it leaves my skin smooth and hydrated all day and night. A must have for dry skin!
