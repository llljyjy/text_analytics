For the glowy gals! This was complimentary from Innisfree - I have to use a little bit more of this than a standard moisturizer to get the actual moisture Im after, but thatâ€™s not a huge issue to me. And this certainly lives up to the name of being very glowy! But it does so with sheen and with a lightweight feel that gives you glow without looking greasy. Lovely product! For the glow without the grease!
