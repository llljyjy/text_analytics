This is really an amazing sunscreen! As an oily skin girl, sunscreens tend to leave my skin feeling greasy but this one doesn’t! It leaves my skin with a very soft and natural finish! It also pairs amazingly under makeup if I use it after priming. My boyfriend also uses this sunscreen and loves it. The only con I can think of is that it has a slight fragrance and it could possibly irritate those with extremely sensitive skin. Otherwise, I’d recommend!!!!!! The price is perfect. get it
