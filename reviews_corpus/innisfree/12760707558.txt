Personally, I thought gel moisturizers worked better for combo/oily skin, but I was wrong. I had been using a cream moisturizer before this product, which was working well for my skin. I used this moisturizer, and I could tell that my face was significantly more oily. By the way, I was using Herbivoreâ€™s Pink Cloud Moisturizer, and I am still using it :) Made me more oily...
