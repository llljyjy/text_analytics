Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to have been selected to try this product (#freeproduct #trywithtopbox) I have been using this cream in the morning. It is hydrating and lightweight consistency. My skin gets flaky dry during the winter, but this cream is changing my skin and feels moisturized throughout the day. I appreciate the glass jar because the strength of the ingredients last longer. It smells great however less fragrance would be ideal for a variety of people with various sensitivity. Boutique quality
