This moisturizer was kindly gifted to me by Innisfree. I absolutely love the texture of the moisturizer and how lightweight and absorbent it is. It hydrates my skin so well without making it oily or greasy and is great for a glowy makeup look. The packaging is also very cute and! Personally for me, the fragrance is a little too strong but overall, it is a great moisturizer to try. Innisfree Dewy Glow Moisturizer
