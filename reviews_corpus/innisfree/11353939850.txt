Works like a dream! It’s so light that I use it as moisturizer under my makeup. Like others have said, no white cast, no greasiness, and it has a very, very light and pleasant scent, if you can smell it at all! I’m sure that if I used it without makeup it would look like I have nothing on, it’s that light! But, since I wear makeup daily, this goes under it - no fuss! The price is perfect, as well.
