I’ve been trying this spot treatment for around a month now and I think it works well to reduce inflammation around a new breakout but it definitely isn’t an overnight fix. I had to use this for a few days before I saw the best results. The spot treatment itself isn’t drying and it feels a bit cooling so I can tell it is way gentler on the skin. If you have sensitive skin then this will probably work best for you! gentle but works!
