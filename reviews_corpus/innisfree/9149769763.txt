I got this as a sample and noticed it smells like cologne. Parfum is listed in the ingredients before itâ€™s highlight ingredient, hyaluronic acid, which is one of the last ingredients listed! There is also a high concentration of alcohol. Definitely not a great concentration of skin friendly ingredients in comparison to potential irritants. At least it was just a sample! Not sure why it has so many high reviews. Bad ingredients
