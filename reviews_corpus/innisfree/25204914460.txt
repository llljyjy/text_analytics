I’ve tried and loved other products from the green tea seed line before and this one did not disappoint! My skin has been really dry due to the colder weather and my skin feels super hydrated after using this because of the hyaluronic acid. It also feels very soothing and cooling. There is a slight clean/refreshing scent which I don’t mind but just a heads up for those who have sensitive skin. nan
