I have sensitive acne-prone skin and initially I loved the finish on my skin! It didn’t leave a white cast and looked matte on my skin. Over time, I noticed that I broke out more and stopped using it, which made all the irritation go away. It was irritating my skin probably because it’s a chemical sunscreen but I would still recommend this to people who can handle chemical sunscreens! It still has a nice finish overall and I wish I could continue using it on my face. nan
