This hydrating cream has a gorgeous texture that is light and gel like but deeply moisturizing. It doesnâ€™t feel heavy but it does a good job of adding lasting moisture to my skin in the dry winter months thanks to the hyaluronic acid and green tea extract. It is gentle and has a light fragrance that is not overwhelming. Overall, it works great as a daily moisturizer especially for my combo skin. Lovely lightweight cream
