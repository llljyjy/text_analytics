This is my first time using this brand and I am really impressed. I didn’t know what to expect from this sunscreen for such an affordable price, but the quality is there. For reference, y have normal to dry aging skin.PROS:- Lightweight texture: it is so easy to spread and to get absorbed by the skin.- It doesn’t leave a greasy feeling (even applying the recommended amount), although it can feel heavier on oily skin.- No white cast: being a 100% chemical sunscreen, it doesn’t leave you with a ghostly face.- Amazing price for the quality and amount you get! CONS:- Although it has some hydrating ingredients, or is not packed with antioxidants and other skin loving ingredients as other sunscreens have. I get those ingredients from my skincare regime so it is not a problem for me.- I don’t think this good for oily skin, unless you apply a very thin layer that will not provide the advertised SPF protection.- It has a slight scent, very pleasant in my opinion, but that can be irritating for those with perfume sensitivities. - Chemical sunscreen: this is not something bad, it is just that I prefer physical sunscreens because they don’t irritate my eyes (y want to apply my sunscreen over my eyelids and around my eyes as well)I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador Great chemical sunscreen
