This is one of my favorite sunscreens that I have tried. It doesn’t leave a white cast on my face and feels moisturizing while not feeling greasy. I’ve been wearing this every day for a few weeks and it doesn’t cause my skin to break out, for anyone else that is prone to breaking out from sunscreen. nan
