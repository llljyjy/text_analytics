so I recieved a sample of this stuff in my ipsy sub and fell in love. I microderm my face with a pm tool, and I usually jello mask after. and I needed a mask for in-between uses, and this is the one, I notice my skin the next day after use it all around clearer smooth and even has some glow too it. love it and I have super sensitive skin. washes off nicely even one of the best. best price best mask best of the best
