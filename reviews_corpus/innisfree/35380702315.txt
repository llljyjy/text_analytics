I’ve been using this sunscreen since the beginning of this year, and I have a lot to say about this sunscreen. If you’re looking for a sunscreen that’s literally PERFECT in every category, then this is the sunscreen for you. This sunscreen spreads so smooth on the skin and leaves my skin looking dewy and soft. This sunscreen also has a very subtle floral scent and doesn’t leave a white cast. And I absolutely love that this sunscreen is affordable with all of these qualities. I will be sure to buy this again! the best sunscreen ever!!
