I purchased this sunscreen thinking it would be good and affordable… and while it is good and not too greasy with just a little bit of glow, it does pill up with makeup on top which I don’t love. It is perfect for those no makeup days or very very light makeup days but when putting on heavier makeup it does not look it’s best. Okay sunscreen
