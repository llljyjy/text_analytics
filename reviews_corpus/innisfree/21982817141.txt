I bought this product after it was recommended by an employee as a cheaper option than the Belif True Cream Aquabomb (which i LOVE). I loved the price point for sure, but I’m not overly thrilled with the product itself. Personally the fragrance is very strong, which isn’t good for my headaches or sensitive skin. The moisturizer itself feels very sticky on my skin and doesn’t feel  very hydrating. I have also noticed a lot more breakouts since using this product, which may or may not be related. Overall it’s an okay moisturizer, but there are definitely better options! Not my favourite
