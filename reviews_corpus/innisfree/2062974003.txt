If you have oily skin, this is the kind of moisturizer you want to try! Itâ€™s light weight yet hydrating. It wears well under makeup and on top of serums. Cute package and smells good. I have more dry skin so I need something more thick and heavy duty but I will save this for the summer time when my skin gets oily. Gifted by innisfree for review purposes. nan
