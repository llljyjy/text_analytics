Great makeup base and mixed will with many different sunscreens. If i had dry skin, i would definitely not use this. I enjoyed how fast it absorbed, but i would not say itâ€™s very moisturizer. it may be great in humid environments, but definitely not in dry climates. Great morning light moisturizer
