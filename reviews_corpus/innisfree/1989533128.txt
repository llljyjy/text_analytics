I have acne prone skin around my chin due to masks, so I was interested to try the innisfree blemish serum. It worked on a really red spot I had, but didn’t work on some others. So it seems like it only works on certain types of troubled spots. I do like the tube and pointed tip packaging it comes in - it’s hygienic, easy to use and you can control how much serum you need. It’s easy to blend and absorb into the skin and it’s not drying or stripping like some other spot treatments. nan
