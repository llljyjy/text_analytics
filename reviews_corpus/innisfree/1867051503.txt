If you loved the original formula, you’ll love this just as much- if not even better!I still find it to be a lightweight gel texture that sinks into the skin- and it will leave that “glass skin” effect + brighten up your tone. The main noticeable difference is the “lower volume” in fragrance. It never bothered me with the original formula- so to those who are sensitive towards scents- you might like this one even better!This product was gifted by innisfree. Glass Skin!
