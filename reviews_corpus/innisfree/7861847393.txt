I’ve been using for about 3 months now and it works pretty well! Blackheads don’t go away but it def cleans up the pores a little bit. Super gentle, and gets rid of oily skin. I just wish it was like the peace out products, and you could see the stuff being removed! I use once a week or when I have been on my period it’s not bad!
