As someone who doesn’t like heavy or sticky feeling products, this moisturizer really does the trick. The matte texture is perfect for me. I put it on after my showers, and I don’t even feel that I put anything on. It goes on and then disappears, like magic! It’s hydrating enough for my needs and doesn’t irritate my skin. Highly recommend this moisturizer! Excellent daily use moisturizer!
