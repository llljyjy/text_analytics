This is a nice lightweight sunscreen for every day use. It layers well with my other skincare and makeup, and doesnâ€™t pill, which is often an issue. The scent is light and dissipates quickly. I wear a more heavy duty sunscreen when at the beach or in the sun for an extended period of time, but this product is a great affordable version for every day. good for every day
