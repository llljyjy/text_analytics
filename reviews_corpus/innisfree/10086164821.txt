This Green Tea Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Moisturizer is amazing. I’ve used this for about a week now. It’s very light and smooth when applying. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive which is a bonus because I’m super cautious with skincare. This is definitely perfect during the cold months and even during the summer. A Must!
