my favorite sunscreen ever!!! i always use it underneath my tinted moisturizer and it always creates a dewy base before. i wore it to a lake day and it stayed on perfectly fine within 4 hours and one one reapplication (i was in water most of the time but it still didn’t come off or get me sunburnt). it also doesn’t have any white cast for me, but im very pale so i’m not sure if it would for darker skintones nan
