I love K-beauty products!! This lightweight gel serum gives such intense hydration but feels very lightweight on! It’s got 5 types of Hyaluronic Acid to help keep skin hydrated all day long!!  I like to apply this both during my morning and nighttime skincare routines (I apply right after cleansing and before moisturizer). It’s got a subtle scent to it that I enjoy too! I highly recommend it!! Very hydrating!!
