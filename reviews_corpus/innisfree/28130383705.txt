#trybeforebuyit #topboxcircle #SampleGot my innisfree moisturizer through TopBox Circle and just fell in love! To start has a mild scent, really creamy and great to spread. After a couple of uses I could notice fine lines disappear and a skin more smooth. Winter always ruins my skin and innisfree moisturizer really helped me! I applied before sleep, having tried yet in the morning. Must have moisturizer!
