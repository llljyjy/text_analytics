I absolutely love this light-weight sunscreen! It has a light smell which remind me of sunblock you would put on at the beach but its not that is overbearing at all.The consistency reminds me a lot of the LaRoche Posay sunscreen I have but I actually favor this one. For the price it is definitely worth it! YASSS
