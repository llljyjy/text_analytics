I was sent this complimentary from Innisfree and was soooo excited! I’d been wanting to try this for a long time. Upon opening it, I noticed the beautiful sweet/floral scent.  The gel texture is amazing and feels cold against my skin. The best part is how quickly it absorbs and doesn’t leave any sticky feeling behind. I feel like this will definitely be my go to Summer moisturizer! Amazing and great scent!
