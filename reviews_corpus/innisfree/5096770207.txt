I received this product for free from Topbox in exchange for my honest review.I hadn’t tried any products from innisfree’s green line before, but having used this moisturizer for a couple of weeks, I would definitely consider their other products.  I found the cream to be lightweight, with a non-offensive scent.  It absorbs quickly and didn’t irritate my skin. I think the hyaluronic acid addition to this cream is an asset, especially as the weather changes and dry skin afflicts the rest of my body.  I’d recommend giving it a try. Pleasantly surprised
