Very Hydrating! - This gel cream to start off smells amazing, the subtle scent is relaxing. No doubt this product is very hydrating and light weight. It leaves the skin incredibly dewy and feeling nice. Def an amazing product for those off days that you just want to re-nourish your skin entirely. Very Hydrating!
