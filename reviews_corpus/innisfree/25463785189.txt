I have dry skin especially in the winter months and I was impressed with this cream. I loved the creamy texture and that it glides on smoothly. My skin looked dewy and hydrated while feeling soft. I loved the ingredients in this cream. It has a light scent which was fresh and not overpowering. I also appreciated the recycled glass packaging. I received this product from Topbox Circle for free for my honest opinion. #trywithtopboxcircle So Hydrating
