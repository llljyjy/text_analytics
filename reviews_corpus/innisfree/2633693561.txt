It’s a good thing they called this. Jelly moisturizer, because everyone will be JELLY of your skin. Okay that was bad, but the moisturizer definitely isn’t! My skin is super dewy, very plump, and there’s not a dry skin flake in sight. Plus you can’t beat the price!This was gifted by Innisfree, but I will absolutely be repurchasing. Totally worth it!
