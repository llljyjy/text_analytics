I received this #freeproduct to #trywithtopbox.  Fabulous moisturizer that is lightly scented with a very clean smell.   You only need a little and it doesn’t feel sticky as it seems to absorb so well.   The packaging is lovely with the dark green glass jar.  I used it mostly in the morning but on trying it in the evening, because it absorbs so well, no sticky feeling on my pillow.  When I checked to see the rest of their products, I was delighted to see how well they were priced.  This is the best hydrating moisturizer that I’ve tried and will check out the rest of their products. Exceptional performance and priced right!
