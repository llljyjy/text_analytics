This product does what it says - this gel leaves your skin looking super dewy and glowy. However, I was not a huge fan of the sticky and tacky feeling it left on my face! Fairly uncomfortable for me especially when I was trying to sleep. Next time I will have to go with the lightest layer possible to avoid that feeling. The scent was also a bit too artificial cherry blossom for me, I would have opted for a fragrance free gel instead. *gifted by innisfree nan
