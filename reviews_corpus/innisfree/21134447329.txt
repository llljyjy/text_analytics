I’ve had this for a week now and instantly I knew I would like it for the simple reason that this is the only sunscreen I have used that hasn’t burned and irritated my face. I do wish there was more spf, but I’m just really pleased I can actually use this every day without worrying my face will be bright red and splotchy in minutes after applying. Really Good
