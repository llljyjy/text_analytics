Ugh. I’m so sad. The reviews for this product were so convincing and I’ve been on the hunt for a great moisturizer for oily skin. So far no luck. I had super high hopes for this product. I usually put this on after I use the innisfree pore clearing toner with volcanic clusters. When I tell you, that my skin feels TIGHT after the moisturizer dries, it literally feels like I have a clay mask on (the tightness of a clay mask). Even when I don’t use the toner, and I just wash my face and put the moisturizer on, my face is so dry, it starts to flake around my forehead. For my skin type (oily t-zone, super sensitive) it does not work. My face gets red, especially my cheeks. I have not seen my pores clear up. I guess my hunt continues. I gave three stars due to the pricing and the amount of product given. Not What I expected
