I purchased this cleanser back in October and used it religiously for 2 months before writing this review. This has been an absolute game changer. I used to have a lot of textured skin and this cleanser really helped reducing it. My skin is so soft, super in love with creamy foam cleansers. Don’t think I’ll ever go back to gel cleansers. Truly feels like you’re giving your skin a 60-90 seconds facial in the morning and evening. So refreshing. And for $13?? Can’t go wrong. I have acne prone skin and tried a good amount of cleansers. Cream foam cleaners are amazing. I’ve tried the other cleanser from Innisfree, that one is great as well (don’t think Sephora has it anymore, it’s the hydrated cleansing  foam with green tea). I highly recommend this product if you’re struggling with textured skin. Refreshing!
