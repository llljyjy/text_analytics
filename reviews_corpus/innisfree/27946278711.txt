During my time in Taiwan 4 years ago, I used this cleanser to help clear up blemishes and pimples. Now that Iâ€™m using the cleanser again for the same reasons as before, I can say it has done the same thing. I will mention that I am however not acne prone, but when I do get a pimple or any form of acne on my face, this cleanser does help. Saved me in Taiwan, still helpful now
