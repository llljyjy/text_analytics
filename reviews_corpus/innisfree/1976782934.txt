I’ve always been a huge innisfree supporter and was excited to try the hyaluronic acid cream! It’s such a clean and refreshing scent and leaves my skin feeling extra hydrated and plump. I use it in the morning after a toner and before an additional moisturizer because it’s winter, but I could easily see myself using just this HA cream in the summer because it’s so lightweight and absorbs so well! Really great HA and affordable!
