I received the Dewey glow jelly cream  gifted by innisfree and Me tell you it works really well. I apply mine after washing my face and using toner and it really does help my skin! When I use it I feel that my skin is a lot softer and it has a beautiful radiant glow. And I really like the cherry blossom fragrance as well. Love the glow!
