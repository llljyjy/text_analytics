Worked perfectly for me. I’ve always struggled to find a good sunscreen. As a dark skinned girl and someone with sensitive skin, I struggle to find a sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white cast and doesn’t break me out. I used Supergoop for a while but I personally think it’s too expensive and it makes my eyes feel uncomfortable. So I tried this out and I’m very glad I did. It’s white and creamy like lotion but it doesn’t leave a white cast. It has a subtle beachy scent but it doesn’t smell like sunscreen. What I love most of all is that it gives my skin a nice glow as I’m applying it. I can’t believe it’s only $15. I totally recommend! Good for dark and sensitive skin
