I was super excited to try this sunscreen mainly because of the brand and the price point. After continual use everyday for about a month I probably will not purchase again. It tends to leave my face feeling greasy even though I have mildly dry skin and also pills when I use a light moisturizer underneath (which I always do in the winter because of dry skin). It is also hard to get the white cast to go away even though I don’t even use the whole 1/4 teaspoon which is the recommended amount to get the full spf effect. I don’t fully hate it because it is an affordable option even compared to drugstore sunscreen and has a nice smell. I would recommend this product to someone who doesn’t layer many products because it will feel heavy and greasy and pill. I would still recommend trying to see for yourself since it is not super expensive, if it was any more expensive I would say not worth it. Not great not terrible
