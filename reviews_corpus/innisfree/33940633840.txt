my friend recommended this product to me when my cleanser had just ran out and I decided to try something different then my usual cleanser (glossier milk jelly cleanser). the smell of this cleanser is really nice and not overpowering at all, a small floral with hint of sweet kind of smell. After a couple days of using it I noticed I was breaking out on my cheeks, t-zone and my temples. I knew it was the cleanser since it was the only new thing I added to my routine. Overall this was a very nice cleanser but not for me or my skin type. made me breakout
