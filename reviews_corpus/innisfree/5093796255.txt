Love this! It’s lightly hydrating but not too much. I have oily skin, so spfs tend to slide around on me, but this is the perfect amount of hydrating for me. It doesn’t really work under my foundation. I use a pretty matte one (Estée Lauder double wear) it’s seems like it just won’t let me blend it, it just comes off completely when I try to blend. But luckily I have an spf I love for under makeup. But this is my go to on days I’m just running errand and want to fresh faced with a slight glow. one of my favorites for makeup-less days!
