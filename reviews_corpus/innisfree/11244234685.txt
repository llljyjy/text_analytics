I think this is my favorite SPF I’ve tried from Sephora or Ulta because it sinks into the skin so quickly and doesn’t have a white cast or heavy grease. However, I can easily use up an entire 1.69oz in 2 weeks over the summer or 1 month over the winter, which if you calculate is a loooot of money in comparison to other brands that have more oz per $. Still, I just find myself thinking it’s cheaper on immediate purchase and get looped in again. I still recommend ! Expensive overtime
