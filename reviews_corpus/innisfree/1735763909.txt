I received this free through Top Box, in exchange for my honest review.Itâ€™s my first introduction to the Innisfree brand, and I have to say I am quite happy.What a lovely moisturizer. A perfect product for the cold Canadian winter weather.  It absorbs quickly without the greasy feeling, and does not irritate the skin.  It is a nice thick moisturizer that locks in moisture and gentle on the skin barrier. I also love the nice light scent, not too overpowering.#freeproduct #trywithtopbox What a great product!
