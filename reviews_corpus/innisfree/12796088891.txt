I am AMAZED! I’m 48 yrs old and I could not believe that I would find a mask that’s comparable to Glamglow YouthMud, but without the annoying abrasive particles and uncomfortable burning sensation, and yet it exfoliates every bit as effectively as YouthMud and also doesn’t strip my skin afterwards! And best of all, it’s only $15 vs $60 vs Glamglow! I have very fair, sensitive skin and I use several different actives in my skincare regime and still did not experience any type of irritation or sensitivity after using this mask twice so far this week since I have received it. And for those of you who are curious, there’s zero abrasive particles in this mask and it doesn’t harden, flake or crack once it’s completely dried. I cannot recommend this mask enough for anyone who has mature skin, no matter if it’s dry, combo or oily. This is one product that I regret not having tried sooner and will never be with out as long as they keep making it! If you love YouthMud but hate feeling like you have sand on your face, then give this mask a try! You will not be disappointed! Move over, GlamGlow!
