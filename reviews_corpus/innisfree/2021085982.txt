At the beginning of this month, my face was covered in painful relentless hormonal acne, whiteheads, and scars. I would do lymphatic massage with a guasha tool which would help a lot but my old face routine wasn’t cutting it. Saw this product on tik tok and did some research. I was curious about the Niacinamide ingredient and the price was super affordable so I thought why not? After a month I noticed:- it works really best at night as the last thing that goes on your face- decreased redness in my acne the next morning- I have a less oily face - Can be a nice spot treatment to soothe inflamed hormonal acne- keep it away from your lips when applying or you’ll have the worst chapped lips everA month later my face is 90% clearer, definitely hats off to this product for helping with half the work of my guasha tool. Definitely give it a try with other things that work for you. Hormonal acne, and oily skin helper!
