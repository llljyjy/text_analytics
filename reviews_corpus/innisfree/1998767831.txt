I am a fan of Innisfree products and this one didn’t disappoint. I have been looking for a new and affordable moisturizer and this one fit the bill. It is great quality. I like that it is not runny and is a thicker consistency, but feels light on the face. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and you don’t have to use too much product to feel the effects. It has a light smell and I am already seeing results. Would recommend. Love the ingredients. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Super moisturizing!
