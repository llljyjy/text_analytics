This product made my skin feel sooo moisturized! At first I was worried about the fragrance on it but it was not too strong and actually smelled good. It didnâ€™t irritate my skin. It added shine, moisture, and even made it seem more glowy! It applied really smoothly too. It distributes to my skin so well. At first I did have to apply more because o was a bit to stingy BUT I can say a little goes a long way! This will last me for a bit even if I use it am and pm! A new must-have!
