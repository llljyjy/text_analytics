*Product was gifted by innisfree. The first thing I noticed about this product was how cute the packaging is. It is very “trendy” and I cannot wait to place it on my bathroom counter. The jelly cream is thick, and feels super good going on the skin.  My skin has instantly felt hydrated and plump. I will say it does feel super tacky for a while after application, but other than that I am a fan. nan
