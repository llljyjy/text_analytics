I got this as a free product to try and really enjoyed it! I love the hyaluronic acid incorporated into the moisturizer so that I don’t have to use 2 separate products for it. It’s perfect for the winter as my skin has become more dry and this provides the extra moisture and hydration it needs. I love the texture and smell, and the packaging is lovely as well! Would definitely recommend as a moisturizer for anyone! Great moisturizer with HA!
