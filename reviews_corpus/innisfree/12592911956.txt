overall it’s a pretty good product if you have more dry-normal skin, it really is hydrating and lightweight. doesn’t sting eyes or lips like most other chemical uv filters. my only complaint is that it leaves my skin looking greasy, but that’s a common issue for me because of my skin type (oily) great spf, just not for me
