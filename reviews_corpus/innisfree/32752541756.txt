mostly love this sunscreen! I struggled a lot with other sunscreens pilling on my skin, and this one does not do that at all. it has a mild clean scent (which I personally like). deducting a star because when you use the recommended amount of sunscreen (two finger rule) the sunscreen doesnâ€™t melt into your face as nicely. it also feels uncomfortably insulating when using that amount, and I usually break out into a sweat. love! except not at the recommended amount
