I have been testing out the Innisfree Dewy Glow Moisturizer that Innsifree gifted me and here is my review. First, my skin is normal to dry in winter months and normal in the warmer months. My skin can get super sensitive and reactive as well. If you are looking for a gel moisturizer that provides a glow, this is for you. This contains niacinamide, cherry blossom flavonoids plus hydrating glycerin with vitamin E. This feels super soothing & pretty hydrating on this skin but I couldnâ€™t get past the strong fragrance. Too bad that they included this because it would have been a nice hydrating gel cream. Senstive skin
