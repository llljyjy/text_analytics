This cream has been the gift that keeps on giving! I love that the smell of the green tea is subtle & not overpowering, even thou I wouldn’t mind if it was. But most importantly, I’ve had amazing results on my skin since I began using it. It’s hydrating, locks in moisture (which I need because it’s freezing here & with all the heat my skin tends to dry out), it strengthen my skin’s moisture barrier for glowing skin. I’ve never been happier! I’d get 3 more tubs of this if I could the Holy Grail!!!
