Whooooaah!   I received this sample in my Sephora order & decided to at least try it.  I typically don’t use clay masks because I have quite an extensive skincare regimen and regularly use other exfoliants (AHAs and BHAs), Retin A, and the occasional nose strip to clear out any pesky leftover blackheads.  So I used this recently (accidentally kept it on much much longer than directed but no big deal, I often intentionally do that anyway), removed it, and was left with THE cleanest skin I’ve seen in a long time!  My pores were literally non existent.  They were just gone.  I proceeded with my serums, etc and my skin was glowing like the stars.  It was a beautiful sight lol.  So I just ordered the full size jar.  I do realize the effects won’t last forever but hopefully they’re cumulative over time, just like the effects of other skincare products used regularly and religiously.  I’ll be adding this to my skincare regimen and will use a couple times each week.  I had no issues with dryness after using this, and I’m 60, but I also use several serums twice a day, including hyaluronic acid, and just a small amount of La Mer moisturizer, so I keep my skin in pretty good shape and noticed no excessive dryness from using this product ….just really tight pores:).  I’d definitely recommend trying, especially at such a reasonable price point and with Sephora’s generous return policy if it doesn’t work as well for you .. No More Pores!
