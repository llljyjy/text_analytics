I am new to this product and have only been using it for a short period of time. When I looked at the products, I expected for my skin to feel dry after noticing that alcohol is among the first few ingredients. I donâ€™t know how my skin feels so soft and not dry at all. I use in combination with my origins original skin moisturizer and the combo does a really nice job of keeping my excessively oily skin under control. Excited to continue using and trying under makeup, etc. Delightfully surprised!
