I have loved using the Bija Clarifying Spot Serum from Innisfree on my acne-prone skin! The small bottle size is great for travel and I love the applicator. The product smells nice and applys easily over the skin. My skin has looked clearer after continuous use. The product is not drying and feels like it makes my skin smoother! Great for acne-prone skin!!!
