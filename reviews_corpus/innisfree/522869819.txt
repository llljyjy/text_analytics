Unfortunately this really did a number on my skin. I got acne in places I don’t usually, like my cheeks and forehead, and realized this was the cause. The pros are that it’s lightweight and easy to apply, also doesn’t have a heavy sunscreen smell. I love this brand but this particular product just didn’t work for me. Nice but not for my skin
