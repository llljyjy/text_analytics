This product is really a game changer, in all of the seasons. I have very dry and sensitive skin so I was hesitant to try at first because it has a light fragrance, but it didn’t bother my skin. I put it on in the morning after I was my face and I end with a light moisturizer, but I’m sure that if you had normal/oily skin types you could just use this! Just bought my second bottle and the first one has lasted me months! Definitely worth it!
