This cream is really light and hydrating and works great for dry skin. It leaves my skin looking glowy and dewy. It’s perfect for this cold, dry weather because it adds moisture to my face to keep it from getting dry and start flaking. Highly recommend if you’re looking for an affordable cream for winter time! nan
