I really like this sunscreen! It feels very nice on the skin (it goes on smoothly, isn’t super thick, and seems to hydrate my skin as well), and it has a pleasant smell. It also doesn’t leave a white cast once it’s fully rubbed in (I have a lighter skin tone). The only reason I didn’t give this 5 stars was that it seems to make my face greasy after a while (I have combination skin--I think). However, I have tried several face sunscreens and this is the one I prefer--I’ve purchased this 3 times! nan
