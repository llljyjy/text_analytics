this sunscreen is of great quality for the price. it takes a bit of rubbing in for the product to fully absorb. at first, it leaves an extremely dewy almost greasy finish but after 15ish minutes the product looks more skin-like. overall itâ€™s a good sunscreen for 15 dollars however there are sunscreens feel better on the skin for higher price points. great for the price
