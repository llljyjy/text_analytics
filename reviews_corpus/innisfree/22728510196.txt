I like this cream a lot because it makes my skin look amazing and I saw only after a few days use. Works very quickly on skin and it smells okay. It feels a bit pasty on my hands. Would have to wash hands after when I did the first day but after a few days use I got used to it. It did not bother me afterwards. I use it day and night and itâ€™s very light on the skin. Not my favourite but would recommend still cuz it still gives a glowing look. I received this for free for testing purposes #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Good cream
