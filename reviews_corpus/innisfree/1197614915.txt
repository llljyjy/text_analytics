I have acne-prone skin and have it mostly under control except for a few monthly instances of skin troubles that pop up. This product is very gentle and doesn’t work as quickly as a more intensive treatment but it also doesn’t dry out the area either. The non-drying aspect is really great when you’re needing to wear makeup and don’t want to look crusty in those areas. It dries down pretty good and doesn’t feel like there’s something sitting on the skin so I was able to wear it to bed as well as under makeup. If your skin is sensitive to the more harsh treatments this would be a great way to go for those times when you skin is stressed or acting up. The photo attached shows the results after about 3 days of use. Gentle But Effective
