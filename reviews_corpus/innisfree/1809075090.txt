It’s hard to describe this sunscreen, but it literally feels like lotion and leaves this natural glow that is not too oily or greasy looking! i religiously use Elta MD UV clear, but was looking for something that was more affordable. This might just be my new go to every day sunscreen. Price, can’t be beat, consistency, feels like a moisturizer. Furthermore, i didn’t experience a white cast like i do with Elta MD (very subtle but i still need to rub it in more than the innisfree). Will be repurchasing again to have in all bathrooms of my house. Amazing non-greasy Glowy Sunscreen
