I’ve been using this sunscreen for about a month now and I really do enjoy it! Makes my skin look amazing, love the consistency! BUT if you have a active lifestyle, this is not the product for you! I go on morning walks daily. Usually in colder weather and I don’t sweat that much. When I have this sunscreen on and just walking, I feel & look like I am in a sauna! The product just SITS on your skin and gets very slimy when being active. Love this product when I am not working out! nan
