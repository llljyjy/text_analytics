I received this complementary in exchange for my honest review: i have dry skin and whew this stuff is dewyyy! I love it! You can also apply less for a more satin finish if you don’t have dry skin like me. It does have a clean scent to it that kind of lingers but it’s a gorgeous light and creamy gel like consistency that provides so much hydration for hours. Dry skin be gone!
