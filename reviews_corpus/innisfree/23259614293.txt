I recieved this product complimentary, just in time for my trip to the Bahamas where I am in the salt water a lot and need moisture. I use this product as part of my night time routine over a serum. I love the scent, the gel-cream textures glides on easily and my skin stays hydrated. My skin looks plumper and healthier. I would definitely buy this product again and recommend it! #freeproduct Great moisturizer for the price!
