I agree, this moisturizer is “sticky”, not ridiculously sticky but there is a level of “tackiness” to it. This could pose a problem if you’re applying multiple hydrating serums or treatments before applying this moisturizer. It is light and it DOES give a dewy affect, so I would advise applying a smaller amount to avoid too much of a sticky affect. It is scented but not strong, it sort of smells like candy. Perfect for summer rather than winter though. nan
