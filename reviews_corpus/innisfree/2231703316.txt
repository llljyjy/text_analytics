I love this green tea hyaluronic serum from Innisfree. My skin feels so soft, smooth, well hydrated and nourished. It is very gentle and lightweight on the skin. I use it after I shower and before all my serum. I noticed the long lasting hydration it provided my skin. Highly recommend. Long lasting hydration
