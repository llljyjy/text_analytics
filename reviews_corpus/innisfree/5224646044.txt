I have been using this serum since before Sephora sold Innisfree. I am a huge fan of k-skin care. I have can be prone to dry skin. Recently I bought an 80$ serum to test against this serum (higher end brand at sephora) and this one still wins. Plus for the amount you get for the price is just unbeatable. one of my fav serums
