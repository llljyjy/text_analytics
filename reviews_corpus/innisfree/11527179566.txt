I received the innisfree green tea hyaluronic acid hydrating moisturizer completely #freeproduct to #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review . I am completely blown away by this beautiful product and I am so happy to have been selected. The cream is slightly thick and has a very light and pleasant scent to it.The Innisfree moisturizer is definitely hydrating and very moisturizing. It also absorbs easily onto the skin and does not feel sticky in the least. I feel very comfortable after applying it and I actually feel like my face feels quite refreshed too. One of the best moisturizers.
