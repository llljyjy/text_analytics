Wow this mad is PHENOMENAL! Not your average dry hard clay mask. Itâ€™s very comfortable on the skin. It dries down but not in a cracky cement on your face way. Washes off very easily and leaves your skin feeling super clean but not striped and dry. Definitely my new favorite clay mask. Will always repurchase this moving forward! nan
