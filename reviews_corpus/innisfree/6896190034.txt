I have been trying to get a hold of this Dewy glow jelly cream ever since it went viral on TikTok. I am so happy I finally got to try it complimentary from Innisfree. It is  such a soothing ,cooling ,colorless, gel- like moisturizer. The texture reminds me of aloe vera gel. It has a beautiful faint scent. The moisturizer absorbs quickly and left my skin looking Dewey just like its name. I think this moisturizer would be perfect for spring and summer ,warm hot days since it feels so cooling on the skin. I have normal to dry skin and it kept my skin hydrated all day.
