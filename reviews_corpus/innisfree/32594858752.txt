I love this mask. Itâ€™s at an excellent price point for all that it does. The lactic acid has done wonders for my skin in comparison to other more costly formulas. I would recommend this mask for use to others. My face feels clean and not tight after use. After removing the mask after about 15-20min I saw tremendous amount of impurities lifted off of my face and I am a double cleanse girl. So feel free to try it because it works as advertised. Eliminates all the impurities, must have skin-care
