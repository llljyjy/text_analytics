This hyaluronic serum is really wonderful for my combination skin. I often feel like I need a lot more hydration after using clarifying products for my acne prone skin, but I donâ€™t want to use a heavy moisturizer so this is where this comes in for me. It absorbs well for makeup application. My skin feels soft, smooth, and hydrated. Definitely a great lightweight staple in my skincare routine. Must Have Hydration for Combo Skin
