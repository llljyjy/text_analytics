This is one of the few sunscreens that actually goes on clear, and with porcelain skin, I don’t need anything making me look more pale like sunscreen white cast! I have Lupus & Sjögren’s, so my skin is extremely sensitive and dry. This doesn’t bother me at all! It goes on smoothly and clear - feels so nice! I highly recommend to try, and the price point won’t break your budget. Great for Sensitive Skin & Goes on Clear
