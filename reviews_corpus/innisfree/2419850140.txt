I think this is the first review I have ever written for Sephora - but this convinced me to share with you all how wonderful, effective, and affordable this mask is. After washing my face, I applied the mask with a mask brush (from Gee Beauty). It applies exceptionally smooth and is a dream to take off. The mask is cooling and refreshing and leaves your face visibly smoother and pores are visibly smaller - however, it does not leave you feeling you dry or tight which I appreciated. I have oily skin and have breakouts from time-to-time (mostly cystic and around my period) but this has kept my skin in check and is a nice treat after a long day. I absolutely recommend you try this, especially for its price point. A must have in my self-care routine!
