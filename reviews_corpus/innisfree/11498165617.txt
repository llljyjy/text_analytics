What stands out to me about this product is how light this product seems but how deeply moisturizing it feels applying. It feels refreshing and has a light natural scent that really adds to the experience. It gave my skin a really nice plumping and glow that made my skin look really healthy and happy. Definitely a great cream! Perfectly Light and Surprisingly Moisturizing
