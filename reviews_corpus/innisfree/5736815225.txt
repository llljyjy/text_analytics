This is my absolute favorite sunscreen. No pilling, no white cast, no bad scent, and it’s a mineral sunscreen so safe for reefs and travel outside the US. The price point is amazing and it’s 10/10 worth a try. If you’re trying to incorporate sunscreen into your daily routine for the first time, this is it. If you only wear sunscreen at the beach, this works wonderfully on the water too. It’s fast absorbing and not oily at all and I would but 100 bottles of this. nan
