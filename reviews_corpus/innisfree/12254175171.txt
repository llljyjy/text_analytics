I really like this product. It doesn’t make my skin red or dried out and it feels super clean after. It also isn’t super hard to remove when it dries, unlike some masks that leave a lot of residue. It’s not as intense as bentonite clay with ACV though. That really unclogs your pores. It just depends how clear you want your pores because ACV turns my skin beet red and puffy. :/ nan
