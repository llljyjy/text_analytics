I am SO glad I randomly found this sunscreen and decided to try it out because it’s no doubt, one of the best ones I’ve ever used! It’s so easy to blend, there’s no white cast at all and it doesn’t feel gross or too sticky and to me that’s always an issue because I have extreeemely oily skin and this still felt light weight and definitely more like a water based moisturizer than sunscreen. My new favorite and will be repurchased as soon as I’m out! New Fav
