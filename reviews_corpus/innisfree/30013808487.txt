I always love a good cream so I was excited to try this. This is A green tea seed hyaluronic acid cream. I love hyaluronic acid products they have great benefits. This cream comes in a green container which is cute. Nice dip container. Scent is very minimal which is nice. My skin was instantly softer and hydrated. My pores looked better after just one use. Skin looked more even and clearer. Loved it 10/10. Good
