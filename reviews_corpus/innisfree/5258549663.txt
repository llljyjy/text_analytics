I love all Innisfree products and this one did NOT disappoint! The packaging is so cute and the product itself smells amazing! The jelly texture felt so light on my skin but was still very hydrating! As I have drier skin, I usually crave heavier creams, but this one kept my skin hydrated all day and worked incredible under my makeup. nan
