I recently had the opportunity to add this moisturiser into my daily skincare routine. I applied it at night after I used my regular cleanser. I love that it is very light weight, soaks in quickly and does not leave any sticky or oily residue. I also like that it has a clean and mild scent. The scent does very lightly linger but tends to disappear completely within a few hours. Overall itâ€™s become a really lovely addition to my winter skincare routine, and would highly recommend it to anybody with dry/ combination skin.  I received this item free from Topbox Circle. Perfect for my dry Winter Skin
