There’s a reason this sunscreen always sells out. Its really great. If you hate the feeling of thick and greasy sunscreen, you’ll love this. It feels like a light moisturizer. Doesn’t get greasy after reapplying throughout the day. My only gripe is that I can’t buy a bigger size! my favorite everyday sunscreen
