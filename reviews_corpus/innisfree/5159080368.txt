Iâ€™ve been looking for a hydrating moisturizer that helps my skin rehydrated overnight and this one does an excellent job.  It has a smooth jelly like texture and has a very faint scent.  I apply this before I go to sleep and my skin feels great in the mornings.  I also love the packaging, the jar is great quality! Great overnight moisturizer
