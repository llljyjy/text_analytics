I tried innisfree Hyaluronic Acid Cream for the first time and loved it. I have been using this cream every night for the last few days. Only little amount is enough and it gets absorbed into the skin quickly. My skin feels soft and smooth after applying this cream. It keeps my skin hydrated for a long time. I like the subtle scent. The packaging is very nice and environment friendly. Itâ€™s a great addition to my skin care routine. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Amazing Cream!
