This clay mask has been part of my skincare routine for years - it’s a go-to when I need a gentle and effective mask to exfoliate and clear up my skin. This is my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador. This is a no muss, no fuss, get it done creamy, light charcoal grey hued, kaolin clay based mask that when used once or twice per week on the oiliest parts of my combination skin (nose, chin and jawline) gently but effectively exfoliates, clarifies, deep cleans, softens and smooths skin in under 20 minutes, without leaving it overly dry or tight. All for under $20 ($15 + tax). A little goes a long way so you get a lot of bang for your buck with this beauty. Consistent use over time, whether as a spot treatment or applied over a larger part of my face, has helped with maskne as well as periodic breakouts. It’s been an amazing ally in the fight against blackheads and breakouts. As far as clay masks go, this is in my top 3! 🏆 Simple and simply effective. A must have for me. Highly recommend.👍🏼 Simple & simply effective!
