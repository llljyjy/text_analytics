At first I was skeptical when I used this product, just because of its consistency. However, over the next few weeks I changed my mind. It smoothened my skin and gave it a slight glow. But, I would recommend it for more combination to oily skin tone. It’s a bit too lightweight for people with dry skin. Overall I’m pretty satisfied with it and would definitely continue to use it. Love it
