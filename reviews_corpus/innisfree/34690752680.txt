i use this as both a general moisturizer and before makeup and it helps achieve the glass skin look!! the gel texture feels great and has a cooling effect. it keeps my normal/sensitive skin moisturized through the morning. skip if you react badly to fragrance or have dry skin - product has a mild cherry blossom scent and is rather lightweight lightweight moisturizer for glass skin!
