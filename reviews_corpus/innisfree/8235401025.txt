I stay hydrated with Innisfree Green Tea Seed Hyaluronic Acid Cream right now. I use this as my daily moisturizer. As of lately, I’ve been struggling with a little bit of dryness on parts of my face due to the change in weather. It’s been extremely cold. I’ve been experiencing dryness near my cheeks and jawline area due to using retinol. My skin type is combination skin. However, I apply this cream and it immediately soaks into my skin. The cream is thick and has a pleasant yet refreshing green tea smell. It feels like you’re at a spa when using this product. It feels more like a gel than a cream. I’ve noticed a huge difference in which my skin has been less dry. I love that my skin is dewy, plumped and soft after using this product. It’s an ultimate game changer for me!
