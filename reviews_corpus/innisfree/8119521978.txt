I have dry and sensitive skin, and this is my new favorite cream. It is thick, luxurious formula that is calming and instantly moisturizing. Although it’s a thick formula, it doesn’t feel heavy at all on the skin. A little of this goes a LONG way. It does have a fragrance to it: a sweet green tea smell that doesn’t linger. I personally don’t mind the fragrance and had no irritation issues with it. nan
