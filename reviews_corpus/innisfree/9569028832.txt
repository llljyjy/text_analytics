Amazing sunscreen for any skin type! I was obsessed with the Krave beauty beet shield before the whole kbeauty sunscreen recall sitch & this is the only one I have found to replace it! It leaves a beautiful dewy finish, is lightweight, no white cast, no smell & sits great over skincare and under makeup. I also really like it because I can put it over my summertime moisturizer and my skin will stay hydrated enough all day in January in NYC! Literally buy it!! Such a good product AND so reasonably priced. Amazing & Won't Clog Pores!
