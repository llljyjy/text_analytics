My favorite sunscreen for my combination to dry skin. It isnâ€™t sticky nor does it leave a white cast on your face. It lasts me all day when I apply it above my moisturizer. It has not once broke me out. The consistency is rich yet not heavy and an easy/comfortable wear throughout the day. All around good sunscreen
