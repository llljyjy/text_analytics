Great sunscreen that doesn’t affect makeup application and doesn’t break me out! I have sensitive skin and have not had a negative reaction! Love that it has spf 36, does feel thick but blends in easily and best of all don’t need to follow with a moisturizer. For reference I wear a vitamin C serum before I apply this. Recently started with retinol and the combination had been working. nan
