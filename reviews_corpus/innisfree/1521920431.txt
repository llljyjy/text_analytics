My first time trying this product but I am a huge fan of this brand. I love the texture of this cream as it is very moisturizing but absorbs quickly into the skin and works very well under makeup as a base. Itâ€™s light but absorbs well into the skin and nice light scent. The jar itself is very cute and girly which I love. The product was gifted by innisfree but the opinions are my own. nan
