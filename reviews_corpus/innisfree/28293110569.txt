let’s be honest - this face wash isn’t going to change your life, clear your skin, etc. however, it is a cute bottle, nice consistency, reasonable price, and smells good. it hasn’t dried my skin out, does the job of cleaning my face, and is an overall nice experience.i would recommend this product, not because i’ve had amazing results from it (my skin looks the same), but just because it’s nice to use and everyone deserves to enjoy their skincare routine. pleasant product
