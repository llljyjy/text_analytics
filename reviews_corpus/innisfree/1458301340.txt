This feels great on my skin. I love that it’s a gel moisturizer, as they are my favorite type and feel the best on my face. It moisturizes really well, and it takes care of the dry patches on my skin. It actually seems to bring a balance to my skin that I’ve never really seen before. I am loving this product! nan
