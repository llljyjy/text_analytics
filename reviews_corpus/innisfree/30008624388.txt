This is a great hydrating serum! Itâ€™s got a very lightweight and cooling gel texture. I love that is has green tea extracts - this makes it very calming and it really helps with redness and irritation. I think its a great way to add hydrating, soothing ingredients into your routine! Lovely hydrating serum!
