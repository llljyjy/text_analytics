This broke me out so bad, tiny bumps all across my chin and jaw. Some bumps on my cheeks. I know this is specific to my skin, but I donâ€™t consider myself to have sensitive skin in adulthood and this made me feel like a teen when this happened with new products. Not sure what in the ingredients list did this. Otherwise, no white cast and light dewy glow. Plus great price point! Great bang for buck;  not ideal for sensitive skin
