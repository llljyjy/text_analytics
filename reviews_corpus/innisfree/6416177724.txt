I love this, I’ve tried many different popular suncreens,  but this is moisturizing and soft on my dehydrated combo skin. The price is great also. Also not sure why people are stillll complaining about how full a product is, it is sold by weight. Your not getting ripped off, just look at the weight before buying. You’re still getting 1.69 ounces no matter the component size. Mini rant over. Favorite sunscreen
