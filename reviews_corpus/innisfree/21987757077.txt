I have dehydrated skin that needs a lot of water packed in before locking it all in with oil-based moisturizers. This serum is AWESOME for toning and hydrating my skin. The hydration keeps my skin from getting dry and irritated, so it actually helps as a base for using other serums and treatments.My skin drinks it up, but actually feels saturated with moisture instead of just evaporating away like other watery serums feel sometimes. I highly recommend! This is the bomb, a water bomb!
