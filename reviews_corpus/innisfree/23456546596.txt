I LOOOOVE this!! It goes on so smooth and feels so soothing on the skin!! It honestly feels like a lightweight moisturizer and reapplies beautifully. The only con some people may not like is the smell, it smells very herbal or medicinal I guess. But the smell doesn’t last very long and I felt it wasn’t that strong anyways, I can just see why people might not like it. Beautiful lightweight daily SPF
