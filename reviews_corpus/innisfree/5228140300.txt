I’ve been using this cleanser for the last week and I love the way my skin feels after I use it. It foams up very nicely and give that squeaky clean feeling without over stripping my skin. I highly recommended this product because it’s great quality and a great price. There’s no need to splurge on a face cleanser because… Cleansers are just cleansers, they aren’t going to drastically change your skin nor are they meant to because you rinse it off. Try this if you’re looking for a new face cleanser!! Must Have
