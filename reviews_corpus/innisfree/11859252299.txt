This was my first time ever using a gel moisturizer and I was instantly hooked! Unlike a lot of face creams it doesnâ€™t leave a sticky or oily residue on your skin, and even though it is a gel it is super moisturizing! I have been keeping mine in my skincare fridge and find it is so soothing to apply when it is cold! It has a really pleasant fragrance that is not overpowering too! I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone! I received this product complimentary from innisfree! nan
