I love innisfree products, but this is one I just canâ€™t! It may work better for oily skin. My dry skin hated this. It feels nice, looks nice when applying but after 30 seconds my skin has never felt more dry and sticky. I found I can only make use out of this when I apply a whole layer of a different cream on top which obviously defeats the purpose :( Even a toner by itself would make my face feel more soft than using this No thanks
