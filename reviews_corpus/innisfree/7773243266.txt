Please save the judgment, because I have never used sunscreen on my face daily until I bought this, but this quickly became a daily part of my skin care regimen that I can’t do without. It is SO moisturizing and SO hydrating, zero white cast, dewy finish. Absolutely love this stuff and for the price point it’s even better. Super moisturizing!
