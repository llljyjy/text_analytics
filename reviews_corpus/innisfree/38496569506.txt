this is honestly my favorite sunscreen I’ve tried so far. It’s so light on my skin and sits so nicely under my makeup. There’s no white cast and feels super nice on my dry skin. I have this one and the unseen sunscreen by super goop- they both have about the same amount of product but this one is half the price and way better, definitely recommend amazing for its price!
