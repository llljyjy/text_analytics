Ever since getting pregnant with my son 6-months ago, my skin has been anything but clear. I find that if I put a treatment on my entire face, the areas that don’t have issues become dry and irritated so therefore defeating the purpose of the treatment in the first place. That’s when this gem comes in - I love this spot treatment not only because it’s sooo effective but because the ingredients are CLEAN and GOOD for your skin. LOVE!!!
