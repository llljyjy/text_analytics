I tried a new sunscreen for the first time in about 5.5 years because the previous formula for the one I had been using was changed and it ruined the product. I searched online for a great affordable daily sunscreen that wouldn’t irritate my sensitive skin or make my combo skin super oily. I bought this based on the reviews, and I have to say that I am IN LOVE with this product. It’s even better than the one I had been using for so long. I recommend it! nan
