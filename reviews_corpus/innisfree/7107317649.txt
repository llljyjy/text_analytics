I already loved this gel cream before the reformulation but it got better! The scent is not as strong now but the lovely gel and watery texture is the same. It spreads so easily and is lightweight BUT still gives a long lasting hydration and a dewy glowy look under any makeup. Absolutely love this cream! One of my faves!
