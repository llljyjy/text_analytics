I’ve been testing this product for a few weeks as part of a #freeproduct trial with #trywithtopbox and I it’s been mainly positive. I love how hydrating and thick this cream is especially during the Canadian winters. The cream feels great and not heavy at all but the only downside I have with this cream is the fragrance. If you don’t mind a bit of a fragrance on your cream then I definitely recommend this! Now this cream is not overly-scented, but I would much prefer a fragrance-free option. Very Moisutrizing!
