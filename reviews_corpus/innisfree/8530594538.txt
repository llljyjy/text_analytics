i hesistate trying new sunscreens because im trying to figure out why i always have allergic reactions. im either itchy and scratching my face to my body or my upper lip has a reaction that wont go away for a week or two. i wish this worked out for me because upon application, this was a great, lightweight texture. it was so easy to blend out and i had no white cast. it wasn’t heavy or greasy or tacky. it wore super well under make up and it was easy to apply primer over this too. I’m just sad im having a reaction to this sunscreen. if you dont have any allergies to sunscreen, this is a great one to use! highly recommend. and so affordable compared to the others in the market! nan
