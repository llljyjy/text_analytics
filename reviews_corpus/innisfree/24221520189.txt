I have received this product for free from TopBox in exchange for my honest review #trywithtopbox #gotitfreeI have nothing but great things to say about this moisturizer! The gel-cream texture is lightweight, but very hydrating for my dry to normal, dehydrated skin. It absorbs nicely without leaving any sticky feeling or greasy appearance. It is packed with some of my favourite ingredients such as Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramides and Squalane. It also contains Green Tea which gives it a very nice scent, which is delicate and not overpowering. I also appreciate the product comes in a glass jar that can be recycled or repurposed once emptied. Iâ€™m very pleased with this product, and I can see myself purchasing it again. Love this moisturizer!!
