I love this hyaluronic acid serum so much!!! I use this morning and night, two to three pumps each time, and it’s lasted me just about two months. I used up three bottles of The Ordinary’s hyaluronic acid serum before this and was looking to splurge on a more expensive one to see if there was a major difference. I’m not sure if my skin has improved because of less stress, less hormonal imbalances, or the other products in my routine finally working in the long-term, but I have noticed a general improvement in the texture and moisture level of my skin while this product is in my routine. Overall, The Ordinary is more affordable and very good, so I don’t think that you inherently need this product for similar hydration. However, if you’re looking to splurge, this is definitely not a regretful purchase of mine! Personally, I will be repurchasing Innisfree’s hyaluronic acid over The Ordinary, but that doesn’t mean you have to run out to get this now or go over budget for the Innisfree—buy responsibly! innisfree vs. the ordinary
