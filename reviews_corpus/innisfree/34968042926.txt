I really wanted to like this spf. I do not have sensitive or any allergies that I know of. it does blend out invisibly. it does not leave a white caste and is lightweight. However this spf caused so much irritation to my skin. I’m not sure why. It doesn’t seem to irritate my partner as bad but it did cause then to erupt in acne. I can’t recommend on good conscience after reading the warning on irritation in the back. Caused irritation and acne
