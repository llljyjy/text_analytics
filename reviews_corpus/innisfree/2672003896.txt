It does what it says and thereâ€™s nothing fancy about it. The price is right, quantity is perfect, you dont need much to lather, pea size amount work for washing my face, as for removing makeup idk what to say, since I always double cleanse, first with oil and than with soap. Because I use oil base prior and than this, I love the fact I feel clean, some will say it strips clean, but I love that feeling after oil wash cleanser in first step. I use essence not toner afterwards so I am hydrated. I have Combo/sensitive skin and this is the best way to keep my skin  balanced and hydrated. I spend good money on essence and serums, that actually stay on skin, so I dont like to spend alot of money on cleansers but I need them to be effective in taking off dirt. And this does that. Love it and bought it for whole family. does what its suppose to
