I received a small tube in the Sun Safety bag a few weeks ago and used it daily until empty and during that time did not have any outbreaks. I tend to cover my entire face with sunscreen even over my eyelids if I can tolerate the formula and this brand did not bother my eyes.  This brand did not leave me overly shiny or oily like Fenty sunscreen did but I did like the feel of the fenty sunscreen better.  If you are looking for a mineral (zinc/titanium titanium dioxide) based sunscreen than this is not the one for you. Overall I feel this brand delivers a great product for the price. Solid basic sunscreen
