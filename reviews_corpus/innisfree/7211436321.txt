Super happy with this product! I just switched to a new skincare regimen that really dries out my skin but I have trouble finding moisturizers that don’t break me out. This one is SO lightweight, and it’s so versatile! I can wear it under a mask, a thin layer under makeup which helps me blend more easily, and a thicker mask layer when I go to bed. I physically feel more moisturized, more supple skin. Complimentary from innisfree Lightweight
