I don’t have much to say about this. I didn’t notice any difference in my skin whatsoever using this. It didn’t make it worse so I guess that’s a good thing, but it doesn’t have any benefit for me at all. My pores don’t look clearer after using this, and my skin doesn’t feel healthier/softer/clearer or anything that might be considered a positive change. I’d skip this if you were on the fence. Doesn’t Do Anything
