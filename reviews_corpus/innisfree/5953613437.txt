My favorite sunscreen ever!!!! I have super dry skin and love a glow. When I use my bha and niacinamide serums along with vitamin c, my skin is glowy enough but this adds more glowy but not a greasy look. This doesn’t pill and isn’t heavy. I love wearing it without makeup and with makeup. LOVE the price of it as well. I just finished my first bottle and I’m going to open my second one. I want to pick up the cute limited edition packaging. Only thing is I wish they had a higher spf version but spf 36 is great too. best sunscreen ever
