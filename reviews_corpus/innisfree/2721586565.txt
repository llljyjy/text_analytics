I’ve been using this product for 3 weeks as part of a #freeproduct trial with #trywithtopbox and I am really loving it! I use the product morning and night after I’ve cleansed and used any acne products, and because I have acne prone skin I’ve been looking out for clogged pores but this product has not done that and instead has actually helped prevent my acne from returning! It is very moisturizing without being greasy, there’s no sticky residue left even after I apply a thick layer of the cream, and the smell is ‘clean’ without being overpowering. I’ve never used anything with green tea before but after this am tempted to try this whole Innisfree line! Excellent hydration for acne prone skin
