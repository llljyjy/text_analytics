My new favorite sunscreen! I’ve been exploring more with Korean skin care and this didn’t disappoint. I have a medium complexion with combination skin. On your finger it looks very white but after blending it’s flawless and doesn’t leave a white cast. It’s not heavy and gives your skin a dewy look and feel. I also love the scent, I can’t put my finger on it but it doesn’t smell like chemicals. For the price point, it doesn’t get any better. New favorite product!
