I received this #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox program.  This face cream is a new and improved formula and packaging is more eco-conscious.  As soon as you open up the jar, you’re hit with this light floral, citrusy fragrance.  This linen-coloured cream has a light whipped watery cream consistency that once applied its buttery softness melts into the skin absorbing quickly.  It leaves your skin with this soft, smooth, luxurious satiny skin-like finish.  Although, with a slightly tacky after feel, this non-greasy cream leaves even the most dehydrated skin - hydrated and nourished.  It’s like it literally wakes up the skin, allowing it to look more refreshed and rejuvenated. Omg....What I love about it is its plumping effect on the skin and makes my face appear fuller and brighter too!  Wow, am totally blown away by how hydrating it really is!  It’s the perfect secret weapon to combat winter dry, chapped skin!!!!  Love it so much!!! A Super Hydrating Cream with a Plumping Effect!!
