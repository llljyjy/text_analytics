this is one of my favorite sunscreens! i’ve tried many sunscreens before, but a lot of them were too oily for everyday wear. i had used a japanese water-based sunscreen for some time, but it’s hard to get my hands on it so i decided to give this one a try. this one is slightly greasy, but the feeling goes away after some time and it looks great under makeup. highly recommend! perfect for everyday wear!
