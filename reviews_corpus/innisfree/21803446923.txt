If you’re looking for a clear and glowing skin (who isn’t! lol) I recommend you to try this clarifying spot serum with skin soothing Bija Seed Oil for your acne prone skin. This spot gel will help you gently exfoliate dead skin. I truly think this serum is making my skin glow and my skin feels so soft and fresh. Also the price is really great for this quality. I’ll buy it again! Great product
