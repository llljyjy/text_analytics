I really love this cleanser, I was a bit apprehensive on reading some of the reviews but took the chance when it was on sale and I would definitely recommend, I don’t think it’s too strongly scented atal and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped even though I have dry skin, lovely texture and packaging too. nan
