I have sensitive, combo-dry fair skin and have struggled with redness, large pores and tiny blackheads all my life. I know no product can permanently reduce the size of pores, so Iâ€™ve been looking for a product to clear my skin without drying it out. Most clay/acidic masks are too harsh for my sensitive skin, leading to flaking, red spots, dryness and overproduction of oil - but not this mask! Wow! This mask WORKS! It clears my pores, combats redness and calms my skin leaving it soft and clean. Highly Rx! This WORKS! Not harsh!
