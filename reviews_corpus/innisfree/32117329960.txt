I’ve had this sunscreen for months now, trying to get myself to like it, but it’s so weird. Putting it on feels really nice and smooth with a strong citrus scent- wouldn’t  recommend if you have a sensitive nose. My main issue is about ten minutes after it’s on, without fail, it seems to separate from my skin? It almost becomes its own layer just sitting on my face. And if I start to sweat, even a little, it just drips off. So long story short, I don’t even know if it’s been protecting my skin from the sun, so I’m going to keep trying to find an everyday sunscreen that works for me. Not my favorite
