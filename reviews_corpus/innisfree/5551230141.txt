So I really liked this at first, it blended in well wasn’t too thick or tacky feeling but it did give me some small bumps on my forehead. The real problem though was after I’d wash my face at night my skin would get flushed and burn. I’ve used the same face wash for almost a year now this is the only product I’d changed. I have fair sensitive combination skin so finding a sunscreen that works is tricky :/ Rubs in well but..
