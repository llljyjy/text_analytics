My holy grail face sunscreen for summer!!!! It applies so well, I have oily to combination skin and it doesn’t feel heavy on my face when applying. It also doesn’t leave a whitecast which is what I look for because I have a lighter skin tone. I wish that it had a higher SPF and I wish that it was water resistant. Overall I definitely recommend and for the price you get a good amount. HOLY GRAIL SUNSCREEN!!!
