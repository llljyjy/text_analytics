I love this moisturizer! I was a little concerned when I first saw it because it’s a small package but it is literally filled to the brim. And you really do only need a generous pea size because this spreads and soaks in so well and easily. My skin looks so dewy and moisturized as soon as I apply it and throughout the whole day. Longterm, I’ve noticed my skin looks and feels so much more smooth and even overall. I’ll definitely keep this in my rotation, especially for my morning routine because I love how healthy my skin looks and feels throughout the day after I use it nan
