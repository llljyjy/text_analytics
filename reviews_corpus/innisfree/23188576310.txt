personally for me it didn’t do a ton for my skin but it is a nice product. you definitely get a lot for the price and the formula, ease of application, and the fact that it didn’t break me out gets a solid 4 stars. i would give it 5 but honestly i didn’t notice it did anything good for my skin. it’s a pretty basic clay mask and makes my skin feel soft in clean but in terms of pore clearing or reducing acne like i hoped it doesn’t do much. i do recommend this product because it’s nice to have and might do something for you. it doesn’t hurt to try. overall it's alright
