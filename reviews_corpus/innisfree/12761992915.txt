Love this clay mask! I received it first as a sample and went back the next day after using it. It doesn’t say and it’s not meant to but for me, it helps with my mascne! I’m a healthcare worker so wearing masks for hours of the day throughout each shift is tough on my skin. I use this once a week or every other week and it’s really good! Helps my mascne!
