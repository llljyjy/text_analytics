At first this product ’seemed’ really great but after 40 years of not being a person who is acne prone, I broke out like crazy. I give it the second star because if I only use it on my nose, it seems to work a little bit. I would never buy this again and I am not going to be using it. Although I have used it a few times, each time, I get more and new acne on my face. I used it this past Friday for the last time and Saturday I woke up with 8 new pimples surfaced. I would not ever recommend this product. Will cause ACNE! 100%
