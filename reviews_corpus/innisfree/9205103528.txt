I’m actually very impressed with this moisturizer! Hyaluronic acid is a classic staple in my routine so it really packs a punch in this moisturizer — it’s more of a cream gel so I recommend for oily to combo skin types. It has a scent so keep that in mind when ordering, especially if you have sensitive skin. I usually use this in daytime. nan
