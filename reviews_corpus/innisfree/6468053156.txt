No irritation on skin or eyes, it applies beautifully under makeup, it does not make my makeup break up, it doesnâ€™t look oily and def not dry. I have tried more expensive ones but this one is perfect. The smell also is nice. I really enjoy it, already on my third tube, and recommended to my daughters as well. beautiful under makeup
