This facial cream is a must have for my winter skin! I absolutely love how hydrating it feels and my skin barrier has already improved after a few uses. My skin also feels more smooth and I looove the ingredients in this cream. The cream quickly absorbs into my skin and doesnâ€™t pill when I put makeup on after A staple for hydrated skin!!
