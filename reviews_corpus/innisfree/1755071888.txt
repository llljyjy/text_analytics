This is a nice lightweight moisturizer for combination-oily skin in the summertime. The ingredients are good and I enjoy the light scent (although that always comes down to personal preference). Iâ€™m not normally one for a really dewy finish, but I find this gives that glowy look without looking too shiny, so it works for me. However, you have to be careful how much you apply - it can be sticky if you use a lot of product. Pretty Good but can be Sticky
