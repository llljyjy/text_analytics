The first thing I look for when it comes to sunscreen is sunscreen that won’t burn my eyes which thankfully this sunscreen didn’t hurt them at allIt blends in your skin easily and there’s no scent I loved this skin for my sensitive/ dry skin.This price tag is awesome they made it affordable for everyone yes from me
