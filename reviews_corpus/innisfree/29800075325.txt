Grateful to #trywithTopbox for sending me this #freeproduct to try at home. This is my first tike using this brand and itâ€™s packed full of amazing ingredients, including green tea and hyaluronic acid!The jar is fabulous and sealed well. Although I do love a sanitary pump or squeeze bottle for moisturizer, this glass jar feels luxe! The cream inside is thick and perfect for winter weather and skin. On application, my skin feels soothed and soaks up the moisture given.All in all a great moisturizer! Must buy!
