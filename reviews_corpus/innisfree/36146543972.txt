I received this Hyaluronic cream by Innisfree, free from TopboxCircle. The packaging is uniform and calming to the eye. The cream contains Hyaluronic acid which helps lock moisture into the skin, this is good for harsh winter weather. It smells light and clean, and applies without a greasy feeling. Good to have
