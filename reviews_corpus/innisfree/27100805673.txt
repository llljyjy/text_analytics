as someone with dry, sensitive skin, this saved me! it feels super refreshing, clean, and moisturizing. i use it twice a week along with my skincare routine. it does a nice job of maintaining my complexion as well as minimizing my pores. because this mask has limited ingredients and virtually no scent, itâ€™s perfect for individuals that are sensitive to scents and specific ingredients. dry and sensitive skin friendly!
