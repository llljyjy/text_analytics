I was gifted by Tata Harper their Restorative Eye Cream. I have used a lot of eye creams for being 47 years old and have never tried this brand before. I have fine lines and wrinkles, dark circles, and puffiness, and loved the mountain full of ingredients that would help with my problem areas. The packaging was beautiful and was surprised to see that it was refillable. This eye cream had a light herbal scent that went away quickly. I enjoyed the light creamy formula. It wasn’t too heavy and absorbed nicely into my skin. This provided a nice plumping effect, great hydration, and helped minimize my fine lines. A little goes a long way, and I also apply it to other problem areas when I have excess after applying it to my eye area. It’s a bit pricey, but I wouldn’t mind paying for this. With consistency, I saw the wonderful benefits. So hydrating!!
