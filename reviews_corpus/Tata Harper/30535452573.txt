I received this product complimentary from Tata Harper skincare. I had high hopes for this eye cream. It claims to to target wrinkles, under eye bags, dark circles, and dryness. Dryness, dark circles and puffiness are My biggest concerns. After one use this super thick cream made my undereye MORE dry then before. My make up creases Bad and it just looks terrible.  I am a little shocked that this eye cream is $130 and didn’t work. I’m very disappointed. Disa
