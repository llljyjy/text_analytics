Heard many good things on the TaTa Brand, decided to start off with the water lock moisturizer. I’m super impressed by it! I love the texture of this moisturizer. It instantly absorbs into my skin, provides immediate hydration. Makes my skin soft. It’s got a lovely light scent to it, which doesn’t bother me. Gonna try one of their serums next! nan
