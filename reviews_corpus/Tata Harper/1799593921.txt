It doesn’t make sense that the people writing negative reviews about the scent, are also the same people that want a natural product. You’re not going to get a unicorn perfume scent and have it be “natural”. The scent isn’t bad, but if you’re used to perfumed moisturizers, then you’re not going to like this. If the light scent bothers you, then you don’t want a natural product. Go buy the cheap fragrance-filled products that you’re used to instead. This moisturizer works fantastic on all skin types but is exceptionally great on aging skin.  I’ve been using essential oils on my skin for years and some of the oils smell like wet towels, but that’s what nature smells like sometimes. You can’t always have it both ways. I took off a star because I do agree that the price point is ridiculous, and that’s why I always wait for a sale to splurge on this. Stop complaining
