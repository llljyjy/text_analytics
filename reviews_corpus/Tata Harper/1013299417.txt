Love this! Less is more, and it’s very nutrient dense and hydrating. I use this only at night (mature combo skin) and I mix a couple drops of her vitamin oil. Her entire line is so enjoyable to use. I am on a budget and even the green line is a splurge for me, but I purchase on promo/sale. Tata’s green line is complimentary to my clean diet and healthy life style. A must try if you’re seeking clean ingredients. I pair this in the evening with her cleansing oil, toner, and eye balm for a truly therapeutic night time routine. Love!
