I’ve been using this moisturizer for several months now and love it. I have incredibly dry skin, and although this says it’s lightweight, it’s very moisturizing; just this and my serum in the morning, plus this and face oil at night in the summer. I’ll switch to an additional moisturizing serum for the winter to keep using this. It absorbs quickly and even my skin feels great all day. Plus I love how it dispenses and that you can buy the refill. Lightweight but great for dry skin
