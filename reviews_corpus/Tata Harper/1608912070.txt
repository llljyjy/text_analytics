I was gifted by Tata Harper Skincare in exchange for my honest review.  I have used for nearly a week now, and as of right now, I don’t see much more than a good hydrating lotion for underneath the eyes.  The good things are, you hardly need any, a little goes a long way.  Next, the scent is pleasant and not too strong.  It hydrates well, but for me, as of a week in, I don’t see any huge changes.  The bottle is beautiful, and I like the refillable aspect, but it’s probably not worth $130 for me.  Maybe with a bit more time it will show more results Hydrating!
