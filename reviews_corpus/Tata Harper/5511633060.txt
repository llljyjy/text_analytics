I struggle with oily skin and breakouts, especially hormonal/stress breakouts on my chin. I’ve used lots of different exfoliating cleansers, and this has proven to be the most effective for my skin. The citrus scent is refreshing and the exfoliation feels like it gets the job done without being too harsh. I love the pump, and not having to fumble with a putting a lid back on a tube while holding product in my hands. Within a week or so of daily use, my breakouts have been more under-control and I haven’t been getting as oily. The only downside for me is the price, which is more than I like to spend on a cleanser, but it works well enough for me that I’ve continued to repurchase despite this.
