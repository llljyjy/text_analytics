Based off the raving reviews, I went ahead on splurged on this cleanser. The most I’ve ever spent on a cleanser in my 27 years of life. And let me tell you…it was underwhelming to say the least. Two stars just for the beautiful packaging alone. But the actual cleanser stripped my sensitive, perioral dermatitis-prone skin of all my natural oils, and left my face feeling tight/dry. There are so many better cleansers out there for a fraction of this price. I’ll stick to my trusty SkinFix foaming oil cleanser, which is much more effective for my skin type. You’re paying for the name…not much else
