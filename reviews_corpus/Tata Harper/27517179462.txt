Gifted by Tata Harper. This was my first product to try from Tata Harper and I was impressed! The texture of the cleanser was grainy, feels like a small sand kind of texture. The scent is also very citrusy and pleasant to smell. The effects I seen and felt after cleansing was having smoother skin, not stripped at all either! My face felt hydrated and cleaned, I was surprised too considering it does have alcohol on there. I really love the glass packaging of this as well and it just feel so luxurious to use. I do wish there were no alcohol in this however, but it thankfully doesn’t strip my dry skin of any oils at all. I’m just left with softer skin that’s glowy after use! Softer skin after use!
