I received complimentary from Tata Harper. Detoxing and relaxing with Tata Harper resurfacing BHAglow mask on this rainy Thursday night. I have tried this mask in the past and loved it! so I was happy to be gifted it. The mask is a very different from others that tried, it has a gel like texture to rather than a cream or lotion feel. Upon application the mask spreads easily, a thin layer is more than enough as a little goes a long way, it then starts  dries down with the feel of tightening which I believe is when it starts working on my pores exfoliating my skin. The process takes about 30 minutes to complete than I rinse with tepid water for a fresh and glowy. This is perfect for my skin during these warmer days! Youthful Skin
