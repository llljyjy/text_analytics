If I could afford to have this on hand all the time I 100% would. Using overnight and sleeping next to a humidifier is magic. This is my go to if I’ve overused something and gotten irritated or if I’m just feeling very dry from drastic temp shifts. It is a bit sticky, and takes getting used to if you sleep with it on but it’s good. I love to just mist my face and pat excess off. The end result is very hydrated, happy skin. My only complaint is that for the price, I’d love even a half ounce more, as I can burn through this in a few weeks. Gold
