I am gutted that this is so expensive, because it absolutely did NOT work for my oily, acne-prone skin. This is the only moistuizer I’ve ever used that makes my skin look wet- as in, so greasy it looks moist. It doesn’t matter what skincare products I use underneath (or even if I skip them entirely and go right from cleansing to this), this moisturizer always makes my skin look like an oil slick, and any makeup I try to put overtop breaks down by midday. I’ve tried about a third of the bottle and won’t continue to use the rest- it is THAT bad. If you have oily skin, skip this product and go for something else. NOT for oily skin
