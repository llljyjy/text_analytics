This mask has a unique texture and feel; it applies almost like a cleansing balm. It’s rich and thick in the jar but once it’s applied it’s thin and lightweight. It’s not irritating whatsoever so it’s comfortable for the entire 20 minutes it’s on. I feel this is great to use if your skin is flaky or if your barrier is damaged. In just one use, my skin looked more evenly toned and brighter. The result is minimal, but enough to notice a difference. I would repurchase again! nan
