I love love Tata Harper products but can’t stand anything with a floral scent (which is a lot of her products). I was hesitant to try this one but so glad I did! I’ve used her green clarifying cleanser for the last few years and just added this one to my routine. A very gentle daily exfoliator with the most wonderful light citrus (apricot) scent! Will repurchase when empty. another Tata staple!
