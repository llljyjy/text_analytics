This cleanser from Tata not only has the most delicious citrusy scent, perfect to help wake you up in the morning, but it cleans beautifully leaving my skin soft and hydrated after. Tata Harper Skincare gifted me this cleanser complimentary for my review and I will be a repeat buyer because it’s that good. The exfoliating level is good, but with my skin I can’t use it twice a day so I use it once, morning or evening depending on when  I shower. On top of how good the product works, it also looks pretty on my dresser. Worth every penny. incredible
