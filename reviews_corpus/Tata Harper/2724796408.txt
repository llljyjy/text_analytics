I received this product complimentary from Tata Harper Skincare. This product is absolutely gorgeous. The packaging is 10/10. I love that you can recycle the empty pod and just buy a refill. There isn’t a heavy scent to this moisturizer which is great if you’re sensitive. You obviously want to start by applying it only a time or two a week, but it didn’t dry my skin out or cause any reaction which I love! Definitely noticed my skin feeling smoother and looking brighter. Love the design!
