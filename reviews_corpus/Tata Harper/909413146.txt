This little pricey mask is worth every single penny. I love it so much; its clarifying without stripping, it exfoliates gently, it leaves my skin looking soft and smooth. Bonus: I love that as you wash it off, you can gently massage it with the tiny micro grains for added exfoliation. I also love that it never super dries on your skin (like some clay masks do) so washing/massaging it off is easy. I’m 41 with normal/sensitive/dry skin and I love this stuff. It’s on heavy rotation in my bathroom, despite its price. GREAT for sensitive skin!
