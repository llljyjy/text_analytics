I’ve been wanting to try tata harper products for awhile and this is the first I’m testing out. First off, the packaging is legit! Really secure and nice. You can buy a refill for this moisturizer once you run out which is great, less waste is always a plus! The moisturizer itself smells ok, not my favorite smell. It had a citrus scent mostly, with a hint of a diaper wipe smell? The texture is really nice and it feels like it just melts into your skin. No sticky feeling, no oily feeling either. It just feels moisturized and leaves your skin buttery soft!!I’m so far really loving it! No breakouts or anything like that and I have dry, sensitive skin. Definitely worth a try!! I was gifted by Tata Harper skincare for my honest review. Smooth as butter!!
