I received a small sample of this product from Sephora and gave it a try.  I liked it so much I was willing to splurge on the actual size product, though I bought it during the spring sale at 20% off.  I’ve been using it 3 x a week and my my face is glowing, feels tighter and lifted, but smooth and my pores do appear smaller.  I have oily skin on my T zone area and normal to dry skin everywhere else.  This mask seems to even out the texture of my skin.  My skin also appears brighter and dark spots not as dark as before.  I’m looking forward to trying more of their products. I'm addicted!
