This product WORKS. I can understand why some would not like the smell, but If you are someone struggling with acne just try it out. Approaching my 30s my skin started to change and since then I have been trying to get it back on track. Tried everything over the counter and various other cleansers. I have only been using this for a few days and the stubborn zits on my chin and jaw line are drying up! Love this stuff. Love this stuff
