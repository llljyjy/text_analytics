This product was gifted by Tata Harper in exchange for my honest review. This eye cream is really hydrating and nice. I havenâ€™t been using it for long enough to comment on the long-term benefits but it definitely feels great on my eyes and plays well with makeup and my other skincare. The refill pod was super easy to put in as well! Love the refillable pod!
