I received this Regenerating Cleanser complimentary from Tata Harper Skincare in exchange for my honest opinion.  I was super excited to start using this cleanser because it had a beautiful bright citrucy scent and little exfoliating beads that I knew weâ€™re going to make my skin look and feel beautiful. I was not disappointed in any way and this is now my absolute favorite cleanser that I use both day-and-night. You start off applying it on dry skin and massage to exfoliate. The beads are very fine and gentle. Then you add water and continue cleansing and rinse.  My skin was clean without being stripped and it instantly felt soft and smooth.  It was also soothing and provided moisturization.  No tightness or irritation occurred.  The bottle itself has a luxe look and is made of glass.  I appreciate that because glass is much more eco-friendly.  I also really like that it comes in a pump and all ingredients are natural.  As a reference, I have oily, blemish prone skin.  I definitely recommend  to all. Gentle and Refreshing
