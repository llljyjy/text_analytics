I have been a long time user of Tata Harper, and typically love their products. I wanted to try this moisturizer, as my usual TH hyaluronic gel moisturizer was not available at Sephora. I found it was too heavy and rich for my sensitive and combination skin. I ended up breaking out after using it for two days. I also found that it distributed automatically more product and I typically would use. This may make it not last as long.  I think this would be good for dry skin, but sadly itâ€™s being returned. Not for me. Too heavy for my combination skin.
