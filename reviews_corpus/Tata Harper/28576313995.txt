This is a great cleanser to use with their exfoliating mask. I donâ€™t use this everyday bc my skin can be sensitive to citrus. However, I love how my skin feels in combination with the mask. Very effective on making the skin soft, smooth, and glowing! Love it for special occasions! Perfect combo with their mask!
