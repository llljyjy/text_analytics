Gifted by Tata Harper Skincare. I love how this product is cruelty free, natural, and made to be refillable to cut down on waste. It’s super easy to refill, you just unscrew the glass casing, pop out the tube and then pop a new one in. This eye cream is slightly thicker than other eye creams I used, however it still absorbs very nicely and layers with my makeup and other skincare just fine. I did notice a slight tingle upon application, but no itchiness or burning. The tingling went away after the product absorbed in. This product has a nice clean and fresh scent. The only thing i dislike is that it’s hard to control the amount of product that comes out with the pump. Because this cream is a bit thicker it really doesn’t take much at all to evenly spread across both eye lids and under eyes. I wish I had a bit more control over this so no product goes to waste, but it’s nothing crazy. This eye cream is moisturizing and instantly helped with smoothing out what I thought were fine lines, but I’m now thinking are dehydration lines instead. My under eyes were plumped where the skin was dehydrated but not puffy. Most eye creams take about a month of continued use for me to notice if dark circles and fine lines are improving, so it’s hard to say with only a few uses what this one can do. My skin does feel and appear more firm but not tight or dry. I really like this eye cream! Hydrating and firming
