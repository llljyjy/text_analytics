Gifted by Tara Harper skincare. Okay, so refillable skincare is 100% the move right now and this is refillable done right. The pod secures itself in, there is no wiggling or popping out or any of that annoyance. The packaging is sturdy, beautiful land the refills are great. As an eye cream; this has instant plumping of my dehydrated under eyes. I imagine for bags it would work quite well, but I’m more crepey. I can’t speak on dark circles as I don’t have any; but this made my under eyes perfectly primed for make up with no pilling! refill packaging that actually works!
