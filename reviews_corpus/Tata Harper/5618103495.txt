As I age, the dark circles and eye bags are starting to look more and more noticeable, so I was excited to try this!! I was gifted this Restorative Eye Cream by Tata Harper Skincare. It was so silky soft and smooth!! It takes a small amount and instantly made my skin under my eyes feel so soft. As I used it daily, my bags started getting smaller and the dark circles started to lighten. I will continue use because it is working so well! Scent is light and it is the perfect thickness. Goes on smooth and easily and I just love it!! Beautiful!!
