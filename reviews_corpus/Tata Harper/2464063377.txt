The bad reviews are mainly for the smell and this is a fragrant product. It smells like earthy florals which I love but if you are sensitive to smells donâ€™t buy it. As a 30 year old who invests her money into skincare and is trying to stay away from Botox & fillers, tata harpers line is amazing. I also use her eye cream and find that it heals my dry, sensitive skin and works for me morning and night. I just add an oil on top during the nighttime. It also pairs well with my retina, vitamin c & sunscreen and I feel like it plumps up/fills fine lines. I highly recommend to someone who is starting to age and wants to invest in a great moisturizer!! nan
