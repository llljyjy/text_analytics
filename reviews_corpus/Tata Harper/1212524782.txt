I’m a little skeptical. Wasn’t there this huge controversy awhile ago about apricot seed and how it wasn’t good for the skin? Before using this I patch tested on my hand to feel consistency and texture and immediately knew it was apricot seed. It has a sort of rough exfoliating texture. I personally know that apricot seed isn’t good for my skin so I dare not even try.  I am disappointed they use it though. Maybe its grinded down so well that it doesn’t affect many, but if you have sensitive or inflammatory skin its not recommended. I don’t, but I am so cautious when it comes to exfoliating. I prefer rice powder. I was gifted by Tata Harper Skincare. nan
