LOVE this mask. It’s been a long time favorite and it truly exfoliated the skin - smooth, fresh, plump. I have combo skin and it work well with the excess oiliness that develops in my tzone. While I love this product the price for the amount of product kills me. You can try and use a small amount but I think a full face application of the mask will give you the results you want. If it wasn’t so pricy, I’d give it 5 stars. nan
