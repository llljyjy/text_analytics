The Superkind Fragrance-Free Softening Cleanser is fabulous. It is unscented with a creamy texture, so it is a bit hard to foam. Luxurious cleanser that is perfect for sensitive skin. It is worth the price- especially for those of us with sensitive skin! I have used (probably)over 50 cleansers in my lifetime, but this is it. I was using a multitude of other luxury cleansers, but since I’ve bought this Softening Cleanser, it’s the only cleanser I have used! 10/10! Must have! Morning cleanser HG
