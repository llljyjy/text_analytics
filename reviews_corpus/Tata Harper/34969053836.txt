This is a well-balanced cream that’s hydrating and moisturizing at the same time. It has a unique gel cream texture that smooths into a watery liquid on the face, and sinks in quickly. It is not sticky but does leave a dewy finish that makes skin look nourished and healthy. It feels protective and definitely keeps moisture in the skin all day long. I live in a very humid climate, and do not have air-conditioning, so I am extremely picky about my summer moisturizers – gels are never moisturizing enough for me or end up being sticky, and creams are too heavy for summer. This water lock moisturizer is ideal. I also love the pump jar! It dispenses the perfect amount of product and keeps germs out. Gifted by Tata Harper Skincare. Excellent balanced gel-cream
