I actually really enjoyed the scent of this eye cream; it smells like sweet green tea to me. I do enjoy the packaging and texture of the cream, as it makes the experience feel rich and luxurious. The actual formula, however, didn’t work for me. If I were actually paying full price for this, I’d be expecting a miracle. Instead I got a very hydrating, but otherwise ineffective in terms of anti-aging properties, cream that actually caused milia. I just honestly expected more from a product from this brand and at this price. Just okay…and caused milia
