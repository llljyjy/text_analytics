#giftedbytataharper - This is the first Tata product I have ever tried and let me just saw.... What an experience!! It was a light yet beautiful citrus scent that did not irritate my sensitive skin. And was those “sugar“ like granules that provide light exfoliation.  With the scent and texture, it was just such a relaxing experience. OH and my skin was so soft and felt well hydrated after use. I . am . obsessed. Totally see why this is so expensive!! What an experience!
