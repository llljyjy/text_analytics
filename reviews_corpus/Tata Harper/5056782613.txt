I received this set as a gift. I used it tonight for the first time and I tell you, the smell had me nauseated. The essence was fine. Then I applied the serum and it literally smelled rancid. I thought maybe the moisterizer would be better so I tried that. Believe it or not, the smell was WORSE! I washed it all off and put on my usual SkinFix moisturizer and am currently laying down with an awful stomach ache. No kidding. Do not recommend. Terrible scent.
