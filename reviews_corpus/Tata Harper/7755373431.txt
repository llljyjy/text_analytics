This is a rich eye cream with a natural lavender scent.  It blends seamlessly into the skin and doesnâ€™t leave behind any sticky residue.  The pump packaging is hygienic and helps the formula stay more fresh and potent.  This container will last for a long time because one pump is sufficient for both eyes.  The issues I deal with most around the eyes are dryness and fine lines.  This eye cream has softened the rough texture beneath and around my eyes and plumps the skin, temporarily smoothing out lines.  There is a slight firming sensation after application, but nothing irritating.  It works great under makeup so I can use it both morning and night.  In fact, when I use it as a base for concealer, I find that my concealer creases less throughout the day. Nourishing and firming!
