For the price point this moisturizer doesn’t wow me. It worked well on my dry skin which I was surprised considering how lightweight it was but the results were not any more amazing than other moisturizers I have for a fraction of the price. Despite other reviews I do think this is safe for sensitive skin and fragrance free but again there’s better options on the market. Not worth the $$$
