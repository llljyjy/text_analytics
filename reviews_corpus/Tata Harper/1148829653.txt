*gifted by Tata Harper Skincare for my honest opinion.Tata Harper Skincare are some of my faves for a reason! They create innovative products with clean ingredients that actually works! I’ve been using the “Restorative Eye Cream” for almost a month to properly review and let me tell you it’s wonderful! It’s got the “Clean at Sephora” seal so you know it doesn’t contain harmful ingredients in it! I applied every day & night, and noticed my eye bags have improved a lot and my overall eye area is less dry (kinda plumped effect) & little firmer! The eye cream has a subtle “fresh” scent to it as well that I enjoyed.. The refillable packaging is so chic, easy to remove, and I love the eco-friendly vibe of it! It’s a bit pricey but def worth the splurge in my opinion. I highly recommend you try it out to see if it works for you! def worth the splurge!!
