Like the others here have posted—unfortunately, I really like it a lot and the price for me was worth it. It is very soothing to my super dry and fussy skin.  The floral scent works for me, but is definitely not for everyone.  It’s a small jar, but a little goes a long wat! Super nice face mask for dry skin
