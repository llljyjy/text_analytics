This product was complimentary gifted by Tata Harper skincare in exchange of my honest review. I’ve been using it for a few days now and my skin feels more soft and fresh. The exfoliation is not to harsh for my acne prone skin so I’ve been using it everyday. My skin doesn’t feel lighter in any tone, but it does feel more fresh and radiant and soft. I’d recommend this product. My acne skin loves it.
