The Restorative Eye Cream has the perfect consistency! Not too thick or too thin and I love using it as part of my nighttime skincare routine. The cream is formulated with natural ingredients only which is something I look for when choosing skincare products. I would recommend using only a tiny amount each time otherwise itâ€™ll feel heavy on the skin if you use too much. The cream not only hydrates but also plumps the delicate under eye area. nan
