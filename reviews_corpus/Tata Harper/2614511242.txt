I love how this mask is gentle yet effective. It does leave my skin feeling soft and smooth and overall glowing for the most part. The consistency is very thin and light. The exfoliation was gentle and I love how it has BHAs, so a great chemical exfoliant, nothing scrubbing thatâ€™s harsh. The only negative is the price.  Gifted by Tate Harper skincare. nan
