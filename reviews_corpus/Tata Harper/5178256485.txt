Totally obsessed with this mask! From the packaging to the formula, everything is so luxurious. After my first time using it, I could tell that it did a really good job at exfoliating, but it was still gentle enough for consistent use multiple times a week. I love the color of the mask and the texture too! My skin always feels so soft and smooth after using it. Overall, my skin texture looks way better and way more brighter!
