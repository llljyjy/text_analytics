Like the package of the eye cream. Just like all Tata Harper’s products, it has some natural smell which some of the people may not like it. It’s ok to me since it’s not that strong. The eye cream can be observed very fast. It makes your eyes feel relax but the hydration will last for a whole. So if your eye skin is very dry, it may not work as magically as you expect. nan
