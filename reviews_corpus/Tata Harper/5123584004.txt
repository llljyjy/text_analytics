I was gifted by Tata Harper Skincare for review. I held off on trying this for quite a bit because I had a horrible reaction to another product and was afraid to irritate it more with a resurfacing product. I regret not trying it sooner, it actually helped soothe my irritated skin. The consistency is jelly like. I noticed a cooling and gentle tightening effect while it dried down. My skin didnâ€™t feel irritated at all and I found it to be super gentle. My skin felt more supple, and soft immediately. I had some swollen cheeks from itching so much this week, and it actually tightened my skin overall. Super impressed! nan
