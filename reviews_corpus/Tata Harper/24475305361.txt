My face is soft but red like I have a chemical burn. I followed the instructions exactly and don’t have sensitive skin. While I won’t be using it again, I can’t imagine that you could get more than 2-3 uses out of this tiny jar if you apply a thick layer as the packaging instructs. Turned skin bright red
