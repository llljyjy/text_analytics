I love the Tata Harper skincare line and what it stand for, it’s truly clean beauty at its best. This cleanser exfoliates and cleanses my skin without drying it or stripping the moisture away.  The duel exfoliants are gentle and effective, the natural citrus scent is lovely and my super sensitive skin responds to the exfoliating ingredients without irritation.  I’m really pleased to have an all natural cleanser that clears toxins from my skin, while leaving it feeling soft and hydrated, I swear it makes my skin look more plump.  I received this cleanser complimentary from Tata Harper Skincare. Exfoliates gently without stripping my skin!
