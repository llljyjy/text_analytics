I have dry skin and also deal with a lot of texture. My skin thrives off of exfoliation! I love this product so much. Iâ€™ve never used an exfoliating cleanser but it left my skin feeling so soft and a clearer appearance. It also has a great scent. This was complimentary from Tata Harper Skincare. Good for dry skin
