Loved the citrus smell! Skin definitely felt clean afterwards but it is has physical exfoliant apricot “microspheres” in it which I don’t think suit everyone’s skin. I chose to be more gentle with using this cleanser. I think would use it more as a weekly scrub/cleanse rather than a daily.  Gifted by Tata Harper Skincare nan
