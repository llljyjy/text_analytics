This stuff is amazing. It’s thick but a little goes a long way and needs to be warmed up between your fingers before patting in. I’ve never experience the grainy issue others have mentioned. With that being said, I’d also encourage you to order this product and anything else from Tara Harper directly from the brand rather than Sephora to make sure you’re receiving a fresh batch. Also note it doesn’t actually contained retinol and Sephora’s description is misleading. Worth the price
