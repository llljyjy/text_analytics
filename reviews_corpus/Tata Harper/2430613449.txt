I quite enjoy this. I use it every other day in the morning as it is quite gritty, so I don’t want to overdo it on my sensitive skin. It doesn’t remove my minimal make up and you would not want to double cleanse with this, so if you’re using it at night then make sure you remove your make up first. It smells nice and fresh and I would repurchase this as it is gentle enough, but still smooths and removes dead skin. Note that the instructions say to use on dry skin… I tried that once and it really hurt and did not spread. I use it on warmed damp skin and that is what works for me. very nice
