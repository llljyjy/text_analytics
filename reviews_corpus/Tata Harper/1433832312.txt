I’ve used this set for about two to three weeks in total, mostly to bed.I’m 46 and going through the change of life so my skin can be all over as far as moisture. this didn’t make me breakout, a plus.the samples are a good size. I find that the serum pump stinks. after the first week, it gives up the ghost as the product is rather thick for a serum, so I scooped out with the cream with the plastic tube. if I wear the moisture serum combo, I find my face sticky and I’m not a fan of that, hence why I wear it to bed. The spray is nice and I use it to refresh my skin if I can’t get to my moisturizer fast enough post shower (I have a toddler).I cannot comment on the smell as post COVID I am no longer as sensitive to such things. There is a scent but it doesn’t last.All in all, it’s a good collection and a reasonable price if you can grab it during that sale to try a new line. worth a try
