I received this complimentary from Tata Harper in exchange for my review.  This resurfacing mask is so exquisite.  From the texture to the fragrance this quickly rose to the top of my mist have products. Left my skin rejuvenated,  vibrant, and glowing and after leaving on for 20 minutes , no irritation or any issues, so this cam be great even for those with sensitive skin because itâ€™s gentle enough. Scent is light and lovely.  Bha and white willow bark, ad well as pomegranate enzymes round out the combination of top notch ingredients that really are like a spa treatment quality at home. Enjoy, I did. New Fav!
