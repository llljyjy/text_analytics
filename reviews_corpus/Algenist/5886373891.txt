This serum is gifted by Algenist! First time trying this brand. And, Gotta love collagen in a bottle! Love that it’s Vegan and gentle enough for my sensitive skin. My skin is mature and dry. So I have to be careful of what I use. This doesn’t dry out my skin. Loving the extra boost of plumpness and firmness in my skin. Good for Mature and Dry Skin
