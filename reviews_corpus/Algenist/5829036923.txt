I received this product as a free sample. I have previously used several Algenist products, and am always satisfied. This cream was no different. It feels thick and luscious, but quickly melds into the skin with no tacky or unpleasant film. It doesnâ€™t have a noticeable fragrance. My eye area is noticeably more moisturized, and fine lines less noticeable. performs as expected, a quality product!
