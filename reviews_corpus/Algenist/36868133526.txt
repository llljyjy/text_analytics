I loved this product but I will admit that it will leave the under eye a bit dry so even though I felt the product go into the skin, it felt a bit drying so I do recommend moisturizer with this product. Other than that I liked how it felt on and how my under eye felt with the product on! I do have every oily skin so this may be different for others! Great but a little drying
