Yes, I did get a free sample, but Iâ€™m honest in my reviews.  I really love this eye cream and a little goes a LONG way.  I ended up putting it all over my face one night because I love it so much, ha!  My skin is incredibly soft and strong the next morning. I will be purchasing when I run out. Good stuff!
