I received this toner complementary from Algenist in exchange for my honest review. I honestly am loving this BHA toner. I have sensitive skin and can use it without any irritation. I have been using this daily for almost 2 weeks. When I apply it, my skin instantly feels clean and refreshed. After just under 2 weeks of use, my skin feels so much softer, and redness has decreased as well! You do not need to rinse this product off-you apply it and leave it. I use this before my serums and moisturizer. I am happy with the results so far and I will continue using this! Loving this toner!
