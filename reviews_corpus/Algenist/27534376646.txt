This Algenist eye balm has a light texture, that’s easy to apply and it absorbs fast. It also got a very very light smell of coffee. I like applying it as my night time eye cream, next morning I wake with under eye area looking perfect. I didn’t find it to be very comfortable for me to apply it in the morning as it leaves a wet feeling under eye, but for the night time it works very good. nan
