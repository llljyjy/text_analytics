I received this product complimentary from algenist in exchange for my honest review. I have always had acne on my cheeks and my texture was not the greatest. This toner has helped my skin as i can see my acne lessening and it’s making my skin less textures. I did have to cut back from daily use to twice a week as I don’t think my skin is used to it. The one thing I dislike is the bottle. It has a plug at the top which I could not open with my fake nails. I had my husband try with his nails and he could also not open it. I simply cut it off as it was a nuisance. nan
