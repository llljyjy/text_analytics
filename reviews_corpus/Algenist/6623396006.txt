This product was gifted to me by Algenist but the opinion is my own. The product is more of a thick cream than a balm. I like how it feels on the skin, I like how it absorbs, and I like that it neither broke me out, made me more sensitive, or burned. I would need a significantly longer try out period to see the full benefits but I have noticed that the skin under my eyes feels and looks a lot more hydrated. I was looking in the mirror yesterday and admired how much younger than my almost-38 I looked. I would love to give it 5 stars but the price point feels a little prohibitive at nearly $70. nan
