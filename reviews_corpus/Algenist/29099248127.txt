Got it Complimentary from Algenist, I use this for my nighttime skincare, it is a perfect consistency. Not too thick or thin, keeps my under-eye area hydrated all night long. A little goes a long way, very easy to spread and blend; doesnâ€™t tug the skin. Fragrance-free formula that has great ingredients. nan
