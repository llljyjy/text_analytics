I wear this sunscreen every single day.  Every other face sunscreen I’ve ever tried has either given me a rash or major breakouts, but not this one.  It’s the only one I use now, I keep a bottle in my car and in my purse (I get chemical peels & my face turns red and scaly if I get too much sun…always gotta have sunscreen on).  The only downsides are that it sweats off, and so you do have to reapply to prevent burns. nan
