I recently got the 10-day results kit from Algenist. This kit includes a serum, moisturizer and eye cream which is perfect for a routine. The serum felt lightweight on skin, despite being deeply moisturizing. The moisturizer also didn’t feel overly heavy. The eye cream has a lovely velvety texture that didn’t irritate my eye area at all. After using for 10 days, my skin looks more hydrated and overall healthier. This makes a great gift set, travel set,  or if you want to try out multiple products by this great brand at a lower cost. nan
