This is my second algenist product and as expected the formulae outshines. Love the serum consistency it feels a bit oily and gel like but once you massage it on your damp skin, it completely melts away and gets absorbed into your skin like an essence. It makes my skin look bright and refreshed. Been using it consistently in my morning and might time routine. Loving the results so far. Gifted by algenist. Brightens and Hydrates
