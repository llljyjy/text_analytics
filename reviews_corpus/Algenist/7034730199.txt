I recieved complimentary from Algenist. I am in my mid 20’s and am using this a preventative measure, I don’t exactly have any fine lines I’m trying to combat. This product smells nice and light. It feels amazing,not thick and heavy on your skin.  I may not have any results but I still feel as if my skin is more moisturized and glowing since using. Nice and light
