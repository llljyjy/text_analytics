I’ve been using this eye cream for a couple days and I’m really enjoying it. I still can’t see much difference with fine lines but I love the thick texture and how my under eye area feels brighter and hydrated. Also love using it before makeup. It’s a little bit pricey but if you want a good eye cream I would recommend that! Complimentary from Algenist. nan
