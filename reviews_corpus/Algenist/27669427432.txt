I am complete new to using exfoliants. It is a product that I have been wanting to add to my skincare routine. My face has faded acne marks and uneven skin texture from past breakouts. I like to apply this product after my shower when I am getting ready for bed, in about a weekâ€™s use my skin has definitely improved. Great
