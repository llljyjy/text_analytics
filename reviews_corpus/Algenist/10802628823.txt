This is a nice eye cream. It’s rich but not too heavy. It absorbed quickly, didn’t look greasy, and didn’t cause any problems with makeup over top of it. It left my skin feeling moisturized, but after using it for a week I didn’t notice any improvement in fine lines. It might take more time to see results. On the whole, this is a solid eye cream. nan
