I enjoyed trying out my complimentary from Algenist liquid skin resurfacing 2% BHA toner on my skin. It works great at removing impurities and oily skin. I can use it twice a day without worrying about any burning or irritations on my skin. Instantly I didnâ€™t see results but after using for two weeks I have noticed my skin looking better. Great toner
