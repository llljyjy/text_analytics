Algenist gifted me their liquid skin resufacing 2% BHA Toner in exchange for my opinion on the product. I have been using it for about four days and I like it.  After using it on my face my skin looks brighter.  I’m noticing my complexion appears just a little smoother.  I’m looking forward to seeing the results after a month of use. If you want a toner that hydrates while improving the appearance of your skin this a great option. nan
