This totally repaired really old dark acne scars I had for years that would not go away. My skin is now clear and without any scars. I still use this for regular exfoliation to wake up to the most perfect beautiful skin. I use it at night under Lancome Absolue moisturizer. While this is stated as anti aging, used this to repair scars, not for anti aging and it totally cleared my skin. I find its also great for waking up to perfect smooth skin w no pores. Great product. Works for reversing dark acne scars
