Love it but.....I find that the Chanel No1 newly released eye cream with Camilla works best for me, brightens and rids the wrinkles, and its light.The Algenist works but for me as a contact lens user, I find it gets into my eyes and I have to use lots of eye drops to get rid of it. No matter how I apply it esp at night.I am >60 and have tried the Algenist line when it first came to Sephora only becausethe BEST skin care line ever, NUDE got dissolved. Weighty, not rec for contact lens wearers
