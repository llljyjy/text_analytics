This Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm is a vegan multi-tasking targeted eye treatment that combines powerful triple algae, patented Alguronic Acid, and a multi-peptide complex to help reduce dark under eye circles, bags, puffiness, lines, wrinkles, and crow’s feet in 10 days. I say this product is aptly named as a balm, it has a very thick decadent texture to it… It melts into the skin and absorbs fairly slowly, but I think this makes it ideal for deep nourishing moisturizing around the eye area. I felt that my undereye area was hydrated and soothed every time I applied it. However, even though the instructions say to apply both morning and evening, I found the thick texture of this eye balm to be incompatible with any eye makeup whatsoever. When I applied this eye cream in the mornings & then applied my eye makeup, I would notice halfway through the day that my eyeshadow/eyeliner/mascara would smudge and bleed. This never occurred with my makeup before I started using this Algenist product and as soon as I finished my samples, my eye makeup was just fine. So I would probably recommend this as a nighttime eye cream with how rich it is. But overall, it was a pleasant experience and I would recommend it! Decadent
