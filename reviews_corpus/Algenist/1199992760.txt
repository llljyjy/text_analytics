This is the eye cream that made me believe in eye cream. It takes 2-3 weeks of religious use (morning and night) but, man, it makes my undereye area look like I’ve used a blurring tool. My issue has always been severe dark circles and puffiness. No other eye cream has worked as well as this at diminishing darkness and brightening/smoothing the entire area. My eye concealer used to settle into a crease caused by puffiness, and I no longer have that problem. It is SO MUCH EASIER to cover my dark circles with makeup now. My eye routine currently consists of: Algenist renewal balm + Nars soft matte complete concealer (as a primer) + Makeup Forever full cover concealer. This is better than any other combination of products I’ve tried to combat undereye circles. Lifelong dark circle sufferer on my third jar.
