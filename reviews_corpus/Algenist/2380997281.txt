The bad: I don’t think Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm made any difference for my wrinkles. I used it every day (morning & night) for almost a month and saw no change in the wrinkles around my eyes (I’m 39). The good: I completely expected my skin to sting like crazy and not be able to use it. Never happened!  I mean, I am shocked because this always happens with every cream, but nope. Absolutely no stinging!Another massive plus is that I didn’t get any breakouts or little bumps (this is something my skin seems to always do with any kind of rich cream).The only change that I did notice was how smooth it made my skin and it made all the winter dryness disappear after using it for several days. Like TOTALLY disappear! I can now use a concealer stick during the winter if I use this cream! Safe for my sensitive skin
