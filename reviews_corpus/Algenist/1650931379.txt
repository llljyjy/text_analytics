I love the new bottle with the pump! Now I can get the product out in one hand without the mess. The serum is super hydrating and I love taking my time to spread it on my face and bringing it down my neck as well. I am noticing that my skin is less dry so I’m happy! Can’t wait to see more anti-aging result from long term use. Very expensive though. Kindly gifted by Algenist Hydrating Serum
