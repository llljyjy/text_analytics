The first think i noticed was the scent which was much much more pleasant than other toners I’ve used. It doesn’t leave my skin super dry either, however I did notice a bit of sting/burning on my face the first few times I used it. It definitely exfoliate and helped my acne prone chin area, it just takes a while to notice. I was gifted by Algenist. nan
