I received a sampler kit of Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm from PinchMe. It was a set of 20 single-use packets, so I can’t review the jar component. I used one packet each at day & night, per the instructions included in my kit. This is definitely a heavier balm, vs the eye creams I usually use. It didn’t interfere with any of my other skincare or makeup products, but if you heavily use product around the eye area, this balm might be too thick. It did feel very soothing on my skin. I did not notice any added fragrance in the product. I would consider purchasing this again, but I would probably want to use it solely as a night cream, using a lighter cream or gel for my day routine. Smooth balm
