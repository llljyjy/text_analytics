I was “gifted by Algenist” to try out and I am grateful to test it out! My skin feels really hydrated and not at all dry.. it has this luminous glow to it whenever I look at myself in the mirror, which is pretty new to me because it used to be either dull or not feeling like I didn’t have enough elasticity in my skin leaving a feeling of dry skin or even having a patchy uneven colored skin tone.. the results feel so fast, something I was not expecting to see so quickly!! I definitely noticed a difference in my forehead lines and also my laugh lines around my mouth! I’m not even kidding when I say this, but my face looks more youthful in the short amount of time using this Genius Liquid Collagen There were 2 times where I felt it was out on a little thick and my skin wasn’t absorbing it as well, so much that it started to ball up if I touched my skin, that’s how I know I used too much. One pump should be the right amount for me and really spreads onto the entire face, neck and décolleté areas. The new pump feature is probably the best solution compared to the dropper that was you know the right amount of product to use each time. I did notice one pimple pop up on my forehead closer to my hair line which is an area around the 3rd day I was using it. I don’t normally break out in that area.. after application in the morning, a few times my face felt itchy about 5 minutes after it absorbed into my skin.. décolleté did feel a bit sticky in texture… overall I think this serum is a bit pricey … I probably would buy the larger size (2oz) for a better value! A must have serum to add to your routine ++
