I have been using product for about 10 days now and am not seeing much difference yet. I do plan to go through full product before reaching a final consensus and to be fair I havenâ€™t been sleeping 8hrs each night probably also not helping my case. The product goes on smoothly and soaks to skin, a little goes a long way. Looking forward what more days will do! This was gifted by Algenist. nan
