I received this complimentary from Algenist. I have loved and used Algenist eye creams since it launched first and when I thought they could not improve formula even more I was wrong. This is pure perfection. It is lovely thick and creamy and works so well on my skin that is dry around eyes and has fine lines. It smooths them, plumps the skin, and helps it look and feel hydrated. A bit goes a long way. Love love love. Algenist never fails me Perfection!
