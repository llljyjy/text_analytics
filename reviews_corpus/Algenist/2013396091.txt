This set is such a good value, the eye cream is full size and that alone is worth $68! Perfect for if you want to try the products to get a feel for Algenist. The collection works well together and my skin feels softer already. The serum feels amazing on the skin and has a floral scent which doesnâ€™t bother me but I could do without it. The eye cream goes on and rubs in easily with no tugging. The ultimate anti-aging cream smells a bit unpleasant but it goes away very fast and, again, it feels very nice on my skin. Gifted by Algenist. nan
