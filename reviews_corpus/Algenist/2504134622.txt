I absolutely loved this product as a day time eye cream under makeup. I swear that it made my concealer and powder not look cakey throughout the day and last longer as well. The formula was perfect and wasn’t too think. I wouldn’t use this as a night time cream just because I like to have something with more of a retinol based formula. I can tell my eye look brighter within the time I’ve used it and I only need a small dab for it to go on my entire eyes so I know it will be worth the money once I run out. Great under makeup
