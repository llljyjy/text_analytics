I’ve been using Algenist’s Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm in my skincare routine for over a year but I recently received some samples so I was instructed to leave a review.It has a true balm consistency, sinks right into skin, no fragrance, no irritation and leaves my sensitive undereye area nicely prepped and moisturized. Comparable to other skincare products in the same price range. For reference, I’m in my early 40s with fine lines, no dark circles and very dry/dehydrated skin (I live in the desert). Beautiful
