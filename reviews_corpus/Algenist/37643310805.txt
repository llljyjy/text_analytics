I received this product for free from PInchMe in exchange for my honest review. I received enough product to test it out for 10 days. By the end of the 10 days, I noticed that my under eyes looked more moisturized which helped reduce the visibility of fine lines.  One issue I did have with this product was that if I put it too close to my eye, it tended to migrate into my eye and burned. So definitely be careful with how close you put it to your eye. nan
