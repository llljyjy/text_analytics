So far so good. No irritation and good formulation. I haven’t seen any miraculous transformation but happy that the first ingredient in here is collagen (makes me somewhat justify the cost). And while I have no irritation, I just wish this didn’t have fragrance, there’s just no need especially for a night cream. So far So good
