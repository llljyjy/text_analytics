I tried the Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm and I really felt the skin around my eyes was tighter after using it for awhile. I love the smell and texture. The skin around my eyes felt moisturized. My mascara on my lower lashes did smear though but it would be great to use at night before bed. Great product! nan
