This product was gifted to me by Algenist. The container is beautiful and the science behind the microalgae oil beads is pretty cool. No issues with the pump or application. Makes my skin feel more supple and look more radiant. Expected more results on fine lines & wrinkles (specifically my forehead) but thinking my Botox may be wearing off at the same time impacting the perceived results. nan
