I used this product for quite a  few weeks and didnâ€™t see a big difference. I will say it did feel nice on the skin, not oily or sticky, absorbed nicely and felt hydrating. The scent kind of smells like peanuts though lol. For the price and what it does I would just go with a different brand as there are quite a few eye creams that do the same thing for a fraction of the price. Just ok
