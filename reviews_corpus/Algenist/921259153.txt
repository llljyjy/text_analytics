I was gifted by Algenist the Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm for my honest review. I have tried lots of eye creams, and this one is up there. I loved the silky creamy texture and how well it absorbed into my skin. It left no residue or stickiness and felt so very light. My eyes look brighter and very hydrated. Using this has minimized my fine lines and has made them smoother. I am very happy with my results as a 47-year-old woman with dry skin. Great hydration!!
