I am 52 and I have fine lines and wrinkle under my eyes. I tried so many eye creams and Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm from Algenist has a perfect texture. Not too liquidy or not too waxy. Not oily or gel-like. I would love to put this eye cream all over my face. Itâ€™s that nice moisturizing but not overly thick. LOVE IT!! I received it complimentary from Algenist for my reivew. Perfect Texture for my under eyes (52)
