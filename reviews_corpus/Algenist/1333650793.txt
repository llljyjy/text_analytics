I am 43 with genetic dark circles so any eye cream that says it with brighten and de-puff is going to be in my wheelhouse.  This cream, gifted by Algenist, is very thick and rich in texture, but what I found interesting is how quickly it absorbed and dried down.  I have dry skin so I usually use very rich and emollient skincare that leaves some sort of residue but this cream seemed to just vanish.  It worked well under makeup and didn’t cause any irritation.  I can’t say that I have seen a drastic reduction in my dark circles but I am hopeful that with more time I might.  I would say that if you want a nice eye cream this is great but if you are looking for dramatic results I can’t say this cream will provide them. A nice eye cream
