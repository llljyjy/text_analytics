For reference, I just turned 30 & I suffer from dark, puffy under eye circles & focus on preventative care for fine lines/crows feet. I was able to try this eye cream in the form of 15 day & night satchets (30 satchets total). I applied this 2xs a day (once in the morning & once at night). I noticed after 15 days that my under eye area was moisturized, softer, smoother & even the creepiness/fine line in my inner corners was less pronounced. I noticed temporary brightening of my dark circles but I’m pretty sure mine are genetically inherited so I don’t expect much help from eye creams to fix that. I’m pretty impressed considering I Jose eye creams all the time & don’t generally see results like this in such a short amount of time. I would definitely consider investing in a full size product. 15 days for improvements in fine lines, puffiness
