This feels and smells way too much like a traditional sunscreen. I read the positive reviews so I had high hopes. Unfortunately this did not sit well on my oily skin. I look extremely oily with this on my face. I also feel like it was clogging my pores. I only used it a couple of times…I can’t keep this in my skincare routine. I will be returning it asap..back to super goop until I find something better. Not good for every day use OR oily skin!
