This is a great gift set to give someone. It has all the essentials for a skincare routine and is especially best for aging skin. I loved how the collagen felt on my skin and am very impressed that it’s vegan, as well. That means it’s a great set for everyone to use. It left my skin glowing and refreshed, so I definitely recommend. Gifted by Algenist nan
