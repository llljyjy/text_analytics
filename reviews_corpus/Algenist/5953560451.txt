This serum was gifted  to me by Algenist to  review their liquid collagen serum - Algenist is without a doubt one of my favorite holy grail skincare lines, and I’m glad they released this liquid collagen serum. I’ve been using it for two weeks and have noticed a significant improvement in the smoothness of my skin. I love  the scent  and texture. It absorbs quickly into the skin and does not leave it feeling greasy or heavy. This is my go-to item! Worth to have this serum
