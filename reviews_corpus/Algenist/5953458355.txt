This set from Algenist is so perfect. I personally love all of the products that come with it. I also feel like it could be a great holiday gift idea for someone in your life who loves luxury skin care if you’re on a budget. Not to mention you can travel with this kit as well. The liquid collagen serum is a product that I’ve been using for years. It’s been a staple in my routine for a long time and it keeps my skin looking fresh and plump every day. The eye renewal balm is new to me but I can quickly tell that I will be using this every day. Its very creamy but absorbs efficiently and provides the ultimate hydrating power. The anti aging cream is the perfect product to use following the serum for maximum hydration. See my before and after I used this set together for the first time. great way to try the brand
