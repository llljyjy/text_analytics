I love a lot of Algenist products, but unfortunately, this is not one of them. It leaves a white cast. You also don’t get a whole lot of product for what you pay. Sunscreen is VERY dosage dependent, so if you aren’t using two fingerlengths, you aren’t getting the advertised SPF (and I imagine those who say the white cast goes away are *not* using the correct amount.) Only use if you’re the palest of the pale
