Received this full-size as a gift. I have extremely dry skin, and sensitive. This did not cause me any irritation but I found myself using quite a bit to hydrate my skin to what it needs. I usually use the Tatcha Dewy Skin in the winter time. The consistency of the cream is almost spongey, I would recommend using a spatula (it doesn’t come with one). The smell is very nice and I’ve always loved Algenist products on my skin, but I can’t justify the price point at this time. Maybe if I use the whole jar and notice results, but still seems expensive. Not sure about the price but it is good
