I like Algenist products, and this is no exception.  At first I used too much of the product and have since found I need only use a rather small amount to work into my skin. I do not wear a lot of make up but am guessing this melting cleanser is very good at dissolving make up and impurities of the day. I gave it 4 stars because the texture is a little too heavy for my personal opinion. It is very rich, a little thick, but does dissolve with application and glides over the skin smoothly. I rinse it off using water and a washcloth to remove the last traces of cleanser. The post-cleansing results are the reward: skin looks and feels clean and nourished, which I believe would describe the “anti-aging“ aspect of the product. It is gentle, but thorough. A very nice way to cleanse and achieve smooth skin. Use only a small amount for really nice results!
