This product was sent to me complimentary from Algenist. This eye cream has been pleasant to use - a thick creamy texture with a very mild scent if any. While I havenâ€™t noticed a major difference in my undereye circles after ten days (mine are a little milder though) it does feel moisturizing and does not clog my pores or give me irritation/milia. Will keep using as a daytime eye cream! Solid everyday cream
