i really enjoy the texture if the product and if warmed between your fingers it settles well into your under eye which gives a nuce and hydrated look. The only reason i knocked a star of was fir the packaging being dipped into by a cover and also because u didn’t help with my puffiness that i experience almost every morning. I myself need something that’s de-puffing but if all you need is hydration then this product is amazing and great for your skin. Good but Not Great!
