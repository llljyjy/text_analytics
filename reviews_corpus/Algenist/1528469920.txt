Most of the eye creams I use are hydrating and moisturizing and this is no different. Makes the under eye area soft and “appear” smooth. I don’t have very deep lines but my under eye area is dry and I am Impressed with the way it has handled that dryness. The consistency is dense but not heavy. Little goes a long way! Avoid using extra or it feels heavy. I use this at night but it works perfectly fine under concealer. Over all a good eye care product. I didn’t notice much difference in dark circles but it has been few days only. Also, I wish it came with an applicator. At this steep price, we can expect one of those nice steel ball thingy!
