Algenist’s Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm is really an amazing eye cream/balm! It really does help with lightening undereye dark circles, which I really found to be amazing since my dark circles are very prominent. Even after waking up from only a few hours of sleep, the lines under my eyes were not that deep and my eye bags were not very puffy. The consistency is really nice since it’s a balm and it actually feels a little cool against my skin. It is not too thick once applied. I did find the smell a little off-putting, but was able to put up with it due to pros of this eye cream/balm. Amazing Eye Cream/Balm!
