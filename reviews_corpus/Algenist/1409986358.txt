I find this serum helps my skin absorbs other products better, and makes my skin feel supple and well hydrated.  I read some reviews that complain about the smell, it doesn’t bother me at all, it’s a natural “veggie/healthy food” smell for lack of better words, but definitely not off putting or overpowering at all, abs It fades pretty quickly barely notice it.  However, if you are sensitive to smells, it might not be for you. nan
