I have used the original bottle with the dropper applicator and I LOVE this pump packaging more. I never liked droppers as they expose the rest of the product in the bottle to air/oxidation, dirt and other things from getting into the bottle. The formula is the same amazing micro beaded began collagen that I loved when it first came out. It applies so smoothly and others may think it’s “oily“ but this is good oil that nourishes my skin. I have normal skin so this feels great. I wake up with such SUPPLE skin and after 10 days I feel like it’s transformed my skin from the inside-out. This product was provided complimentary from Algenist for an honest review. Really works! New pump design is amazing!
