I was gifted by algenist this serum for review - I have used this serum in the past and absolutely loved it! It makes my skin smoother and hydrates my super dry skin without having to use other products. I especially love the new packaging with the pump instead of a dropper, this allows you to get all of the product out when it almost empty. Love the serum and Love the new packaging!
