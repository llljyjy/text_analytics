Vegan Alert!!! The Genius Liquid Skin Resurfacing Toner with 2% BHA is a VEGAN must have!! Any time I can get my hands on a vegan product I am over the moon! This Algenist toner contains Alguronic Acid & Vegan Collagen. What is VEGAN COLLAGEN you ask? Itâ€™s a brand new blessing created by combining soy, corn, and wheat protein fibers! Those create vegan amino acids which mimic collagen without the nasty animal derived products. This toner is smooth, pore reducing and unclogs pores. I use it after washing my face at night time.
