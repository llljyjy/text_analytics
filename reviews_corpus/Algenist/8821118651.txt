I’ve really enjoyed using this eye cream so far. It’s hard for me to find an eye cream I like but this one feels lightweight while also hydrating the area. I haven’t noticed much of a difference with dark spots but I love the way it makes my skin feel. I like putting this on morning and night after applying my serums. This was also gifted by Algenist. nan
