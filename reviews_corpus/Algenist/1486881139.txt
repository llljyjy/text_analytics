I was gifted by Algenist the liquid skin resurfacing toner and was excited to try. This has 2% BHA, vegan collagen, and their patented alguronic acid formulation. I continually have excess sebum on my nose that looks like blackheads. After using this for a few days there was a noticeable reduction and my nose looked smoother and clearer. I was worried it might be drying but so far my skin had tolerated it well and Iâ€™m looking forward to the results I get with continued use. Effective without irritation
