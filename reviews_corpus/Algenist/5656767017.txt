This product was gifted by Algenist for my honest review. I’ve always been curious about Algenist so I was super excited to try this. This is a vegan collagen serum that adds a huge dose of hydration and helps firm the skin. The texture is a lightweight gel that absorbs effortlessly leaving my skin looking and feeling refreshed. I’ve been using this on recovery nights and my skin is absolutely loving it! Definitely a luxury item, but one that truly delivers! Leaves Skin Hydrated & Plump!
