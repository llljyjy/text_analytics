I was really surprised by the ALGENIST TRIPLE ALGAE EYE RENEWAL BALM. It was definitely not like other eye creams in the fact that it wasn’t greasy and sank right into my eyes. I guess that’s why it’s called an eye balm instead of an eye serum. It was very moisturizing and I could tell a difference in the dark circles underneath my eyes. I would definitely recommend this product. I got this product free as part of a promotion. Great eye balm
