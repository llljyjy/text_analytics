This was gifted by algenist for my honest review. I haven’t been using toner for a while now because I couldn’t find one that I liked. Once I started using this my face felt very soft! After using this for a week or so I’ve noticed it’s helping get rid of my hormonal breakout I always get on my chin. This will definitely be staying in my skincare routine! Love this product!
