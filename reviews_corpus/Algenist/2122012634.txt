The Algenist Tripple Algae Renewal Balm gifted by Algenist, has been an amazing eye cream. I have been using this eye cream mainly at night, but it works well during the day (as it can be used AM), and plays well under makeup. Itâ€™s hydrating without feeling heavy and blends easily onto the skin. I have noticed an improvement with my dark circles and how plumped my under eyes look and feel. It does not pill under other products and leaves my skin area hydrated and nourished. I will definitely recommend trying out this eye cream! It has a vegan formula and the packaging is really nice with decent amount or product and travel friendly! Great eye cream!
