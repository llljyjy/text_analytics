I have enjoyed using this product for the past month or so. I am not sure if I can tell an immediate difference in my fine lines around my eyes but it does feel luxurious and substantial while I am applying -- like it is locking in moisture and protecting my delicate eye skin. I have used morning and night, and I donâ€™t find it to pill under makeup like some creams can. The smell is a bit odd but it kind of smells like it must work -- it is not perfumed and smells like useful ingredients. I do not have heavy bags or dark circles so I cannot speak to how this works for those concerns but if you are looking for something hydrating and balanced for delicate skin, this fits the bill. It was my first product from Algenist and I now trust the brand to provide what it claims to provide. Solid
