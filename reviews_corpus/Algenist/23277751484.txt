The product is good, I notice a decrease in the fine lines on my face and neck after a few days of use.  I used the product for about two weeks and discontinued use because I am currently breastfeeding and trying to conceive again and this product contains some controversial substances.  But I recommend this serum to anyone who is not trying to get pregnant and doesnâ€™t care about its composition, as it really delivers what it promises. nan
