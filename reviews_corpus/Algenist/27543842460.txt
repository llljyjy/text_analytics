It’s nearly impossible (or at least it was for me) to find an undereye product that actually delivers the results that is promised. That is until I tried this, Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm with Multi-Peptide Complex by Algenist. I’ve been using this exactly as directed and I can definitely see my dark circles blending away as well as the dryness that would come through my concealer. I can’t wait to see how big the difference is going to be compared to now in just a few more weeks!! I can also say that this product will definitely last me a good while too so I don’t mind spending a little more to receive great, lasting results with something that finally does as promised! You MUST try this for dark circles!
