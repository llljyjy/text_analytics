Almost all of the products that I have tried from this line I have enjoyed.  This eye balm is no exception.  It is like a rich creamy like gel that applies and absorbs easily.  A little also goes a long way.  My under eyes felt and looked hydrated while using this product.  If you are on the fence about trying it, you should it is really nice. Good stuff
