I had been using and the original Algenist eye balm until I started trying the Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm. Within a few days my fine under eye lines were greatly improved and my eye area was brighter! The balm absorbs nicely and is not greasy. I Highly recommend this product! Great Eye Balm, Highly Recommend
