I love this eye renewal balm. I suffer from circles under my eyes but after one week of use I noticed a difference. The skin under my eyes was brighter and more evenly colored. The balm does not give off a strong scent and did not cause any irritation or break outs. Iâ€™m very happy with it and plan to incorporate into my daily routine! Awesome Renewal
