I am writing this after having used it daily for a month. I really like the way it makes my . It absorbs quickly and has no weird smell. Some skincare products Iâ€™ve used before although may be great, can sometimes have an off putting odor to them. The pump on the bottle is good - allowing one to control how much product is dispensed fairly easily, which is important because a little tends to go a long way.  I find that it does a wonderful job making my skin appear radiant, plumped up or hydrated and a subtle diminishing of deep lines in my neck from years of sun damage and aging.  As we get older we realize we can use all the help we can get both by diet and quality skincare. i plan on incorporating this into my daily regimine going forward. love how it makes my skin feel
