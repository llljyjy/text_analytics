This product made me think that it was somehow going to make my lips fuller (and my presumption was more moisturized?).  Unfortunately for me, this didn’t really do anything.  I didn’t see any fullness and it was not moisturizing, which at least I was hoping that it would at least do that.  Also, while I didn’t see mint or any mint products in the ingredient list, there is a cooling feeling when you first apply it.  I’m probably the only one here that doesn’t like that feeling, I think for most people this is fine, but if you also don’t like that cool minty type feeling when you apply something, well now you know that this has it. Wish this worked for me, this was not moisturizing
