I really enjoyed using this eye cream. It melts into the skin easily. There was no burning or eye watering. I didn’t get those little white bumps around my eyes like some other eye creams can cause. A small amount goes a long way. The texture was thick but not heavy and very silky so it goes on easily without making my eyelids greasy. Although I don’t  have any wrinkles, the skin around my eyes feel softer and looks healthier. If you want something luxurious to put on your eyes then you should try this. Luxury eye cream
