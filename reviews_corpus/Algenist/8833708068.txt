I absolutely love this serum that was gifted to me by Algenist. I have deep wrinkles in my forehead and they’re looking noticeably less deep. My skin feels and looks softer, smoother and brighter. The pump is convenient and keeps the serum sanitary since I don’t have to open and dip into the bottle. Very pleased that there is no scent and I love how lightweight it is. No sticky or oily residue. Definitely a staple product!!! A staple product for smooth skin
