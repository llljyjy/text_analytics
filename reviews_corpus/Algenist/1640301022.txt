I’m disappointed with the whole prebiotic line from algenist. This mask doesn’t necessarily do anything bad, but I don’t see a noticeable difference after using it either. It is easy to apply and rinse off, no stinging or irritation however I don’t notice any improvements in my skin after using. Safe to say I will stick to my glam glow masks. nan
