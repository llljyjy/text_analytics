So I have deep under eyes as well as extremely dark circles with deep lines. I noticed after using this for a length of time that my under eye lines were not as deep.  I also noticed that my undereye dark spots were not as dark as usual.  I found this product overall to be beneficial.  If your dark eyes are more on the mild side this will probably help you much more significantly.  Since I have deeper lines and darker circles I saw a slight decrease which I am still happy with though.  I highly recommend this if you can afford it I found this product very helpful.
