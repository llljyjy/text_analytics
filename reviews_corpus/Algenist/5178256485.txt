If you have someone on your Christmas list who loves skincare, then this set is perfect for them! It has such a great value and you save nearly $60. I love the minis in this set because they are perfect to take when I am traveling. I donâ€™t want to sacrifice not having my skincare just because of travel restrictions, so this is great! Overall, I truly love Algenist products. I have been using the serum, moisturizer, and eye cream throughout the past couple of months and it is insane the results that I see. My skin is always so hydrated, plump, and reduced my dark circles. gifted by algenist. Love it!
