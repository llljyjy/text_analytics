First I love the consistency of this eye cream itâ€™s like a thick creamy mousse, but then you apply it to your under eyes it turns it to a watery consistency. It absorbs into the skin quickly a small amount goes a long way. I have definitely seen smother under eyes. I only use it at night time. I wake up and my under eye area is nice and hydrated. I have dry under eyes so this helps a lot to bring hydration over night. Helps my make up look so much better than what it use to look like. Definitely going to keep using.
