I previously used the older version of this eye balm when it came in a subscription box. Then, I was offered a free sample of this version and can see how it’s related but better. This is a very thick balm (even thicker than a cream) that instantly moisturizes the skin under my eyes. The color of it helps to conceal dark circles a little bit too. I’ve noticed that it does a better job of not pilling like the older version did. However, I’m not sure if it does much for anti-aging. Also, it smells a lot like coffee when applying it. Overall, it’s a good under eye moisturizer, depending on your needs. nan
