I bought this product back in April and used it regularly. I didn’t see any brightening like most vitamin c serums however, I did enjoy the blue algae aspect of this serum. In my opinion this serum created a nice protective barrier (blue algae) but other than that there’s nothing special about this product...just an over priced antioxidant. Just an Expensive Antioxidant
