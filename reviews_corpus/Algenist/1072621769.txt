A few weeks ago, I was in a bad place with the eye cream I was using (OleHenriksen-Banana Bright). For some reason it started causing my eye area (both upper and lower) to become very noticeably red, chapped and wrinkled. Not only was it was it unsightly, but I was also worried there might be some kind of irreparable damage. I started using this Algenist Eye Renewal Balm with little hope that it would actually turn things around. But after a few days, using it once in the morning and once at night, it did! The redness is completely gone, and the wrinkles caused by chapping and dryness are gone. Both under-eye and eye lid area look smooth and refreshed. I am very pleased, and plan to keep this in stock. (Note: I am 51 years old, with very fair skin) Renewed my faith in eye creams.
