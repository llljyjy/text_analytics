I have very hormonal skin with regular breakouts that really compromise my skins look/feel and knocks it off balance making it very oily and unmanageable at times. With this product I have noticed a huge difference in my skin. This is a leave on product I use once daily with a cotton ball. Making sure to saturate my cotton well, I first dab then lightly make an upwards motion following my facial structure. With 2% Salicylic Acid, Alguronic Acid, Vegan Collagen and Azelaic Acid I promise that your 1-10 day results will show skin benefits worth the extra step in your skincare. I also use directly after washing, allowing it to soak in, followed by my other products and finishing with spf which I highly recommend to protect your skin! Overall I enjoy recommend!
