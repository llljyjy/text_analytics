I had the pleasure of testing out Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm with Multi-Peptide Complex as I don’t normally use an eye cream. While the product itself had a nice scent and feel it didn’t really work for me. I saw no difference in my undereyes or fine lines. I have oily skin for background reference. While this did not work for me perhaps it will for someone else. Tried but it didn't work out for me
