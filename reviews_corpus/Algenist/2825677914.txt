Lovely, lovely, I love it! This has such beautiful texture I am in love with the formula. I received this as a 10 day sample from PinchMe in exchange for my honest opinion. The AlgenistTriple Algae Eye Renewal Balm with Multi-Peptide Complex was a treat to use, it applied smoothly without that greesy-oily texture you can sometimes get from a BALM. I notice very smooth, moisturized looking eyes at the conclusion of my 10-day-trial. $69 price is a little steep but might be worth it with a 20% off coupon etc! Lovely, lovely, I love it!
