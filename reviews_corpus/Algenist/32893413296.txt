I’m very happy with it and here’s my honest review. My dark circles are a little noticeable. After trying Algenist Triple Algae eye cream, I saw results in a few days. My under eye skin looked brighter. Also, the lines on my eyes due to aging improved. I liked how smooth the texture of the cream is. It does not feel sticky or greasy.I just wish the price was not out there. It’d be too expensive for many people to afford! nan
