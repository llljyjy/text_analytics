I can honestly say out of all the products I’ve used for wrinkles or firming this has given best results. I’ve tried everything from top med skincare lines, Augustine’s Bader (which I do love and also proven results and continue to buy alongside this) to The Ordinary and this really works. I’m not sure why so many negative reviews, maybe those people really didn’t need what this has to offer.. and remember everyone’s skin is different! I am pregnant so my sense of smell is that of a hound dog and the smell did not bother me, and honestly I didn’t notice it. I steer clear of anything with perfume because I’m super sensitive with scents on my skin as I can breakout. A lot of firming creams are too thick and really cause negative effects to my texture but this did not which is another reason I really like it. I first received a tiny sample from Sephora upon purchase of another product then purchased the small bottle to confirm I really did like it and now I’m buying the 2oz bottle because you get twice as much for $20 more which is a no brainer for me. If you truly have fine lines (forehead) or around orbital bone of eyes or starting to get minor marionette lines then I suggest trying this, even if you have sensitive skin like me! Employee at Sephora told me this product has the highest collagen content of any product at Sephora, and I was comparing to a Dior product at the time trying to confirm I was making the right purchase(not to knock Dior bc they are great too just really depends on if acne or texture/pores is a concern for you). Try it as you can always return it if you don’t like it! :) I’ve tried it all and I truly believe when it comes to skincare, especially firmness and wrinkles as your concern, you get what you pay for. Also, a glass bottle is a must have for me, which this has, as who wants their expensive skincare products in plastic.. not I :) if I buy a product twice that says a lotttt.. Truly works, sensitive skin approved..
