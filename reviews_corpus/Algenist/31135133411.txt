I have been using the Algenist GENIUS Skin Resurfacing 2% BHA Toner for a couple of weeks for my acne prone areas. I love the glass bottle and green shades. It doesn’t sting or dry out my skin, which of course is ideal, but can happen with acids. It has a pleasant light scent and quickly absorbs into my skin. Obviously, I use spf when using this product in the AM. I haven’t really noticed a difference in breakouts on my chin which i think I’m getting from mask wearing. I continue to get little breakouts here and there, but I’m hoping this toner makes a difference because I typically like Algenist products and appreciate the clean formulas. The salicylic acid i use right now doesn’t have the cleanest formula, so I’m looking for a replacement. nan
