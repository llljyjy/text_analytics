I was kindly gifted by Algenist, their Genius Liquid Skin Resurfacing 2% BHA Toner.  It is an exfoliating toner used to smooth post breakout marks while unclogging congested skin and removing oily buildup to result in supple healthy looking skin.  It also promises to reduce the appearance of pores, to refine texture, even tone and leave skin purified.  It is especially for people experiencing hormonal skin concerns.  It is easy to use by just applying it with fingers or a cotton ball. No need to rinse. I like that the cap has a small hole to prevent over usage.  The hole has a little plug to prevent leaks if the bottle is traveling with you and turned sideways or upside down.  The packaging overall is very nice and I love the colors.  It is recommended to follow with moisturizer and sunscreen, if using during the daytime. After my first time using the product I felt that I could feel it working.  My skin seemed to tingle slightly and pleasantly.  After just one use my skin felt better and I looked forward to seeing what the results may be after using it for a longer amount of time.  After 10 days of usage I noticed it helped breakouts clear faster, my skin feels supple and soft. After each use my skin feels cleansed and hydrated. I really like how my skin looks and feels. I would definitely purchase again and recommend to others.
