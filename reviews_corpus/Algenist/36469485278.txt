My skincare ritual is typically very minimalistic and doesn’t include an eye cream but since I have 2yo twins and have had a new baby that is a few months old I don’t get much sleep. I have been having under eye bags and barely noticeable dark circles so I decided to give this a try. I used for 10 days and noticed after the third day my under eye bags were getting smaller and by day 10 they were nearly gone and my eyes looked much brighter and radiant looking. I’m pleased with the results given I only used for 10 days. I’d love to try it for longer. I took 2 stars off. One because it did cause some eye watering when I used it and the second one because it’s just so expensive. It’s a little more than I would pay for an eye cream for every day use but maybe for when I have flare ups of under eye bags and I need to rid myself of them. I’d absolutely recommend to anyone with under eye bags, slight dark circles or just looking to appear rejuvenated but also with a bigger budget for skincare. Good but expensive
