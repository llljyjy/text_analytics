I was gifted by Algenist for my honest review, but all opinions are my own. I’ve tried a good share of different toners, so I wasn’t expecting too much with this toner, but I was actually surprised by how much I loved it! I’ve been using this Algenist GENIUS Liquid Skin Resurfacing 2% BHA Toner for about 2 weeks now and my skin is looking beautiful! Right away, I noticed how wonderfully it helped to remove any left over dirt, oil or left over makeup that my cleanser had missed. The formula is extremely gentle and didn’t burn or tingle like some other toners. My skin was left clean and glowing. Fast forward to now and my face looks and feels amazing! My skintone looks more even, the texture much smoother and even the red patches I get on my cheeks are lighter and much less noticeable (your face will look so good after using this you won’t want to skimp on the SPF!) I also love that this toner has virtually no scent. I’m really happy with this toner and would definitely repurchase! My favorite toner so far!
