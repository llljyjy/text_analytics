Everything I have tried from this brand has been exceptional. This eye cream is thick and creamy. I don’t have dark circles so I can’t speak about those but I do think it diminished my lines and wrinkles. I’m in my 40’s and my skin in my under eye area is loose and I had some firming so I am one happy lady . nan
