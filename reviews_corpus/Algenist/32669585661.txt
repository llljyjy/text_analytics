I really loved this renewal eye balm. It’s lightweight and doesn’t make my skin greasy, it goes on smoothly and leaves my skin soft. I like to use it under my concealer and this keeps my skin from drying out or looking cakey. I love the hydration it gives and that it didn’t irritate my face. Love it!!
