The Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm is an excellent vegan product.  It reduced the appearance of lines under my eyes and and properly hydrated this hard to manage area.  The best part is the ingredients are high quality and formulated to meet the European Union Formulation Standards, which are stricter than the U.S. Standards.  Additionally, my eye area can be very sensitive, and this product is hypoallergenic, and I am able to leave it on without it causing any tearing in my eye. (Other similar products will cause my eyes to tear after hours of wear.) Excellent Anti-aging Eye Balm
