I received this complimentary from Algenist. It is a perfect set starting at a 10-day result. The collagen is so creamy and when it hit’s my skin it feels like velvet. The eye cream texture is like a sponge. It disappears into my skin the minute I apply it to my eye. The cream is also like sponge and it absorbs instantly. The cream is an anti-aging cream. I noticed results right away and didn’t need the full 10 days to see that. My skin was dry but now it is smooth and my under eyes are not puffy anymore. It has a multi peptide to increase bounce in my skin tone. I already have the serum to this brand, and it is incredible too! The eye cream is an actual full size. I love this set. The best I have tried
