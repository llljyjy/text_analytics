I have used Algenist eye gel for a while now but I have had my eye on the balm and really wanted to try it out. I got a bunch of samples from pinchme and I was hyped! I love the formula it has little to no fragrance and is silly smooth. You only need a tiny amount for both eyes too! I’ve been using the balm for about 2 weeks and I have seen an increase in hydration and my dark circles are looking lighter! I plan to purchase the full size but I was disappointed to see it’s only 15ml and not an ounce. It’s not a deal breaker but I wish an ounce was beauty industry eye cream standard. I recommend this product! Great!
