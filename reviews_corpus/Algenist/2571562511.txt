This was gifted to me by the brand but my opinions are my own - I have used Algenist before and really enjoyed the brand. This kit is a really great way to try a variety of products from them. It includes there a liquid collagen, triple algae Eye renewal balm (which is my favorite) And their ultimate anti-aging cream. This is made for all skin types and aims to help combat fine lines, wrinkles and loss of firmness. Like I said the eye balm is my favorite! It’s so hydrating and plumping! When I don’t get a good nights rest it helps make me look so much more awake! A must have kit!
