I can’t even tell you how much I absolutely love thisSerum!! I have been wanting to add in some thing with collagen into my skin as I’m in my late 20s and I can feel that my skin is getting a little bit less plump. I’ve been doing skin cycling and as I’ve added in some harsher products I wanted something that was really good for recovery night and this product is absolutely amazing for that! I’ve been using it for a little while now and I can honestly see a difference in the overall tone and texture of my skin I feel like you definitely do get what you pay for with skin care and although this is pricier, it’s definitely worth it. I actually received this product as a gift and was able to try the product for free as I was gifted by algenist but I definitely am glad that I got to try it because I’ll be repurchasing for sure! So good for skin cycling recovery night
