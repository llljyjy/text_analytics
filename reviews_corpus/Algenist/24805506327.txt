I received this triple algae eye renewal balm as a sample to test out for 10 days. I am a working mom and am very tired most days. It shows. I was more than willing/excited to test out this product. I did actually see a slight difference which leads me to believe that it would only be more effective the longer I use it. It is slightly oily but not too bad and it absorbs nicely in just a matter of a few minutes. It doesn’t slow me down when getting ready for my day, putting on makeup or any of that (I don’t use foundation so I can not attest to that type of makeup application). I feel that my skin is much softer throughout the day and then I reapply at night before going to bed too. The only downfall is that I get a slight redness to my face around my eye/nose area but it’s not too bad. Works
