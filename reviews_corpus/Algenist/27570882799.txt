Great kit if you’re new to the brand! The liquid collagen is fun to use and deeply moisturizing while the genius cream is very occlusive and helped maintain my skin hydrated throughout the whole night. The eye balm is lovely too and didn’t really migrate to my eyes which is great.*Complimentary from Algenist nan
