I got a free sample from my purchase about a month or so ago and I honestly had no intention of using it.. but wow. The first time I used it I though it was too harsh. My face was inflamed and red in some spots, but when I woke up the next morning my skin was stunning! I waited some weeks and tried it again, but that time the  inflammation wasn’t a problem and my skin was equally pretty. I’ve just used it for the third time and I know I have to give in and buy the bottle. 80$ is insane, but I really love the product. I’m sold!
