I got this in hopes that it would lighten up my dark spots that I’ve developed from sun damage over the years. As you can see from my picture, I had some red blotchiness to my skin, mainly on my cheeks, as well. I have used this religiously, morning and night, for 6 months now and finished the whole bottle. Unfortunately, I’m pretty disappointed with the results for my dark spots, as I really don’t see much improvement or lightening in them. However, I do think it helped neutralize my skin a bit and helped in preventing any redness or blotchiness which does, overall, help my face look brighter. I like the way it looks and feels on the skin, but I’m just underwhelmed by the results for the purpose of brightening dark spots which is why I bought it. That being said, I think if you have more clear/ spot-free skin this is a good option, however, if you’re looking to really lighten up the dark sun spots on your face, seek elsewhere because this really didn’t do much for that. For reference, the picture on the top is 6 months ago and the picture on the bottom is from today!! neutralizes redness but not dark spots :/
