I’m picky about my eye cream, as most seem to just be a simple moisturizer. The Algenist triple algae eye renewal balm actually produced results for me. I tried it for 2 weeks morning and night. I noticed that my skin was much more firm and the black discoloration and bags were much improved. I was very impressed with the results and would use this in the future especially now that I’m aging and my skin is much less firm. nan
