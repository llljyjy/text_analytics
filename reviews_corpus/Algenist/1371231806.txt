I am pleasantly surprised about how much I love this mask. I’m always looking for the next best thing, so I tend to try different masks when I am done with a bottle. I’ll try cheap ones, i’ll try expensive ones just looking for the right fit for me. Did the quiz on Sephora for an anti aging mask and this came up. Since it wasn’t too expensive, I figured I’d give it a try. I’m 42 years old with minimal wrinkles starting to get smile lines. My skin is combo I’ve been using products since 16 so it’s in decent shape.   This mask has made my skin look radiant. I’ve been using it 2 to 3 times a week for about a month now and I can tell a difference in my skin. I can’t say I see a huge anti-aging difference but My skin is more even, soft and glowing. I’m definitely confident enough to wear just tinted moisturizer and go with how dewy my skin looks. It’s the mask I didn’t know I needed and now, I am so in love. It is a green color and you have to rub it in and it turns peach. I leave it on for 5 minutes and rinse so easy.. It’s a nice thick consistency. I saw another review indicate it’s a little messy and I have to agree only when it’s being rinsed, the peach definitely can be noticeable. It doesn’t stain or anything Just noticeable. Please give this a try and give it a chance and hopefully you will love it. Love!
