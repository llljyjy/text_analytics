I have been using this eye cream for a couple of days now and I love how good it feels when applying. I love the thick melting texture, the under eye area feels very hydrated. I don’t see much difference with wrinkles, I’ll have to use it for a longer period to notice that.  I’ve used it before makeup and I loved how hydrated my under eyes looked after applying concealer and powder. Complimentary from Algenist nan
