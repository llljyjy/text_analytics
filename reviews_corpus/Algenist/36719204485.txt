This is a lovely eye cream with good ingredients including Vit C E and even caffeine. I love the quality and how thick the balm is so I only need to use a little at a time. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the price is still incredibly high ( as are many eye creams). If this was at around 50$ or less / had a larger value size jar or tube I would be more willing to regularly buy. If I am splurging this is a good buy though. nan
