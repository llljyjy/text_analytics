This is a wonderful product for anyone that has fine lines and crows feet around your eyes. No greasy feeling after putting it on. It soaks in well and doesnâ€™t leave a residue as I have found with other eye creams. I have seen a reduction in the lines at the corner of my eyes and can positively say this product works.  With alot of eye creams out on the market prices are very high for someone on a budget the price can be a bit much for me. nan
