I loved this product at first and thought it was really helping with my fine lines and dark circles. However, after using it for a few weeks, I seem to be having an allergic reaction to it. It has been causing eye irritation, itching, and swelling for me, so I would not recommend it if you have sensitive skin. Not great for my sensitive skin
