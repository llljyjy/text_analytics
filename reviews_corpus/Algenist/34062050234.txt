So I received a 30 day supply from Sephora, PinchMe and Algenist for my honest review.  Honestly, where has this amazing product been all my life?  They came in little packets that are to be used in the morning on clean skin as well as in the evening on clean skin, under your eyes.  They state that the product is clinically shown in 10 days that it reduces under eye circles and just makes your under eye area fresh.  Well, it DOES!.  I found my new eye cream to remove dark circles under my eyes.  I feel that my under eye circles are almost gone and my skin under my eyes looks so firm and it feels moisturized Who knew that tripe algae eye renewal balm with enhanced algae technology could really do it?  I am hear to say it does.  Get to Sephora and get your own.  My under eyes have never looked so fresh and rested before. Puffiness, gone, dark circles, gone
