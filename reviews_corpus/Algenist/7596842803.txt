I received Algenist Liquid Skin Resurfacing 2% BHA Toner as complimentary from Algenist. Recently my skin is sensitive and since the product has BHA, I use it every other day and it goes well on my skin and does not irritate. I also use it as refining toner that tighten my pore after my routine deep clean and exfoliating. It smooths my skin well and I like it. nan
