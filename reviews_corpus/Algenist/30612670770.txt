I completed the 10-day challenge, and while I enjoyed the non-greasy formula and a smoother appearance to the fine lines at the corner of my eyes, I wasn’t wowed by this. I still prefer gel moisturizers and liquid serums over a thicker balm. I also greatly disliked the strong chemical scent. I wish they would neutralize the odor with a light scent. Other than that, I still feel this is a good option for people with normal skin (no oily t-zone) looking for day-long hydration if you don’t mind the price point. nan
