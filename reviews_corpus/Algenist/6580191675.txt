I found this eye renewal balm to be very calming and nourishing. It definitely kept my undereye area hydrated and moisturized. I didn’t think I had dark circles under my eyes before, however, this cream still brightened my undereye area significantly! The area became smoother as well, which made applying makeup a lot easier. 10/10 recommend. As someone who doesn’t use eye creams often, this is one I may invest in. A little goes a long way, so I have no doubt the container would last me a year or more. nan
