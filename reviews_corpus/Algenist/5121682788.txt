Great intro trio to test out algenist. These 3 perform really well together especially for me during this cold month with my skin being super dry. The collagen serum is definitely my fave, it penetrates the skin fast and leaves it super smooth and quenched. The eye cream is thick and super hydrating as well, it works really well under my concealer. Gifted by algenist. nan
