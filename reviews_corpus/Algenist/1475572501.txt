I have honestly never been disappointed with anything I have used from Algenist. Their ingredients and formulas are great, never greasy, but they always have an interesting smell to them. Not bad, but not good. This isn’t a deal breaker for me as I’m not trying to make my face smell good with my skincare routine. I’m not sure if this one is my holy grail and I wasn’t totally blown away after using it, but my under eyes were moisturized and my “starter wrinkles“ (I’m 41) looked slightly less noticeable. So that’s a win in my book. I would buy this one if I was looking for an eye balm in this price range. Great Eye Balm
