I’d wanted to try this serum for ages, but after finally getting the chance (gifted by algenist), I find myself pretty underwhelmed, especially given how much hype it’s gotten over the years. To be fair, I think a product like this needs to be used for longer than I’ve had it (a couple weeks) to show results, so it’s possible that my opinion could eventually change. That said, I didn’t find it to be particularly hydrating, and thus didn’t see/feel much change in the texture of my skin. nan
