This was gifted to me by my mother in law for Christmas and I am in love!! I have used very expensive eye creams always searching for the best one. I am 32 and people usually guess I am 10 years younger, sometimes even more. It is very important to me to have vegan ingredients which this has, so I am so happy something like this works well and then I can have a clean conscience also. The texture feels like a whipped souffle and I do not have to rub or work it in, I can feel it sinking in instantly. My eyes always feel soothed right away. I also have had terrible hereditary dark circles since I was 10 and this eye cream literally lightens them! I hope they never discontinue it because I have found the perfect eye cream for me and the search is over!! Best Eye Cream I have Ever Used
