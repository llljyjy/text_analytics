This was gifted by Algenist for review. On that note, I want to say that I really love the GENIUS Liquid Collagen in combination with the GENIUS Ultimate Anti-Aging Cream. I especially notice a huge difference on my forehead. The skin there looks hydrated, plump, and the fine lines + wrinkles reduced. The only product in this set that I’m not overly fond of is the Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm. It brightens my eye area, but it feels dry for hours on end.. unless that is the firming effect, so I’m not in love with the eye balm. For that, this package only receives 4/5 stars. The other two products are excellent! Loving the liquid collagen!
