As I continue down the road of age and deeper into my 30’s, I’ve begun trying different products and methods as a preemptive strike to keep my face and skin looking as young as possible. ALGENIST TRIPLE ALGAE EYE RENEWAL BALM was the first product that I took for a test drive in this department. Overall, the application was easy and smooth, non-greasy, absorbed quickly and had about moderate results. Nothing out of the ordinary though. But was a great first try for me to get a grasp on where I’m at and gauging what type and which one of these products I would benefit from the most. nan
