After using Algenist Triple Eye Renewal Balm I have found that it exceeded my expectations. I applies soft and creamy and after 2 weeks of using it twice daily I actually think my fines lines have softened. The areas around my eyes are definitely brighter and less puffy. I hope that it makes me look a little younger. I would highly recommend this eye cream and intend to continue using it. Exceeds Expectations
