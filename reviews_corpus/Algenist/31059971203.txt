I’ve loved almost every Algenist product that I’ve tried in the past and it has been one of my favorite brands for a while. This eye cream definitely lived up to the claims. It’s extremely hydrating but I found it to be too heavy of a cream to use daily or in the mornings. I found it to work best for me if I use it at night every other day. nan
