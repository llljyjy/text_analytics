I recently aggravated my skins barrier and needed something that would nourish and help repair my sensitive skin. I have used this product in the dropper form and I was so pleasantly surprised to see that it’s now a pump! The pump makes it SO much easier to dispense this wonderful product. I did a 10 day challenge to see what changes would happen and not only was my skin barrier healed, but my skin was hydrated, plump and glowing! I absolutely adore this product, it’s truly a one stop ‘all you need’ type of product that now has its permanent place in my skincare routine. I will be transparent, this product was gifted by Algenist but I’ve used it many times before it was gifted! Best serum ever!
