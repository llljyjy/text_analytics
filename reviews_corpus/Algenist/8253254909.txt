I was really impressed at how good this Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm is. It worked really well with my usually dry skin, without making it shiny (some eye creams will make the area shiny while moisturizing it), which is very important for me since I also have huge dark circles. I’ve been using it for one week and can notice that the area looks and feels better. The dark circles are still there, but that’s why we have other tools like concealer and such. nan
