I received this kit complimentary from Algenist This is the first time I tried Algenist. This 10-day kit is a great way to test out Algenistâ€™s products. This kit includes Genius liquid collagen, Triple Algae eye renewal balm, and Genius ultimate anti-aging cream. I really like the collagen one because it makes my skin feel so soft. It is lightweight which is perfect for my oily skin. I have some fine lines near my eyes and the eye balm makes my eye area very smooth. The cream is fairly rich, so I use it at night. My skin looks plump in the morning. This kit is very convenient for travel and daily use; and it will make a lovely holiday present as well. Good trial kit
