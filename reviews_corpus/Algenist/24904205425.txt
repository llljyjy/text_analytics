I’ve tried a lot of undereye creams and I must admit this one had the best results.  It did not instantly change my dark circles, and even after a few weeks of use, I still need an under-eye concealer.  So, this is not a miracle cream, however, what I noticed is that my undereye concealer looks better after using this cream. You really only need a tiny dab for each eye, so this product should last a while.  All that being said, it is a bit pricey for the slight difference that I noticed.  I’ve attached pictures without any makeup and you can see that it really didn’t make a big difference in my dark circles Works good under concealer
