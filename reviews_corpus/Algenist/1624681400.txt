For a variety of reasons (cost and unnecessary duplication of facial moisturizer), I don’t usually use eye creams. But since this was a 10-day free sample, I tried it out, and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. Were my dark circles gone? No, but I also have shallow under eye veins and no amount of cream can fix that. However, there was something about the cream that made me look a bit more rested. Although thick, it applied easily and sunk in, leaving my eye skin feeling moisturized and smooth. I have oily skin and I didn’t feel like this made it any oilier. I will consider purchasing when my budget allows :) nan
