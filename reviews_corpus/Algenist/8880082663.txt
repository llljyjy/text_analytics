I’ve been using this sunscreen for years and I love it so much. I have type two rosacea and I prefer to have a physical sunscreen (this one is a combination) but I also didn’t want to have a white cast all over my face everyday and this does not at all and it also doesn’t irritate my very sensitive skin. nan
