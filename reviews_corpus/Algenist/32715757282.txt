The Algenist Genius Liquid Collagen is literally liquid gold in a bottle! I’ve heard many great things about this skincare product before,  and I’m so glad that I finally gave it a try.Alguronic Acid, one of the main ingredients, has been clinically-tested and proven to significantly reduce wrinkles and fine lines. Additionally, it helps combat environmental aggressors that could cause aging signs. 13000 bubbles of Microalgae Oil smooths out the surface of your skin while hydrating and nurturing it with omegas 3-6-9, Vitamin E, and other nourishing properties.I’m in my early 30s so I definitely want to start using products that will help prevent wrinkles!  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, regardless of their age!gifted by Algenist* nan
