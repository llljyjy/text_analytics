Gifted by Algenist, So many benefits! I was super exited to try this as I was looking for an all in one remedy for fine lines and aging as I approach 30. I unfortunately suffer from very sensitive skin so I was slightly bummed as this product does have fragrance. My skin was ok for the first few days but My skik became slightly irritated as I continued to use so I had to stop using in the morning and now only nightly. I hope I can continue using! Wish they had a fragrance free version! The pump bottle makes a less messy way to put on vs dropper A fragrance free version would be amazing!
