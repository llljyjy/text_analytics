The Genius Liquid collagen, gifted by Algenist is one of my new favorite skincare products. My skin feels smoother and brighter after 10 days of using it. You donâ€™t need a lot of product, just a pea size for the face and I like to use one for my neck. I only use it in the morning before my moisturizer and after my Niacinamide serum.  I love the bottle as well, everything seems to have a dropper these days and I am not a fan of it; so definitely likes that this is a pump bottle and transparent to see how much product is left. nan
