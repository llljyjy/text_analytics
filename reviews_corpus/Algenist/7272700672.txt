I’m giving the product 5 whole stars. Because it’s a beautiful serum. It makes your skin feel so soft, I see the small lines on my forehead saying bye-bye. It literally melts into your skin. It does lay of top of it. My makeup goes on beautifully, no clumping.The sent is light and beautiful,  so light you smell it when you apply it and then that’s it. Now to the bottle, perhaps instead of a dropper, due to it’s more of a jelly texture. A Top that just most all serums seems to use and it works. I don’t mind the look of the bottle and pump action, just can’t work well very well if it’s consistency isn’t right for the adaptor. Otherwise,  I’m already obsessed with this!!! definitely worth getting!!!!!!!!! Love this!!!
