I like that it didn’t irritate my eyes and felt gentle for the skin around the eye. However, I didn’t notice a significant difference after using it for a while. If anything it’s like a light moisturizing effect, which you can get from other products at a lower price point or for similar price points you could get products that do more. I’ve tried other algenist products in the past and I love the way they feel and the brand. However I always end up finding products that are more effective and make a visible difference. It may be my skin type, which is combination but definitely needs moisture around the eye and is also sensitive to fragrance or other ingredients in eye creams. This did not aggravate my eyes at all so that’s a plus! Gentle but didn’t notice a difference
