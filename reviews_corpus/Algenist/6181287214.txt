I’ve been using the Genius Liquid Collagen Serum for almost a week now which was gifted by Algenist. So far I’m loving it. It helps firm my skin and smoothen my fine lines as well. I have sensitive skin and this serum does not break me out. I have tried so many anti aging serums on the market and this product made a visible improvement on my skin. I use it daily after cleansing and toning. You can also put a gentle moisturizer on top of it. Definitely a must try!
