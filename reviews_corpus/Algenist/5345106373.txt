Very hydrating product with absolutely wonderful ingredients. The ingredients are most important to me and the first ingredient in their product is collagen (vegan). I personally don’t have a problem if it is animal-derived and may even prefer that, but regardless, the product leaves my skin ultra hydrated and smooth. I am looking forward to using it until it’s all gone, as I am noticing that my skin is very smooth and I want to see what it does for my skin after I give it even more time.
