very creamy consistency leaves skin silky I have only been using it for 2 weeks and a little goes a long way i use less than a pea size for each eye because I don’t want milia to form I work it in very well. I would definitely no recommend for people who form milia easily because this formula is insanely creamy. My main eye area concerns are under eye darkness and some beginnings of fine wrinkles. In the 2 weeks since I started using this product I have seen a difference in under eye darkness. It’s not completely gone but it has improved enough that I don’t need to color correct. I will continue to use it to see if there is any difference in wrinkle reduction. I will that I wake up looking refreshed and the eye area after use is very well moisturized, loving this so far! Great creamy product not for milia
