I’d give this kit about a 3.5. I really enjoy the eye cream and face cream and I use them daily! They make my skin texture smoother and younger-looking! However, the serum was an issue for me. The serum is impossible to get out of the bottle and would leave my face with both an oily and a grainy texture at the same time. Whenever I would use the collagen serum, my face would look worse, and really bad under makeup. I don’t even have sensitive skin and it made my face too shiny and gave me a few breakouts as well. I had high hopes for this package... but if you are going to get any of these products, I would only get the eye and face cream. Those are great! Face and eye cream awesome; serum wasn't up to par
