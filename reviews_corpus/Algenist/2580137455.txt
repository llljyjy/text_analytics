The eye cream is a bit thick but it did glide easily. A little bit of product goes a long way, which is good imo since the price of this eye cream is a bit too high for me. My under eyes did feel moisturized the next morning. I did not see any noticeable results so far, so I might need to use this product a bit longer. Okay
