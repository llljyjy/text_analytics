I can’t believe that no one has mentioned the smell in any of the reviews that I’ve read for this product. It has the strongest perfume smell of any product I’ve tried, so strong that I can still smell it after washing it off of a small patch of my cheek! Sadly this will not be my holy grail product. nan
