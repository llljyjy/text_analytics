This was my first time trying the Algenist products and I’m obsessed! All of the products worked super well on my combination sensitive skin. I’m in my late 20s and I don’t have a huge wrinkle problem, but there are some visible lines and my skin’s been a lot more dull than it used to be 5years ago. I’ve been using this set for about 2 weeks and I’ve noticed a huge difference in moisture balance (my skin has been dehydrated and had occasional acne from most of moisturizers). Liquid collagen and anti-aging cream “recharged” my skin and it started to look glowing and a lot more bright. Eye cream helps a lot with puffiness and my little wrinkles are less visible than before. This set is definitely a great value for the price + amazing for traveling. I’ll definitely repurchase and most likely will get travel size again, since each product is a decent size and will last me a while and I can take it with me on the plane. This set was gifted to me by Algenist in exchange for my honest review. nan
