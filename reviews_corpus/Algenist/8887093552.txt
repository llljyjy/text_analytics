So excited to receive this toner, it is gifted by Algenist. I love it’s package and the glass bottle which is heavy but feeling good! Also, it’s a gorgeous size, 100ml/3.4 oz, wow! The ingredients for this toner is great, such as 2% BHA, propanediol, salicylic acid, niacinamide, collagen amino acids…..and alcohol-free! I have used this toner for one week, the experience is great! It is absorbed quickly, it makes my skin soft and smooth but not sticky. I noticed it also reduce my redness and post-breakout marks, since this toner has a exfoliating formula. It just makes my skin looks bright and healthy! Highly recommend
