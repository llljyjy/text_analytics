Have been using this for a few days and love it! It doesn’t make my skin feel dry after washing although it has exfoliating properties. It’s not sticky at all which I love, but it’s also not extremely liquidity to where it doesn’t feel like you put anything on your face. I feel like my skin is more smooth after using it every night. Super easy to use with a cotton pad or just my fingers to press into the skin. Received complimentary from Algenist. nan
