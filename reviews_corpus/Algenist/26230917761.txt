This Liquid Skin Resurfacing 2% BHA Toner I’ve been using this daily after cleansing. I like how it’s not drying or irritating as some toners I’ve come across can be it also has a nice light scent.  After a few weeks of use I have definitely noticed my skin is smoother, more refined and healthier. This is a great exfoliating toner that smoothes skin while unclogging pores and controlling excess oil. Highly recommend giving a try definitely worth the price. Gifted by algenist. nan
