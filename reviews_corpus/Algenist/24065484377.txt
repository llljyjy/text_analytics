I bought this as an everyday lip product or overnight lip balm. The texture is very runny and watery, so I wear it under an overnight lip sleeping mask. I was excited to experience the spheres, but they don’t dissolve so you end up with them gathering around the applicator or tasting them - bitter and not a pleasant consumer experience. I did notice my lips haven’t been chapped in a while since I started using this product, but not any more than any other product. It seems to work but the texture and consistency is really awkward. Alright but not great
