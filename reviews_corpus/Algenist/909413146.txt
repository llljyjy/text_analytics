I love this stuff. Iâ€™ve tried various niacinamide products all with varying degrees of success but this product instantly makes my skin feel soothed, especially in colder weather/dryer air conditions. My skin feels soothed and supple and is an ideal primer for any moisturizer on top (I love to use it with Origins Soothing Lotion as this doesnt need anything too heavy on top) great for dry sensitive skin
