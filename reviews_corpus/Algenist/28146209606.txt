When I started using the Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm with Multi-Peptide Complex, I noticed my skin feels brighter. Its overall formula is so gentle and absorbs seamlessly around my eyes and they look and feel more hydrated. The texture of the eye balm is thick, yet luxurious and deeply moisturizes my delicate eye area. I use this twice a day and have had no irritation or sensitivity. I use it in the morning and at night. I pat it onto my skin around the entire eye area, in a gentle circular motion with my ring finger. My fine lines have started to slowly fade. My dark circles have really started to fade making my eyes look brighter. wait one minute so it fully absorbs. My makeup goes on flawlessly without any pilling because my eye is smooth. A little product goes a long way so do not apply too much! Ultimately, this has given me a brighter, smoother, and firmer looking glow under my eyes.
