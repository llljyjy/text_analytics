This serum was gifted by Algenist and I have been consistently using this serum for the past two weeks and I can tell that my complexion is brighter and I also think that this is a big reason I’ve liked more how my makeup wears. It just makes your skin look and feel healthy. It’s pricey, so I’ll try not to use it every night, but oh my, it’s worth it. Bright and healthy skin
