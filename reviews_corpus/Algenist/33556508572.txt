I received this product complimentary from algenist in exchange for my honest review. I love toners as they absorb quickly into the skin and feel like nothing. This bha is no exception and i love it. It has also helped my skin as i have had more breakoutson my jaw due to wearing a mask. My skin looks clearer and in a way softer. Though i dont use it daily due to using retinols i made sure to ease it into my routine and make sure i use sunscreen as its a must!! The one downside i have is the bottle itself. It has a stopper which is impossible to remove with just my fingers. I always have to get something pointy to remove it when i want to use it. I am getting ready to simply cut it off. I however do not know if removing it would make it leak if not standing up. Thats the reason i gave it 4 stars. nan
