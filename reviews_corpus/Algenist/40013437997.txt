I have been using Genius Liquid Collagen for over 4 weeks now. I have seen noticeable improvement in my main problem areas, which are prominent bags under both eyes. I have had the bagginess for as long as I remember and while the bags are still there, they are much less pronounced and have a moderate swollen appearance than before I had begun to use. In addition, the skin on my face feels and appears softer. The day 1 application actually had a bit of a tingly sensation and that affirmed me that it was working. I apply 2-3 pumps of the liquid twice per day, in the morning and before bedtime. I like the way my face/skin feels after the application, and it blends in and spreads well to cover my entire face and parts of my neck. A bottle lasted approximately 3 weeks, and I believe after a few months I would reduce the pumps to 2 per application, so the bottle should last 4 weeks. Great product
