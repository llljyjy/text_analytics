I love this set! I’ve been a long time fan of the liquid collagen. It helps my skin become softer and more plump. However, this is my first time trying out the eye balm, and this is my new favorite. The texture is a bit thicker - not watery or runny, but it’s not oily or greasy at all. The feels super creamy and buttery and is perfect to help my undereye area stay moisturized. I like this set also contains a travel-sized face cream to try. Overall all three products are amazing! (This set is gifted by Alienist for my honest opinions). Amazing set
