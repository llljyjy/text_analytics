I had used this product a while ago and then stopped and my neck area began to get wrinkly so I purchased again. It works very well for my skin and I notice a difference immediately. I use in conjunction with my micro needle roller for even better results.  I am extremely sensitive to scents and this one does not bother me and I don’t find it strong or over powering at all so I’m surprised at similar comments. The pump is a bit annoying as it works best when the bottle is new and full but as you get towards the bottom, it’s a little harder. And since this is so pricey you don’t want to leave any in the bottle! Highly recommend nan
