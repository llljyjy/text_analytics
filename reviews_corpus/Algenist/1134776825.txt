I love this product~great for fighting Hyperpigmentation! You are getting those dark spots triggered by, sun let alone heat~this may be the thing for you to try. I feel like I do, and use all kinds of stuff to fight my darkening spots~Hat and products, but this is one of those things that is great on the Bummer of a Beautiful day, where the heat triggers your freckles to surface even more. This is not tingling to me~it feels cooling. I often forget about it as I keep it stored away. Every time I use it, it calms things down and I am not sure what it is doing but really resets your face to before that big bloom and better! Good combat to a Darkspots Blooming on a warm day!
