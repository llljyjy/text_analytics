This balm is so brightening and plumping around my eye area! The fine lines around my eyes look smoothed and filled in so it makes a perfect primer before makeup. I never have any creasing or visible lines around my eyes when I wear this before my foundation even at the end of the day. I haven’t noticed more firming but it brightens, moisturizes, and fills in lines so I’m sold! It feels really silky and soft on my skin and melts in so beautifully too! Gifted by Algenist. Beautiful Balm!
