I received a free sample of this cream. It has a nice texture and feels very moisturizing. It goes on smoothly and soaks in quickly so you can put on other products if that is part of your routine. I didnâ€™t notice a huge difference in my dark circles, but the cream did make my skin soft and smooth. nan
