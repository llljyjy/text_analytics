I have lots of lip products (an understatement), and this stuff is amazing.  It has a strange but cool gel-like texture with little microbeads of goodness, a subtle but pleasant taste and scent, and it does make my lips moisturized and plump.  Most importantly, in just a few days my tiny little lipline that has been bugging me for months is faded.  Best benefit of all, and something my jade roller work hadn’t been entirely fixing.  I’m sold.  I will enthusiastically repurchase and recommend. Yes it works
