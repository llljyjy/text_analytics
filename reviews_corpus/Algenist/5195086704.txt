This eye balm promises to do a lot. I noticed that it helped lighten the dark areas under my eyes. It also helped with puffiness, especially in the morning. It hasn’t had a dramatic impact on wrinkles and crow’s feet yet, however. My skin is very sensitive and it doesn’t seem to cause irritation. I will continue to use it and hope for continued benefits. Enjoying the benefits so far
