I have been using ALGENIST TRIPLE ALGAE EYE RENEWAL BALM for almost 10 days, both morning and night. I have very dry and crepey like eyelids along with puffiness under my eyes and some darker shading. I love that the cream has no scent and it does not burn my eyes. It is very moisturizing but more like a cream than a balm.. it is fairly hydrating but not any more so than any other cream that I would use. I find a $68 price point pretty high for the lack of results. Not the best
