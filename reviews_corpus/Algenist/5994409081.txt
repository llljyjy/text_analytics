I’ve tried a number of eye creams and this is one I keep coming back to. It’s a full-eye cream that is used both under eye and on the lids and over the ocular bone. I often get very dry and crepey in my eyelids and this really moisturizes and keeps going throughout the day even under makeup. No stinging or irritation that often comes with eye creams as well. All around lovely product. Best all around for the eyes
