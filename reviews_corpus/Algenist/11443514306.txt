Gifted by Algenist but opinions are my own.This is my first time trying products from Algenist and I have to say, I’m impressed. The kit has everything you need for travel, and is a pretty generous size for a sampler kit. The packaging is really pretty, and the lotions/serums feel high quality and luxurious. Like most skincare I’ve tried, it’s hard to notice a difference right away, but it’s a pleasure to continue using this set :) I’m considering it for some holiday gifts this year! nan
