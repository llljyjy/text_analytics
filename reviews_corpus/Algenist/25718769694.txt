I have been using Algenist Genius Liquid Collagen Serum for a few weeks after receiving it complimentary from Algenist and am loving it. It’s a liquid collagen serum and I typically put it on my face and neck. It’s so smooth and hydrating! I can tell it’s helping with my skin elasticity, firmness and am not noticing as many fine lines and wrinkles. I also love that it’s feee or parabens and is vegan and gluten free. So happy to have this product and will continue using it! Best liquid collagen!
