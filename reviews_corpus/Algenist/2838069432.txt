I received 10 days worth of samples. The eye balm is very creamy, lightweight and non-greasy. It’s very moisturizing and doesn’t have a fragrance that can irritate the eyes. It sinks in immediately. It works really well to help smooth wrinkles and lighten under eye circles. My only complaint is that it smells odd but it’s effective so it doesn’t matter much! nan
