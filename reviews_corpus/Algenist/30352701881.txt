I love this toner, this toner was gifted by Algenist to give my honest opinion.  Normally toners do not have a good smell and this one has a very pleasant and mild mint smell, the bottle is cute and has a protector that helps prevent it from bounce, it absorbs quickly, I notice my face is softer and with a more luminous appearance I use it twice a day after washing my face, I always use a toner to help me better absorb the other products I use in my facial routine.  I recommend this product it is wonderful I love it
