I love this product. It was a gift from another skin care enthusiast, after I admired her skin. Within a few weeks, people were saying to me how great my skin looked, glowing and brighter. I could see myself (I look in the mirror a lot) that my skin was firmer and my lines and wrinkles were less visible, especially the “marionette lines” around my mouth and the horizontal ones on my forehead. Plus Genius Serum is light, absorbs quickly, and makes my skin feel refreshed. I used in morning and night as the second step, after cleansing. Everyone commented on my skin!
