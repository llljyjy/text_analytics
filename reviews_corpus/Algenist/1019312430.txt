I loved using this balm! Very gentle, soothing, glides right on to your skin. I started out using this 1x/day as a test for skin tolerance, but I have since been using it in the morning and evening. It’s gentle, no irritation to my skin or eye area. And I’ve found that my skin is softer, smoother, and fine lines are starting to look smaller or fainter. I’m hoping that this trend will keep going as I continue to use this eye serum. nan
