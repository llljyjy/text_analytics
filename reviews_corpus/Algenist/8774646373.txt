I would buy this in an instant if it wasn’t so scented! It smells so strongly like a 90’s mom. Other than the scent it’s a tad greasy after going on but I immediately had less wrinkles the next day after using this only from a little sample pack. It has little beads in it too that are kind of fun! Make this less stinky and I’ll be back! I really wish this wasn’t so scented!
