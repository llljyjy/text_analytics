As a mom of a young toddler, I need all the help I can get with my under eye area. I used Algenistâ€™s triple algae eye renewal balm for 10 days, both morning and night, and did see some improvement. I saw a reduction in fine lines, however I did not see any brightening or de-puffing throughout my use. You may need more time to see those results. As far as the product goes- it is rich without being heavy, absorbs well, and did not pill when used in combination with my other skin care products. nan
