I was gifted by Algenist this set and was incredibly excited about the eye cream and let me tell you it did not disappoint. I have naturally dry skin and even at a young age, it makes my mimic wrinkles look worse than they are.  That is why collagen serum and eye cream turned out to be my favorite, it moisturizes my skin and makes it feel really nice. Good for sensitive skin
