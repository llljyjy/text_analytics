I have used a few eye creams before and never really noticed a big difference but when using this one I started to see a difference  it has great consistency. I did not have any issues with it and no problems with irritation. I used at night after washing my face and about 15 minutes before applying makeup in the morning so it would soak in and it is helping. I definitely recommend trying. I did get to try this for free through PINCHme but my opinions are based on my own experiences. Great consistency and seemed to work well
