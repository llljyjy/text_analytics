I’m a big fan of eye creams and this didn’t disappoint. My under eye area can be quite sensitive and this cream didn’t cause any irritation. I used the 10 day sample both morning and night and though I didn’t see a shocking difference my skin felt very moisturized. It was occlusive enough for me to enjoy it as a night cream and worked well enough with my makeup for it to be part of my morning routine. I used it while traveling and really helped keep my skin healthy and hydrated even after several flights. nan
