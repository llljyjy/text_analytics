I really enjoyed using this renewal eye balm from Algenist. I received a large amount of samples from PinchMe. The eye balm is creamy, but lightweight and non-greasy. It’s very moisturizing and doesn’t have fragrance to irritate the eyes. It’s a little pricey for an eye balm, but it works well to smooth wrinkles and lighten my under eye circles. nan
