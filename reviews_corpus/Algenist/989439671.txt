I received this complimentary from Algenist, I have been using this for the past two weeks and definitely notice a difference in my skin.  My skin doesn’t feel as dry and just feels more hydrated overall.  I also see a difference with my fine lines and wrinkles.  I’m over 40 so I’m always looking for ways to get more collagen so this is an awesome find! Hydrating serum
