This is a great eye cream and primer before makeup. I feel like I would have to use this for quite a while to really determine if itâ€™s minimizing any wrinkles but it definitely highly moisturizing. My skin feels noticeably softer and I look a little bit more awake since I began using it. I especially love it as a makeup eye primer. So far I am happy with the results I see and I will continue to use. This product was given complimentary from Algenist. Great eye cream!
