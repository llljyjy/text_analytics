PackagingI received a sample jar and it’s definitely has the signature Estee Lauder packaging, the gold lip and brown jar.ConsistencyIt’s a thick cream but spreads easily on my face.ScentIt is highly scented as compared to other Estee Lauder cream, which has a slight scent. But the scent dissipates after a few seconds and I don’t smell any scent afterwards.PerformanceI am 45 years old with combination and this moisturizer is just perfect. It has a thickness to it but too thick, a good transition cream from summer to fall. It goes on easy and my skin absorbs the cream so quickly. It kept my skin moisturized throughout the day without looking greasy. Very good cream
