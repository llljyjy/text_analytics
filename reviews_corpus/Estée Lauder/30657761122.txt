I was so excited to get to try this from Influenster! Estée Lauder has always been one of my tried and true go to skin care products, and this moisturizer did not disappoint. While it’s super rich, it absorbs exceptionally well and doesn’t just sit on the skin. I use it as a night cream and it leaves my skin feeling luxuriously smooth and soft without leaving a tacky, sticky feel. (Of course, I purchased a full size even before the sample was used up). I’ve especially noticed a difference on my neck and upper chest. The skin is smoother, well hydrated and fuller. Miracle neck cream
