I vow to keep it honest and i just was not impressed with this moisturizer at all. There is literally nothing about it that I even liked in order to write a review for it. It felt dry to the touch and when rubbing on my skin (Ive never experienced such a strange feeling). It left my face begging for hydration and moisturization. After using this for 4 days I started to get flakey dry skin patches. I love the serum and other products from Estee Lauder and really expected this to be the same lux experience but it just wasnâ€™t like that at all. Because of my experience and how expensive it is I dont feel right recommend this to anyone. Not worth the hype But the serum is a diff story.
