I received the Estēe Lauder NEW Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review! This moisturizer has an  extremely indulgent, thick texture which I found more appropriate for nighttime use. This definitely delivered on hydration and glowing skin! It’s full of hydrating and firming ingredients such as: glycerin, hyaluronic acid, squalane, vitamin E, peptides and caffeine. It also highlights moringa extract, hibiscus morning bloom extract and cactus stem cell extract… okay, those sounds good in theory but I don’t know of much research behind them. I do wish this had retinol in it which is the ultimate ingredient for fighting fine lines and wrinkles and with a name like “youth power creme” I think there should be retinol in there! Glowy and Hydrated!
