To call this a lotion is quite a stretch. It’s very very watery. I received this as a free sample in exchange for my honest review so it may have been diluted because of the sample size? This dries too quickly to provide any long lasting hydration benefits. I have dry skin and this did not improve that. It has a nice floral smell which I enjoyed but other than that I would not recommend this product for a facial moisturizer. Smells Nice, that’s about it
