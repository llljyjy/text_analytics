I can’t tell what’s my favorite part about this product. From the amazing texture that feels like magic on the tip of your fingers, to the unscented gel it contains. I understand why it’s pricey, it works fantastically and rapidly and it’s worth every single penny! The color from the pictures is fully accurate. The good stuff!
