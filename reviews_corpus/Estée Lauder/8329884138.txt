I received a sample of this product complimentary from Influenster and Estēe Lauder in exchange for my honest review. My skin is on the drier side as I advance into my mid 40s, therefore I like my moisturizers to give off extra hydration or at least do a good job of locking in moisture. The Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme is a medium thick cream that just melts into the skin, and a little seems to go a long way so I’d go in with less and add more if you feel you need it. My face had a lovely moisturized sheen to it after application but it didn’t feel greasy/oily at all. Also, it is very light on the scent that it’s barely detectable. The subtle scent smells so elegant and rich, almost like a spa, therefore I used this product every evening before bed (even tough it said it could be used in the AM and PM) because it felt like such a zen routine. I loved the feeling of it, and it didn’t break me out at all which is usually the case when I try new creams on my sensitive skin. This cream would be perfect to get you through the coming winter season. I’d say get it if you feel like pampering yourself, it’s worth it. I’ll be adding this to my wishlist. nan
