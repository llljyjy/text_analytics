I do already use under eye cream, so I always get excited to try new ones. I have pretty significant dark circles and starting to get some fine lines under my eyes. This product has a really nice texture. My skin definitely feels hydrated after using, but other than that, I did not see a significant difference. I think if used consistently for longer, you may get better results. Nice
