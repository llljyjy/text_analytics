I received this as a free sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really wasn’t sure at first because of the texture of this essence. It seems very watery, however a little bit goes a long way to cover my face and neck. I could see smoother, softer skin and the redness that I normally have was gone by day 2. I do with that there was a spout to control how much comes out, but it really wasn’t a problem. I love how calm and luxurious my face felt afterwards. Calm
