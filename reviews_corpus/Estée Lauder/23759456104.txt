I received a free sample of this product for review. I liked the scent of the product. It is a thick moisturizer and it left my skin feeling very hydrated. It is a good moisturizer but didn’t notice much additional change to my skin except the hydration. It is a good moisturizer but not my favorite Estée Lauder product. Good moisturizer
