I received this sample in exchange for an honest review. I must say I probably would not have otherwise purchased. I have sensitive skin and am loyal to another brand. However, I am impressed. It goes on thick which made me nervous. It does absorb though and the scent also disappears. My face was left moisturized and glowing. With it being thick, I would suggest using at night or when you donâ€™t need to wear makeup as it may be difficult to work with under makeup. I am not yet sure how it works with wrinkles etc. Definitely worth a try as a moisturizer.
