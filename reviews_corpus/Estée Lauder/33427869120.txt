Couldn’t wait to rave about this NEW innovative Youth Power Creme by Estee Lauder. I received this creme complimentary to try and I’m glad I did. With the first use of the Youth Power Creme by skin felt supple, hydrated,  soft to the touch and screamed “ GLOWING SKIN“. The texture is creamy and pretty light weight.  A little goes a long way since it is a creme not gel creme. It has a scent which is fresh not overpowering.  I noticed over a few days of use my skin appeared smooth, continued glowing and my fine lines appeared smoother. I will definitely purchase a full size and I would recommend to anyone who is looking for preventive or corrective skincare.  I promise you won’t be disappointed. YOUTH in a jar
