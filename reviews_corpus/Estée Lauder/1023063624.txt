I received a sample size of Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review of the product. Due to its very small size, I decided to use this product around my eyes as it was such a small amount. This product adds a lot of moisture to my undereye area that lasts throughout the day. The balm-like texture feels very nourishing upon application. This moisturizer does an excellent job of helping to diminish the look of fine lines/wrinkles under and around my eyes and it definitely lessens the appearance of crepiness in my undereye area. I really like this product, but cannot access its long-term results as the sample size only lasted approximately 2 weeks with morning and night application. I intend to purchase the full-size product and use it on my entire face so that I can truly assess the effectiveness of this moisturizer; however, I absolutely recommend it as an eye cream. Really Helps with Undereye Crepiness
