Nice, thick gel crème. Really provides moisture. I have only used it at night so I cannot speak to how it wears under makeup. I have found a slight difference in dark under eye circles from using this product. A little definitely goes a long way! I’ve gotten this too close to my eyes when applying to much and it burns and stings! I normally use the Strivectin eye cream and I’ve liked this gel consistency as a change! I would use this again, I would purchase, and I would recommend. Nice thick gel crème
