I received the Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme Moisturizer sample from Influenster. I enjoy this product. It was a nice moisturizer.  It worked really well. I will say that the only reason I am not getting the product again is the price.  It is extremely expensive, even the travel container.  It is not in my price range.  I will say if you have a sensitive nose, this product does have a fragrance to it.  The fragrance didnâ€™t bother me, but I could smell it slightly. Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer
