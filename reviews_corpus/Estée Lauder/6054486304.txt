I received this moisturizer complimentary to sample. I typically use a thick, oil-free moisturizer for my combination skin AM & PM. The Revitalizing Supreme+ would make a perfect fall/winter supplement to my skincare routine. I find it’s moisturizing qualities to be a bit intense for my humid climate and doesn’t absorb quite so quickly for me. It could also be a great addition to my nighttime routine. More than anything, I enjoy the light, neutral scent. Dreamy scent
