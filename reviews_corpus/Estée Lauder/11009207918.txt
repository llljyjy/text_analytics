I was sent this product by Influenster in a VoxBox to review. I was shocked at how small the container was, and how little product you get for the money. After feeling the cream I understood. It is a very thick gel like consistency, but applies on the skin like silk. A tiny bit goes a VERY long way. I am in love with how smoothly it glides on the skin. I have used the product for a little over 2 weeks, and I do notice a slight difference. My dark circles are definitely lighter, and the wrinkles under my eyes are less visible. We will see if the wrinkles and circles continue to minimize the longer I use it. Worth The Money
