Received this product as a complimentary sample from Influenster and was surprised how much I liked it. It’s gives great hydration for these dry winter days and I could see my skin perk up and brighten almost instantly. My only complaint is that it smells like perfume and I’m not a scented products fan. Definitely would recommend for mature skin! nan
