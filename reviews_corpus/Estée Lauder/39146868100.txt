I must say this gel cream is pretty great TEMPORARILY. I have dark circles and puffy eyes which can be a curse. But nothing fixes the issues better than sticking to a clean diet. I do not believe in a quick fix. Iâ€™ve never believed in any brand of eye cream. Eye creams to my understanding have been overpriced night cream in tiny jars. But I do like this eye cream it is lightweight, free from synthetic fragrance, parabens, sulfate, mineral oil, paraffin, and the botanicals infused in this recipe are impressive; Watermelon fruit extract, Algae Extract, Apple extract, and Lentil extract among others have been linked to anti-aging effects. I used the eye cream for 4 weeks and did not see a significant change. But my eye area did seem brighter in the morning after a Pm application. I have sensitive eyes. They seem to water with just simply moisturizers, but the eye cream gave me a lovely cooling sensation with every application. Great Eye Gel Cream
