First, I would like to thank Influenster & Estee Lauder for the complimentary product!!! I am an SPF girl for sure, been using since I was way younger because I live in Florida & it gets SO hot & humid here! I’m ALWAYS on the look out for a new SPF especially with antioxidants & anti-aging benefits! Plus, I need it to last throughout the day! I’m use to the SPF smell but I still don’t like it! This one from Estee Lauder has SPF 15, antioxidants & anti-aging benefits! It does not leave any white cast behind & absorbs fairly quickly into the skin! It’s great for a dry-skin gal like me! The smell WASN’T overbearing with SPF, but there is a definite smell to it, but I didn’t mind it! The moisturizer looks light blue in pictures but mine was more white colored that again, didn’t leave a white cast on my face! It is not greasy or oily & claims to give you 24 hours of moisture with both antioxidants & anti-aging properties! All of the Estee Lauder products I’ve tried before ALWAYS went so well with my skin, NEVER any problems with purging, irritation or breakouts! My skin IS noticeable softer & smoother! I just love Estee Lauder skincare, it’s great! ONLY hiccup for me is that it is such a LOW amount of SPF in it! I’m MORE of a SPF 50-70 GIRL, I DON’T PLAY AROUND WITH THE SUN! It can seriously damage the skin faster than anything else! It all starts with a great SPF PRODUCT! Overall, while I loved it, I probably will not repurchase ONLY because of the low SPF levels but other than that, it was terrific & worked well with all my other products! Definitely recommend if you like a lower SPF with moisturizing & anti-aging benefits!!!! Lovely SPF Moisturizer & Antioxidant
