I received a free sample of this product from influenster for my honest review. I usually don’t use an eye cream in my skin care regimen. This may have to become a staple for me! The texture is a cooling gel that sinks into my skin fairly quickly. A little goes a long way, so you’re definitely getting your money’s worth. After the gel sinks into my skin, my eyes feel refreshed and it doesn’t leave a sticky residue. I have seen improvements in the severity of my dark circles. This really does work. I definitely recommend this if you have darkness under your eyes. Impressed
