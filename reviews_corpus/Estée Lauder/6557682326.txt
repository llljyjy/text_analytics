***RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FROM INFLUENSTER IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST OPINION***I have tested this product out for the last few weeks.  While it is hydrating to the under eye area, i would say that was the most benefit that I noticed from the product.  It did take a few days for my skin to adjust to it, but after that I had no problems with it.  Do i see myself purchasing it at full price, more than likely no.  It was great to sample the product though. nan
