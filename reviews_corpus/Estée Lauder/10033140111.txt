I received this product sample complimentary for my honest review. I liked the consistency of this cream. It was creamy and smooth and felt good applying it on my face. After using it for one week, I noticed my skin texture had improved a bit. The reason why I gave it 4 stars, is because the fragrance is a little too strong for me. If they had a fragrance free option for this, Iâ€™d definitely buy it. Creamy smoothness
