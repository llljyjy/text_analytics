I recieved this Estee Lauder Night Repair Eye Gel complimentary of Influenster for my honest review. Initially, I was so excited to try this eye gel. The circles under my eyes definatly put 10 years on me. The consistancy of the gel feels nice and light. A little does go a long way, so use sparingly. Unfortunately, after using it for 3 weeks, I hardly noticed a difference! I was really hoping for better results. I will continue to use this a bit longer before giving up. Not worth the hype.
