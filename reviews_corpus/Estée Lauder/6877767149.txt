After using this product complimentary of Influenster and Estée Lauder for my honest review I would have to say first time I used it was dreamy. The moisturizer was thick consistency , with nice smell that left my dry skin feeling hydrated and glowing. Definitely replaces the moisture need to have your skin feeling revitalized. I didn’t really experience firmness or lifting but may need to use more over longer time nan
