I received this essence as a complimentary for my honest review. This essence treatment lotion is fantastic! I was very surprised how well it worked with my oily/combination skin. My skin felt more hydrated and very smooth. It also doesn’t leave a tacky feeling afterwards or leave your skin feeling greasy. It’s very moisturizing and leaves your skin with a glow. I would highly recommend this product!! Great hydrating product!!
