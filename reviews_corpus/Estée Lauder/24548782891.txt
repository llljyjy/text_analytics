I really like how this made my eye area feel smooth and hydrated. Helped with my bags under the eye. It has a very subtle tint to it not a hard white color like most. It is thick but socks right into the skin. A little has lasted me a long time because I donâ€™t have to use a lot. I do have super sensitive eyes and this did make them sting a little bit if I got the product too close to the corners of my eyes. If I put it on and went straight to bed and closed my eyes, I was fine. Great hydration
