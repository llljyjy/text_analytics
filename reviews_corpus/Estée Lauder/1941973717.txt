I received a sample of this for free in exchange for my honest review.So first off it’s feels rich and thick like a good hydrating cream and has low odor so that great. I stay away from over-scented products. I didn’t get to experience the full effects for long term use with this but from what I tested it was nice and didn’t cause any irritation. Another plus is that a little goes a long way. Surprisingly good
