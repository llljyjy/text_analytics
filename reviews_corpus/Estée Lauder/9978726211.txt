I really like this moisturizer. It has a light, clean scent that isn’t too overpowering and it feels rich and thick on your skin. You don’t need a lot so don’t let the price dissuade you. It helped to moisturize my dry skin and I didn’t notice any side effects to sensitive areas like my under eyes. I will say that I didn’t notice any improvement in firmness or anti aging benefits but it works well to hydrate the skin. A decadent, effective moisturizer
