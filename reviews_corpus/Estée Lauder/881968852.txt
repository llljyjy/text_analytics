I received this item free from Influencer to review. I love the fragrance of this moisturizer, and I like that it’s not overwhelming. The moisturizer soaks in quickly and provides a smooth finish without being greasy. I do feel like my skin looks a bit more radiant, but I can’t speak to long term affects since I only received a small five day sample, I would love to try this moisturizer for longer to see what the long-term effects would be. I am always impressed with the quality of Estee Lauder. nan
