I received this product for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest opinion. At 37, my skin tends to be on the combination side, but leans towards dry. I use moisturizer daily and nightly in my facial routine.  I used this Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme for 4 weeks. It has a thicker consistency and that is something that I really enjoy. It absorbs nicely and left my skin feeling very hydrated and soothed. I did notice around week 3 there were a couple blemishes starting on my forehead so I switched to a oil fighting facial cleanser and it was no longer an issue. Overall, this is pretty fantastic, and while my fine lines are still visible, my skin looks and feels great. Just happy, healthy, glowing skin. I recommend this to anyone. Happy Healthy Skin
