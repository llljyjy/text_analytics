I received a small sample from Influenster and unfortunately was not impressed by this lotion. I have combination oily, dry and acne-prone skin with hyperpigmentation so I usually look for exfoliating toners with AHA/BHA and this would not the lotion of choice for me. With the small sample size and inconsistent use, I did not see any difference when using the product. The lotion would be more suitable for someone with dry skin who also does not mind scented products. I felt that it was fairly heavily scented. nan
