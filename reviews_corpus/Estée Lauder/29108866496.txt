I’m studying for a ridiculously hard test and this eye cream has been a saving grace! I cannot put into words how dark my dark circles are and how puffy my eyes look but this cream has made them noticeably better. I have a few different eye creams: this, Kiehls, and SKII, and I reach for this one. It has a really nice consistency, doesn’t make my eyes burn, and is very moisturizing. Saving grace!
