I received this as a sample and at first wasn’t Ute if it was a toner or cleanser. However, after applying it after cleansing it leaves my skin feeling really soft and it has a lovely scent. It wasn’t enough hydration for my dry skin on its own, so I follow up with my normal moisturizer in the AM, but like how soft and smooth this product made my face feel. Soft skin & lovely scent
