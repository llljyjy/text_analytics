This was a free product in exchange for an honest review! I’m a tough one to please and this cream moisturizer was an instant like for me. The way a product spreads and feels on my skin is just as important as the results to me! This one glides on effortlessly and almost had a silky texture to it. It absorbs really nicely in my skin and feels really moisturizing which is great for the winter! I apply this generously and I couldn’t be more pleased. I do love the fragrance it has as well but I understand this could be bothersome to some! This is a 5 out of 5 for me! 5 out of 5 for me!
