I received this complimentary as a sample size from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This cream is so rich and luxurious. The scent is light but really pleasant. My skin is dry and sensitive and this made it so soft and supple. I used this at night only since it was so rich. In the morning my skin was left hydrated and glowy. I would definitely recommend this for dry and/or mature skin. nan
