I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. This is a pretty good product, it does make my skin feel soft after use, but I haven’t seen much long-term benefit or even a difference in my skin the next day before I do my skincare again. That may change over more use, but I don’t know that I’d purchase the full sized product as it is on the pricier side and I can’t tell for certain any additional benefits. nan
