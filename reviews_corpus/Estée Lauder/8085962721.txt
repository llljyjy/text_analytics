i have been searching for an eye cream to moisturize & lighten up my dark circles, this has definitely done the job & made a difference in the month that i’ve used it. i apply a small amount around my eyes every night. the texture initially feels thick but it applies on very light & airy. the price point is the worst part of the product unfortunately, but when it works it’s worth it! so thankful i was given the opportunity to test this product out! WOW
