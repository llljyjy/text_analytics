I received this product for free from Influenster and ESTĒE LAUDER free for my honest review.  I received a small sample sized jar, which is really cute. The smell of the product is amazing! I only used a pea sized amount which on my finger felt really light, this amount covered my whole face, which I thought was a great thing. After applying to my whole face I noticed a grease feel that the cream left behind. I did not think anything of it and figured it  would just soak into my skin like some lotions do, wrong. My face felt greasy the rest of the day which was a shock to me because I have dry skin. But I continued on and left it on overnight too, thinking when I washed my face the next day it would be soft and feel great. Wrong again I woke up the next morning to my whole face being broken out with pimples. I washed the cream off and did not reapply. My face was broke out for 3 days. I am not happy with these results and will not be buying this cream.#Free @Influenster @ESTĒE LAUDER Would not recommend
