I was gifted this from Estee Lauder and Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I have enjoyed sampling this. I have normal skin but I have a dry patch on my forehead. I have tried so many creams on that dry spot to no avail.. until I tried this. It did a fantastic job moisturizing that area as well as my whole face. I do think the product feels a little thick. For me personally, this would be a perfect moisturizer for the winter months. The Ohio Valley’s high humidity caused this to melt right off my face. I love that a little goes a long way. I didn’t notice a glow on my face, but my face was smooth and well moisturized. It’s said this product take 4 weeks to notice any changes in fine lines and wrinkles, with a sample I was not able to establish an opinion on that. The only downside for me was the fragrance. I wear fragrance every day,this interfered with my personal fragrance. Would I purchase this? If the fragrance wasn’t so loud,100% yes! Thank you for allowing me to review this product. Great Moisturizer for Normal/Dry skin / Winter
