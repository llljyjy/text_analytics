I got a sample size of this product from Influenster. It’s a nice cream. I would recommend wearing it at night because it’s too greasy to wear under makeup. It has a strong scent but it disappeared pretty quickly. I didn’t notice any major improvements in my skin after using it and it wasn’t quite moisturizing enough for my dry skin, but I think it would be nice for someone looking for help with fine lines and wrinkles. Nice overall cream
