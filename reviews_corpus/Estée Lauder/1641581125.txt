I received a trial version of this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review.I am someone that is very sensitive to many ingredients around my eye area, but the silky gel-cream formula had me very pleasantly surprised. I don’t have super dark circles or very visible signs of aging in that area, but I did see noticeable results pretty quickly still after using this product in the AM/PM for a few weeks. What I loved most about the Advanced Night Repair Eye Gel-Cream was how transformative the results are when applying this product in the AM after a sleepless night — my very obviously tired-looking eyes look more rested/less fatigued & my whole eye region immediately becomes brighter, more wide-awake looking. Great new find!
