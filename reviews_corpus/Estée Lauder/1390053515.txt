I have extremely dry skin and have a multi-step skin care routine. I was hesitant to try something new, since I have found products that work for me. I found the Estée Lauder revitalizing supreme + moisturizing youth power creme equally as moisturizing as the current moisturizer I use. I didn’t have any break outs either from trying a new product. That being said, I don’t plan on switching moisturizers due to the scent of Estée Lauder’s moisturizer. It has a very strong scent that reminded me of my grandma’s perfume. If you are not sensitive to strong scents, then I would recommend this product, but if you are like me, there are plenty of less expensive products out there with a much lighter scent that will give you the same results. nan
