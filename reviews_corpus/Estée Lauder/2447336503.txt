I’m not the best at remembering to moisturize on a daily basis & honestly can’t stand when a moisturizer feels like it just lays on your skin. I’ve used Estée LauderDayWear Advanced Multi-Protection Anti-Oxidant Moisturizer, Normal/Combination almost every day & the 1st thing I noticed was how quickly I felt it absorbed into my skin/pores & wasn’t left shiny. I would buy Estée LauderDayWear Advanced Multi-Protection Anti-Oxidant Moisturizer, once the one that Influenster & Sephora sent me to test & give my honest opinion on Sephora.com This day wear Estée Lauder doesn’t have a chemical smell which is a positive on many levels. It actually absorbs into your skin!!!!
