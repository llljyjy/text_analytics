I’m in love with this product. First and for most Estee Lauder is my favorite go to product. This tiny jar is pure gold to me. I dab a little bit in the morning after before I put my foundation on. It makes my skin feel baby soft. It doesn’t feel greasy like some moisturizers feel. I can’t wait to try more products by Estee Lauder. This is an new technique for me every morning
