I am obsessed with this crème! It has a velvety and smooth texture with a light scent that smells great! With the cold weather in NY, my skin has become super dry. I have been using this crème twice a day for two weeks and have noticed such as difference. My skin now feels hydrated and smooth. I would absolutely purchase a larger jar when I run out! Holy Grail for soft, smooth and hydrated skin!
