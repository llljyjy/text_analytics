I received Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Crème for free in exchange for my honest review. I used this moisturizer in place of my normal moisturizer. It has a mild pleasant fragrance that doesn’t last. I immediately noticed the gel light texture. Felt good going on and did moisturize my skin. If I skip moisturizer once the next day I’ll have dry flaky skin. I was pleasantly surprised that it didn’t happen using this moisturizer. I did not like that it left my skin feeling sticky for quite a while and I had to stay far from my eye area or they get itchy. I would not replace my current moisturizer for this one. If you are looking for a moisturizer and you have normal/oily skin I’d recommend you give it a try. If you have one that you are already using and like it I would stick with it. It’s ok
