I received this complimentary in exchange for an honest review. I actually really loved the product. Not sure if it actually eliminates fine lines but it definitely does hydrate your skin so you have less wrinkles and bags under the eye. Itâ€™s a great addition to my skincare routine. I know other complained of irritation but I did not have any issues. It was great. Loved.
