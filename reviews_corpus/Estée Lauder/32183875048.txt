This night cream seems to be working really well! It is surprisingly thick for a cream, but absorbs quickly. It feels nice, and not heavy or greasy on the skin at all. It rivals my other eye cream that I love. There is no scent that I can tell of. The price point is a bit high, but it is a good product. I would recommend. Nice!
