I was pleased with this product. I think the name is a bit misleading, but nonetheless it does moisturize and leaves your skin feeling nice. The texture is thick but it absorbed well into my skin without leaving it greasy. I didn’t see much of a difference in wrinkles, but I did just get Botox so there’s that lol. I don’t think the smell was overpowering in my opinion. I did notice a nice little hydrated glow after application my skin didn’t look as dull so I liked that . Overall 4 stars not an amazing product but not a bad one either. Pricing ah is a little pricey. ** I received this complimentary for reviewing purposes. ** Super youth not quite
