I’ve anyways been a skeptic of lotions because I never really understood what they did. When I received a deluxe sample of this (in exchange for my feedback) I was excited to finally see what it was about. It absorbed really well but I expected that since it’s watery. What I didn’t expect was how well it hydrated my skin on its own with no other products. I love that my other skincare went on and absorbed well without pilling (which unfortunately happens often with skincare). A little goes a long way-I learned that the hard way- so it has lasted me quite a long time. My skin didn’t feel tight later on in the day and my makeup looked great too. nan
