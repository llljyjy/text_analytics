my first impressions, this is without question rich, I think this would be amazing for dry skin, this lush, beige colored cream goes on nice and smooth, absorbs quickly, leaving a silky, matte finish. However it does have a very perfumish scent to it, and after a while it seems to almost resurface, on the more oily parts of my combo skin. My face gets a tacky like finish about an hour after I apply this. I think dryer skin would have better luck? My skin just doesn’t seem to like this, at least not during summer. I can’t speak to long term effects Very rich
