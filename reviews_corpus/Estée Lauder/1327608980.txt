This is product is getting 3 stars from me- good, but not necessary. It’s light but also moisturizing. I have combo skin and it didn’t make me too oily, but caused my makeup to pill. I didn’t notice a dramatic difference after using this product and don’t think it’s worth it for the price. I would continue to use if it was sent to me for free, but don’t find it a must have in my skin care routine. Good, but Not Necessary
