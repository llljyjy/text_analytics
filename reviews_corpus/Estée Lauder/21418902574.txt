I think if you have dry skin, you will love it. However if you have combination or oily skin it’s going to have to be a no, for me anyway. The product is very heavy and I can deal with that if it absorbs well enough to be invisible…. It does not. My skin did glow though but I’m not sure if that was because of the shininess. Also smells good… clean and perfumey-like… No Not Today
