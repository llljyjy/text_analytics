I received this free from Influenster for my honest review. This is a pretty good moisturizer. It is not heavy. Absorbs nicely. The smell is clean. It doesn’t leave you feeling oily. It plays well under makeup. I’ve tried it with several different foundations and skin tints. I tried it for about 2 weeks before I formed my opinion. Pleasantly surprised
