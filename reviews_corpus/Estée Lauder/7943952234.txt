This is easily the best moisturizer I have ever tried, and itâ€™s not even close. It is intensely hydrating without making my combination skin feel oily. I use it at night after serum, and in the morning before makeup. It plumps and smooths my skin, and my makeup goes on beautifully without sliding around during the day. It has the most incredible soft, scent that I would absolutely wear as perfume. Everything about this product screams luxury, and it has exceeded all my expectations! Intensely Hydrating, Smoothing & Smells Amazing!
