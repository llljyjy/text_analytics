This is a very unique eye gel, it glides on so smoothly and hydrates really well. I have really enjoyed using it. It does smooth out my very fine lines, but I havenâ€™t noticed a difference in my undereye dark circles. Which is why I give a 4, but I really do like the texture of this cream and I like the results of the reduced appearance of fine lines. Worth a try
