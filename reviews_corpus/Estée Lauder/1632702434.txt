I love that this moisturizer has SPF. It’s not thick and Cakey. it absorbs well. very smooth. A little bit goes a long way. I love the cucumber smell and how my skin feels afterwards. I wait about 15 to 20 minutes before putting my foundation on. And I definitely use it on non-make up days. I couldn’t tell any difference as far as anti-aging. But otherwise I definitely recommend this product. I love the smell
