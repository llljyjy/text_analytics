I received this from Influenster for an honest review. I’ve been using this at night for the past month and it’s a nice night cream for the eyes. My under eyes seem slightly softer and smoother when I use this, though I haven’t noticed any change in dark circles. The consistency is very nice, it feels like a thicker gel than most gel eye creams and actually stays on the skin longer than others. The couple of cons for me are when I tried using it during the day time, I noticed my concealer pilled and I ended up having to wipe it off. The ingredients list is also super long and I tent to like more natural products with fewer ingredients. It’s pricey for the amount of product you get, and I do think other creams would do just as well or better. But this is a nice one overall. Nice, but pricey
