This cream is very soothing. A little goes a long way, and it feels very cooling and moisturizing. It felt really good to put it on before bed. It didn’t feel gloopy, sticky, or greasy. The gel texture was perfect, making it easy to apply and stay in place. It didn’t immediately absorb, you could feel it sitting on your skin, but again, it was soothing. I can’t say I visually saw a big difference, but when I woke up I felt like my eyes felt more awake and refreshed. But aside from these positives, I personally wouldn’t justify the price for a lack of visual results. Like it, but not for the price!
