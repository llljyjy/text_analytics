Received this as a trial from Influenster for an honest review.  So glad to have had the opportunity to try it too!This moisturizer was very good. I typically have normal skin but as the weather changes it tends to get drier in the cooler months. I find that this definitely helps keep my skin from feeling dry. It absorbs very well, has a light scent, non-greasy yet makes skin supple and hydrated.  I liked it very much and I think at this price point itâ€™s worth it! Great addition to your skin care regimen!
