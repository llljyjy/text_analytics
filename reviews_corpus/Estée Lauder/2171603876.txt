I’ve been using this cream daily after washing my face in the morning for about a week. I like that it is light weight and yet moisturizing. It seems to be what my fine lines needed since they are less visible after applying a thin layer. I telework, so I’ve not been putting make up on after this cream. It is not greasy and thr fragrance is so mild that it has not caused any issues for my skin.  It seems to be a quality face cream, and works well with my skin. I would recommend it. Lightweight and moisturizing
