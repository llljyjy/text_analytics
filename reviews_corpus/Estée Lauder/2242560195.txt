I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have really enjoyed this moisturizer. I use moisturizers every morning and night and have tried a multitude of different options. This product is extremely rich and hydrating. It is a thick cream but it wears very comfortably. I apply it at night and notice that my skin not only feels soft in the morning but looks notably healthier. I only knocked off one star because this item performs in a similar fashion to other moisturizers that I have tried at a lower price point. Rich and Hydrating
