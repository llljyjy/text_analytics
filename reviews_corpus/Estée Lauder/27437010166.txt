I received Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-Creme Synchronized Multi-Recovery Eye Cream. A little of this goes a long way. I dab this under my eye untill it is absorbed. Absorbs very well does not leave any gross residue. I love this for my night routine. It has helped significantly increase itâ€™s my dark circles under my eyes. The lines have faded and I look wide eyed and bright eyed. It makes my under eye soft and moisturized. It is so easy to apply. Very lightweight and feels amazing. Defiantly recommend. Hydrated and glowing
