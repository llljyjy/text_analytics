I love the way this moisturizer made my skin feel. It didn’t leave an oily residue and left my skin feeling hydrated. It was easy to spread and I didn’t need too much to make it work. I felt a difference when applying my makeup. It also has a light scent that is not overpowering. Left my skin hydrated
