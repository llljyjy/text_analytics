I received a sample of this moisturizer from Estee Lauder and Influenster for my honest review. I have been using this product twice daily for the past two weeks. It is thick but absorbs quickly with no oily residue. I have noticed my skin appears brighter and well hydrated! My fine lines are much less notable. The scent is very faint and pleasant. I have combination skin and this moisturizer is perfect for me during the cold, dry Midwest winter months! Would highly recommend this moisturizer! Effective, absorbs quickly, minimize fine lines
