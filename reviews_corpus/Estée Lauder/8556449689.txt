I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this for about a month. I honestly have not seen a reduction in my under eye circles and fine lines. It is however nice and moisturizing for my under eye. I have noticed that my makeup looks better after using this for about a week. I am going to continue to use for my under eye as a nice moisturizer. It might also be one of those products that you will see results with continuous use over time. If it is, I will update my review. Even though this was sent to me free, this is my honest review. Nice moisturizer
