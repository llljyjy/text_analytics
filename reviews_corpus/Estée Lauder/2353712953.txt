To be honest I got this to review in the smallest sample size I have ever seen. I think it was ok but I could literally only use it twice so I have no way of knowing if it is actually going to do anything. It felt nice, but ultimately for 42 dollars for a full size seems overpriced for what basically amounts to a toner. But like I said, I only got a sample size to review so I donâ€™t think I can contribute much to the conversation. nan
