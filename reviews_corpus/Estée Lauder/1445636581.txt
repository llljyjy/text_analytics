I was skeptical when I got a sample of this eye cream but ended up using every last drop of it, I was even using less to make it last longer. It dissolves instantly into your skin and is lightweight but very moisturizing. If you have oily or combo skin this is a MUST, it doesn’t just sit on top of your skin like heavier creams. Really an outstanding eye cream, I will be purchasing when it’s available. Silky eye cream
