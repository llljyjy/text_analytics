I received this cream complimentary from influenster and Estee lauder in exchange for my honest review.  This cream is good. I didn’t necessarily notice a huge change to my appearance in the time I’ve been using it. The texture is smooth, smell is mild, difference in youth appearance is minimal. Still I do love the light feel of it on my face,  it isn’t extremely heavy, which I appreciate. I would recommend with minor hesitation because of the price. Ok moisturizer
