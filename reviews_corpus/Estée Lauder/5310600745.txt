I Received This As A Free Sample To Test Out And Give My Thoughts On It. Love This Stuff! However, I Wish The Sample Was A Little Bigger.  Itâ€™s Such A Tiny Jar. Maybe A Week-2 Weeks Worth Of Product.  I Love That This Is Non-Greasy Yet So Thick & Luxurious On The Skin.  Definitely Helps Plump Up The Skin Before Makeup Application. LOVE This Non-Greasy Moisturizer!
