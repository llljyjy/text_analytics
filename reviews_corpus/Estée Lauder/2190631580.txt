This creme did a nice job hydrating my skin. The creme was thicker, but did absorb into the skin well. The fragrance wasn’t too strong and the product was easy to apply with the jar application. I didn’t notice a big difference with fine lines, but only had a sample size to try. Great moisturizer! nan
