Definitely not a lotion as noted in its name/branding but I loved that my skin drank up the solution as soon as it was applied. It left my skin feeling hydrated and soft before applying regular moisturizer. It’s lightly scented and fast absorbing.  Not sure about the full size product but the sample I received, I did not like that the bottle opening was so big, you can literally spill the product. Would have been nice to include a topper or even a dropper to secure the solution in the sample. Im giving this a 3 because received a small sample from Influnenster, which lasted about a week so I don’t feel like it was an adequate amount of product to test and give full review on the product. Fast absorbing and moisturizing
