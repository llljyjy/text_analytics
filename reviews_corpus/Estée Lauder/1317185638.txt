This cream is nice. It is noticeably scented. I did not find the Creme to be super rich- it has a good texture and isnâ€™t super heavy. I found that it soaked in fairly quickly and worked well with my other skincare products. I think the price is a little hefty for the quality. I did not notice a difference in my skin after using it. I received a sample complimentary from Influenster. mediocre moisturizer
