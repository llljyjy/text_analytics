I received this item free in exchange for my review. I really liked this moisturizer. The smell is very pleasant. As I get migraines certain smells make me Iâ€™ll. It kept my skin soft. I have combination skin so this worked well. I was glad it has spf in it because that is so important for cream. I would buy this again and use as part of my daily routine. Great moisturizer
