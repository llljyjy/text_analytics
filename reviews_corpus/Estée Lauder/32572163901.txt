I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about a gel cream or if this would even work well. I love this eye cream. I have dark circles and bags due to young children not sleeping. Most eye creams haven’t worked at all and seem to make it worse. I used this twice a day as suggested and saw a difference in dark circles and puffiness. It doesn’t take much but a small dab. Too much and your eyes feel greasy. There was a slight burning feeling with it but it lasted a quick second and went away. This is def a top contender for eye creams for me. Works great
