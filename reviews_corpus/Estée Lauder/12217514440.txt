I wish I tried this product earlier! Super hydrating, but absorbs quickly and the gel texture feels great and works well with my oily skin (even under makeup.) Iâ€™ve noticed my fine lines have looked less deep and my skin looks brighter. My under eye area has been loving this especially since my skins been a bit dehydrated due to standard summer sun exposure, feels much more hydrated! Will continue to use this! Wish I found this earlier!
