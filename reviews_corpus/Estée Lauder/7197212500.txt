This was just an okay product for me - it has a very strong rose fragrance, you know, that old school luxury skincare scent. I wish it was either fragrance free or just had a less noticeable scent. I don’t think it was not hydrating enough although I do have oily skin so I don’t normally need much hydration anyway. Noticed no difference and will not purchase myself.
