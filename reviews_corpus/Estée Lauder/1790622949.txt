I thought the consistency was nice and it did moisturize well and had a nice scent. I was sent a sample from Influenster and tried it a few times. I will say it made my face feel moisturized deeply, but it’s just not my favorite. Also my skin seems to have a slight reaction to it and I think it might be a sensitivity reaction to the ingredients in it. I think if you have drier skin and it’s not sensitive that most would enjoy it! Nice product
