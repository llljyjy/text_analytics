I received a small sample size of this cream to test and review from Influenster. Since it was such a small amount, I just focused on my problem area- my forehead. after using the cream twice a day on my forehead for two weeks- I am completely convinced that it works! It felt a little greasy on my skin but I’m not accustomed to using a thick cream like this (I prefer serums.) the smell is very very mild and agreeable. After a week I felt like my skin looked glowing, dewy and plump. Definitely took away the tired and dull appearance of my skin. I can’t see a significant change in the reduction of fine lines or wrinkles but my skin does appear more youthful looking. As expensive as it is, I think I’ll buy the full size to use on my full face because if I can see results after a couple weeks I would love to see what it does after a couple months. Surprised
