I received a sample of this product from Influenster for free in exchange for my honest review.  I have combination skin and this just isn’t the product for me; though it’s a nice product.  It’s heavily fragranced and a thick cream.  It did make my skin feel softer and absorbed quickly into my skin.  It made my skin look more hydrated.  It can feel greasy if you use too much, which I did the first two uses. Nice product but not for me
