I received this free from @Influenster to use and give my honest opinion. I opened and smelled it, It has a light scent that smells good. I put just a little on my face and it absorbs quick with no oily feeling. It left my skin feeling soft, smooth, & hydrated. I was sent a sample but in the short time i was able to use it my skin has felt and looked smoother and more moisturized than it  ever has. Over time 89% said their skin looks  firmer and 85% said their pores looks more minimized. My face is soft & moisturized
