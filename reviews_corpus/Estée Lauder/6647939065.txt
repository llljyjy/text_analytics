I received a deluxe size sample of Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme + Youth Power Crème courtesy of Influenster in exchange for my honest review. For reference I am in my 40’s with combination skin. Usually I do not like writing reviews on trial sizes of skin care because there isn’t enough product to use long enough to see the benefits and give an accurate assessment of the product. With this Estée Lauder crème I can. This crème comes in typical Estée Lauder packaging not unlike some of their other products. The crème feels nice and luxurious. It has a scent, but it’s not overpowering. I was excited to use this moisturizer. Since it’s a heavier texture I decided to use it at night. Unfortunately I woke up the next morning with multiple tiny bumps around my mouth and chin. I rarely break out and I don’t have sensitive or reactive skin so this was unusual. I decided not to use the cream until it cleared up and so I tried it a few days later. I had the same reaction. I am sad to say that something in this product doesn’t agree with my skin. Everyone’s skin is different so that’s not to say that this product won’t work for you. This is purely my own personal experience. I’ve used other Estée Lauder products without that reaction. I used the rest of the sample on my hands. Not my favorite from EL
