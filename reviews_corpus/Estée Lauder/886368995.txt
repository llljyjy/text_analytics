I received a complimentary sample of this product from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I used the Micro Essence Treatment Lotion for about a month and it didn’t seem to do much overall. It has a watery but smooth consistency and has no scent. It absorbed quickly into my skin and almost felt like it wasn’t even there but my skin was just a little more moisturized. It is a nice product but at the high price point, it’s not a necessity. I would not purchase. Not necessary
