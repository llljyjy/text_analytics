I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. The samples fairly small, so I truthfully have not seen much of an effect with this product. However that being said, the product feels super nice on my skin, especially on these warm summer days. It has a light smell, and I do not find it irritating to my sensitive skin. I think it is worth trying, I would like to try it for a longer period of time to see if it does have any long-term effects on wrinkles in the eye area. Love the texture
