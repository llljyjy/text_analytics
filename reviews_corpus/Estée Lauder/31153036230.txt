I got this cream as a free sample and as long as I have been using it, I can say that I haven’t noticed any change but I do feel like it is a nice cream to refresh, so if after a long day that is what you are looking for your eye skin, I highly recommend it. Pro tip: leave it in the fresh before using it, it’s gonna be even more refreshing! Refreshing cream!
