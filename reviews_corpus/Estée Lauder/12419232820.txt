Received complimentary from Influenster and Estée Lauder for honest review.Y’all, this eye gel-cream is GLORIOUS!!!! It applies so smoothly; a little bit really does go a long way. It does not leave the skin feeling greasy or sticky at all. I know it’s a “night cream” but I like to use it both morning and night because it keeps that delicate skin nice and hydrated!!! nan
