I am always excited to try new products for my skin. I especially like finding products that help my skin maintain its youthful glow. I tend to have skin that leans on the drier side. This product applies nicely with my other nighttime routine and leaves undereye skin looking hydrated and firmer in the morning with consistent use. I also noticed that this product was a good fit for my sensitive skin and did not irritate with regular use.. I would highly recommend this product. Great product
