Received complimentary from Influenster for my honest review.  Estee Lauder is always a timeless, great brand. This Micro Essence does work for softening my skin and reducing redness.  The consistency is liquidy.  It says treatment lotion with Bio-Ferment.  Not really a lotion consistency, more like a toner consistency.  I am a little weary of the price, kind of expensive in my opinion.  I applied the product with a cotton pad, because of the consistency.  I did try with my hands, but you have to becareful not to waste any product because of the consistency.  I have sensitive skin and did well with the product.  My cheeks were soft, less red.  I would probably use it again, if the price is slightly lower, and if the consistency of the product was a little thicker - to not waste any. If it didnâ€™t have the word lotion in the title, I probably would of thought of it as a toner type product. Does help with redness...
