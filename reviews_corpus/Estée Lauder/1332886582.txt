I received this product for free from Estee Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I was very excited to try this moisturizer. It smelled nice and was thick and creamy. It went on smoothly. I have sensitive dry skin. It didn’t irritate my skin which was a plus. However, my skin is super dry and I didn’t feel this moisturized it as much as I would have wanted. I’ll continue to use this and see if it has long term benefits.#influenster #esteelauder Nice thick moisturizer
