I absolutely love this eye cream. It is a thicker gel formula and it feels soo good under my eyes!!! I think it is better suited for my pm skincare routine, but it also makes my concealer apply very nicely during the day as well. A 10/10!!! I will definitely repurchase. I have terrible dark circles, and this is one of the only eye creams Iâ€™ve ever used that seems to help Amazing!!!
