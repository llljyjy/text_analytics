I believe this would be a great product for the right skin type. My skin is sensitive, and upon trying this multiple times, my skin ended up breaking out in patches of whiteheads with redness that burned. Please note that my skin is extra sensitive so this is not indicative of what the product may be like for most users. I did note the SPF smell within the moisturizer, as well, so those who are sensitive to SPF might want to be aware (although this can definitely be a plus!). It did seem to absorb well and not be greasy, and had I not broken out, I felt this would have been a great option for me. nan
