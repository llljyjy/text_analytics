First of all, this toner smells absolutely heavenly. It’s sweet, soft, feminine and high end, floral. The formula is very gentle on skin and definitely alcohol free. However, I felt the texture was too viscous and didn’t feel cleansing enough. I had to use a lot more than regular toner for it to soak up my cotton ball or cloth. It didn’t help remove impurities and left a slightly sticky residue. Smells Heavenly
