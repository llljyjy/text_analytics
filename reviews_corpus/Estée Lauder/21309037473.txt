Love this so much. I have been using this creme before bed for 3ish weeks now and absolutely adore how my skin feels. Softer healthier, more supple. At 44 I have my share of wrinkles and dry areas and this creme has made my skin look and feel younger. Tbe cream is light and does not feel heavy or greasy on and immediately absorbs in to your skin. It has a lovely light fragrance as well  for the price it is a fantastic cream. I have already ordered a full size and know this will remain a part of my skin routine. Would give it 10 â˜† if I could
