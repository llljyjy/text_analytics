I received a sample of this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  The sample size was good, would last a couple weeks easy if you use a proper amount. This left my face feeling smooth and plump. Although it did feel fairly heavy sitting on my skin.  I don’t have a need for hyaluronic acid in my products.  Also... I just can never get past the scent of Estee Lauder creams.  The same scent they’ve had for decades.  There are better products for me out there, but if the scent doesn’t bother you, this could be a good product. Good, just not for me
