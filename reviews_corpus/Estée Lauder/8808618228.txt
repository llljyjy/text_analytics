I got a free sample and just a little bit lasted a long time. I’m 37 with acne prone, hormonal acne skin that does not like too many products used on it. I use this every night and it’s all I need. I only use a lotion during the day on occasion if my skin needs it. My skin has been hydrated, glowing and NO irritation. That’s a big one for me. Sounds to me, based on the varying feedback, you might want to see if the sample works for you. I love it myself. works wonders on my late 30’s, hormonal acne skin
