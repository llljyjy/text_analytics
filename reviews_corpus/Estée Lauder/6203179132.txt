I received this product & started using it 7 days ago. It smells great. It has a soft, clean smell to it. It can be applied easily, it’s not thick or heavy. I’ve worn it just fine under makeup as well. I feel like my skin has been more hydrated since using it. I love that it’s spf 15 as well, giving your skin added protection. highly recommend for a daily moisturizer. Product was received complementary for testing purposes. Refreshing Moisturizer
