I received the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-Creme from Estee Lauder and Influenster for free. I was excited to incorporate this product into my daily routine. I usually apply eye creams in the morning, but added in some applications at night when I received this product. It was extremely easy to apply and I felt as though it was a smoother application than most other products I’ve tried. It also seems to be absorbed very quickly. Since using the product for the past couple of weeks I’ve also noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin under the eyes and some decrease in wrinkles. Almost immediately when I started using the product I felt as though I looked more awake in the mornings. Overall I really enjoyed using this. nan
