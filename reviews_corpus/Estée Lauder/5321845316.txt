This was very very smooth and hydrating. It really hydrated and plumped my under eyes. It’s was so smooth to apply and it wasn’t sticky. I used it alone and under makeup and concealer stayed great! I don’t have wrinkles, but I do have a line under my eyes that appears when I’m really tired and this really helped hydrate and plump it so it nearly disappeared. nan
