I received this product free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I’m all about texture when it comes to skincare and I love this smooth gel cream. It absorbs really well, and leaves a silky finish. The delicate skin under my eyes are instantly refreshed and hydrated. I’m not sure that this product made much difference in my dark circles, but it did make my eyes look less tired. Texture and Hydration!
