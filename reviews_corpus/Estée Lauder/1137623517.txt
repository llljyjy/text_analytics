I got a sample of this for 100 points, so I can’t yet know how it works for long term but I do know from using it after a serum and under my regular moisturizer (my skin leans dry, but this product might work great in its own for normal to oily skin), I noticed a marked difference in how my makeup lasted. This moisturizer seems to act somewhat like a wrinkle-plumper and filler. I have this one fine-line area just to the left of my chin where makeup wants to settle after just a few hours, despite primer and setting powder and setting spray. I figured it was a lost cause and I was doomed to touch up throughout the day, but right now my makeup is five hours plus, and looks good as freshly-applied.  It has to be this cream!  Yes it contains a LOT of silicone products. That concerned me (does EVERYTHING need silicone these days???), but so far no breakouts.  Then again I’m not as prone to breakouts as I once was. All I can say is order this if you have a fine-line/makeup settlement issue.  Your makeup will glide over this like buttah, too. It has not pulled on my face either. Could be because I topped it with a different moisturizer for my drier skin. Works great with other products
