I received this product as a free sample, and I wasn’t disappointed. First, the container is rather small, but the product inside packs a punch. The moisturizer has little scent, which in totally ok with. The product is creamy and goes onto the skin nice and smoothly. I used it on my face and neck and felt that my skin had a slight more bounce to it, my skin was much more hydrated, and smoother. It isn’t greasy and it soaks into the skin beautifully. I would have given this 5 stars, but the product was just too small. Smooth skin left
