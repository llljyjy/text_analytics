Honestly this smelled like a really nice laundry detergent. I really liked the scent, can honestly not get over it. I tested this product for a week and my face was flakey before beginning to use this product. It definitely helped moisturize my face, and the flakes went away, though I think twice a day was a little too much. My face began to get oily. But once at night seems to do the trick. I’m rating it 3 stars because while it was lovely and it did work, there are a lot of products out there that accomplish this for far less. I just didn’t feel it was a necessary staple in my skincare routine.  I received a sample of this product to test and review through Influenster nan
