I received this sample complimentary for my honest review and feedback from Influenster and Estēe Lauder. I love this eye cream just like every night repair product by Estēe Launder. This isn’t too thick or too light, my under eyes look noticeably better in the morning after using this. I think this would work great for any skin type, even those who are sensitive. This eye cream also plays well with eye serums and doesn’t cause any pilling. Two thumbs up. Lovely eye cream. Wonderful texture.
