I didn’t know I needed a new moisturizer until I tried this. I am a huge fan of a certain skincare brand and this has converted me from their moisturizer! I love how luxurious this feels! It’s thick, which one would assume also means it’s heavy, but it’s not! It soaks in so beautifully and does not irritate my sometimes sensitive skin. Typically I need lightweight moisturizers even though I have dry skin because they cause me to have breakouts. This did no such thing. I was glowing by week 2. Highly, highly recommend! I can’t wait to finish my current moisturizer so I can bring this one into my lineup! I recieved a sample size of this cream for my honest opinion. SO GOOD!
