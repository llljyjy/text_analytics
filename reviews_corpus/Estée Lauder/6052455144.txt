I received a deluxe sample size of the Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Moisturizer from Estee Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I am 44 and have combination skin.  This product is thick and rich but also like a gel at the same time. It doesn’t sit on the surface of your skin like some moisturizers,  but absorbs into the skin like a gel. My skin didn’t stick to my pillow lol.   Using this moisturizer twice a day for a full week I did notice a difference. My skin looked very plumped and dewy. I thoroughly enjoyed how it helped my skin look and feel healthy with a beautiful glow. I would recommend this product to friends and family. nan
