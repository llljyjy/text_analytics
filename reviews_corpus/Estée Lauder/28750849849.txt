I received a free product from Influenster for an honest review. This was a beautiful lightweight eye cream. The gel texture felt smooth and never irritated my eyes. Summer is currently hot and humid so this was perfect to use without worrying it would melt off my face. As beautiful as this was, I could not justify the price and I didnâ€™t notice any results other than it kept my under eyes moisturized. I am in my late 20s so if you have more mature skin then you may notice better results. nan
