I loved the texture and fragrance, its not too heavy or thin of a texture and the smell isnt overpowering and I found it pleasing. The negatives that is even with repeat use I did not see dramatic changes in my undereyes, the product did give a nice moisturized and hydrated  effect but nothing different from other things I have tried before. nan
