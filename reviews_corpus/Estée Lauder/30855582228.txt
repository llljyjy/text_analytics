I received this product for free in exchange for an home fest review. Overall I liked this product, the texture of it is extremely smooth and almost silky. It absorbs into your skin nicely and you are able to wear it under make up. It did not make my face greasy or oily throughout the day nor did it affect my foundation or concealer. I gave it four stars instead of five due to some of the product evaporating from the container. I used it and then took a little break from it for about two weeks then when I used it again some of the product it had evaporated. The top was on tightly  but overall it does make my skin feel moisturized, didnâ€™t really see or feel any sort of firming or see a difference as far as any wrinkles. Great for under makeup
