I have previously used a few Estée Lauder Creams, they’ve never disappointed me. I was glad to get a free sample from Influenster. I have combination skin so I used this cream at night on top of my EL Night Repair Serum. I woke up with soft, dewy skin. I would need to use it a longer time to see if it firms and does other things. I really liked it. Soft Radiant Skin
