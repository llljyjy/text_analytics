I received a mini size product from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I really liked this cream. It has a beautiful texture and feels so light weight but super hydrating. I didn’t notice a scent which is good because I don’t like my skincare with overpowering fragrances. The cream goes on nice and feels wonderful. The only reason I took a star away was because the trial only lasted 2 weeks so it’s hard to tell if it made a difference in my wrinkles at least I didn’t notice any. Lovely cream
