Got this for free from Influenster. I really did enjoy using this product and honestly have been missing it from my routine since I finished the little sample. The consistency feels so silky, hydrating, and slimy (which I know is a terrible descriptive word but it’s what I love in an eye cream/skincare). I still took a star off because it’s claims are inflated, it’s a cream to hydrate your eye area - a face cream will do that too at a much cheaper price. That being said, it’s made my skincare routine feel complete and fancy too, I wouldn’t purchase it but I did enjoy using it while it was there. Lovely
