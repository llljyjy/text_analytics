I received this product for my honest review. The package says lotion but it’s consistency is just a little thicker than water. It’s clear as well. I used this for several weeks and it does give my face a moisturized feel. It soaks in well, but it says it helps reduce redness and I can’t tell a difference in that area. Its a decent product, but It’s definitely not worth the price tag though. nan
