I received a sample size of the product to try for free, courtesy of Influenster, in exchange for my honest review.Due to the size, I wasn’t able to try it too much. I really wanted to love it, but the couple times I used it, my skin just said “no”. That said, please take my review with a grain of salt because I am prone to rosacea and super super sensitive so it’s hard to find products that don’t irritate my skin. nan
