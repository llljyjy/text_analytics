I received a sample of this product for testing purposes. Although I’m a skincare girly I don’t regularly use eye creams. This one had a great start because it did not irritate or burn my very sensitive eyes. I feel as though I literally saw a difference overnight. As someone who has under eye bags from both genetics and insomnia, I saw a difference in the overall brightness of the area and my eyes looked lifted and not as tired. It didn’t get rid of them completely because it can’t change genetics but I definitely saw an improvement and that’s a plus. I used a small amount on my ring finger and spread it both under the eye and on my eye lids. A little goes a long way. I’ve used it every other night for a month and this sample size still has a good bit left. I would recommend for those who are ok with it being on the pricier side and is looking to improve the area, not “fix” it. 4/5 stars because it is pricey Good product
