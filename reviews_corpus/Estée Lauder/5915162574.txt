I received this product complementary from Influenster. It is a nice moisturizer, especially since it has spf 15. It leaves my skin glowing and looking healthy. It is kind of oily though, so if you got oily skin I’m not sure this is for you. It has a nice scent, well it’s nice to me. Am I happy to have this and will I use it? Yes. Will I purchase it? I would have to say no. It’s nice
