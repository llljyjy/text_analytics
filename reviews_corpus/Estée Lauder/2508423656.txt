I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review from Influenster and Estée Lauder. I really enjoy this eye cream. It feels very hydrating with an almost Vaseline like texture. I feel it helped de-puff my eyes and kept them refreshed. I would add this to my everyday routine happily.I can’t tel if it did anything for my fine lines or dark circles so that’s the only reason I’m giving 4 instead of 5. Very Nice
