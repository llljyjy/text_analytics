I am not someone who buys eye creams very much, so I’m definitely new to this type of product, but I really enjoyed using this eye cream. The consistency is a cooling, comfortable and gel-like and was definitely a pleasure to use. After immediate use, the skin around my eyes look brighter and plumper. After several weeks of consistent use though, I wouldn’t say that I noticed a drastic long term effect. I would recommend this product if it’s in your budget, but I think it definitely depends on what you are looking for! Overall, a really lovely eye cream though. Great eye cream!
