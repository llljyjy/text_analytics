Very lightweight on the skin, I am very sensitive to all eye creams however this only gave me an issue on the first night! About a week after using my skin seemed to be softer wanting to continue to use to really see the affects! Still unsure if I will repurchase but it is a nice addition to my routine! Like it !!
