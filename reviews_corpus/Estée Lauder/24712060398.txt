To be completely honest, I received this cream for my review from influencer. All of that aside, I have been searching for a nightly cream for a while now and this came at the perfect timing. This eye cream is moisturizing and light weight. It doesn’t make my skin feel weighed down or oily while my under eye looks way less dry and tired. I really loved the way it helped with the few wrinkles I’m starting to accumulate and the texture it left my skin without weighing it down. I left only 4 stars due to the fact I didn’t see a huge difference in the darker areas as much and it does carry a very heavy price tag. Other than two negatives, I really was very nice. Gives an amazing feeling to your skin♡
