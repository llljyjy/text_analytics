I was actually pleasantly surprised that I really liked this moisturizer. I was gifted the moisturizer in exchange for my honest review but it is actually a nice moisturizer. This moisturizer has a slight fragrance to it but it quickly fades and it feels really nice on the skin. I love that it contains SPF but it is only SPF 15 and I wish it were at least SPF 25 However it does wear well under other products and doesnâ€™t leave a white cast. It also absorbs great with no greasy feel. If this had SPF 25 and was a touch less expensive I would whatever given this 5 stars. I will definitely continue to use it. I really liked the product
