I tested the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Complex against my regular eye skin care routine (The Ordinary Caffeine Solution and the Verso Super Eye Serum). I used the entire 3mL sample over two weeks. The eye I used the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Complex on was visibly brighter and my seemingly permanent dark circles were much less noticeable. The skin in the under-eye area also felt well moisturized. I also tend to have issues with puffiness. As far as I could tell, the Estee Lauder and The Ordinary were both similar at minimizin under-eye puffiness. The Estee Lauder was noticeably worse at minimizing the appearance of my crow’s feet. The Verso Super Eye Serum does an exceptional job reducing the appearance of fine lines around my eyes. If you are concerned about fine lines around your eyes, I would not recommend the Estee Lauder. However, as an overall general use eye skin care product, the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Complex performed well at minimizing dark circles, brightening, and depuffing. For now, as I am most concerned about my fine lines, I don’t plan on changing my routine. However, I have to say that as a brightening product, the Advanced Night Repair lived up to its claims. Good for brightening
