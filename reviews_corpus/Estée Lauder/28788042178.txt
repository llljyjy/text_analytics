I love the packaging of this product. The little container is strong and elegant. When I first felt the moisturizer, it felt thick. I was nervous it was going to go on really heavy on the face. Bit to my surprise,  it rubbed in nicely and was not heavy at all. I love a light feeling moisturizer that has SPF in it. One less thing I have to put on my face. The scent is also very lovely! Felt heavy but went on light!
