I received this product for free from Influenster and Estēe Lauder in exchange for my honest review;The Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme gave my face an instant firm feeling, it’s smooth, however, I found it a bit thicker in comparison to other facial creams. The scent is pleasant. The only down side is that the sample was to small to use for a long time to determine how well it works with fine lines. The texture of my skin did feel soft and was radiant anytime I used it. Although the jar was small the plus is that you don’t have to apply much to get full coverage on your face, the 5ml sample lasted a couple of weeks. It would be helpful if it came with a small spatula for easier application. nan
