love the feel of this product and the way it leaves my skin feeling. It is smooth without being to heavy or oily. Not stinging or irritation around my eyes, which is a common issue I have. There is virtually no scent which I really like. I have very dark circles and after using this product for a week my skin is softer and my under eye area appears brighter concealing my under eye circles - I received this product complementary in return for my honest opinion A good product
