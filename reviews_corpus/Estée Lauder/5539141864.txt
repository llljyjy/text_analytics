This is great for dry skin. It is hydrating and is easy to apply. The consistency is nice and it soaks right into your skin. It is great that it is free of a lot of chemicals you do not want your skin absorbing but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because it does still contain some bad ingredients such as fragrance. I received this product complimentary to try out. nan
