What can I say Estee Lauder is the OG of skin care. I received a small very small sample from influener. Unfortunately the sample didnâ€™t last long enough to see the results it promises so this review is only about the texture and smell goes on great absorbs creamy light not greasy fragrance is pleasing and not irritating thank you O.g skincare
