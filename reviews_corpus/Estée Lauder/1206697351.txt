As with all their eye creams Iâ€™ve tried this one does not disappoint.  It was hydrating and I could see the difference after a few weeks it had on my under eye wrinkles.  The smooth texture blends easily on your skin, which make a little go a long way.  I also used it on my forehead and around my mouth to help with those wrinkles as well.  Highly recommend! Love Their Eye Treatments!
