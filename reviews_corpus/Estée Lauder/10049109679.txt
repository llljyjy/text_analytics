Firstly, I received the product for free from Influenster and EstéeLauder in exchange for an honest review. Pros: it doesn’t irritate my very sensitive and delicate skin around my eyes- gently tapping helped the product absorb but still left a nice cushion of serum to take in overnight - I truly believe this makes a huge difference in the darkening of my UPPER eyelids (my lower eyes are dark from having hollow tear troughs)- my upper eye skin is no longer pink/irritated looking nor do I get the odd bluish/grey darkening I had in the past. Cons: it’s pricey. I already owned this product when I received the sample to review. I find it totally worth it for me. If you can get your hands on a sample give it a try!Lastly, I already owned the full sized version of this; I LOVE this product. I think Estēe Lauder is extremely underrated, especially by people in my age demographic and younger. I don’t know if it’s just associated with “old ladies” or if it’s the price point, but even my first “big girl” liquid foundation was Estēe Lauder back when I was 19! Love 99% of Estēe Lauder products; this is one
