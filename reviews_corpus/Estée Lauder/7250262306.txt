I received this sample from Influencer and Estée Lauder for free for my honest review. The size of the gel-creme was enough to appreciate the light scent, smooth application, and lovely feeling of the product on my skin. I’m afraid it wasn’t enough to truly provide feedback on longer use results. My skin felt hydrated each morning and the product did not irritate my skin. I would be curious about the results a full-size product would make on my skin with continued use. nan
