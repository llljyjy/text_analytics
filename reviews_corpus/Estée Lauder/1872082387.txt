I received a complimentary sample from Influenster for an honest review andI loved this moisturizer the first time I applied it. It felt so fresh and light but left my face and neck feeling nourished and smooth.  It is a great hydrator but doesn’t feel heavy at all.  I’ve never used a moisturizer that made my face feel even cleaner after applying it. After a few weeks of regular use my skin had a noticeable glow and I saw a slight increase in firmness and reduction of wrinkles. This is a great product for those who want deep hydration without a greasy feel. nan
