I received Soft Clean Infusion for free from Influenster and Est√©e Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I tend to have dry, sensitive skin and was excited to try this sample sized product. I was pretty disappointed with how extremely tiny the sample size is and was unable to truly get an understanding if this product truly works. If I would have been given a slightly larger sample size, I would have been able to use it more than just a few times. With the limited use due to very small amount of product (0.24fl oz), I enjoyed the sweet and gentle scent. From what I could tell, I believe this product would be very beneficial to dry skin with consistent use (and with more product to try). This did not irritate my skin and felt refreshing to my skin. Overall I was very thankful for this opportunity to try this hydrating essence lotion but would have liked to have a slightly larger sample size to get the full experience.On a side note, I was disappointed with how massive the box was it came in and how tiny the sample was. It almost felt like a cruel joke as I expected the size to be somewhat in proportion to the packaging size. I feel like the packaging could have been significantly reduced in size and result in less waste. Sample too tiny to fully evaluate product
