I like this eye gel. It has a thicker smooth consistency so you don’t have to use a lot and it rubs in nicely. My undereyes feel moisturized as soon as I rub this gel in and stays moisturized all through the night. It hasn’t done anything for the dark circles though. I haven’t found anything to help those. I would definitively recommend this as a moisturizer. I received this for free from influenster and estee lauder to try for free for my honest opinion. Moisturizeing
