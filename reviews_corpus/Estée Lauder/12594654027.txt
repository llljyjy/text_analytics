I received this moisturizer complimentary from Influenster for trial purposes. I’m 43 with combination skin. My main concern is preventing fine lines, staying plump and glowy. I used this only at night since it doesn’t have an SPF. It was hydrating without being heavy or greasy and in the morning had a nice plump glow. I love it, highly recommend. 4 stars only because the price point is so high. Nice night moisturizer
