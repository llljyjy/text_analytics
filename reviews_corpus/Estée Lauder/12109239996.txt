I received this for free for my honest opinion; here I go. I must say I have used this every night for three weeks now, and Iâ€™ve yet to see a difference; if your eyes are sensitive, you may feel a little burnt if you apply it too close to the water line; the texture of it is gel-like and goes on like an oil base type under eye cream. It kept my eyes very moisturized, and I love that. Its okay
