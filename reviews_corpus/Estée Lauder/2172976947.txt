I received a deluxe sample size from Influenster to review and provide my honest opinion. Unfortunately, the sample size wasn’t large enough for continued use, so I can’t confirm the anti-aging claims. However, it has a nice, comfortable consistency. It’s on the thicker side and is hydrating. So, I think it’s perfect for the winter. It looks nice under makeup. What I really like about it is that is doesn’t suffocate my skin or make me look greasy like some other thick moisturizer. I’m not crazy about the scent, but it doesn’t last for long. I gave the product four stars because the price tag is high, and I can’t confirm the skin improving claims. I’m considering purchasing a full size. Very Nice Moisturizer
