This product wasn’t the best option for my skin. I have very dry skin in the winter and it didn’t offer me much hydration.  I also received a free sample for my honest review of this product. Therefore, I did use a smaller amount for a limited amount of time. The cream itself feels silky and has a slight scent that I liked! nan
