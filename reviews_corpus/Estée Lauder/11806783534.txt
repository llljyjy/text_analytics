Definitely hydrating! This product leaves my skin feeling soft, supple, and hydrated. It does have a bit of a floral scent, so if youâ€™re sensitive to fragrances be aware. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to level up their skincare routine. I received a sample from Influenster. Great.
