I received a free sample of this is exchange for my review. I loved the way it felt immediately and it worked well under my makeup. Unfortunately I only received a very small sample and my face broke out after using it. I don’t typically have breakouts so I think it was caused by this product but I can’t be sure since I didn’t have enough to continue using it. Not for me
