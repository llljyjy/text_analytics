I received a small sample of this moisturizer to try in exchange for my honest review. There was not enough of it to really see any results but I can speak on my experience with it. The first thing I noticed is it has a strong perfume scent that lingers on the skin for quite a while after applying. If you are sensative to fragrance I would not recommend. It has a gel like texture but feels very thick and hydrating on the skin. It kind of has an oily feel. Honestly I dont think I care for it very much. I have combo skin and while it does feel nice on drier areas of skin it is not helpful in my oily t-zone. I think this would be best for dry skin types that are not sensative to fragrance. I don’t think I will be buying this in the future. I’m not sure what the results could be with long term use. Not for me
