I was selected to test and review Estēe Lauder’s “Revitalizing Surpreme Youth Power Creame“.  I’ve always been a fan of E.L. products as they are always quality ones.  This moisturizer makes my face and neck feel super hydrated and replenished, with an instant glow and firmness.  I’ve used it in the a.m. and p.m.  I wake up with having a brighter and refreshed complexion. It doesn’t clog my pores and hasn’t caused any breakouts.  I definitely recommend this to others looking for revitalization and youthful glow to their skin. Amazing moisturizer
