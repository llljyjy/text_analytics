The product itself is easy to use, and a little does go a long way. I primarily used it on my forehead. I noticed my skin was getting dull, wrinkly and almost ashy looking. After about two weeks of using this every night I am starting to notice the results! My skin is looking younger and rejuvenated! I’ve noticed a decrease in the visibility of my wrinkles. My skin feels smoother, softer and more plump. I don’t think this would work great for daytime use, it is thicker and stays thick even after sleeping with it. I think it’s a great product and the added benefits of moringa and stem cells make it worthwhile! Works in time!
