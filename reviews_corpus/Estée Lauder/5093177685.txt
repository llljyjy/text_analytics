A nice face cream but nothing truly revolutionary. I received this from influenster and have been using it for a few weeks now. It goes on nicely, an almost gel-like moisturizer, and has a subtle scent that I like. It feels on par with other face creams - honestly pretty on par with an olay cream that I’ve used so by no means super lux. It left my skin feeling hydrated and not oily - a concern if mine. I didn’t notice any real differences off the bat. It’s nice, but not something I’ll be purchasing. Fine but not great
