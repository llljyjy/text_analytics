I received a complimentary sample of Estée Lauder’s Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Cream from Estée Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. While there wasn’t much product to try in this small jar, what was there was lovely indeed! The rich cream went on smoothly but had a hint of tackiness afterward which seemed to absorb into my skin within a couple of hours leaving it plump and moisturized. The fragrance was soft and subtle and dissipated quickly making it a nice experience while applying without being a smell that sticks in your nose for hours… a major plus in my book! While there wasn’t enough product to see results over time, I would absolutely consider adding this to my skincare routine in the future thanks to a very good first impression! A great first impression!
