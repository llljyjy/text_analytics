I received this product as I part of an influencter campaign. It is a very watery texture, so be sure to use a cotton round. It did make my skin noticeably softer and was very light on the skin.  I havenâ€™t noticed any long-term effects, however, the sample provided was quite small. Overall the product is very nice and compliments the other Estee Lauder offerings. I used it along with the advance night serum and eye cream. nan
