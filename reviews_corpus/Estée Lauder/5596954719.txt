I tried a deluxe sample of the  Est√©e Lauder Revitalizing Supreme + Youth Creme Moisturizer and the creme is thick moisturizer that i did not need to use too much of. I can instantly tell the difference when I applied the moisturizer because my skin was very dry and I did use a toner before applying this creme. The creme help seal in moisture and make my skin softer in appearance and the texture smooth. I like that the cream can be applied under my makeup and does not pill if combined with other skincare. The cream absorbs easily into my skin without any oiliness or heavy feeling. Perfect for Colder Weather
