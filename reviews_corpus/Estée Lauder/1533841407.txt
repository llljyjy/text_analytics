I was able to try this through Influenster. I thought the product was super moisturizing and luxurious feeling. I did appreciate how moisturized the skin under my eyes felt. With it being moisturized, it seemed like the fine lines were less noticeable and makeup sat better on that area.  I have very large dark circles and I noticed a small change in that area but not a ton.  Overall I felt that it was a very moisturizing product for the under eyes, but not a miracle worker for the dark circles for me personally. Great for moisturizing the eye area.
