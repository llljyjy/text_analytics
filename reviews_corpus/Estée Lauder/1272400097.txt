I received a sample of this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I really like this product, I have been using it for only a few weeks but so far I’ve seen a slight improvement in my skins hydration and texture. I tend to be a bit sensitive, and this has never caused any irritation which is wonderful. I’m not sure if a toner is a need to have for me, but I do appreciate this as an add to my routine. nan
