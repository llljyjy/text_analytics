I’ve been testing this out for about a week so far with no issues. My skin can be sensitive at times and this hasn’t given me any redness or irritation. I appreciate that this also feels fairly light on the skin without being oily and wears well under my foundation. I’m looking forward to seeing my skin after another week of use. Satisfied!
