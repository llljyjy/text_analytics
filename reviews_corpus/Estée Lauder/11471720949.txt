After using this product for almost a month, I didnâ€™t see any major results. This moisturizer was very hydrating on my skin. It has a super-rich cream-like feel that is not super heavy on the skin. It does contain fragrance and silicones which I am not a fan of. The ingredients include moringa, cactus stem cell extract, hyaluronic acid, hibiscus extract, and collagen. I love that the moisturizer has collagen because as we age, we tend to lose it. Overall, I think its a good products. very moisturizing
