It’s been a little over a week and what little bit I have been using I’ve noticed visible difference in my overall skin tone and fine lines! I love adding this into my morning and nighttime routine after my facial cleanses! It hasn’t got much of a scent which I don’t mind. I’d rather have the benefits of the product and I’m definitely seeing that! I’m definitely getting more when I’m empty. I love a good quality ingredient product for my skin with noticeable results! Noticeable Results!
