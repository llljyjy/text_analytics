I did as instructed and used it in the am and pm. I wasn’t very good at remembering to take a progression pic on the same day every week. But as you can see from the pic, it definitely decreased my bags after a week. It didn’t look like there was much progression by the end of the second week but that could just be my bad sleeping habits. nan
