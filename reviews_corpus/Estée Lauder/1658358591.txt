After using this moisturizer in the past 3 weeks, i think i kinda love it.  The cream is on a thicker side so I was skeptical of putting it on my face because i have sensitive skin. To my surprise, it melted instantly into my skin and not just sit on top. My skin is on the drier side and it does a good jon at keeping t gave my face hydrated and glowy during the day. It does have fragrance, but I love the smell so it is not a problem.  Since I only use it for 3 weeks, so I have not seen any significant improments yet (that is why I gave 4 stars), but so far im loving it because it made my skin so soft and moisturized. Loving it so far!
