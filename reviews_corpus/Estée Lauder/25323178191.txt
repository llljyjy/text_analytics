I received the product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I am honestly not a big eye cream user since I believe that a regular face cream/serums do the same wonders. But I did enjoy using this. I really liked the consistency and texture and how my under eye area felt very soft and hydrated after the application. I do also like that there isn’t a powerful fragrance in this at all. The price tho is a bit much for the amount you get and for what it does. A little does go a long way but hydration is the only benefit I experienced. Unfortunately, Estée Lauder is available for sale in countries with mandatory animal testing. This means that their products were likely tested on animals, which I am very against so I would not be purchasing anything from this brand. There are a lot of cheaper higher quality and cruelty free alternatives out there for those who care. nan
