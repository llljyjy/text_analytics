I received this product from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I been using this for a month now and have noticed that my dark circle has lighten up. It’s absorbed very quickly into the skin. The only downside is that if the product goes inside your eyes, them can get irritated, but other than that, I do recommend this eyes cream. Say bye to your eyes circle
