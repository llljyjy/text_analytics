•I received these products free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review• I’ve enjoyed several Estée Lauder skin care products in the past and this eye cream was another winner for me! The velvety gel-like formula was a dream to apply and absorbed easily without greasiness. My eyes felt and looked refreshed and rejuvenated. After using for a couple of weeks I felt my fine lines were less noticeable. I’ve started using this on my forehead lines and around my mouth as well! nan
