I got a complimentary sample from Influenster and I absolutely love this moisturizer. It feels amazing on the skin. Its so silky and smooth and it smells great! I love everything about this moisturizer, but unfortunately I can’t use it because it has several oils. I have an issue with milia and oils tend to cause them. If you don’t have issues with using oils then you should absolutely should try it. It feels so luxury. Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Cr
