I enjoyed using this creme at night. I woke up and my face just feels and looks hydrated and glowy. The scent is very pleasant.  The creme is thick but a gel like consistency. I didnâ€™t break out with my oily/combo skin. Overall, I think this is a great staple to have in your skincare routine! I received this in exchange for my honest opinion. Great product
