I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I enjoy the light scent of the product and I really like the texture when it is applies to the skin. The only downfall is how oily it makes my skin, which is already oily. I think it would be a great product for someone with dry skin, just maybe not someone with oily skin. nan
