I’ve been using this cream for about 2 weeks now and I’m really liking it. My face has a glow to it and is very smooth. Most rich creams don’t absorb well but this one I find soaks right into my face without leaving any residue that’s sticky or oily. I can’t tell anything for long term results yet but I would recommend this product so far after using it for 2 weeks! Absorbs well!
