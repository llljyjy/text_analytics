I received this product for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder. I was happy to see that I was receiving this moisturizer! This is exactly what my skin was needing. My T-area tends to become dry and dull, even after I cleanse my face well. My skin type is normal to dry. I made sure to focus on that area with the deluxe sample that I received. After the course of 10 days, the outcome was exactly what I was hoping for. My T-area was firmer and smoother and the moisture was locked in. My skin felt soft and I was very happy with the results! I highly recommend this moisturizer! Moisturizer Love!
