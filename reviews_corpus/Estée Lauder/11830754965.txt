This gel cream texture is smooth, rich but not heavy, spread easily, absorbs well & not greasy.The scent is mild & doesn’t linger. I love how it made under eyes feel smooth & hydrated without being greasy.It also seems to help with puffy tired eyes, though I haven’t use it long enough to see any improvement in fine lines or wrinkles. Smooth & not greasy
