This is a great cream, the texture is incredible gel-like but applies like a cream itâ€™s lovely. It is a bit strong because it did sting me a little bit but I do have sensitive skin and eye area, but it has gotten better with more uses. My eyes look plump and incredible even with just a few uses. I love it! Great eye cream
