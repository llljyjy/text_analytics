I didn’t notice a difference in the darkness under my eyes, at all. It’s much softer under there, but no difference in the dark circles. If I’m paying $70 dollars, I would hope there would be a bit of a difference. If I’m being completely transparent, I didn’t even notice it become firmer. I use a different brand usually, cheaper. That has a better firmness then this. No dark circle help if firmness help
