I tried this out a few times before writing this review and Iâ€™ll tell you I actually like what I got. Light smell, easy to apply very smooth and creamy a little goes a long way. And it helps bright up my dark under eye. It also helps boost my makeup and make it look good. So happy I got to try this for free. Must Add to cart and buy
