I received this product complimentary  from Influenster and Estée Lauder  in exchange for my honest review. I’m having a hard time figuring out how to describe my skin because skin because it’s not been normal for me lately.  I’ve had dry issues and sensitivity issues. Lately oily issues that are new.  I was open to trying this product since essences are generally pretty lightweight.  I don’t usually use toners because they seem a bit drying.This smells nice but this is much too strong of a scent to have on your face.  If you have sensitive eyes like I do you have to be really carefulwhere you’re applying the product. The scent travels pretty far and can sting your eyes.This is labeled as an essence lotion. It’s pretty thick to be an essence and feels like a serum. Is it an essence? A serum?    I’m sad to share that I didn’t notice any positive change at all in my skin.  It dried out the skin on my chin. This just might not be a compatible product for my skin. Not for me.
