Received this as an incentive. Honestly, the sample size was very small. I’m order to give an opinion on improvements seen in skincare, you need at least two weeks minimum of product. This sample size was enough for 3 or 4 days using it at night only not the recommended twice a day. It has a pleasant scent and is very, VERY rich. Of all the moisturizers I’ve tried both drugstore and luxury, this is by far the most amazing consistency. I used this over my serum and tret and it felt so wonderful. Unfortunately, it was short lived as the next day I had zits on my cheek and along my chin. Cringe. I look like a teen who feel asleep on the couch with a greasy pizza on my face. Ughh! I think they have the consistency, smell, feel, application down but there’s something in the formula that must be comedogenic. It’s a shame it didn’t work for my skin, This could’ve been perfect! Wanted to love it..
