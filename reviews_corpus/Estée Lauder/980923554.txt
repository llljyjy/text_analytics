I’ve been using this product for a month on my neck only. The reason why I’m only using it on my neck is because I have oily skin and at night time I need to do anti acne treatment and this is a night time moisturizer. It has helped firm and moisturize my neck substantially. I like all Estee Lauder products and this one is no exception. I highly recommend. Good Product
