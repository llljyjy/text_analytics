Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme Youth Power cream smells fresh and was gentle on my skin. It didn’t feel greasy and absorbed well. It didn’t irritate my occasionally sensitive skin or eyes. A little bit did not go a long way, and i used about a large pearl size on my face and another on my neck. I used it day and night and felt well hydrated while I used it. I’m not sure of the long-term benefits on my skin as the sample size was too small to use it for a significant amount of time. In the time I used it the primary benefit I experienced was hydration. Okay moisturizer
