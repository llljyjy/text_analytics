The product comes in a translucent amber tub with a golden cap. I personally prefer tubes to tubs when it comes to eye creams. I feel it is more sanitary. However, an application tool can be used provided you have one already. The consistency of the product is more like a gel-cream. It applied very smoothly, not surprising given the silicone present in the formula.To keep the review short, I don’t really like it. The formula seems, in my honest opinion to contain too much silicone as the product doesn’t seem to absorb as well as it should have.I didn’t find that it helped alleviate my dark circles as I still had to hide them under my usual conceal and set routine. However, it did help with puffiness. Overall, the product has failed to impress me.Dislikes:•Expensive •Comes in a tub •The formula contains harmful ingredients such as alcohol and silicone •Does not help reduce dark circles and wrinkles •Over promises and under delivers Not for me
