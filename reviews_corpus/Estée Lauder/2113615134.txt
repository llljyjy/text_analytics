I received a free sample of this products for an honest review and used it 2xs a day for almost two weeks.  The cream is on the heavier side, but not too thick where I felt it was suffocating my combo skin.  There was no discernible fragrance and it absorbed easily.  I was happy with the amount of moisture it provided and I think it’s gentle enough for anyone with sensitive skin.  My only reservation is for the price point, I would expect to be a bit more wowed by the product.  I’ve tried many different moisturizers from low end to high end and there was nothing about this one that stood out as super special compared to others.  I would happily use it again, but it’s one that I can easily forget as well. Good Everyday Moisturizer
