I recommend the Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair eye creme. This is a gel and glides on so smooth for the under eye. It is very hydrating and even though it is a night cream it absorbs nicely into the skin and can be used during the day also. I have been using this for 4 weeks now and my under eyes look more awake and it has helped with my fine lines. Smooth and Hydrating
