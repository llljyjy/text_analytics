This added a nice amount of hydration, however didn’t do much. I don’t usually use an eye cream and just use my normal moisturizer instead. This had a little more of a ’slippery’ feeling when it went on. I would keep it to night use. It didn’t do anything additional for me than my regular moisturizer. It’s a nice added step if you want to add it into your routine but not necessary. Not A Necessity
