I have enjoyed the sample I received from Influenster and Estée Lauder to try and review. It has such a light consistency- like water- that it absorbs so fast and hydrates. It has really helped my semi dry skin and I think my pores have looked smaller. I am glad it’s not oily or thick. I haven’t noticed any difference in my crows feet though so it lost a star.
