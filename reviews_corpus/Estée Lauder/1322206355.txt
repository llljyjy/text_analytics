I noticed immediate results after using the youth creme. My skin felt  hydrated and blended beautiful with my foundation. Unfortunately,  I did not notice a difference on my fine line and wrinkles. I recommend this product to help the winter skincare blues. This product is best for people that struggle with winter dry skin. The cream’s silky, exceptionally fine texture offers optimal comfort without leaving a greasy film. This product has a beautiful whipped cream texture but provides instant hydration once applied.The price point is affordable and the product can be purchased online or in the department store. The creme has a slight fragrance but it’s not overwhelming. If you’re struggling with dry skin this product is a must have. Supreme Youth Power Creme: Skincare Must Have
