I received a free sample of this moisturizer from Influenster. I liked it for the short time I used it. I didn’t find it too heavy, it layered nicely, and didn’t have too strong of a smell. However, the sample wasn’t large enough to test for a long period of time, so I wasn’t able to see a huge noticeable difference while using it. nan
