This cream is THICK! But not creamy..it’s surprisingly almost gel-like and melts in like a gel so I didn’t think I would like it because of that, but surprisingly do. It absorbs quickly and isn’t sticky. It lays well and discreetly under makeup. I can’t tell if it’s doing anything to be honest, but I’ll continue using it. nan
