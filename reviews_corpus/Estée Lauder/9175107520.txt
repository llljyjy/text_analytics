I have been using this cream for a couple weeks now. Its a lightweight gel texture its very hydrating doesnâ€™t leave a greasy feeling absorbes nicely into the skin. Its made huge difference with the puffiness in the morning. I wish I would have taken a before and after picture because I noticed that my undereyes have also gotten brighter. Overall I love it but it is very pricey. nan
