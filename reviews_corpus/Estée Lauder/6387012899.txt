I really liked this moisturizer and could definitely see and feel the effects after using it. My only concern, and deterrent from purchasing is the price. Given the iconic and trustworthy Estee’ Lauder name, it’s no surprise that it would be pricey, however in my opinion the price is still quite steep for a moisturizer. The consistency is nice though and it isn’t oily like some. I also prefer to have my moisturizers in a jar instead of a tube so that’s a plus for me. Ultimately, if I could afford it, I liked this moisturizer enough to buy it but for now, it’s just too pricey for me. Nice but pricey
