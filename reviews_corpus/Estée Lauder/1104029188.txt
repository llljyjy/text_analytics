I was excited to receive a mini sample size of this moisturizer from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have combination skin that tends to be on the dryer side as I get older. I immediately liked the cream to gel- like the texture of this moisturizer which absorbed quickly but did not leave a greasy residue. I also instantly noticed the immediate softness of my skin texture after applying. My skin felt so buoyant and even my pores looked a bit more refined and more clear after continued use. My only slight complaint is the scent is very strong for a daily moisturizer. But the scent is not unpleasant but it does remind me of a rose perfume. I would recommend this product to someone who is looking for hydration and softness as well as increased clarity. Surprisingly effective
