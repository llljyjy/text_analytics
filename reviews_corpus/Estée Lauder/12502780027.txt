I received this product for win exchange for my review. I really liked it! It doesn’t have a fragrance- which I love because I have pretty sensitive skin. I had no bad reactions to the formula. My eyes loo refreshed and hydrated in the morning. This is probably my favorite eye cream that I’ve tried so far. The consistency is thick and a little goes a long way nan
