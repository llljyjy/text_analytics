I love the texture of this gel. It feels cool to the touch and glides on smoothly and gently. My under eye area feels refreshing after using this product. It’s not sticky or heavy. While I haven’t seen any results other than some minor depuffing, I would still recommend this product to others for a gentle fragrance free eye gel. nan
