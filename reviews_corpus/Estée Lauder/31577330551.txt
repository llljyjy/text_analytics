I was given a free sample in exchange for a review of the product and since the sample was enough for just 2 applications this is what I CAN confirm:It does not have a strong fragrance, nor a bad one.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and not at all oily.  It sits well under makeup. Things I can NOT confirm:Whether it firms, lifts,  or provides added radiance. To be fair I never expect results after just 2 applications so I’m not saying it won’t do these things, simply that I can not determine that with what I was given. From what I can tell...
