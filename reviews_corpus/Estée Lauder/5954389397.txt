I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. wow,they aren’t kidding when they say indulgent. the texture of this moisturizer is socomforting to my skin. it’s thick but very smooth and a little goes a long way,which makes it last a while. it’s a bit pricey, but you’re paying for theluxuriousness of estee lauder. i use moisturizer every day, and because my skintends to be dry i am always on the lookout for really nourishing products thathelp with dryness and everything that’s caused by having dry skin that isn’tcared for properly. the wrinkles and dullness, especially.. this works right awayas i could see radiance as soon as i used it, and each time i put it on. I need totry a bigger size and see just how amazing results are after an extended time.the one thing i could go without is the scent, though it miraculously doesn’tirritate or bother my skin or eyes at all and the scent doesn’t seem to last. it’sdefinitely not a deal-breaker.
