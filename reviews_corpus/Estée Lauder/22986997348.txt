I received a free trial of this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I constantly stay up late and don’t expect this product to work miracles over my bad habits. However, I did notice that my eyes were significantly less puffy and dry when using this item. The dark circles are still there but the bags are noticeably less prominent. The texture is gel like, so a little goes a long way and it is very easy to apply. I noticed results after two weeks, and my eyes definitely felt moisturized immediately after using it. Although I saw results, it is a little pricey in my opinion. I wouldn’t recommend it unless you REALLY hate your bags/puffy eyes because the price is a bit costly for the difference I saw and you’d likely have to use it for much longer than I have been. Kind of works but a little pricey
