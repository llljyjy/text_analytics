I have very oily skin, especially in summer when itâ€™s so hot.  This cream may be good, but personally it does not suit me.  Because the cream has a heavy moisturizing texture.  I usually look for something lighter and weightless.  I can not use it day or night because of the hot summer period.  Perhaps in the winter it will be more comfortable.  Perfect for mature skin that needs deep nourishment and hydration. Not for hot summer season
