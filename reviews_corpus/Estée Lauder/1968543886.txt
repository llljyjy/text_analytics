Queen of all eye creams. I received the Advanced Night Repair Eye Gel as a gift from Influenster for my honest opinion and I’m obsessed. The gel is light weight and easy to apply. I have been using it under my makeup for day and I apply it before bed. A little goes a long way and I use it all over even on my lids. I love that it hydrates, plumps, smooths, and breaks up the dark circles. I’m telling all my friends and family about this holy grail product. I can see a difference in just the one month I’ve been using it. queen of eye cream
