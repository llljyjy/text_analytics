I received this eye gel-cream complimentary for my honest review from Influenster and Estée Lauder . I was using a basic cream under my eyes before and found it too heavy. This gel-cream formula is perfect and unique for under the eyes. The texture is soft and smooth going on and I love how it makes my eyes feel. I’ve been using this for about two weeks and adding this product to my wishlist to purchase a full size because it is literally the BEST eye gel-cream I have used under my eyes. I have very sensitive under eye and prone to getting milia, this product has actually reduced those little annoying bumps I had from my previous eye cream. I would run and get this if you have undereyes like mine! One of the best eye creams I've used!
