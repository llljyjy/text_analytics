I received a sample from Influenster to try. I am very pale and have genetic dark circles, which isn’t anything you can fix. This product was no exception. That said, it has a gel formula that is unique and does feel like it does a good job hydrating. It applies smoothly and feels moisturizing. I’ve been using it for over a month now. Some days my dark circles feel minimal, and other times, they’re still very apparent. It’s hard to say if this really helps brighten up the undereye area. I do think it works well as an eye cream, but don’t know that it’s necessarily worth the price. nan
