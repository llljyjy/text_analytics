I was a bit let down at how small it was when I received it but then I remembered how Estee Lauder products go a long way. Twice a day I used a pea size dab on my face. Three small one each time. Doing that lead me to use this product for a month before needing more. Not bad for a .17 fl oz container. So much was packed in such a small package. The hydration is perfect given the cold months hitting and drying my skin out more. This product feels like spring on my face. Moisture is no longer an issue. As for the wrinkle aspect I didnâ€™t see much change. I did see a change in my skin over all. It looks smoother, more radiant with a brighter glow. I felt a bit younger after using this product for a few weeks. The price is decent but at the cost I would only use it once a day instead of twice. Small package, big results.
