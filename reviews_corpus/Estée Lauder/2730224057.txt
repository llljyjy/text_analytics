decent eye creamoverall i like this eye cream. i received it fortesting a couple months ago and have beenusing it regularly at night. i like the texture - its alittle more sticky, gel consistency which i like.haven’t noticed any significant difference, butnever really do with eye creams (shrug) i will saythat if i’m not careful with application, it will stingmy eyes a little bit. i just make sure to be extragentle. overall it’s fine for a nightly eye cream nan
