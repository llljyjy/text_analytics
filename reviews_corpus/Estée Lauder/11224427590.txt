I received this through influenster to give my honest review. I wanted to wait two weeks to give my review. After using I am loving it. The consistency is something I love when looking for an eye cream. I tend to enjoy the gel like eye creams over the lotion ones. My skin seems to “suck” them up more. A little goes a very long way for this so while I received a smaller size of the product.. i will get lots of uses.  The ingredients impressed me and feel great when applied. I notice an instant plumpness when using. It’s very refreshing! I enjoy this and would like to repurchase. Will be repurchasing!
