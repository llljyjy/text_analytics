This product was very easy to apply and had no bad smell to it. I have dry skin and problems with firmness and this has started to help alot. I’m sure once I use it for a prolonged period it’ll have even better results.I received this product in exchange for my honest review and let me tell you I love Estee lauder products because this brand just never seems to let me down no matter how skeptical I may be at first. Ive TRIED finding a new moisturizer to go to as my everyday product and none were even close to this one.i am a customer for life now . It keeps my skin smooth and doesn’t leave a sticky residue on it it makes it easier to put my .akeup on and amm the while it helps my aging process by containing crows feet and fine lines you won’t be disappointed! Gotta have it
