I received a sample from Influenster, and as some one who used to use Estée products every day, I was really excited. Estée Lauder creams are amazing. They’re smooth, rich, luxurious and they do an excellent job of hydrating my dry skin. My one complaint: fragrance. There’s something in the fragrance they use that as I’ve gotten older, makes me get little rashes of pimples after a few days. I realize that not everyone who uses fragrance in their skincare breaks out, but that’s one thing that has driven me to avoid Estée Lauder facial creams. I hope that some day they will make a fragrance-free line and then, sign me up. Ditch the fragrance and it would be perfect
