Feels luxuriously creamy and smells expensive. Like, I have my own private jet and a trophy boyfriend expensive. Loved how it felt on my face on the dry Colorado winter. Unfortunately it broke me out. I have sensitive skin. So Iâ€™ve been using it on my neck and collarbone instead. Those places age too! Maximum hydration, luxe scent
