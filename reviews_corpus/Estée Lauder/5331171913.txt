I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. But I’m saying that I really enjoyed this product. It comes on light and was absorbed fast with a few gentle taps.  I didn’t feel like it sat on my skin or was was too heavy. I really liked that it does not have a strong smell.  After the first use I noticed a difference.  My eyes looked less tired and my face was brighter.  I have recommended this to many friends and family. Bright eyes!
