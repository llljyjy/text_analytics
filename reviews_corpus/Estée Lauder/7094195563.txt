I use eye cream for my self-care routine, I honestly havenâ€™t felt a great difference from the multiple brands of eye cream, day or night, using it or not. This is a lightweight eye cream that didnt create fat granules around my eye. I have been using this product for almost a month and I havent felt a difference in either its brightening or line-reducing effects. I believe there is some fragrance to this product, it is very light, but if you have sensitive skin already, i would recommend look elsewhere. Das is expensive
