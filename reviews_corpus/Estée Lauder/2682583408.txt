This left my skin feeling very clean and soft. I used it after toner, before moisturizer. It’s a nice light moisturizer essence. My skin is oily and this didn’t make it worse. However, not sure I would repurchase at the price point, it’s a little expensive for me and I don’t love it over others I’ve tried that are more affordable. nan
