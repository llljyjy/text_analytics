I know they are a good brand, but I really don’t like anything about this product.  I don’t like jars that you have to dip your fingers into. To me it seems like the circles under my eyes returned when I switched to this product.  I don’t like that it’s a gel that seems to just sit on top of my skin and looks greasy instead of a cream that soaks into the skin.  After the 30 day trial I through out the jar.  I would not recommend. Not a fan
