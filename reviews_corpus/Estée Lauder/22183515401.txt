I love this Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ moisturizer. My skin feels much more moisturized, hydrated, and soft. I noticed a bit more firmness as well. The cream isnâ€™t heavy or too greasy, and it absorbs into my skin completely. I can even wear it under my makeup. I have combination skin, that leans more towards the drier side, and this moisturizer works great for me! I highly recommend!! Such a luxurious cream! Luxurious feeling!
