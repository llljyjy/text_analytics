This product was sent to me from Influenster to test it out. I don’t take these kinds of reviews lightly. Moisturizers, and any skincare product for that matter, need to be well studied and used on a regular basis for more than a day to be able to talk about them. So that’s what I did. I spent a month or so using the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme to make sure I could give a truthful and accurate opinion. I used it everyday after a good face wash and I have to say, I am pleasantly surprised with the results. My skin feels healthier and definitely smoother. The packaging, as usual for this brand, is impeccable and luxurious. The moisturizer does not have a really strong smell, which is perfect for me. It goes easily on your skin and it seems to be absorbed pretty quickly, so it doesn’t feel super sticky after you’re done with your daily skincare ritual. One tip: if you like to use dermaplane razors, do it once a week and put the cream right after that and it makes your skin feel extra smooth. All in all, a great experience. Definitely recommend it. Honestly amazing!
