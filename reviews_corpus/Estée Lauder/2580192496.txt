I’m a huge advocate of essence in my skin care routine! I feel like it is such an important step for my serum to soak in. I’m obsessed with the fermented factor of this essence! It works really well for hydration. I noticed I can often skip my serum step when I use this product! My skin feels and looks so much healthier, plump, and vibrant! I love this Essence and highly recommend it! nan
