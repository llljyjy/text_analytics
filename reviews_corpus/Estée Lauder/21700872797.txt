I received a complimentary sample of this Hydrating Treatment from Influenster. Sadly the sample is so tiny itâ€™s hard to really give this product an efficient test and determine just how well it works over time. It has a nice rose scent and did leave my skin feeling hydrated. Would have loved to atleast given the product atleast 2 weeks of use to truly see the results. Nice scent but tiny sample
