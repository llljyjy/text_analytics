I received a sample of this product complimentary from Estee Lauder for my honest review.I appreciated the tinted bottle so that light does not cause it to sour. Unfortunately the perfume scent of the product was still very noticeable after trying it multiple times and this deterred me from using it further. I am sure if I could get past this it would be an enjoyable product as I have bought and used many Estee Lauder products in the past and loved them all! I will likely try again because the claims of skin lifted and glowing effects has me intrigued! Scented product
