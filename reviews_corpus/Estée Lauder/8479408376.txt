I received this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I loved that this product doesn’t have a heavy fragrance and has a clean smell. I did notice minimal decrease in my under eye crease which I was happy about. My main reasoning for 4 stars opposed to 5 is that I’m not sure the product is worth the price for the minimal benefits. nan
