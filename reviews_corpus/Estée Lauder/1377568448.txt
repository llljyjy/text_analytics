I love the way this feels on my skin. It is very hydrating, which is important for reducing the look of lines. It doesn’t feel greasy on my skin. I use it all over my eye, because I have issues with dark circles under and in my inner corner and my lids themselves need hydration. While I can’t say it cured my dark circles, I do love how this feels on my eyes. Feels amazing
