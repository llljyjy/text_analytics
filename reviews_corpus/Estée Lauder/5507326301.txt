I received Soft Clean Infusion for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. The product is heavily scented but the fragrance doesn’t last long when layering skincare products. It felt like it gave me a boost of hydration and made my skin feel soft. I thought it was nice but maybe not for everyone. Nice hydration
