I don’t really have many wrinkles but I do have dark circles and this cream definitely reduces those! I like that it’s lightweight and i also noticed a subtle scent which I very much enjoy as I’m a big fan of scented skincare, and this one is not overpowering at all, barely noticeable but still nice. I applied this product at night before bed, once a day because I have oily skin and my skin doesn’t react too good to anti aging skincare products. But my mom is older with oily skin and she adores this product. Super recommended if you want to reduce fine lines and dark circles! High quality!
