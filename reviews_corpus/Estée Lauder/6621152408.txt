I received a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes complimentary from Influenster. I was not a fan of this product. It was heavily scented and irritated my skin. I didn’t notice any hydrating benefits after using it completely up for 2 weeks. I just couldn’t get past the floral scent, it made my skin itchy and red. After a while that sensation went away but I just did not like it. It also felt sticky on my skin as well. I don’t have sensitive skin so I’m not sure why this irritated my skin. nan
