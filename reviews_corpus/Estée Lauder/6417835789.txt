I received this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. This eye gel-crème has a really nice smooth texture. I used it in place of my regular eye cream and can honestly see a difference. It helps brighten and make you look like you got a good nights sleep. It has a very nice texture, super creamy with no tacky feel! After about 30 seconds of patting it in it turns into a sueded texture/ feel. It absorbs nicely. My skin feels nicely hydrated the next morning. I would buy this. Very Nice
