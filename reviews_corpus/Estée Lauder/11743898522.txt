I have really enjoyed using this cream and have been using it almost daily before work. It is a small container but it has lasted me a while because I apply only a small amount to my cheeks and around the eye area and it’s crazy how smooth and bright it makes your skin! Also, great moisture without the greasiness and it is lightweight on the skin. I’m almost out and will be purchasing a larger container ASAP! Soo good
