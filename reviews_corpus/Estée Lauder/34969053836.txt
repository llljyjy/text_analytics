I’ve been using this lovely cream for a while; I love the creamy, luxurious texture & the sumptuous fragrance. It’s emollient but not greasy, & I can use it in the AM during winter & PM in any season. There’s just something about smoothing it on that makes me feel special! I use it whenever I need that little boost. I do feel like it temporarily covers fine lines and skin texture due to the dimethicone in the product. It keeps in moisture all day and does well under makeup. Lovely Luxurious Cream
