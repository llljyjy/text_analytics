Small but mighty moisturizer! Doesn’t take a lot to get results. 2 weeks of use and my skin is glowing and fine lines around eyes and mouth aren’t as noticeable. Not a strong fragrance which is a major bonus. I wear it under light makeup and go on about my day without any hiccups, I could see myself purchasing this if it was a little less pricey.
