I received this product complementary in exchange for my honest review. That being said, this is my new favorite eye cream of all time. I rarely go and purchase new products (I stick to my favorites), but I actually went and bought this one in the full size jar. I love it. It’s hydrating, plumping and not tacky or sticky. The cream is more of a gel consistently and goes on so smooth. I can put it under makeup and there is no caking. A little bit goes a long way too!! My dark circles under my have diminished and I’m really looking forward to seeing more benefits as I use it long term. Highly recommend!! My new favorite!
