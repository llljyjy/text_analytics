I’ve been using this gel creme for a little over a month and have been LOVING my results. It’s an oily girl’s dream. I love the smooth, creamy texture.  It blends and absorbs into the skin very easily. A little goes a long way without leaving my skin feeling greasy or oily. I have noticed a difference in puffiness and slight improvement in dark circles. I also think my makeup has been applying easier from the added hydration. I have been strictly applying this at night, but I read that it can be used in AM and PM, so I will be doing that from here on out. I think this is a product that would be even more refreshing if popped in the frig. Definitely recommend! LOVE
