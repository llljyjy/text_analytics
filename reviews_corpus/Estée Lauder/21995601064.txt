I really wanted to love this but it was just ok. It is a very thick cream but itâ€™s not oily or greasy feeling. It almost dries down to a matte finish on my skin. I have very dry skin so I prefer a heavier more hydrating cream. I feel like this is better suited for combo oily skin. I received a small sample so was only able to use for a few days but I did feel like my face was a lot more tight and plump especially under my eyes. nan
