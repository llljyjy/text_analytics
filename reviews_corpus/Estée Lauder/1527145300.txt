I received this product for free for my honest review from Influenster.I was honestly not expecting to like the Estēe Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ as much as I did. I have a pretty strict skincare regimen, however I still have a scow brow and forehead lines that peak. The is where the Revitalizing Supreme+ gets utilized the most!I feel like the creme has a long lasting moisture, that plumps the skin while it’s at it. A definite plus! I will forewarn that this does have a scent, so if you are easily bothered I would refrain from purchasing. Not disappointed!
