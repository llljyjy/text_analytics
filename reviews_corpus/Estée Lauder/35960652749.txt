Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme + is very hydrating and smells great when applied. I love the fact that you need a small amount like a choco chip or a Pea size cream in your hands to hydrate your entire face. I definitely recommend this product And I’m in love with it. Hydration that lasts all day
