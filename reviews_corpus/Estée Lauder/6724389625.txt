I really like this moisturizer. I received free productfrom Influenster in exchange for my honest review.Iwould purchase this product, and would recommendto a friend. I have combination skin with fine lines andsome patches of super dry areas at times. Thisproduct was great at providing a lasting feeling ofhydration, esp when skin was feeling extra dry. Itdoesn’t feel too heavy or greasy. Scent is pleasantand not too overwhelming. I felt like the product soaksinto skin well and doesn’t feel sticky or make skin feeloily. Dry patches improved with use. I didn’t noticedifference with fine lines for the time I tried product,but I feel like over an extended period of time they may some improvement. I use moisturizer daily, I would use this one daily. I would especially use daily when skin is more dry in winter months. Would recommend
