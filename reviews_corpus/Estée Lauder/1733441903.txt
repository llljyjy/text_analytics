This was a surprisingly thick cream that didnâ€™t feel heavy on the skin.  It was surprisingly lightweight feeling for something that creamy.  I really enjoyed the feel of it on my skin and it provided the exact right moisture level.  I loved the cream.  The only reason it is 4 instead of 5 stars is because it was heavily perfumed.  The scent was a bit strong for me.  Otherwise it was fabulous. Great cream but too heavily fragranced
