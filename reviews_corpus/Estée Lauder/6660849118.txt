I received these products for free from Influenster and brand(s) in exchange for my honest review. I have combination skin, but more on the drier side. For the most part, only concern is dark spots and the typical here and there breakout. I use a hydrating moisturizer twice a day as part of my skin routine. Typically, been using Glow Recipe; however, I tried this sample and liked the thickness of it and how soft my skin felt after applying it. Because of the thickness, I preferred to use it at nighttime only. Next few days after using, I felt hydrated, plumped and with a nice natural glow. I use some products from this brand for skincare purposes, and Iâ€™m yet to be dissatisfied with any of them. Feels good on the skin
