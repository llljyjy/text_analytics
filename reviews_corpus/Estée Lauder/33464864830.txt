This is the first eye cream I’ve used and I’m glad this was my introduction because now it’s a staple. I don’t enjoy an skincare routine but I’m in my early thirties so unfortunately it’s time to tackle it. This eye cream is a delight to put on! It’s so silky and there is no greasy residue or scent. It makes my eye area feel so smooth and I’ve noticed reduced lines and no dark circles under my eyes while using this product. I highly recommend this eye cream! I received this product free from Influenster and Estée Lauder. nan
