This product goes on really well and it is very rich and moisturizing.  It may be a little heavy if you don’t need that type of moisture, but is great for dry skin.  I don’t love the fragrance in estee lauder products though so I won’t be purchasing the full size, but it could be great for others! Rich, lightly fragranced
