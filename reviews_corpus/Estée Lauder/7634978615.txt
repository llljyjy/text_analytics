I love this product. Everyone says that the ingredients individually aren’t worth the money, but there is something about the formula as a whole and they were right. I have an extensive skincare routine with and high and low end products. I will add one product at a time to see if I want to repurchase or not, I definitely will be. I don’t have problem skin, but I’m 38 and my skin is starting to not be so firm and is dry in the winter. When I use this I wake with firm and glowing skin. It is also very hydrating and sometimes I will use during the day as well. It may not be worth the money if you are in your 20s, but if you are in your late 30s I definitely recommend it. nan
