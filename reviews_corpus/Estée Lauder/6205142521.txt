I received this product as a free sample. There is a slight fragrance to it that I love. It isn’t too over powering. I applied this as directed and I could noticeably see the lines under my eyes reducing. I haven’t seen any of the darkness around my eyes start to vanish yet. But over all I enjoy this product. Worth buying
