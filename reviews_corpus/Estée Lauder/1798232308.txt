I have received this product in return for a comprehensive review. Been using this product for almost a month since receiving it. It’s a great product for normal to combo skin types. I fit that category and I must say, it works well for the most part, pretty thick for use during the day for me. May work  better during the night time routine when used. With that said, it has a nice pleasant scent not too overpowering, almost like you’re in a spa. It’s my first ever Estée Lauder product and it did not disappoint. Provided the moisture and protection needed for the day. I’d purchase it when it’s more the fall/winter time as that is when I am more combo/dry. Works well during the fall/winter tome
