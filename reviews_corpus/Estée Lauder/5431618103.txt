Received this product for free for my honest review. First off the texture is exactly a mix between a serum and a cream, lightweight and quickly absorbed. Donâ€™t need to use a lot, it spreads well. My skin feels soft and subtle after using it, looking forward to some long term benefits of my fine lines. As always, a great product from Estee Lauder! Would recommend as a nightly treatment to keep your eyes looking bright. nan
