I received a sample size of this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I was excited to try this out as my skin has been feeling extra dry this summer. Unfortunately, I didn’t love the scent and it felt so heavy on my skin. Even though I only used a small amount, I ended up with some breakouts shortly after beginning to use this product. It was too heavy for me and didn’t do anything positive for my skin. nan
