I received a sample of this product from Influenster that I have been using for weeks now. I use it in the am, and it blends nicely into the skin. It doesnâ€™t feel greasy or clog my pores. I noticed a decrease in the number of fine lines that I have. My skin soft and moisturized. It looks youthful and radiant. The packaging is sleek and cute. I definitely recommend! I will continue to use this product to see the long term benefits. I would have given five stars, but I do not like the scent. Youthful skin!
