I received this product as a free trial and was impressed by the results I had after a month of using it. I have concerns about my skin aging and under my chin has started to loosen and this product really helped. I would have liked it to go on smoother and didn’t seem to notice much scent to it but my skin looks and feels tighter and less dry. I don’t normally use Estée Lauder products but will be adding this to my skin care regime to continue with these great results. Surprising results
