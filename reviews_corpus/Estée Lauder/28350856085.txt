I have dry skin and overall, I liked this product. It has a nice scent, the packaging is cute, and it absorbed pretty quickly. The consistency is similar to that of a serum and I applied it before my moisturizer. I didn’t have any sort of negative reaction to it which is always a plus. I can’t say that I noticed any super noticeable results other than my skin feeling more hydrated but I understand that to experience real results requires consistent use, sometimes for months. All in all, it’s a good product. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. nan
