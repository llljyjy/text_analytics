I received a sample of this product from Estee Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  This Youth Power Creme is very moisturizing. I have dry, breakout prone skin so long lasting moisture is something I look for in a product, which this does offer. My skin was soft for hours after use,  if a bit sticky to the touch.  The downside is I did notice a few spots of breakouts or irritation, as if it didn’t agree with my sensitive skin,  so if this is one of your concerns as well I’d exercise caution in checking out the ingredients, as it definitely contains many.  I didn’t see any anti aging benefits but the sample was far too small for long term use. Moisturizing,  but tricky for sensitive skin.
