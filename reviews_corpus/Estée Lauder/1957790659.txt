I love ANR but I haven’t been a huge fan of other Lauder products.  This one I’m actually in love with.  It’s a nice creamy texture not too sticky.  Light scent compared to what I’m used to with Lauder.  In the last few days I’ve used this cream I’ve noticed my skins feels softer.  It’s also not irritating my sensitive skin by causing a rash or breakout.  Loving it so far. Perfect Texture
