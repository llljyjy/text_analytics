I received a small sample of this cream from Influenster to review. I think the sample was a bit small to test itâ€™s anti aging properties. However, so far I really like how it is feeling on my skin. Works wells with my combo skin - enough moisture for the stubborn dry parts. But not too much or clogging my more oily parts. I plan on purchasing a regular size one to truly test the anti aging claims. Nice cream
