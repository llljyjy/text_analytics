I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love the consistency of the cream - it’s not too heavy or light/ it feels very soothing when you put it on almost refreshing. It has a very slight scent that isn’t too bothersome. My skin feels instantly hydrated and super soft. I definitely would buy. Creamy and Moisturizing!
