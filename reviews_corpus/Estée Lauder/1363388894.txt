I’ve used this alone and with my serums. I probably wouldn’t use as a stand-alone product but it works awesome with my serums by locking in everything. I have oily/combination skin and normally have to blot by the late afternoon. I’ve noticed that I haven’t had to do this when used with my serums and my skin stays hydrated all day. I received a free trial of this product. Awesome skin all day
