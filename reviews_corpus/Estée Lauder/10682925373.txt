I received this product for review. I have used this for almost a month and wow! It is moisturizing without being heavy and really leaves my skin feeling nice and soft. The only issue I have with this product is the smell, but I am willing to overlook it due to the fact that my skin feels so nice! Daywear Estee Lauder
