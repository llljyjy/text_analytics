I received this product in exchange for my honest review from Influenster and Estée Lauder. It’s nice and refreshing, it does smell strongly of roses though or water Lilly, aslo it’s thick and feels like it needs to be washed off. Although, those are the only two bad qualities. The infusion for your face makes it soft and glowing. Great
