I received a complimentary sample of this product in exchange for my unbiased review. I am so impressed with this eye cream. I love the texture - it’s a lightweight gel cream that doesn’t feel heavy or greasy at all. I’ve been using it for weeks and haven’t had an milia or bumps under my eyes. As for results, my under eye area is visibly more hydrated and somewhat brightened. Results haven’t been dramatic but I’ve noticed some improvement. This eye cream is good enough to repurchase for sure. nan
