I love how hydrating this crème is. The scent is lovely but if you are sensitive to scents, I would pass on this. The scent can be a little strong, but if you can get past it, It provides some great moisture. It’s a very thick crème.my skin definitely feels much firmer. Hope they can make some unscented stuff Wish it was unscented
