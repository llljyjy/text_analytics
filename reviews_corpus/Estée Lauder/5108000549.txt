I liked this product for day use as it is moisturizing, not too thick, and has a good SPF level (especially important for my rosacea to avoid flares). The product says to use in the PM too, however because of the SPF and the sunscreen scent I’d prefer to limit it to daytime use. Overall a good AM choice for those hoping to get sun protection and aren’t super scent sensitive. nan
