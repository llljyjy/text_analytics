I have been using various eye creams/gels/serums for several years. This one exceeded my expectations, but I wanted to give it a fair shot before reviewing. From the first week, I noticed a big change in my undereyes! They are much brighter and moisturized. I didnâ€™t notice a huge difference in my fine lines, but waking up without big, dark, puffy bags under my eyes is wonderful! I definitely recommend! A little goes a long way! So good!
