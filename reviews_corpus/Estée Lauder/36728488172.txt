It gave me, my life back, aren’t you curious what it can do for you? This creme made it possible for me to look in the mirror again, or my life back. I could actually feel the eye cream working with the very first application. The skin around my eyes felt chilled and refreshed, it was a great feeling. My eyes had dark circles, wrinkles, was sagging, and dull. My eyes were rough. I could not stand looking in the mirror which is not the case anymore. My eyes look and feel fantastic. This crème is light weight, smooth, silky, and does not really have a smell. The crème doesn’t make your face oily or leave any kind of residue.With this Advanced Night Repair Crème you have not to loose and everything to gain. I received the Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-Crème for free from Estée Lauder and influenster in exchange for my complete an honest review. Best eye creme ever
