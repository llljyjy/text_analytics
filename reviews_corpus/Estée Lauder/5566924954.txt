I love the Estée LauderAdvanced Night Repair Eye Gel-Cream. It feels so silky and smooth. I tried it over two weeks and saw fewer dark circles and fine lines. It does not have a greasy feel to it like others do. It soaks in right away. Use it sparingly because it doesn’t take much to work. I definitely recommend it. My New Favorite Eye Cream
