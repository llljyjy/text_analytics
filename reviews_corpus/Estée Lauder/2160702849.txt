This cream is not too watery and not too thick. Itâ€™s just the right consistency. I like that it is moisturizing. I use it at night and I am able to put on makeup the next morning without worrying about my dry skin showing. I feel that my skin feels plumper and more dewy. It has a barely noticeable scent that is pleasant. Lovely moisturizer
