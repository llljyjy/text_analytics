I received this product “Incentivized“ free from influenster for my honest review. Overall it’s a good product for moisturizing. It feels firming but that’s more from the consistency of the product than anything.I wish this was a little thinner to last longer than maybe it might be worth the price point. I received .17oz. Of this which lasted maybe a week if you use it once a day and the most minimal amount possible. Great if you have $98 for a moisturizer
