The Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair is an incredible eye cream! I tend to have dry under eye and have been on the search for a cream that is both hydrating and helps with firming. It’s consistency is a gel and is very cooling. It leaves your skin refreshed and doesn’t feel sticky or oily. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and can tell my under eye looks more lifted and smoother. I I highly recommend. Excited to see more results as I continue to use. Both Hydrating and Cooling!
