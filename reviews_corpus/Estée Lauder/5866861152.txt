Great moisturizer, skin felt hydrated without feeling heavy and oily. Don’t know if it’s worth the money, would have to try for a longer period of time before I could speak to treatment of fine lines. Overall left skin with a nice glow. Definitely going to keep using and see if I notice more long term results. nan
