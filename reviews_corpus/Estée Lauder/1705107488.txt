I’m not sure I’ve noticed changes to my fine lines and wrinkles after using this Estée Lauder moisturizer for the past week, morning and evening as directed, but I’ve enjoyed using this product because it leaves my combination skin, dryer in winter, feeling well moisturized. This creme is a little thicker than the other products I used prior to this one, but it absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave my skin feeling heavy. I can put on makeup soon after moisturizing. I’m sensitive to scents and immediately noticed the perfumed scent of this product, but am happy to report that it has not caused any allergic reaction or even extra sneezing, as some other scented products do.
