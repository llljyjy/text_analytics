Ester Lauder is one of my most favorite brands when it comes to skin care ! I have always used it night eye serum and night moisturizer! When I got an opportunity to try this new supreme + I was super excited.. as always it din not disappoint! Within a couple of days use I was very easily able to see the great results! My skin looks radiant and bright ! And I love how there creams are not too heavy leaving skin oily looking .. always recommend ! love it
