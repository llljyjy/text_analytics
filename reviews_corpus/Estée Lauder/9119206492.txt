I got to try out this Advanced Night Repair Eye Gel-Crème by Estēe Lauder and so far I’ve really enjoyed using it. Even with the small amount I got, it has lasted me quite a while because you really don’t need much when applying it. A little at night and in the morning. I love the consistency of it, the blend of crème and gel feels really nice. It’s definitely been helping out with the dark circles too! Refreshing Eye Gel-Creme
