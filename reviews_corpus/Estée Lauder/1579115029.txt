I received this product as a free sample to try. I loved the consistency that was between a gel and a lotion. I used this nightly for 9 nights and noticed that my under eyes looked less wrinkly and sagging. This provided a lot of moisture without being irritating. I would definitely purchase this in the future. Very moisturizing without irritation
