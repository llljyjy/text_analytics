I usually don’t like using eye creams because I didn’t like the product consistency or they would absorb well, BUT this eye cream was great. It had a jelly like formula and absorbed really well. It felt very moisturizing. I recieved only a very small sample size to try out in exchange for reviewing the product but the small jar has lasted longer that I expected. So with the full size jar I can only assume that it would last a while which is always a plus when splurging on nice things! Best eye cream
