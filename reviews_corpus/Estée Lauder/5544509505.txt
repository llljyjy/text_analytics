I love this eye cream. I received it from influenster for my honest review and I have nothing bad to say about it. It goes on so smooth and absorbs well into skin. I haven’t been using it long enough to know if it has done anything for my fine lines but I definitely think it is helping keep them at bay. It is kinda small in size, but you really don’t need a lot. I dab my finger in it, rub two fingers together and then apply to both eyes from that one dab. So a little goes a long way. I highly recommend giving it a try. nan
