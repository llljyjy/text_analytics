I received a trial size. I used this twice daily for almost a month so a little goes a long way. It felt cooling and comfortable going on. No sticky residue.my eyes felt hydrated. I’m not sure I saw any difference in my lines or dark circles, but I’m not sure I’ve seen that with any eye cream. That said, I would use this again if I got a sale, but it’s but pricey for my general use. Felt nice but no change
