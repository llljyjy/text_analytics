After using this for several weeks it has made my skin feel more hydrated, but I can see little difference with the fine lines.  It goes on smooth and the smell isn’t too strong.  It hasn’t irritated my sensitive skin so that is a major plus.  I would probably purchase a larger jar to see what results I get after longer usage. nan
