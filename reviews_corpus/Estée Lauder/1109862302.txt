This is a good eye dream that definitely smooths and hydrates the eye area. The texture is on the heavier side, but since this is intense for nighttime use it’s ok.My issue with this product is the price point - I would happily finish this product, but there are eye creams that are just as good for a fraction of the price. I would also prefer if this came in a tube/pump container so I don’t have to use a spatula. nan
