I received a sample of this product free from Estée Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love this eye gel-crème! It truly is more of a gel than a cream, but it is much more moisturizing than a traditional eye cream. With my previous eye creams, my eye area would look dry by midday, but I did not experience this with the Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-Crème. While I did not notice a dramatic decrease in fine lines, my eye area felt bad looked more moisturized all day long, which helped to reduce the look of wrinkles. I would definitely recommend this eye gel-crème and will continue to use it myself. Love this eye cream!
