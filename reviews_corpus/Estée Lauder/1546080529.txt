Another wonderful product from Estee Lauder. After a week of use Iâ€™m noticing that my skin is softer, hydrated and fine lines are less noticeable. This moisturizer is a medium weight, neither too light or too heavy. So its great for year round use . It has a pleasant scent and a luxurious feel to it. Definitely a solid product that will continue to improve my skin if I stick with using it. Works for me
