This moisturizer is thick and creamy. Starts off heavy feeling like a sunscreen with a bit of sunscreen scent but once absorbed skin is soft and no longer feels heavy. Very moisturizing but not greasy even at the end of the day. Layers well under foundation.  A little to heavy for my oily acne prone skin. nan
