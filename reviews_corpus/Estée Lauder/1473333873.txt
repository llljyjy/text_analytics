I have tried a couple things from Estée Lauder and some have been good. This youth power crème isn’t what I would like it to be for the price. The first ingredient is water and the second is dimethicone. So, that is what makes up most of the product. I don’t want a silicone filled cream as my skincare. I don’t mind it in makeup at all. In a cream that’s for youthful skin to aid with wrinkles and fine lines should have better ingredients. There is also fragrance and bht as well. In 2022 we all now read the ingredients and aren’t willing to spend our hard earned money on products without proven good ingredients. There are some I like in here but they are overshadowed by the cons. I did try this as a primer with makeup and it worked well for that. As long as you’re okay with fragrance. I just want these high end brands to step it up and do better. We are all reading and learning now with our skincare. If you want to use this as primer you may enjoy it or if you’re okay with mostly silicone in your skincare. This was also the smallest sample ever and I just hoped for more with the product and it’s size. Just okay as a primer, not skincare.
