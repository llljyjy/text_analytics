I haven’t used Estee Lauder personally other than stealing a few things from my mother in years past and honestly I don’t think I’m going to be switching over anytime soon. This moisturizer is just OK, it’s nice and thick when you apply it but I started getting a little pimples after using for a few days so I stopped. Also the smell isn’t very appealing to me. nan
