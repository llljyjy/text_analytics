I received a sample size of this product for my honest opinion. It feels really rich and creamy, not too thick. My eye area feels moisturized, but there’s not much of a difference between this and the previous eye cream I was using. The sample size I received was so small, and you’re supposed to use this cream for 2 weeks in order to see a difference. nan
