I’ve been using Estée Lauder’s Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Creme for over three weeks now and really like it. This addresses mature skin (over 40) that lacks firmness, radiance, targets sagging skin and fine lines and wrinkles. I love that Estée Lauder has clinical testing results because to me it shows they are confident in their product and believe in the honest reviews of their customer base. This is definitely a firming creme. It doesn’t have that luxurious feel of a moisturizer. When you apply this, it immediately soaks in and your skin feels taut and smooth. It’s a fragrance free formula, non-comedogenic, dermatologist and ophthalmologist tested. You can use this on your neck too which I strongly advise. This product contains patented ingredients which includes Moringa Oleifera Seed Extract (anti-oxidant and anti-irritant), Sodium Hyaluronate (fermented hyaluronic acid) and Opuntia Tuna Extracte (strengthens skins moisture barrier). There is a .5 oz. for $29.00 which to me is wonderful for those of us that want to try before we buy a bigger jar. I think this is definitely worth a try if you’re starting to see signs of aging or you want to improve the look and feel of your skin. Age Well!
