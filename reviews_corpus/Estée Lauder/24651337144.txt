I received this product free for my honest review. The cream is very elegant. It is thick and creamy, but not heavy on the skin. It provides long lasting moisture and isn’t oily. It has a nice light fragrance, but not overpowering. I can’t say how it will work long term, I have been using it a week and haven’t noticed any difference. nan
