I received a free sample of this product and was skeptical at first due to the price of a full size bottle.  After using a small amount nightly before my nighttime moisturizer, Iâ€™m pleasantly surprised.  Let me tell you that just a little bit of this product goes a really long way and glides over my face very nicely.  It seems to help my moisturizer go on much smoother. The only reason I did not give 5 out of 5 rating was due to the price tag although I think a bottle should last you at least 6 months if not longer. I would recommend this product 100 percent. Nice product
