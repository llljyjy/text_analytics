I like this eye product because it’s a gel consistency and is great for the summer time or hot weather. This goes on with a little cooling gel feeling. It’s great to wear under a light moisturizer and you’re good to go. A little goes a long way and there is no real smell to this product so I’d say it’s great for all skin types. It’s light weight and very moisturizing. A little pricey but you pay more for better skincare. Like it a lot!
