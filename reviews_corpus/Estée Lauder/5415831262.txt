I received a small sample of this to try so I haven’t used enough to see any major difference. I was pleasantly surprised by how thick and luxurious it felt. I also didn’t notice any scent. Once it goes on it definitely has a dimethicone feel to it. I know people feel very strongly about that one way or another, so it’s good to know that. Since I don’t have anywhere to go lately, I didn’t get the chance to try this under makeup but it seems like something that would need a good primer on top of it. Overall I was pretty impressed and might consider trying a larger size for more results. Thick and luxurious
