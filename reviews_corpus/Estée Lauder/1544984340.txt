I was offered to a sample size of the Revitalizing+ Supreme Moisturizer Power Creame complimentary in exchange for my honest review. The sample size to test is too small to confirm some of the overall benefit claims but this product feels luxurious, hydrating and creamy yet light l. My dry skin feels amazing after putting this on. There’s a slight fragrance that lingers for a bit, but it’s not overpowering. I think people with a variety of skin types would enjoy this! Luxurious feeling product
