This is a miracle essence for my dry skin! I have always been a huge fan of Estée Lauder and I was super excite to try out this essence. Especially now that it’s getting warmer and sunnier, my skin looks dull and needs some additional hydration and this essence gives my skin exactly what it needs. It looks dewy and plum again with a great glow. I love it!It gets absorbed very quickly and does not leave any residue. I didn’t break out or had any other bad reaction to the essence. I always use it right after I washed my face as a toner, then serum and moisturizer.The downside is that is very expensive… Great essence for my dry skin
