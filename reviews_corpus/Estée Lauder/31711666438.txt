I received this product from Estée Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love this eye cream! The gel-cream formula is lightweight and skins into my skin beautifully. Although this is a night cream, I’ve been using it in the morning before makeup, which really preps my eyes. My eyelids tend to be on the dryer side, so this gives the perfect amount of moisture. I definitely recommend the Advanced Night Repair Gel Creme! Great cream for drier eyes!
