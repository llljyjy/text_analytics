I absolutely love this eye cream. A little certainly goes a long way so do keep that in mind. I’ve been using this for about a month and noticed a difference within the first week. My eye area was more hydrated and less puffy. It even seemed to help a hyperpigmentation spot near my eye. It is not super heavy or sticky and didn’t hurt my lash extensions either. I did get this from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. Great eye cream!
