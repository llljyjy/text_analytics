My husband and both began using this product at the same time. I am 28 with dry skin, he is 41 with combo skin. My husband thoroughly enjoyed this product and noticed a difference after a couple weeks use. He said he felt it absorbed and plumped the under eye area well. There has also been a noticeable difference in texture in that area as well. I was not as sold on the product as I felt it didnâ€™t not absorb into my skin as easily. Whether this is due to other products use, our difference in skin types, or simply an age thing, I am unsure. For this reason, my husband and I would certainly recommend this product for more mature skin types! Would certainly recommend for mature skin.
