The older I get, the more I am aware of what I put on my skin. I value and trust Estee Lauder. This moisturizer feels great on my skin, and I really like how it makes my skin feel smooth and soft. I am also an outdoor person, and the added benefit of SPF15 is a major plus. I trust the ingredients that Estee Lauder puts in its products, and I am glad I got to sample this moisturizer before purchasing it. Lovely for my skin!
