I received this product free to try for my honest opinion. I’ve been using this product for about a week and a half now and I’ve already started to notice a difference in my skin. I like the fact that it goes on a bare face or if I’m putting makeup on top of it it does not create any problems. This product also does not have a strong odor which a lot of facial creams do that can keep me from purchasing them. My skin is very dry in the winter in this product has helped to reduce a lot of the irritation that I normally have day wear
