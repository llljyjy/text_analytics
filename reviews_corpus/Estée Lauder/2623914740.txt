I am 40 and have dry skin. I do not like the heavy Fragrance (Parfum) in this, especially for my dry skin type. The scent has a sort of rose fragrance to it, definitely floral and artificial. Although it is free of other ingredients I avoid in my skincare, I canâ€™t recommend this for long term use without having cleaner ingredients based on my personal preferences regarding fragrance ingredients, but it does have some immediate benefits. Absorbs nicely into the skin and drys down quickly without feeling sticky. After applying, my skin immediately feels silky soft and looks smoother. My sample was so small though I did not see any long-term benefits. Okay but prefer cleaner ingredients
