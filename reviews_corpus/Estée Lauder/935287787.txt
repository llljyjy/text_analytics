I was definitely not expecting to like this as much as I did. I was gifted a sample of this moisturizer in exchange for my honest review. I took off one star because they sample was too small to see any actual lasting results but I did notice in the week that I used it, the lines on my neck definitely decreased. I just recently turned 40 and don’t have any severe wrinkles/lines on my face yet so my neck was where I saw the most prominent change. The moisturizer is cream based and is either unscented or may have a very light scent. At first I thought the cream would be very heavy but it’s absorbs into the skin really quickly without any oily finish leaving my skin really moisturized and happy! Definitely plan on purchasing the full size. Would highly recommend. Great moisturizer
