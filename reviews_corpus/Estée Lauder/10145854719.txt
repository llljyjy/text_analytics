A moisturizer that is hydrating and leaves your face looking Youthful. At first use, I wad honestly concerned that it would be heavy on the skin but I was surprised at how it just melted into the skin and didn’t leave my skin feeling weighted down. The fragrance was light and simple, which was greatly appreciated to someone with a sensitivity to smells. I think the major thing I had issues with is how it caused my face to break out. Not sure if I am allergic to one of the ingredients or my skin is just too sensitive but my mom does enjoy it and has no problem with it. Look your best with Estée!
