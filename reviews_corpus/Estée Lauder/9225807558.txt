I received this to try free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. This applied very smoothly and feels good on the skin at first. I don’t currently use an eye cream because my skin tends to be very sensitive around my eyes. This wasn’t an acception unfortunately, my eyes were irritated after use but before that happened I did enjoy the product. I would probably still reccomend to people who don’t have issues with eye creams nan
