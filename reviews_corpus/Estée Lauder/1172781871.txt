I received a complimentary sample size of this product from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I feel like it’s hard to review something when you’ve only used it for a couple of weeks but I do feel like I am seeing an improvement in my skin with just the short timeframe I’ve used it. The consistency is something between a cream and a serum. It goes on easily and a little bit definitely goes a long way. I’m four weeks postpartum and I feel like my skin went crazy after I had my son. Using this creme, i have felt like I was able to stabilize that a bit. My skin looks firmer and less tired. I’m excited to continue using this creme! nan
