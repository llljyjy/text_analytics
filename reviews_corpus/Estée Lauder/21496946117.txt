For someone who does not wear face make-up I do recommend a nice face moisture.  This is smooth and refreshing. The smell is light and pleasant. It is not greasy at all, absorbs nicely into the skin. The fact that itâ€™s SPFis a bonus as well. My skin is sensitive and I have zero issues with this. Definitely recommend you give it a try! Definitely recommend
