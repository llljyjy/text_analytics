I really liked this product, I received it complimentary for my honest review. It was a very very small sample size and I’m not sure if my skin was super dehydrated because I had to use a lot to fully moisturize my face. The product is awesome. It’s clean doesn’t leave a sticky feeling at all. Smell is light and airy. I just would need a way bigger container if I was going to use this twice a day. Thick and creamy
