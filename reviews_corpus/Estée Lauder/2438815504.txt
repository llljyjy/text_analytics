I received this for free in exchange of my honest review. This moisturizer was ok! The packaging is beautiful though and I love the scent of the cream. I didn’t feel it really hydrated my skin. My daily moisturizer, you actually feel the hydration and I didn’t get that from this Estee Lauder product. It might work on other skin types, but I didn’t feel it worked on MY skin. Which is odd because their products are usually great stuff. It’s ok.
