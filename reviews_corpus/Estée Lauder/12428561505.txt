I recieved a free sample of this cream to try. I found it to be super luxurious.  This is a nice thicker cream, with a light fragrance.  It really seemed to lock in the moisture in my skin.  I noticed when I rinsed my hand after application, the water beaded up. So if you need intense moisture this is an excellent product.  If you favor really light weight water soluble moisturizers,  this one likely isnâ€™t for you.  It did make me feel like my skin was more hydrated and glowy with use. Super hydration
