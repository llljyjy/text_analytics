I received a sample of this from Influenster and Estée Lauder, and with such a small window to test the product and writing my review, all I can say is the product is fine. I didn’t hate it and it didn’t irritate my eye area, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to purchase it. While it’s nice and lightweight and absorbed well, I just prefer my eye creams to be a tad thicker. I don’t expect instant results but it doesn’t appear to have even made a hint of an impact on my dark circles. And while it did absorb well, because of its consistency, I didn’t feel like the area remained hydrated long enough. I also wish it didn’t have a scent since the product is used on my face. nan
