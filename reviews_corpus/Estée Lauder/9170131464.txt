I was very excited to try this moisturizer out, and so far I have really loved using this. I would repurchase it but it would not be the only moisturizer I would use, I try to follow what my skin needs and there are times I need a little extra hydration and so I would use one of my heavier creams instead. It is scented so if you are sensitive to smells this may not be for you. Love this for daily wear
