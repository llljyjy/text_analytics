I actually really liked this. I’ve recently started skin cycling. Day 1: exfoliate, day 2: retinol, days 3&4 recovery. Last night was my third day, so it was the perfect time to try it. It’s so thick and luxurious and it didn’t pill! I’m going to continue to use it, and if I still like it as much as I did last night I would definitely buy.You can feel the quality in the formula. nan
