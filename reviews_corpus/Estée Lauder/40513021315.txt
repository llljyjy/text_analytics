I received this sample from Influenster for my honest review. Although the product is a sample size and I have used it sparingly, usually at night after my face cleansing routine before bed, it’s very potent as far as moisture rich. When I wake in the mornings, my face still feels soft and full of moisture. I can imagine how great it would feel to apply twice a day as the directions suggest. The consistency is amazing and glides over my skin. The fragrance is light and fresh, not overpowering like many moisturizers I have used in the past. I will gladly spend the hefty price tag to acquire a product that actually works! I am 53 years old and would say my skin isn’t very dry, but the signs of aging are definitely showing. I look forward to my purchase and to implement this wonderful product into my skincare routine. Thanks Estée Lauder for developing a moisturizer that does what it says. Get this product and do your face a huge favor!
