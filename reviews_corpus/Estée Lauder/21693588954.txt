This moisturizer is super thick and it’s so powerful! I love how it feels soaking into my skin and even though I only was able to use it for a few days I think it would be sooo effective if used over the long term. It didn’t break me out, no issues at all, smelled divine and I definitely recommend. It’s EXPENSIVE though, so thats why I took away a star. So good, but definitely expensive
