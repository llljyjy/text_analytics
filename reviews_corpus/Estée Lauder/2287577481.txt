I think this is a nice hydrating product for the skin but it’s a little pricey for what it is. It feels nice on the skin and I think it smells good. But I don’t notice a huge difference in my skin between the days I use it and the days I don’t. I received the product for free in exchange for a review. Nice but not a must have
