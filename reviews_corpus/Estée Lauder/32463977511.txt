I received a deluxe sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. While this product was frangerance free and light weight I didn’t find it locked in any moisture or tone my skin. It did mix in really well with my current routine and no issues with irritation. I used it twice a day for 3 weeks and didn’t notice any considerable differences. Just meh
