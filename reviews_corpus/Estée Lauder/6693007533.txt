At first I wasn’t to excited about this product because the container was labeled as Night Repair eye-Creme and I would rather have one single product that can be  used for day and night; but as I continued reading I found out that it can be applied am and pm.Lately my under eye area has been looking pretty tired with some puffiness,so I decided to give it a shot right away. I’ve been using this cream for almost two weeks now since I received it, and I’ve noticed a huge difference, my eyes feel softer and look less tired. I definitely love It’s light weight formula and cold gel texture, it instantly awakens my skin which feels great on my eye area. I would definitely recommend this cream. An Eye Cream you can count on!
