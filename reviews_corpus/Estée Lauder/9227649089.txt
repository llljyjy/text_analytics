I received this free in exchange for my honest review. I really like the consistency of this. It is in between a gel and a cream. It goes on really smooth and absorbs well. I feel like my fine lines and circles aren’t as bad. The only reason it lost a star is because Estée Lauder is not completely cruelty free and does some animal testing still. Good but not cruelty free
