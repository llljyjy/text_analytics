My skin is very dry and textured and also very sensitive. Although this hasn’t done anything for my textured skin it did really moisturize my face and make it so that the dryness wasn’t as noticeable. I really like the texture of the cream it feels really nice on your skin and it absorbs well. I do recommend this and I will more than likely purchase in the future. Great Cream
