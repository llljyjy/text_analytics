I’ve got the product from Influenster as a gift.The cream actually is very nice, fast absorbing, very hydrating.I like the fact it has a pretty good spf.I also like it under my makeup because it goes into the skin fast and doesn’t leave oily film.Basically it’s a very good moisturizer. Very nice moisturizer
