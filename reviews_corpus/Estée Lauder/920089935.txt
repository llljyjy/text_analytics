I received this as complimentary in exchange for my honest review from influenster. This product did not work on my skin. It made it itchy & red, but my skin is also super sensitive & oily. I tried it 3 times and every time I did, I regretted it. I guess my skin is just too dang picky. The texture looked & felt light but I had a hard time spreading it onto my face. The application was not smooth and I really had to work it in.  It’s also highly fragranced as with all Estée Lauder products. I feel like this is more suited towards dry/ normal skin that is not sensitive. Not for me
