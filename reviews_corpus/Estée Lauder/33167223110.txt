I received this product complementary fromInfluenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for myhonest opinion. I had Estée Lauder repair eye supercharged complex in the past and really liked it. This product feels like a smooth silky gel version of that and perfect for dry skins. It does wonders for fine lines and reduces dark circles. It’s light, not greasy, hydrating and a little goes a long way. I have used it for about two weeks and can see the results already. I really love Estée Lauder eye repair products and this samplereminded me that I should buy them again. nan
