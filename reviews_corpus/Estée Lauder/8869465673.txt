I appreciated receiving this sample size to test out, but because it was so small, I haven’t noticed any results. A slightly larger sample size, like the mini they sell at Sephora, would probably have given me more time to see how well this worked. I did like the fragrance, as it wasn’t overpowering. And the creme absorbed quickly which is a positive. nan
