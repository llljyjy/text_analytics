I’ve been diligently using this per the instructions for more than 30 days and still haven’t noticed any visible signs of improvement yet in either darkness or wrinkles. Has not caused any irritation to the thin skin around my eyes, which is a plus.  I like the texture and this is easy to apply, but it’s no better than my normal eye cream. Not worth the hype
