I’ve been using this eye cream for a few weeks now and can definitely see a difference in my undereyes- they are more hydrated and there is a decrease in fine lines. I’m prone to milia and fortunately this doesn’t give me any milia under my eyes. I love to use this before applying makeup as it makes concealer go on super smooth. I’ll definitely continue to use this and recommend it to friends and family! Hydrating + refreshing eye cream
