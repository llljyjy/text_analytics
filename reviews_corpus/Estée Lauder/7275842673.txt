I received a sample size from influenster. I like the packaging and think of Estee Lauder as a timeless brand. The product does work and was able to moisturize my undereye area when I suffered from dry skin. Itâ€™s luxurious but pricey! Luckily a little does go a long way. I would use if I had it, but I would not rebuy at this price point. nan
