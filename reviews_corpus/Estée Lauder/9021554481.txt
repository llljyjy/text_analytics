I received this product for free through @influenster I’m exchange for my honest review. I love how thick this gel cream is and how soft it feels applying to the under eye area. It is super refreshing and leaves my skin feeling smooth and wrinkle free. I have sensitive skin and I was able to put the product directly under my eyes and on the eyelids without any burning or irritation. The consistency is super thick so it did leave an oily residue for quite some time which is fine if using the product in the PM. I wouldn’t prefer to use the product in the AM due to the oily residue it leaves behind, not sure how that would work with makeup. Overall I am giving the product a 4/5 stars because it feels refreshing on the skin, gave no irritation and tightened my skin. I am deducting a star due to the oily residue it leaves behind and I haven’t seen any long term affects after using the product multiple times. REFRESHING BUT OILY
