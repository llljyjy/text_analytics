I enjoy the texture of this cream. The gel consistency helps with hydration and my under eyes look glowy hours after I put the product on. I didnâ€™t see any major transformation in my under eyes while using this, but I feel like products like this are more for prevention. Very moisturizing. hydrating for under eyes
