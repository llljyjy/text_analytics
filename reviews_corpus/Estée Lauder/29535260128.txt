Amazing quality product, I love everything from this brand. Yes the products are a bit pricey but so worth it since they are so effective. I love that this looks like a cream but when you put it on it feels like a cool gel. It did not personally cause me any irritation and I was very happy with the results. I am just starting to care about and do something about aging and this helped with my fine line and wrinkles. It smoothed out the area and provided hydration. I definitely recommend giving this a try. Great product
