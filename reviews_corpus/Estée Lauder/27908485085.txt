. I have been using a sample size jar for a few weeks now, and I still haven’t finished it, so a little goes a long way with this cream. I really like the gel cream texture, and it leaves my eyes feeling hydrated and silky. I did notice that my undereye area looks brightened and my fine lines are a bit less noticeable. It’s not an extreme difference, but there has been some change. I will definitely finish the sample size I have and considered getting the full size. nan
