I received a sample of this product in exchange for my review. I’d never tried a lot of eye creams in the past but I was looking forward to trying this one! I was extremely impressed with this cream after just one use. It has worked wonders in keeping the skin under my eyes hydrating and feeling soft. I’ve noticed it’s helped my eyes from feeling swollen when I wake up in the morning, which is refreshing in itself. I highly recommend this cream and will be adding it to my nightly routine! nan
