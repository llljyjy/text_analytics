This is a beautiful luxury cream and it comes in a signature looking sleek jar. I read that it has IntuiGen technology. So that means it literally knows what your skin needs! It doesn’t take much and I used every drop! I wanted to make sure I had an honest opinion to share. It’s absolutely gorgeous!! I plan on buying a larger jar. It’s very lightweight and silky! Not greasy at all. I never realized it was on my face. It’s good for both day and night. It knows what your skin needs!
