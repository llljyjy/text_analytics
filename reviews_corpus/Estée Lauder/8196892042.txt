Iâ€™ve been using this skin product for about 3 weeks every day. The Estee Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion is ideal for dry skin, redness or irritation, pores, and healthy-looking skin. The product is free of alcohol, silicone, parabens, or paraffin. Also free of fragrance. I used this product on a cotton pad to apply to my face, followed by a serum or moisturizer. After applying for every day for 3 weeks, my face skin looks hydrated and my pores are visibly smaller.Overall, I expected a lot more out of this facial product. I would give 2,9 out of 5. New skin product.
