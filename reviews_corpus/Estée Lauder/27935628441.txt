I’ve been using this product for over a month now and I’ve been really, really enjoying it. Immediate thoughts are that the texture is amazing. Especially for eye creams, I love a very smooth, easily applied product. This one definitely fits the bill. I love the texture, it’s the perfect hybrid between a gel and cream formula and applies so smoothly. It makes my under eye feel almost like velvety (in an amazing way) when it has time to dry down, after applying very silky. Over time thoughts are that I have noticed a difference in hydration and the smoothness of my under eye. I’ve been very happy with how my base makeup and concealer has been applying on my eye are after using this eye gel-cream. The most important thing to me is how it applies and how it makes me feel while doing that, and because of that I love this product. A little goes a long way, which for a high end product is also important. I did get this product complimentary from Estée Lauder for my honest review, and this review is my truly honest thoughts. I would purchase this product. soothing, silky, hydrating hybrid gel-cream- love!
