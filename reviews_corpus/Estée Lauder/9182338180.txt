I adore the smell of this, and it does work well very temporarily. It keeps my skin softer and more moisturized for about an hour, but then it wears off and I don’t see any lasting impact. I do like the texture and the packing though, and think it’s a pretty good deal. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. smells good!
