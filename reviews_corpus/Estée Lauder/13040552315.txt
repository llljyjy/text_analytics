I received this product as a complimentary product for testing purposes. I like the light fragrance and I enjoy the texture even more. It’s not oily or greasy, but smooth and leaves my face feeling moisturized.  It’s a heavier cream, but doesn’t seem to layer on the skin in a way that feels like it’s clogging my press. This is a quality product that is not water based and a little goes a long way. I recommend this product. Rich and Smooth
