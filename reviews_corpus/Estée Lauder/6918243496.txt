This moisturizer is very thick and does the trick. With it being colder out right now, my skin is extra dry and this has helped a lot. I’ve been using this for a few weeks and it’s great morning or night. It plumps you my skin and smells nice. It is a bit pricy and since I only received a sample size, it’s hard to say if it’s worth the price or not, though. It does seem to do as promised. Thick and moisturizing
