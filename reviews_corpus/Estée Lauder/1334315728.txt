This eye cream was such a nice surprise. I am a fanof the face serum, but I wasn’t sure what to expect from the eye cream. It’s light on the fragrance which isimportant to me around the eyes. It’s also thick so a little goes a long way but once it blends in under the eye, it’s airy and doesn’t feel thick or sticky. I’ve been using it for over 2 weeks and it has soften the under eye. I can’t see any brightening effects yet but I’m sure with continued use, other claims may be true. I do notice when I skip a night of using it. I recommend trying it out if you’re fan of Estée Lauder. Softens the undereyes
