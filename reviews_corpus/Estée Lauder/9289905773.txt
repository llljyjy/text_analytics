I was excited to receive this product through Influenster because I had just ran out of my usual eye creme. This eye creme has a great consistency that didn’t feel sticky, even though it was a gel, and it dried fairly quickly as well. I gave it a 4 star rating, because I haven’t necessarily noticed any outstanding results from using it for the past 2 weeks. I wouldn’t say it’s bad though, by any means. Seems to be a great product, I just haven’t noticed much of a difference in terms of fine lines becoming less noticeable. I received this product complimentary through Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Nice product
