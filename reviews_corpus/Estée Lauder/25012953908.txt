I love this!! The Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair is definitely replacing my current eye cream because I am so happy with the results! My eye area feels so hydrated and I wake up to plumper under eye skin and I swear my dark circles have been better as well! I love that the cream is gel-like and doesnâ€™t feel super heavy on the eye. I love how it feels when applied - hydrating and smooth. I love that I noticed my under eyes were more hydrated immediately and as time has gone on (3 weeks since i began using it) I notice my fine lines and dark circles continue to improve. Overall, I highly recommend this product!! I received this product complimentary from Influenster for my honest review. I'm in love!!
