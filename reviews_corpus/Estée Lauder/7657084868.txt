I find this eye cream to be quite nice. I used it twice daily for a little over two weeks. It made my under-eye area look and feel smooth. Its gel-like consistency glides onto my eye area with little effort and sinks into my skin effectively and efficiently so, I can start with my makeup routine promptly. I have not had a problem with pilling. The packaging subsists of a gold lid and a transparent brownish container that compliments the gold nicely. Now I did notice a slight tingling sensation and my skin would turn red and blotchy in some of the spots where I had applied the eye-creme. It wasn’t so uncomfortable I wanted to take it off but, it was noticeable. Sometimes more noticeable than other times. (This didn’t happen every time I applied, but enough times where I felt the need to mention it.) I am torn, I love the consistency and the way this product applied and felt on my skin but, after a couple of minutes, the redness starts to occur. It does go away after some time, 30 minutes or so. And my eye area was left smooth and supple. I love Estēe Lauder as a whole and have many of their products I use regularly. I’m not completely sold that this is the perfect eye creme for me. Although I do like a lot of things about it, there is that one con. I will continue to use the sample size up. I might try a different eye cream from Estee lauder because I do like this creme. My eyes did look and feel nice and after 2 weeks of continuous use, my dark circles seemed to diminish significantly. Under-Eyes Look Smooth and Plump.
