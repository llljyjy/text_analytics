I received this product complimentary from Estée Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I’m obsessed with this product. At first I was put off just because it says “toner”, I have dry, sensitive skin and toners make my skin feel tight and itchy. But I gave it a shot after I rubbed a drop between my fingers and realized this was no ordinary toner. It’s like a light moisturizing lotion and a thin, highly absorbable essence had a baby! It glides on with no tugging or pulling and absorbs in a matter of seconds with no sticky/tacky residue, and does not pill up. You only need 5-6 drops and the scent is heaven. Usually skincare products use too much scent in my opinion but this one is perfect. It’s fresh, clean, and somehow also warm smelling. It has become my new favorite product. It leaves my skin so incredibly soft and gives me a lot from within, healthy glow for hours. I will buy this over and over. Perfect for dry and sensitive skin
