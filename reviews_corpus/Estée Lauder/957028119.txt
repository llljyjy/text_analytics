I received a sample this product in exchange for my honest review.  I like the consistency, since I tend to like thicker creams.  Seems to be very moisturizing; I have pretty dry skin and it has kept me feeling very hydrated.  Very faint fragrance.  My skin does seem to be a bit more sensitive than normal, but I also use a high strength tret cream, so maybe don’t don’t do super well together, but nothing too noticeable. Very moisturizing
