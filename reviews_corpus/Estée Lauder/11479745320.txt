I have dry skin and I’m experiencing the initial signs of aging like a bit of jowliness and some facial creasing. I received this to testand it did an excellent job moisturizing and seemed to give me a little glow but since my tester was a trial size I can’t really attest to any noticeable lifting or firming. Overall it’s a nice, thick, rich cream but it is rather expensive. Good Moisturizer
