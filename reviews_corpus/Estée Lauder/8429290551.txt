I.wanted to try this for a good month, before giving my two sense on this product. Honestly, it feels like a basic face cream. The is no smell, or any heavy scent that sometimes comes with creams that have sunscreen in them. For this price, I thought I would be a more luxurious feeling for it. I think I will stick with CeraVe. Not worth the price
