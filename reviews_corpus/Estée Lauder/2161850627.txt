I liked it but didn’t adore it. It was very moisturizing and thick; good for the winter months. I did have a bit of a perfumey yet stuffy smell in my opinion. You could instantly feel it tightening a little bit, but not as much as some products I have tried. I only received a sample which lasted maybe 5 days and didn’t really notice any lasting change. It’s a good product but not my favorite. Somewhat tightening and very moisturizing
