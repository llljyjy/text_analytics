I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. Iâ€™ve used it for a few weeks now, and while I do find it to be hydrating, I do not notice any major changes to my dark circles. My skin around my eyes is nicely hydrated and plumped with use, and the formula is light- not at all greasy. Nice!
