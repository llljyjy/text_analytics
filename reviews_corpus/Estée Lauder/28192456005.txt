I’m almost done with the .5 oz jar and I’m not super impressed. The cream feels nice and smooth and gave my skin a nice glow, but it is heavily fragranced and only SPF 15. Overall it’s an okay moisturizer, not sure if I believe the  24-hour claim, but I was not dry when using. This product has too low of a SPF that I would not consider purchasing. There are better anti-aging sunscreens out there with higher SPF. I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. nan
