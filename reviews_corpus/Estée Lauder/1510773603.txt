I have a normal to dry skin, it’s a nice product for hydration, but I haven’t noticed any difference while using this. Maybe because I got a tiny size bottle to try, so you might see some results in the long run. This lotion smells kind of nice, but a bit strong I think some people might not like it. I didn’t really like the way my face felt after application, it left my skin feeling tacky. So I only used it during my night routine. Good, just not for my skin type
