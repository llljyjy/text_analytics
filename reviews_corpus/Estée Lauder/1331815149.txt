This may be the new holy grail of moisturizers! Soooo hydrating, my skin immediately felt different after application!  Very thick, I used it at night only, I applied after my Estee lauder night repair serum, and the combination felt heavenly!  Highly recommended!  Really felt the texture of my skin firm up quite a bit! Hydration at its finest
