I received this product complimentary for my honest review. Sadly, the product made my skin break out :( I have normal skin that almost never blemishes. I used the product as directed, both AM and PM after gently cleansing my skin. I’ve been using the product for about a month and noticed I’ve been breaking out pretty badly on my nose and chin! I started using the moisturizer just at night because it can be kind of heavy and greasy. It is moisturizing though! I also haven’t noticed any changes in skin firmness or reduction of fine lines. I wanted to love it and it may be a great product, but it just doesn’t agree with my skin. I wish my skin loved it!
