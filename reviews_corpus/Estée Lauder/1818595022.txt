Ester lauder never disappoints with their products and this eye cream is no exception! It’s perfectly thick, smooth, and creamy. I love the way it goes on and that I instantly feel like my eyes are more hydrated. It’s good at plumping the skin and making you look refreshed. It’s a great addition to your skincare routine. great addition to nighttime routine
