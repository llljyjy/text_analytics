I have used the original version if this eye cream, on and off, for years. This “new” version seems pretty similar, maybe a bit creamier/thicker. It keeps my eye area hydrated and firm. You only need a tiny bit and it absorbs well, any more than that it can make your under eyes greasy. It def feels a bit cooling which I enjoy. Between the original and this cream, my fines lines have been diminished and kept from forming, def worth a try. My eye area gets super dry/flaky and this cream helped relieve that too. Hydrating and creamy
