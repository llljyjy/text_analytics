The Estee Lauder Micro Essence treatment lotion felt great on my skin. I did expect it to be thicker than water considering the description of lotion. It was hydrating felt refreshing on the skin. I enjoy that there is no scent. Estee Lauder products to me are usually quite pleasant to use. I donâ€™t have any irritation when I use their products. Fresh & hydrating
