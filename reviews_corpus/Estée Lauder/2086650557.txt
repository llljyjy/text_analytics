This serum like formula should be applied morning and evening. I have racoon circles under my eyes so I really tried to remember to use it both times. Even though I missed a few I could see slight difference. I would never leave my house without concealer on but now I donâ€™t even really think about it! I will continue to use. I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. Help for dark circles
