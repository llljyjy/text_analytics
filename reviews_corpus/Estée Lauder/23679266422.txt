When it comes to my eyes, the fine lines and wrinkles is a big concern for me besides the rest of my face. So, I enjoy discovering the latest eye cream out in the market. The eye area is the most sensitive and thinnest area of the skin, so I like to treat it with care. I am not a stranger to using Estee Lauder’s skincare products, so I was thrilled to try an advanced night repair eye gel-cream by them. Therefore, this cream’s texture is a rich, creamy watery gel consistency that melted nicely into my skin.After 1 week, I started to notice in elasticity and moisture improved in that area. So, after week 2, the dryness went away, fine lines lessen, puffiness improved, and the darkness under the eyes appeared more brightener. However, it is important to invest in an eye treatment to deal with these stubborn problems, and this is one I would highly recommend adding it to the nightstand as I will be adding it to mine!Samantha J. nan
