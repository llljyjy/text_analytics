I received a sample size jar of this from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  I have a variety of eye creams, but this has made it into my top three.  The consistency is super lush and creamy, and it doesn’t burn if you get a bit in your eyes.  You can see the fine lines fade as it settles into your skin, and it absorbs like a champ.  I’d highly recommend trying this if you’re looking for a good night eye cream! This stuff is phenomenal!
