I received this cream complementary from Estée Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. First of all the bottle is very nice and the cream smells soo good! It’s not an overpowering perfume scent but a nice light clean scent. It’s also just the right consistency I look for in a moisturizer. I’ve been using it day and night as the directions state. I apply it as my last step of my skincare routine. I have tons is moisturizers but I’m really loving this one and will definitely be purchasing more even though it’s very pricey. Amazing!!
