I really enjoyed using this moisturizer, compliments of Influenster and Estée Lauder for my honest review. The cream has a very rich and luxurious texture that absorbs well into skin and does not leave a sticky feeling. My skin is soft and moisturize the next morning. I cannot speak for the long-term benefits as the sample only lasted 2-3 weeks. The cream has a floral perfume scent which may be off-putting to some, but it didn’t bother me. Rich and luxurious cream
