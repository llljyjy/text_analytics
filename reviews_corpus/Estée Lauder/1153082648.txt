I received this complimentary from Influenster to try out and give my honest opinion.  I really liked this moisturizer.  It didn’t feel heavy or greasy on my skin.  My skin felt hydrated overall.  I do have some very dry areas on my face that I can’t seem to ever get rid of no matter what brand of moisturizer I use, but this one seemed to work better than others I have tried.  I didn’t notice and improvement in fine lines, but I think I would need to use it longer to really tell.  I have used Estée Lauder products off and on for over 20 years.  It’s always been a stellar cosmetic and skincare brand and continues to stand out in a beauty market that is continuously expanding. Must try!!
