If heaven had a scent, this is it. I received this product for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. Unfortunately, the size is for ants. It’s hard to leave a skincare review as to the benefits they claim to achieve after one weeks usage because my sample won’t last me that long. What I can speak to is the instant effects. Those were softened and smoother skin that left my combination skin self feeling fresh to death. I think Estée Lauder really hit the ball out of the park with this one! My sample has me salivating for more haha. No. Really. nan
