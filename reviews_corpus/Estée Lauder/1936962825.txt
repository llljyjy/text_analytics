I received a small sample of this to try out (enough to last a few weeks using it every other night). While I didn’t notice any significant difference in my skin after using up the sample, I enjoyed how moisturizing this was - I have pretty dry skin and  I’ve never used a toner that felt like it was hydrating. Most toners have felt like they were drying out my skin. This is very very perfumed, so if you don’t like scented skincare, this isn’t the toner for you. I didn’t mind the small though and it does away after a few minutes. nan
