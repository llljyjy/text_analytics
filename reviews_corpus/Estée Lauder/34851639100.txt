Excited to share another product with you all! I received this for free from Influenster and Estēe Lauder in exchange for my honest review. This Revitalizing Supreme+ power youth creme is light in texture, doesn’t feel oily or heavy on your face. It packs a lot of moisture with little product to give you a lot of bang for your buck. It does a good job of hydrating and locking the moisture barrier into your skin to give you a dewy youthful glow. It does have a light floral fragrance which isn’t overwhelming, but I do prefer my makeup products to be fragrance free. #complimentary #EsteeLauderxInfluenster @Influenster @esteelauder Excellent hydration
