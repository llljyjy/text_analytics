There is just something about the smell of Estée Lauder products that I love! This cream smells so dreamy, but the scent doesn’t linger or overpower after application. Although I only used this for about 10 days, I could see a difference in my skin almost right away. It feels smoother, more bouncy, and brighter. I am very impressed with the quick results of the cream! If scent isn’t a deterrent, I would encourage anyone to give this cream a try. Amazing results! I received a free sample for review purposes, but opinions are truthfully my own. smooth and dreamy, lovely cream!
