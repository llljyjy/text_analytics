I liked that this Estee Lauder Supreme + cream was thicker than normal moisturizers. It really did hydrate my skin. In the week or so that I used it I don’t feel my skin was firmer or noticed any less wrinkles. If the sample I received had been a month’s supply, there may have been more noticeable results. It did not make my face feel greasy at all. This is huge for me to find a moisturizer that doesn’t make my face feel oily. I did not mind the scent. It was subtle and I did not find that the perfume was overwhelming. I would probably not recommend this for anti aging unless I used more but I would recommend it as a moisturizer. Good moisturizer
