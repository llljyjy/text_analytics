I initially received a of this moisturizer from Influenster and liked it enough to buy the full size.It has a nice whipped-like consistency and absorbs really well. My skin in combination but I don’t find it to be overly heavy on my oily areas. I don’t have any issues with my skin feeling sticky or greasy after application, though I typically only use it at night. It also has a mild brightening effect, which you can see the moment you put it on - my skin looks healthy and happy.My biggest and only real complaint is the sent, I strongly dislike “perfume” scented products on my face. “Natural” or “herbal” scents are  fine but the artificial perfume I don’t care for. Luckily, I don’t find the sent with this product to be overpowering and I find it does dissipate quickly. nan
