I’m not the biggest fan of eye creams and this one wasn’t too impressive to me because I haven’t been able to see a difference after using it a few weeks. I also do not have a lot of lines around my eyes so maybe that could also be a factor. This seems like it would work well for others though with fine lines. I do like that it doesn’t make my eye area feel greasy when I wake up. Great, but not a miracle.
