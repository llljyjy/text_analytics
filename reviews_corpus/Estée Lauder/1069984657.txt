I recieved a tiny sample of this from Influenster. I cant say if it’ll help with fine lines and wrinkles, I dont have enough product to tell. But after several uses day and night, my skin feels moisturized...but only because the formula is so THICK (not necessarily the formula itself, but the feel on the skin)! This definitely keeps skin hydrated, but has a noticeably thick cream feel on my skin (normal combo). The smell is pleasant, not too strong. Throughout the day with all my other skincare products, it makes me look shiny. I’ll be saving this for the winter when my skin needs it most! Id recommend it for really dry skin types.
