If you are looking to tone your skin this is it! I have been using this for 3 weeks now and I already know that Iâ€™m going to repurchase this again and again. My skin has became more smooth and texture free, skin looks more plumped and hydrated giving me that healthy water glow. My faces has gotten firmer and toned. There is no strong scent in this at all so is also perfect for those sensitive to scent. This also helps with fin lines and wrinkles and dullness. My face is visibly more brighter and smoother. This is worth the price as it does everything that it claims to do. Healthy Glass Skin
