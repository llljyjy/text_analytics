This cream was very moisturizing.  It did last all day, but caused my skin to become a bit oily from that moisture and had a few spots breakout around my nose and chin.  When I applied the product it was very thick so I reduced the amount that I applied and it did help with not being so oily. A little goes a long way with this. Honestly this was a good cream, but do only use a tiny amount. nan
