I received this product as a free sample. I started using this cream in my daily routine after trying it. The natural smell is not too strong and my skin stays soft for the entire day. The ingredients are not too harsh. If your looking for a moisturizing cream to fix those fine lines and dry skin we all donâ€™t like, then I would definitely recommend this moisturizing cream. I give Estee Lauder DayWear Moisturizer 5 stars! All around great moisturizing cream!
