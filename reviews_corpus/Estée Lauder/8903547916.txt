I received this product free for my honest review from Influenster and Estee Lauder. The first night I tried this my eyes burned and I had to rinse them. The next night I tried they didnâ€™t burn. So either my eyes got used to them or just using them just on your under eyes is best. My eyes are less puffy and brighter in the morning. A small amount goes a long way! I got a small sample and have been using it consistently for a few weeks! Use with Caution
