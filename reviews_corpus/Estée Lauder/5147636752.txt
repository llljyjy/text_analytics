I received this product from Influenster for free to review.  First of all I want to say this is a light weight cream for being as thick as it is. It dissolves nicely into my skin. It doesnâ€™t leave any residue behind. It leaves my skin feeling soft and helps with the fine lines. Unfortunately it has not helped q8th my dark circles. Over all it is a good product & it may work for others dark circles it just did not for mine. Softer skin ahead
