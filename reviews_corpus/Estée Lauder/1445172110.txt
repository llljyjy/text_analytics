I received this product to review, a small sample. It wasnâ€™t enough product to use over time to be able to test the rejuvenation of the product in skin. But the thick texture of the cream did leave my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized. It felt very nice on the skin. I believe with more time you will be able to see a difference in skin. I have dry skin so I enjoyed the hydration feel it gave my skin. Great night cream for dry skin
