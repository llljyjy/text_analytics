I received a 5ml sample to review, which was enough for 5 applications. This is not anywhere near long enough to comment on their claims of firmness, strength or lifting. I can only comment on two claims - glowiness? Same as any rich moisturizer, nothing unusual. Hydration? Yes, it’s a fairly rich cream that left my skin hydrated all day. The consistency and skin feel was nice and it absorbed well. I cannot really review this at a higher level based on just a few days use. Would I pay $90 for this based on what I’ve seen over these days? Honestly, no. I can get decent hydrating moisturizers for a lot less with more observable results. It was fine, but nothing outstanding. A hydrating, rich cream.
