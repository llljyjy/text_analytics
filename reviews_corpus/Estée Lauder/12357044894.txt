so far, i’m really loving this product! i’ve only been using it for a couple weeks, so i haven’t seen a difference in my dark circles, thus the 4 stars, but i will continue and review again if i do see an improvement. it’s a gel but super creamy. i keep it in my beauty fridge so when i apply at night it goes on smoothly and feels cool, which assists with anything puffiness or swollen ness. i’d definitely recommend it. absorbs quickly and isn’t sticky. nan
