Claims are hydrating, firming, lifting and radiance. I received a sample so I can’t discuss long term effects. Short term, I saw no firming or lifting difference when using. It is a thicker cream but it didn’t break me out and most heavy creams do as I have sensitive skin. I have very dry skin and it was pretty hydrating and it did provide a radiance. Hydrating, good for sensitive skin
