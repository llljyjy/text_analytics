Very impressed by this eye cream. It felt light, almost gel like and didn’t irritate my eyes overnight... Didn’t give me millia and I used it all over the eye area, not just below the eye. Don’t know if I noticed a difference but it felt nice and didn’t give me any problems. Would probably also work well under makeup.  Heavy price tag but nice!! nan
