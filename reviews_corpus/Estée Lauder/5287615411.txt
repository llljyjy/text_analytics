This lightweight eye cream is ok but not great. It has a thinner consistency than the older formula. One upside to the thinner consistency is that it pairs well with both your day and night routines. I didnâ€™t see many results from the product (besides hydration) which is why I say its just ok. I would prefer a thicker consistency especially at night. Good Eyecream
