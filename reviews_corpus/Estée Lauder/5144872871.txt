I received a free trial of this moisturizer complimentary from Influenster and Estée Lauder. This is the softest moisturizer I ever used! It has a nice light scent not overpowering at all. As soon as you put it on your fingers to apply you will notice how silky it feels. I felt so hydrated and smooth after using this moisturizer and I have oily skin and some moisturizers feel too greasy or sticky and this was neither. It is so light on. I can’t speak on long term effects because I only had a sample but I would definitely purchase this for my skincare routine. Definitely worth the price tag. Silky Smooth Skin
