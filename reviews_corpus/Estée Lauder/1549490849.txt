I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this eye cream every night for about a month and while I can’t say I notice a big difference in my under eye area, I really like the way this cream feels. It goes on so smooth and doesn’t leave any residue or stickiness. I’d continue using just for the nice hydrating feeling it gives my eyes before bed. Feels great
