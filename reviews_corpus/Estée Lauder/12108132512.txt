I have been using Estee Lauder products for years and I was given this one, the Revitalizing Supreme plus Youth power Creme. Received this as a sample to try it and review it. I like it so much that I have bought the full size product and use it everyday. It is very light on the skin and absorbs easily it doesn’t feel heavy. It doesn’t feel greasy or oily. And it doesn’t clog my skin or cause breakouts. I have dryer skin and since using this product I have noticed that my skin is smoother and softer. Other people are also noticed it in the past 30 days that I’ve been using this product.  If you want to try the product this sample size is actually a great way to do it to see how you like the product. I really enjoy it and the scent is very light, not overpowering at all. It will absorb into your skin very fastly. I think you will like it I know that I do. Smooth and silky skin
