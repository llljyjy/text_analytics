I’ve always been a big fan of thick, luxurious, super hydrating night creams. Since we can lose about 40% of our skins moisture while we sleep, this Estée Lauder Cream is moisturizing, has anti aging peptides, and replenishes your skin while you sleep. With ingredients like Squalane, Moringa Seed Extract, Hibiscus seed extract, Vitamin C, Algae extract plus anti aging peptides to get rid of fine lines and wrinkles. After using this for a week, my skin is dewier, brighter and more even toned. Loving this new cream! Amazing new Estée Lauder Cream
