I only used this once, and I can’t bring myself to use it again. The added fragrance is so strong, it feels like I’m slathering cologne scented lotion on my face; and it gave me a headache. However, I do think this works well to provide moisture, it feels light at first, but provides a good deal of moisture throughout the day. I’m 40 yo with combination skin, and this did a good job to keep my skin hydrated. If the fragrance wasn’t so strong, or if it was fragrance free, I would continue using this. overwhelming fragrance
