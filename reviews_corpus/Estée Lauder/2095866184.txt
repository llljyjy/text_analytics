I really like this moisturizer. It’s not too thick, makes my skin really smooth. I use it with my fat skin regimen. I’m a fan of Estee  Lauder and this doesn’t disappoint. It’s not fragrance free, but you can barely notice, which is really nice. I don’t have deep set wrinkles but beginning of aging skin, and it’s great for me. Nice crème moisturizer
