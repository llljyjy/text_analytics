This is one of the best moisturizers I’ve ever tried.  It’s got a great consistency that may feel thick but absorbs well.  It’s does leave a sticky residue and it works well under my makeup. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.  I received a sample for my review from Influenster and I’m so glad I got to try it. Great moisturizer
