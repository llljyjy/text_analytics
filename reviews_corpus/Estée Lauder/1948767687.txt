For the past few weeks I’ve been using a deluxe sample that I received from Influenster, and I really enjoy this eye gel-creme. I think it’s helped lessen the fines lines and puffiness overnight, and makes my tiredness not as apparent each day. The texture is very light and glides on with a gentle touch (similar to the Tatcha water cream). I thought I could use this during the day, but it is very much unfriendly to makeup -- it actually repels it (on me at least). The scent is quite minimal and doesn’t irritate my eyes at all. Overall I’m looking forward to continue using this! nan
