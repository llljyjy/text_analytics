I received this product about a week ago. I’ve been using it in my daily routine after washing my face. It’s super creamy, and soft on my skin. My face feels soft and hydrated after using. It does have a slight scent of SPF, as most do that contain it. Once it dried, I couldn’t smell it anymore. I would definitely recommend this product. Makes my skin soft, and protects it!
