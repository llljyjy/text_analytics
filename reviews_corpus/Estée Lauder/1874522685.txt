I received this product free to sample in exchange for my honest opinion.I like this moisturizer it feels good on my skin and is hydrating however the fragrance is a little overpowering and I have noticed a burning sensation after I apply it nothing major though.Overall itâ€™s a pretty good mousturizer. Decent moisturizer
