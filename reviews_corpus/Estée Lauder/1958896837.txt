This is my new holy grail! I have sensitive, acne prone, and combo/dry skin. I tend to get dry patches around my nose and chin but This stuff instantly hydrated it! It doesn’t leave me oily at all. It makes my skin insanely soft- unlike any moisturizer ever has. As for the claims: I honestly noticed significant difference in my fine lines on my forehead within a week (using AM/PM). Obv they are not gone but I don’t look like a pug in pictures anymore. I’ve already recommended this product to my mom and a friend (both have bought it and also notice a difference). My only complaint is the fragrance is pretty strong. It doesn’t bother me but I worry about my skin reacting to it over time. So far it has not reacted badly! But I would love to see this as a fragrance free option!  I received this free from Estée Lauder and Influenster. Holy grail!
