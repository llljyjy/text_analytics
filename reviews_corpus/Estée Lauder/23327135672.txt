Esteé Lauder is one of my favorite brands for everything!  Perfume, makeup, moisturizers! This is a dense moisturizer, but it doesn’t leave the skin oily!  Excellent for dry and mature skin!  I tried it as a makeup primer and it worked really well too!  Another cream for my favorites list! Perfect for mature skin
