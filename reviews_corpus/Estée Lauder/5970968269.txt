This is one of my favorite skin care products to incorporate in my skincare routine. Love how hydrated and soft my under eyes look. Also concealer looks much better after using this repair serum. Itâ€™s really gentle and smells soft. No my dark circles have not gone away but it does make the skin appear more healthier and youthful. I recommend this product. Must have!
