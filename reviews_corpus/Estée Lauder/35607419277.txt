I like this product it works so well at hydrating my under eye area. I like the how the texture is thick but light so it absorbs very quickly. My eyes look brighter and make me look good without my glasses. It doesn’t smell like anything so it’s not irritating my eyes. Overall I liked this product and would recommend to others. Plus it feels good to have something nice in a self care routine. This product was given to me for free by Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my review. Hydrating and Light
