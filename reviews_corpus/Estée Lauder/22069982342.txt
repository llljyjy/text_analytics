I received a sample of this product through Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have been using Estée LauderMicro Essence Treatment Lotion with Bio-Ferment for three weeks now and love the way it makes my skin feel. My skin has been notiveably softer, smoother, brighter - and my fine lines are less noticeable. I’ve also noticed the redness in my skin becoming less noticeable as well. My makeup has applied like a dream since using it, which is an added bonus for sure.While the price tag is a hefty one, I will certainly pick a bottle up when there’s a gift with purchase offered! nan
