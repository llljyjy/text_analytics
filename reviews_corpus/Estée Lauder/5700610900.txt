Received this complimentary from Influenster for my review. I will say the first thing I noticed was the scent. For some reason to me it smelt like what self tanner smells like, which may turn people off. Other than that it went very smooth on my face and felt nice. I didnâ€™t notice any crazy improvement, but I did enjoy the feel on my face. self tanner smell, but good feel!
