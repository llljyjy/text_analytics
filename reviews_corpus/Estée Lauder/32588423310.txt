EstÃ©e Lauder products are good quality for skin care.  In exchange for my honest review I received a free sample from Insfluenster, as part of their promotion.  Itâ€™s the Revitalizing Supreme Youth Power Creme from the EstÃ©e Lauder line, itâ€™s a great moisturizer. The cream is concentrated, I liked that it absorbs quickly and also helps with expression lines. I used it all over my face and in the area of â€‹â€‹the neck, which is an area that we sometimes forget to hydrate. The sample is small, but in a short time, I was able to observe hydration and luminosity in the skin.  This is a product that I would continue to buy to moisturize my skin. Amazing ðŸ¤©
