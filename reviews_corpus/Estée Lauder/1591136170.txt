I received a sample of this from influencer to try, and it actually is better than what I expected. When you open the container and its gold and heavy, you automatically think it’s going to be an old lady product. And I was actually pretty surprised. It does have a fairly strong smell that I’m not a super big fan of, but it does fade fairly quickly. It also appears to be heavy in the jar but it almost melts into your skin. I did not have any reactions or break outs or problems, so that’s a plus.   My skin did end up a little more oily overnight, so so I wouldn’t necessarily pile this on if you’re planning on a full face of makeup through the day nan
