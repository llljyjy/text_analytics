I got this as a sample to test. I am not a fan of anything too greasy esp since I have combination skin, but I am okay with it at night. I did like using this cream. It hydrated my skin.  Obviously no cream will make aging skin look incredible without surgery but this did hydrate and make it look and feel good.  I am not a fan of the price and am not sure I would pay that much for this cream but if you donâ€™t mind then I would say to get it. Very hydrating without being greasy!!
