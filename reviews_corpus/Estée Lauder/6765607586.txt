I have combo skin… but I tend to get dry mid winter and also dry when I have been out in the sun a lot. I take very good care of my skin and I’m very particular about my moisturizer. I’m almost done with my first jar!! I use it day and night, it leaves my skin soft, smooth, moisturized and free of blemishes. I can’t say enough amazing things about it… it’s my absolute fav. I tried many many others including the infamous la mer which made my skin break out horribly. This works great for me!! love love love
