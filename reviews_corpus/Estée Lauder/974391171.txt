I love this eye cream especially in the summer time when my under eye area is so dry. The scent for this cream is light and subtle and I like the gel texture. It wonâ€™t make your skin sticky just moisturizing. This is a great addition to your skincare routine. Hydrating/Great eye cream for the summer!
