I am in my mid 30’s and have dry sensitive skin. My moisturizers of choice are thick and rich and the Estée Lauder Crème certainly delivered. After one use my skin looked hydrated without being greasy and “plump”. Some of the minor wrinkles were also slightly less noticeable. The mist impressing first impression is how quickly it absorbs into the skin. Most rich moisturizers leave behind a film of hydration and skin looks and feels dewy for a while application. This crème still provide deep hydration without greasy skin. The only reason I deducted a star is because I had to use twice the amount that I would use for a similar rich cream. I think because it absorbs so quickly I needed a little more. Rich Moisturizer
