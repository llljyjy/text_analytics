I absolutely love Estēe Lauder! The Micro Essence Treatment Lotion with Bio-Ferment is quickly becoming a favorite addition to my skincare routine as well. With the word lotion in the title for the product one would think it’d be a thicker lotion like consistency but it’s more of a watery type liquid with little to no scent. No complaints here though! Since starting this I’ve noticed a much more softer touch to my skin and it’s very hydrated after each application. And the glow... The glow is almost immediately noticable after applying this formula to my face. Overall I’m very pleased with this product and will be purchasing the full size very soon! Love, Love, Love Estēe Lauder!
