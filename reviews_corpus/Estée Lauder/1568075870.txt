My Thoughts Is this moisturizer expensive, yes. Is it worth it, yes. This is a beautiful formula filled with rich texture and superior ingredients. The hydration is next level. When I first used it I noticed that the product had a delightful light fruit scent followed by a silky feel. My skin felt very hydrated and even after the product absorbed, I noticed my skin felt protected. That is why I had to share a photo of the product giving this almost water repellent seal! The formula really creates a beautiful, lightweight hydration barrier to lock in the benefits. If you swipe you can see a closeup of my lines (which I think Iâ€™ve been able to slow through skincare) If you suffer from dry skin like I do, I definitely recommend giving this product a try.
