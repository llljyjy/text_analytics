I received this product from Influenster and Estée Lauder for free in exchange for my honest review. Honestly? I hate that I LOVE IT SO MUCH! I can’t afford skin care this great! The hydrated feel of my skin after using this cream is unparalleled. I want to throw out everything I have been using and only buy this until I die. I have not ever owned an Estée Lauder product. However, this has started a love affair for me. I would encourage anyone my age (40-ish) to use this. It is such a self care MUST. Great job, Estée Lauder! I hate that I love it!!!
