I am so excited to have been provided a deluxe sample of Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme by Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This product replenishes and revitalizes skin and increases firmness and strength of skin over time. It made my skin feel super soft and smooth to the touch right after the first application, I really like it. This is the first facial product that I have tried with moringa extract and I am excited to see it as an ingredient along with hibiscus morning bloom extract. I cannot yet say if the long term claims are accurate but I do know that Estee Lauder is a good brand that I have used and enjoyed before so I am looking forward to seeing the results. This does have a light, pleasant floral fragrance when it is applied but I didnâ€™t notice it after the creme absorbed. I would recommend this product, I am looking forward to continuing to use it also! So Good!
