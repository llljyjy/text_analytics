I received this sample courtesy of Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  I typically love Estée Lauder product.  In fact, I use the resilience lift day cream just about every single day.  So I was excited to receive this cream.  It has a chemical odor, and it didn’t moisturize my face.  I felt dry and tight after using this two nights in a row, and had to discontinue use.   For someone with oily skin, this may be a hit for you. Not for me
