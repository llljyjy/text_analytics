When I first used this lotion, I noticed my skin felt softer almost immediately, which is a dream for my dry skin. I did find that continued throughout using the sample. I did notice on days I didn’t use it, my skin felt about the same as before using this product. I should note that I only tested out a complimentary sample size, from Influenster and Estée Lauder,  and didn’t have the opportunity to test for as long as I would like, so who knows how that would’ve been long-term. I do like using toners/lotions in my skincare routine and enjoyed this sample, however, I don’t think I noticed an earth shattering difference from other prestige brands that are less expensive. So, I doubt I would spend money on a full-size of this product. It was fun to try though. Just ok.
