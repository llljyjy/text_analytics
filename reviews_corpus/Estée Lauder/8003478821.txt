I receive this product free to trial from Influenster, but all opinions are my own.This moisturizer feels so luxurious. It’s thick and creamy and feels heavy and smooth upon application. However, it doesn’t sit heavy on the skin. It sinks in really nicely and doesn’t leave a stickiness or oiliness. I don’t love the scent and it’s very fragrant. I also don’t know that it feels like it’s very effective at smoothing my skin, however, I’ve only used it for 3 weeks so it may not be enough time to assess that, but I haven’t noticed a visible difference. Overall it’s nice but smells so strongly I wouldn’t want it as a permanent staple in my routine. Feels luxurious, but strongly scented
