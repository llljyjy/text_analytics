I received this product complementary fromInfluenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for myhonest review. I am usually skeptical of anti-aging skincare products but I was pleasantlysurprised by this eye cream. As a mother of aninfant and toddlers, and some one whoremembers the good old dial up Internet days,I’m starting to need a stronger, morecomprehensive skincare regimen. I was lookingfor an eye cream and hadn’t found one I reallyliked, but this may be it. It has a silky gel-likeconsistency, that feels cool initially and for abrief moment. It feels lightweight but still veryhydrating. I tend to have sensitive skin and eyesand it does not irritate me. With 2 weeks ofsemi-inconsistent use (remember I have all thekids), I think I am noticing a subtle difference.Immediately with application my under eye lookshydrated, and my wrinkles may look slightlybetter overall. Great eye gel
