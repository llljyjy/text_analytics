Now that I’m over 40, anything that boasts to be lifting or firming is worth a try ;) That said, I was a little underwhelmed with this cream. It is thick and lux, but way too heavily perfumed for my face. I could smell it on myself all day, as if I had applied a fragrance. It is moisturizing, but I don’t think it offered any more plumping or line minimizing benefit than much less expensive creams. It’s just ok for this price point. nan
