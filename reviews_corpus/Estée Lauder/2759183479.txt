I did enjoy the Est√©e Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Gel-Cream. It was a nice soothing eye cream. I did receive it as a sample in exchange for my honest review and Estee never gives a same big enough to give a teuely accurate long term review. But it seemed nice while I was using it! Nice eye cream
