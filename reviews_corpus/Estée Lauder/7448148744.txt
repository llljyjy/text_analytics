This was a lovely Cream with a very light fragrance that goes on thick, but absorbs nicely into the skin. I used at night and was impressed that despite being so thick, I woke without a greasy, glazed donut like face, which often happens with a thick cream. Instead I woke with my skin softened and plump. The other aspect of this cream.that impressed me is that they offer refills. Thanks Estee Lauder for looking for ways to to reduce packaging nan
