I really appreciate the texture of this eye cream. It is a lightweight, gel consistency yet still hydrating. I like that because I can wear it under makeup and not have it affecting my concealer,etc. I have very dark circles naturally and can’t say I’ve ever used an eye cream that dramatically changed those, including this one, but I do enjoy using them. I would say this is one of my favorites that I’ve used so far! Nice texture!
