I received this product from #influenster in exchange for my honest review. I do like that out is a very lightweight moisturizer from the start. It was extremely e easy to use and took away the need for 2 of my previously used products during my morning routine. My skin felt and looked much more calm, soft and healthy after a very short period of time of using it. The only part I was put of by was the scent. I do not enjoy super fragrant products on my face honestly. I really wouldnâ€™t purchase this in the future because of the scent. Other than that I think this is a very good product. Nicer without the scent
