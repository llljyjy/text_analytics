This is the nicest eye creme i’ve tried! The texture of it is light whipped gel that u only need a little to apply under eyes. Other cremes i’ve tried accentuate the texture under my eyes but this one doesn’t. My under eyes look nice and hydrated the next day. My only qualm is this price is overbearing. Other than that, i love this eye creme!! I received this product for an honest review from Influenster. so nice but so expensive
