I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to do a thorough review from a sample size. I was wrong. I received this product from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I used this for at least 2 weeks and within days felt a dramatic difference in the softness and smoothness of my skin. Very impressive. It is very thick which I didn’t think I’d enjoy because that’s not what I was use to. I found that a little goes along way. I ended up loving the thick texture. It’s luxurious. The scent is light and pleasant. I will be purchasing full size. Softness Galore
