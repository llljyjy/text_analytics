I usually use a serum and a light moisturizer daily. This product was very easy to use and felt nice on my skin. It did not dry too fast. I like the slight scent to it and the fact that it has SPF 15 in it. I use SPF on my face every day. My face is sensitive to new products and this did not break me out. My skin felt very hydrated when it was used. It did not affect the finish of my make up which I wear every day. I enjoyed this product and would buy it again. I received this product complementary for testing purposes. Good hydration
