Wow! I thought I had found my ideal face cream and while I may still keep my trusty regular lotion, this product is going to be an addition to my usual skincare routine. There is something exciting about the feeling of thick cream disappearing to leave my skin in its best form, natural, dewy and supple. Adding to my skincare routine. You should too!
