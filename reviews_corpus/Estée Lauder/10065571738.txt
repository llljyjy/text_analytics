I received this sample for free for my honest opinion. When I first tried the eye cream I notice that the cream is very soft almost silicone texture￼￼￼ and it doesn’t have any smell to it either. It leaves my under eyes feeling hydrating. I have only been using this for a week and haven’t seen any changes yet. Overall, a nice product to use for hydrating the skin. Hydrating
