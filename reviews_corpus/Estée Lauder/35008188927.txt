I recieved this product as a free sample. Overall I liked the feel and did notice it left my skin feeling soft and fresh looking. However, I don’t love scents in my moisturizer- although the scent was fresh and floral I didn’t love it. I also experienced a few breakouts while using it which may be due to my scenitive skin with scents. nan
