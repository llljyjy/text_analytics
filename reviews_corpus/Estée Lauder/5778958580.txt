I received a deluxe sample of this product for free from Est√©e Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really like the way this gel cream sinks into my skin. The texture is smooth and relatively lightweight; the formula is adequately hydrating without feeling heavy. After several weeks of use, the delicate skin around my eyes appears firmer and fine lines softened. It seems to effectively target signs of aging. I am definitely likely to purchase a full size! nan
