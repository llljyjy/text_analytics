I was excited to receive a sample jar of this product to test. I have more recently been using Estēe Lauder eye creams and love the quality of their products. The scent and texture of this face crème is very rich and luxurious. I definitely noticed an increased hydration in my skin but not super hydrated. I feel like it does plump up your skin though and with long term use could help with fine lines. I will continue to use Estēe Lauder products and will consider this the next time I need a new facial crème. Rich Facial Crème
