I am so picky with eye creams. Sooooo picky! I usually don’t like gel based products as much as cream because my skin is like a thirsty desert and other gel products just don’t cut it in terms of hydrating. Now this…this gel-eye cream…it’s AMAZING! It’s incredibly hydrating and completely blew my socks off! I have used it day and night for about a month and I really enjoy it. My under eyes feel plumper and more hydrated and it does well under makeup. 10/10 do recommend, bestie! Holy Hydration, Batman!
