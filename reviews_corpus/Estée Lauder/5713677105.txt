I have acne prone skin and I knew right away the fragrance was going to bother me. I used up the whole sample and while it did make my skin nice and plump, I got major break outs. I normally use the ole henriksen toner for oily skin and will continue that instead. If you’re not sensitive to fragrance and don’t mind a texture that’s a bit sticky, you will love this. I loved the sticky part for under make up, it helped my foundation stick. Not for me!
