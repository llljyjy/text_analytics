This is in my top three favorite moisturizers. There is no strong scent which is a plus, I personally do not like heavily scented products, especially on my face. The cream is thick and absorbs so beautifully. My skin didn’t get thirsty throughout the day. I started using this in the evenings as well just because it’s so rich and really hydrates. Also because it is so rich, a little goes a long way. As I say, just a dot, not a lot! I didn’t notice any firming or lifting, but my skin was beautifully hydrated. I did receive this product as part of a promotion Love her
