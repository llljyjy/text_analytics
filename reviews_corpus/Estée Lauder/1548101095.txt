I really enjoyed the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Eye Repair Creme. It has a gel like texture that is thick yet is absorbed easily into the skin. After a few days of use, I saw improvements when I apply my makeup around my eye area. Makeup didnâ€™t settle into the fine lines and texture improved. I also love the scent but it can be irritating if you have more sensitive eyes. I received a complimentary sample from Influenster in exchange for an honest review.* nan
