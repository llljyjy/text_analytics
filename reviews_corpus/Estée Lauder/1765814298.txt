If you have mature and/or dry skin, I think you would enjoy this. It has a nice thickness and viscosity to it without being greasy or heavy feeling on the skin. It seemed to have a plumping effect on fine lines, and worked well under makeup. This might be too heavy if you have oily skin, especially in the t-zone area. I found the scent to be minimal and faded pretty quickly once on the skin. I used this for a few weeks and didn’t see any overnight miracles, but I think with long term use it could help lessen the appearance of wrinkles and did a good job at providing moisture to the skin. I’m not sure though if it is worth the high price. Good for dry and mature skin
