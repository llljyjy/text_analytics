I I like that this is very lightweight but not watery, the smell is a light floral scent that is not overpowering.  I have tried it for a few days and I like it my skin looks bright and soft with a natural glow I’ve had no breakouts and my skin doesn’t feel tight it feels fresh like it did when I was 25, friends tell me I look like I’ve had a facial and I look rested and refreshed.  As far as youthful I would say that refreshed feeling/look is youthful…but it’s not making me look 21 again.
