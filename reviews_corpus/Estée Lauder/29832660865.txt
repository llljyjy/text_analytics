I love the smell of Estee Luder products, but I didn’t notice any changes. I received a small sample size, so perhaps with continued use I may have had a better experience. It’s a thick cream which takes a while to not feel sticky. I prefer having moisture with a naked skin feel over feeling a residue. nan
