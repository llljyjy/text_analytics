I’m an avid user of any estee lauder product from their skincare to cosmetics to perfume and they never disappoint. They always cater a high quality product like this revitalizing supreme moisturizer. I knew it even from the moment it touches my skin. It’s so moisturizing and hydrating for up to 8hrs. So rich and thick but is not heavy. I just don’t like the sticky part. But all in all it’s a great product An 8hr moisturizing cream
