I received this product complimentary from Influenster to test. This isn’t a lotion, it’s definitely a liquid. I have rosacea and have used this for a couple of weeks now. I wanted to give it a good trial before leaving a review. I use my fingers to apply. A little goes a long way. I noticed softer skin immediately and after a few minutes most of the redness from my rosacea was gone! I have never had a product help the redness before. I do recommend this for fellow rosacea sufferers. Use your fingers to apply, it’ll last a long time. Great for Rosacea!
