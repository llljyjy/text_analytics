I am in my mid 30s and have dry aging skin. My skin has some dark spot and a lot of fine lines. I also just started adding retinol to my skin care routine, so finding a good moisturizer is my main goal nowadays. After receiving the samples from Influenster and have used for couple of weeks, I would like to give my honest review about this cream. The cream is perfect for night since the the texture might be a little bit heavy for the morning. It goes really smooth onto my skin. When I wake up in the morning my skin feel hydrated and all the fine lines look like it’s been smoothed out. I can’t say how it’s in the long run, but i definitely want to continue to use it and recommend it for my friends. Good for night time moisturizer
