I purchased this from a different store than Sephora but thought I would leave my review here . First off this thing cost a hundred dollars with tax . Second there is something odd in the scent of this cream . Third I think it has a tad too much fragrance . The cream feels really good on my face . A nice moisturizer for dry or dehydrated skin . I haven’t used this long enough to tell if it’s helped with signs of aging . I just think the scent needs to go or be reduced at least . Would I recommend ? Uhm if money is no object sure why not . If it is then probably no I’d tell you to go with one less expensive .  3 1/2 Stars ⭐️ nan
