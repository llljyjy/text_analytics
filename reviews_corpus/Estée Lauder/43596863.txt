This went on thick and was extremely moisturizing. I used it for a while and never really felt that it lifted and was only slightly firming. One thing I really disliked was the scent. It wasn’t too powerful but had a generic, floral scent that really bothered me. I used just a little bit each time because a small amount covered a lot of area which was fantastic, but my skin always felt overly hydrated after use. I don’t think this is a bad product in any way, I just don’t think it’s a good product for me & my combination skin. Just OK.
