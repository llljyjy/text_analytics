This is a very thick, scented emollient cream for dry skin. It absorbs well and leaves skin super soft. Of used in the morning, definitely need sunscreen over top. The scent is fresh, and definitely smells “luxury“, so if you are sensitive to scent this might not work.  That said, it is a pleasant scent and not too strong.  My skin always feels lovely after using this. nan
