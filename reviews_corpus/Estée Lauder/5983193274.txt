This eye cream is not heavily fragranced which is the most important factor for me! Also, it did not irritate my sensitive skin. The texture is more of a gel than a cream which applies smoothly and the skin feels soft afterwards. I’m really surprised how much I liked it. I don’t have dark circles so I cannot say whether this works on that. Also, I received this as a test sample so I’m not sure I could afford the full price of the regular size jar. If you can afford it though I do think it’s worth it! Pricey but worth it!
