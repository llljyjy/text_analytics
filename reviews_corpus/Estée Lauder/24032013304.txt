Really was excited to try this cream after receiving a sample of it from Influenster for review purposes. It came in a beautiful little jar. I liked how smooth it felt smoothing it on. I have dry skin and typically like cream formulas but this unfortunately seemed to break me out and that is unusual for me. It also had a pretty strong perfume smell. The biggest negative for me though is that I donâ€™t believe this is cruelty free or vegan. Have to say I was a bit disappointed. Not my cup of tea
