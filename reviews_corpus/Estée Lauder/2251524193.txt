I love the texture and smoothness of this gel cream. It went on really nicely with no tugging at the skin. I didn’t notice a huge difference in my dark circles over 3+ weeks of using but I did see more hydration in my under eye area after use. I think it’s a good cream but a little pricey with little results. Smooth texture, ok results
