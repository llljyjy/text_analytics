I have dry skin so I always look for hydrating products. I thought that this eye gel-cream was very hydrating and lightweight. It also was not sticky. I really liked the gel-like texture so the product was not too thick. I’m lucky in that I don’t really have dark circles normally, so I can’t comment on the effectiveness of that. nan
