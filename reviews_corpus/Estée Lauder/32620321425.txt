I put this on a freshly washed and dried face. In following the instructions, it states to put moisturizer on after this product. I let the product dry and felt residue that mixed into my moisturizer. Leaving a nice smooth feel. Initially putting it on, it’s liquid like water but turns into a lotion. That’s what confused me until I used the product. I do like the way my skin feels and will be adding this to my routine. #complimentary #Influenster #esteelauder Nice addition to my skin care routine
