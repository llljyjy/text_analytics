I actually really do like this serum.  I view bifida ferment lysate as a soothing ingredient.  It possibly has antioxidant and barrier repair properties but I like to think of this as a probiotic soothing skin supplement.  It also has other soothing ingredients like chamomile and bisabolol.  Hydrating ingredients like squalane, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and B5.I am glad this high end brand has dropped the fragrance from this serum.  I do wish they’d also drop the dyes since they don’t serve a real purpose.  I like the natural scent this product has- it’s almost like a gingery Cola smell.I love pairing this serum with other pre and probiotic ingredients like oats, thermal spring water, snail mucin, etc. for soothing the skin.I took one star off for the insane price point.  It’s a good serum but extreme price tags are rarely justified.  There are many other more affordable bifida products on the market that would provide similar results Good serum but expensive
