I received this product to sample from @Influenster. The cream itself feels good and hydrates my face really good. The cream is a bit thicker than I prefer, it makes me feel like a need to use more than usually necessary. And since the sample jar was very small, it only lasted me about 4 days, so I wasnt able to get the full weeks judgement. Overall, I do like @esteelauder products altogether. I don’t think I’d be willing to pay $89+ for a jar either tho. Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Cre
