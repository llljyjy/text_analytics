I was very excited to start using this moisturizer especially due to the winter dry skin I’m experiencing.  Unfortunately the heavy smell lingers all day on me and I will not be able to continue to use this product.  I did like the consistency and feel of the moisturizer and did notice my skin felt great all day with only a few small pimples on my chin which I expect when trying anything new on my face . Overall its a great product for anyone seeking great hydration and soft smooth base for makeup but for me I can’t get past the strong fragrance. Strong fragrance
