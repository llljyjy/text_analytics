I received a small sample of this cream and I’m using it little by little to make it last lol. I love how light it is and the airy barely there fragrance it has. It’s not sticky or cakey. I also didn’t feel like I actually put anything on which I liked. I haven’t been using it long enough to see a major difference yet but I’d definitely buy this again. The only issue with this is the price point for such small amounts are higher than I expected. But with the results expected to achieve I’m thinking it’s worth it. Light and Moisturizing
