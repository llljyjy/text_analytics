I received this product for free in an Influenster Vox Box to give my honest opinion. I used this product for a while and it feels good on my skin. Gave me a bit of a tingling feeling but it absorbed nicely. This is my first time using moisturizer and I definitely would use this again.  I feel protected from the sun with the spf. I break out from the sun so that is important for me. Itâ€™s smooth and not so heavy and greasy. I have dry skin and it still gave me the moisture I needed. I would recommend this. Loved how it feels!
