I received these product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review.I think the product just doesn’t work on my skin. Tested this product out for only 2 weeks since it was a sample size. Usually I would give a product a month of testing. Unfortunately since this was a sample size I didn’t see any extreme results. It’s soothing and hydrating, but overall a very simple eye cream. Maybe I’ll give it a try again. meh
