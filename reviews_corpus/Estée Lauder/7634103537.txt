I received this for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. This eye cream has a very luxurious quality and goes on nice and smooth underneath the eye. The first few times I used it however it did cause some slight irritation but once I began to use it regularly, that went away. It does make my under eyes super moisturized the day after I use it which is great. I don’t think it’s done a whole lot in terms of minimizing the appearance of fine lines but overall I do like this eye cream and the moisturizing qualities it provides. nan
