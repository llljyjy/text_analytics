Estée Lauder always reminds me of a brand my grandmother would use. With that being said, I was still excited to receive this sample for my review. It’s an interesting moisturizer because of its color and consistency. It definitely gives you ‘glow’ vibes as it’s gold and seems ‘shimmery’ almost. It was a nice nightly moisturizer for me, as my skin can get super dry and a lot of stuff tends to pill on me if I’m not careful what skin care items I am mixing. It smells super light but this won’t be something that takes the place of a current product. I was still happy to give it a go ! Not for me
