I received this sample for my honest review from sephora and Influenster. First of all oh my gosh this gel is so silky soft when you put it on and I immediately melts into your skin and absorbs. No greasy feeling. I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my under eye circles. The price might be a bit steep, but it is so worth it, you also use so little it will last along time.
