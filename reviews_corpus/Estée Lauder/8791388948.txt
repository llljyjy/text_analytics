I received a sample of this product through Influenster. As someone who tries to do their part to save the planet I was a little offened by the packing I received this product in. The box was about ten times the size of the small sample. Anyway, the product smells nice and goes on your skin weightlessly, but i really couldn’t see that it made any difference to my skin care routine and I wouldn’t buy it. Can live without it
