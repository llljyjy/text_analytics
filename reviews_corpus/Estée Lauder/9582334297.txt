I received a complimentary sample for my honest review and I’ve been pretty content with this product! It’s got a very hydrating, gel-like feel. It doesn’t make me feel greasy and it does soak in pretty well. There’s no smell I’ve noticed to speak of. My under eyes do feel smoother/softer actually, and a little goes a LONG way so you do get bang for your buck here! Lasts Forever
