I Received this Estee Lauder day wear moisturizer from Influenster. I was skeptical at first because I usually just use the same lotion for my face forever. That being cerave! I wanted to try something with an SPF! I had high expectations, Let me start by saying this lotion smells good. I have combination skin and after using it for one week I have no more dryness. It may be more expensive than my usual lotion but it is so worth it. I will use this going forward. Smells good and got rid of all my flaky skin.
