I received a sample size of this product in exchange for my honest review. Overall, I found the cream very rich and moisturizing, without being too heavy. What I struggled with, however, was the strong powdery-floral scent. It was too strong for me. My skin felt very moisturized and firmer while using - but I did not notice any difference in the fine lines nan
