While I’m only giving three stars it’s not because I don’t like it, it’s because I didn’t have the opportunity to use it longer. I received a sample size from Influenster and it was used up pretty quickly. The product is not too thick which I loved and the scent isn’t too strong. However, I couldn’t wear it at night because I can’t sleep with scented products on me. I do think I’d like it and rate it higher if I had more to use because it did make my skin feel soft and it wore well under makeup. I Wish I Had More to Try
