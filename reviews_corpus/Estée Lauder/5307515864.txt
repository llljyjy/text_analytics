This creme is exceptionally luxurious. There is a light smell but you can hardly tell. Applying it is super easy and goes on smoothy without tugging on my skin. I wanted to test out the full potential of this luxury creme so this was the only change in my skincare routine (only moisturizer I used). After a week my skin looked replenished and revitalize. It definitely feels hydrating. My skin has a soft glow after applying. I did break out with a pimple here and there, I think itâ€™s because of the thicker consistency and hydrating properties that can make it feel heavy in warmer climates. I believe this will be great for cooler seasons to keep the skin hydrated. nan
