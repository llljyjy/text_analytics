I thought this was a great eye cream! It had a pleasant smell that wasn’t overwhelming. The consistency of it was amazing! It’s super lightweight on the skin and didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy afterwards. After consistent use over a few weeks, I did see some improvement with the darkness under my eyes. A little goes a long way as well. This is a product I would definitely use again in the future! nan
