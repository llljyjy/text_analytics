I did not see a difference in my texture or under eye color while using this product. I used it day and night for 2 weeks. I already use high quality eye cream but there is still plenty that could be better. The texture is silky but I did have to use more product than I thought I should need. I don’t like jar products in general if they don’t come with a spatula because it is unhygienic. Fine
