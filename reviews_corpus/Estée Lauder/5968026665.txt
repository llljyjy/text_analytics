Pros:Light airy textureSuper smooth application Helps longevity of make upHas good SPF for winter months Cons: Melon smell is reminiscent of 90s bath and body worksI prefer a higher spf, like 30 I would definitely recommend this product for someone looking for a light day moisturizer to wear under foundation. I would definitely caution if you are sensitive to fragrances. Good overall!
