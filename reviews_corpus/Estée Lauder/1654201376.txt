This is one of the best skincare products for the eyes I’ve ever used! I was first struck by its amazing texture. Gel-crème is the perfect description. It is very reminiscent of a gel but has so much more hydration. It has a very silky smooth glide to it that quickly sinks into your skin so beautifully and leaves it feeling so soft. The slight bounce of the gel-crème transfers onto the skin restoring elasticity and leaving it looking plump and supple. I do admit I was a little hesitant of the capabilities of this product when I first heard the name as I typically don’t like gel products (they’re too lightweight for me), but this one is completely different. It’s lightweight yet deeply hydrating and makes my eyes look so youthful! There’s no scent, no irritation, no stinging, nor any kind of adverse reaction. Just supple goodness. A really impressive product that I highly recommend! One of the best
