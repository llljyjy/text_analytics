I got a sample of this to try. It was fairly small so I didn’t get to use it long enough to see any dramatic changes. However, it did not pill for it to be a gel cream with a slight silicone feel. It did layer well with other products. I have combo dry skin and I did notice that the hydration did not last me all day. Maybe half of the day. I never have that issue with my current moisturizers. I thought the smell was fairly light and not offensive. I just wish it was more hydrating and longer lasting. It’s okay
