I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I like the gel consistency of this eye cream. It is cooling, soothing and hydrating. It is somewhat thick but not sticky and it seeps into the skin nicely. Iâ€™m not sure if it helped with dark circles because I used a caffeine eye cream in the morning, however it definitely made my eyes look hydrated. nan
