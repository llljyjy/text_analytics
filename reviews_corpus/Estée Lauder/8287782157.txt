I received a sample size to trial and I initially didn’t know if I would be able to give a great review. I was surprised how far this actually goes. I’ve been using the sample daily for almost 3 weeks, a little goes a long way. I haven’t really noticed more “glow” but my skin feels so much smoother. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy and the fragrance is very nice. nan
