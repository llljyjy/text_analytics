This is a nice, thicker moisturizer that I used mainly at night. I found it was too thick for my daytime use but felt amazing after my nighttime routine steps. It does have a slight fragrance but it didn’t bother me or my skin. It absorbed nicely without feeling heavy or super greasy either. I can’t say I noticed many differences in my skin in terms of what it claims to do since I received  sample size. The price point is a little steep for me to repurchase but seems appropriate for this brand. nan
