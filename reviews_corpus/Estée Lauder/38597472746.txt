I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this product for about a month now. While I have seen a difference in hydration, I have not seen much in the reduction of my dark circles. I do however appreciate the difference it has made in the overall hydration around my eyes. I still have product left, so I’ll continue to use what I have and decide to continue on. Sticker price is a bit of a shock, but a little goes a long way, so I imagine it’ll be worth the price. Great hydration
