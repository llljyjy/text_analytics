I have combination skin with fine lines in my forehead and eye areas and a tendency to break out in my t-zone. As the sample size provided only offered me the opportunity to apply it a few times, I’m not sure about the long-term effects. However, I really liked it based on my short experience with the product. It has an incredibly rich texture but goes on smoothly at the same time. It’s very hydrating, but I stayed away from the lower half of my face, as I’m battling some maskne. It provided nice hydration to my neck area as well. I would definitely be interested in using this moisturizer in the future, but until then, I’ll continue using Lancôme. Velvety smooth richness!
