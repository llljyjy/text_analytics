I received a complimentary sample size of this product from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. The consistency of the cream felt like a combination of a cream and a serum. A little bit definitely goes a long way. I only used it in the morning; however, I have noticed that my skin looks firmer and more hydrated. My skin does look more healthy since I started using this cream. I would definitely recommend this product and am considering buying some once itâ€™s back in stock. nan
