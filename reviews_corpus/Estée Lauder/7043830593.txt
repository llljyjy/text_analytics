I received a sample size to test and give my honest review on. I’ve purchased Estée Lauder skincare in the past and the youth creme has the same consistency as their other day creme, but I have noticed that the scent is a bit lighter.Like most Estée Lauder products there is definitely a specific scent that is unique to their products. I’ve noticed the few days I’ve used it that it feels great on my skin and gives my skin a kind of silky soft texture and is great to use before makeup application or great to use if you are using any foundation at all. Would definitely recommend using their serum alongside with it both together like how it’s recommended with their other supreme plus creme. A great cocktail of skincare products. Estée Lauder never ceases to amaze me with their skincare products and after trying this sample, it looks like I’ll be purchasing the full size to add to my skincare routine. Another great Estée Lauder creme
