I received this product free for testing purposes from Estes Lauder and Influenster and am happy O had a chance to try it. I loved the texture and the hydrating properties of this moisturizer. After using it for two days, I started breaking out thought and I noticed that my skin was oilier than normal. In the end, I decided it was not great for me. Might be best for drier skin
