I received a free trial sample of this product In exchange for my honest review. It is more of a gel consistency than a lotion consistency. I got a TINY container that I was able to use for approx 8 days. It didn’t crust or pill. My eyes felt more moisturized but I don’t know that I can claim any of the other benefits that are listed for this product. I wish I received a larger sample that I could have tried for a month or so to give a real review. Hydrating
