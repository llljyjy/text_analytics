I received the Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Creme as a sample to review.  I thought the creme was very moisturizing to my eye area.  I didn’t really see any differences in minimizing fine lines during my sample period.  I did love the application of the cream, it dries quickly with no extra residue or stickiness.  There was no tightening feeling at all under my eyes.  would continue to use this creme due to the moisturizing affects alone. Wonderful eye creme
