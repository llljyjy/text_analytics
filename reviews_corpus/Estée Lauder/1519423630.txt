I used this eye cream for about 2 weeks. I have combination skin, so for me, I felt that it was a bit heavy and it caused some milia around my eyes. It was moisturizing but stopped using it as it doesn’t suit my skin type. It didn’t help my undereye circles at all. Best for Dry/Normal and Not Combination Oily Skin
