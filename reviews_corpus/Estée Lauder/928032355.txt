It’s just OK I suppose. I’m not a big essence user, so receiving this free product for testing purposes was lost on me. My skin felt nice enough after using it but I didn’t see any new amazing clarity or glow or any such things. I will also say, I got a few pimples...however I cannot positively say it was this essence. It could have been that I was approaching my monthly cycle (even though I haven’t really been having problems with that in quite some time). I would not purchase this on my own. Just OK; nothing stellar
