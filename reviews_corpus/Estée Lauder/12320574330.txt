I received a sample free from influenster for my honest review. I’m impressed with the texture and hydration of this cream, especially because it has SPF. I have dry sensitive skin and I hate products that leave a film or pill up. This has a great texture and went on smooth. I was initially a little shiny, but it absorbed quickly. It felt light, but I was surprised to find that my cheeks were still smooth at the end of the day. I’m considering purchasing if I don’t end up having a reaction to the cream with continued use. Nice texture
