There’s a lot of science that goes into this moisturizer that pulls from nature’s Hibiscus Morning Bloom and the miracle Moringa. However, I leave the science to Estee Lauder and I simply reap the benefits of applying this “supreme“ moisturizer each morning and night. This isn’t my first time trying this powerful addition to my skincare routine, and it won’t be my last. My skin is visibly brighter and more lifted. It hydrates without making my oily skin problematic and I love the soft, fresh scent. A little goes a long way, well worth it for this luxurious cream. Perfection in a jar
