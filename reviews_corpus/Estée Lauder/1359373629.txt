I’m finding it difficult to review this product. I received a sample size, so I don’t think I can give a 100% fair assessment of it’s continued use. In addition, I received a different product at the same time that is supposed to be used just like this. So I’ve been juggling the two. with that said, this product is a very light to the touch cream. It feels cloudy and non greasy during application. It’s completely scent free which is nice. My skin feels silky smooth after immediate application. nan
