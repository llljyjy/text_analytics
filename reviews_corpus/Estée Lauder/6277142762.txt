Overall, I really enjoyed this eye cream. A little goes a long way. The best part for me, besides knowing I’m fighting dark circles and wrinkles, is that it applied evenly, smoothly, and dried down quickly/nicely. I cannot stand eye products that feel oily and heavy, and this blended in so nicely and did not leave an icky feeling. It’s an easy step to my nightly routine that I will continue using, and I found that the claims are pretty true so far. nan
