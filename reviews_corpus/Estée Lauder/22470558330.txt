I received the Estee LauderMiicro Essence Treatment Lotion with Bio-Ferment free for review. That in no way changes my honest opinion of this product.First impression: the package in a nice heavy frosted glass bottle, but nothing special. There is absolutely no scent to the product what so ever, so if you are fragrance sensitive this would be a great option. It came with no directions for use. I understand this is a sample of the product, but I would have thought directions would have been printed on the bottle. If not, have an insert in the packaging explaining how to use this product.This product is marketed as a “lotion“ and it definately is not! It is like water! Infact the #1 ingredient is water. I will say that it did absorb very quickly into my skin without leaving any sort of heavy feeling or tacky-ness left behind. It also did seem to leave my skin looking hydrated.Overall: for the price and consistancy of the product I would pass and reach for another moisturizer that I like much much better. It's okay
