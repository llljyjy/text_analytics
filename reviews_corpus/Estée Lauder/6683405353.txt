got this as either a sample with an order here or it was one of the reward bazaar items--i don’t remember. i often forget i have it, but if my skin is angry i use this before bed and wake up noticeably healed. i only have a bit left and came to the page to see about buying more. it’s mad expensive but a little goes a long way. i had the mini size for a long time now, apply it when your face is damp for maximum spreadability. if i were rich i might use it every night! healing, but $$$$
