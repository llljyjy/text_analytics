This treatment lotion has more of a water-based feel to it, the word “lotion“ in the product name makes you think otherwise. It’s almost scentless, and doesn’t have much substance to it in the bottle. I used a cotton round to apply to my face in the evening after showering and didn’t use any other moisturizers or products to see what this would do. It felt nice and cool going on, and you can tell when you’re applying it but I have to say my skin didn’t feel more moisturized or that it really seemed to affect random redness to my skin. I have really, really dry skin though so maybe this level of moisture is better for someone who doesn’t need much and has more oily skin. I regularly apply oils just to keep my skin from being flaky. I think if you need serious moisture this probably isn’t the product for you. Light But Not a Lotion
