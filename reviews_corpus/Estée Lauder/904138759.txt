I was pleasantly surprised by this moisturizer!  It left my skin hydrated but wasn’t an overly dewy finish. Looked great under foundation and tinted moisturizer, gave my skin a nice glow when worn alone. One star off for the fragrance - it wasn’t quite as bad as I was expecting, but I don’t like skincare that is perfumed in any way. nan
