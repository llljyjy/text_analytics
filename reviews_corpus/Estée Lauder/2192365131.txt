The Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-Crème is that helps repair the visible signs of sleep deprivation, UV, pollution, etc.  It claims to reveal a visibly hydrated look for under the eye area.  It repairs the look of eye dryness, lines, and puffiness.  Some featured ingredients include peptides and hyaluronic acid, which is known to hydrate the skin.  Personally, I experience eye dryness under my eyes, so I was excited to put this product into use.  Upon opening, I didn’t notice a strong scent, which is perfect for people like me with sensitive under-eyes.  I quickly noticed that a little goes a long way with this product.  I applied the eye cream to my under-eye area, and I immediately could tell a difference in hydration.  My under eyes felt hydrated, and I also didn’t experience any irritations under the eyes. Since using this product, I make sure to apply it during the morning and nights.  I believe that with continued use, I will see a huge difference in my under-eye appearance.  All in all, I really enjoyed using this product, the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-Crème, and I would highly recommend this product to my family and friends.
