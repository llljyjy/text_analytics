I received this item complimentary of Influenster and Estée Lauder. I really wanted to love this product. It’s smelled good, was light weight and great for summertime moisture, but it just do it for my skin. If my skin isn’t hydrated enough it will start to overproduce sebum in some areas to compensate for the dryness. So when I started getting oily mid day, I knew that this just wasn’t for me. nan
