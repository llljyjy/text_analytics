This treatment lotion does wonders at balancing and calming my skin. Itâ€™s a watery toner consistency that I dispense in my hands and press into my skin. It absorbs quickly,there is no stickiness. Most importantly it does not aggravate/cause acne (does not react to any other skin care products I have either/layers well with other products). The pores on my upper cheeks area have shrank or tightened, I will be ordering a large bottle of this product. Obsessed
