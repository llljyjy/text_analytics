Great feel, mixed effectiveness. The feel of this cream is very soft gel like. It feels very luxurious and is easy to apply. I appreciate the it is in a jar so you can get every last bit since it’s so expensive. I haven’t seen many changes in my eye area, but I’ve only been using it a few weeks. It is very moisturizing, so I would recommend it for dry skin. I haven’t noticed any changes to my dark circles yet, but will keep using it. Great feel and texture
