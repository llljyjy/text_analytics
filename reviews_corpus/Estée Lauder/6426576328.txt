I received a sample of this product complimentary for review and I am absolutely loving it. My skin is naturally quite dry and tight, but this gives a beautiful hydration immediately upon application. I apply it after cleansing my face both morning and evening. Even after the first application my face seemed more youthful, and now that I have been using it for a couple of weeks I see an even more dramatic difference. My (47 -year-old) skin looks soft and luminescent,  with more color and elasticity than it has had for some time. Itâ€™s quite fun to see. While I have alway used some sort of moisturizer,  I love the hydration and results I am seeing with this one; it is very impressive. Beautiful results for Beautiful skin
