Used a trial size, this was excellent for my super duper dry and sensitive skin. My skin is the desert in the wintertime and this was so refreshing. Iâ€™m not a big fragrance person and this did have a strong perfume like smell but that is my only complaint! It feels really nice on and absorbs by the morning great for my dry skin!
