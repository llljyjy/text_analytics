A nice, light consistency. Not quite watery, has a bit of viscosity, but thin and serum-like on the skin. No scent which I appreciate. Goes on well under moisturizer without feeling heavy or sticky. Seems to improve the appearance of fine lines, especially around my mouth. Iâ€™d get this again! Light and effective
