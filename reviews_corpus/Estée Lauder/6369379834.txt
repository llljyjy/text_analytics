I have received this moisturizer in exchange for for a review. At first I was concerned about a possible breakout that this would cause as I am in the middle of a health journey and one of the consequences is possible breakouts due to temporary increased oil production. Thankfully I have not experienced that issue with this moisturizer.  The scent is delicate and not overpowering. Texture wise, it does not leave a greasy film and dries after a few minutes. Highly recommended! nan
