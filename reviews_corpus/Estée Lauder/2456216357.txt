This moisturizer has a rich, satiny consistency and makes the skin feel instantly hydrated. It blends in easily. It has a slight scent, clean and unoffensive. Because of the creme texture I used it in the evening. The next morning after using it, my skin felt smooth and still super hydrated. As someone with dry skin, I enjoyed this moisturizer and would recommend trying it! nan
