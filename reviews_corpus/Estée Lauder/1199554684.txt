I’ve used similar essences from Tatcha and Sulwasoo. Like this product, they are made in Japan where they are much more strict about the quality and purity of ingredients. This is similar. It has a watery consistency and has a bit of slip to it. It dries down non tacky. It’s aim is to soothe and hydrate your skin in preparation for serums and moisturizers. My sample was too small for me to notice a difference. I will say the pinkness in my cheeks from retinol use toned down with use - but I can’t be certain if the other claims. The ingredients are good. Nice essence
