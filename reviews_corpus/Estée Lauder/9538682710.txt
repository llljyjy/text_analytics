I received this moisturizer complementary from Influenster and Est√©e Lauder to provide an honest review. The scent is delicate and nice yet not overwhelming. The moisturizer is not too thick or too thin. It works well and leaves my face hydrated. I am using this in the summer and it is great for summer. I am not sure if it is heavy enough to use in the winter when skin is generally drier. My skin feels smoother and softer in the morning after using overnight. I will purchase!
