I am always a little wary of eye creams because it always feels like an overpriced moisturizer in a small container. But this eye cream surpassed my expectations. It was super hydrating and absorbed into my skin nicely. It wasn’t tacky like other eye creams can be and I love that it wasn’t heavily scented since my under eye area is very sensitive. It didn’t completely erase my dark circles, but it did reduce their appearance by making my under eye area appear more plump and hydrated. I will definitely continue to use this product. Very hydrating
