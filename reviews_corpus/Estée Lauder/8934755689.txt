I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. And, I can’t say how thankful I am that I did. Moisturizer is part of my every day routine. After all, my skin is sensitive to everything and I’m not getting any younger. Yet, finding one that doesn’t break me out can be tough. Much to my surprise, this actually cleared up a breakout I was experiencing. I didn’t notice that right away but after three or four days of using it, I noticed I hadn’t messed with the breakout, nor was it noticeable anymore. It’s light and not all greasy; I didn’t mind applying it. Only downside is that is a stronger smelling product than I normally use. Not saying it’s a bad thing but just something to bear in mind. Overall, I would love for this to be a staple in my routine! Solid product for sure! Love it!!!
