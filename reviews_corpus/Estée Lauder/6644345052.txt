This moisturizer is a little thick when it goes on, but once it’s absorbed it makes your skin feel silky smooth and hydrated. The scent is a cucumber-like smell. It’s a little much which is why I am not giving it 5 stars. I have combination skin and it doesn’t seem to make me oily. Unsure how it does under makeup and I typically don’t wear it on the regular.
