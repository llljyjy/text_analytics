I received a small sample of this crème from Influenster. While I enjoyed this product, the sample was only 5 ml so I only had a couple days’ worth to use, which makes it difficult to assess the effects and results. I did like the texture of the cream, and with ingredients like cactus cell stem extract and hyaluronic acid, this is very nice and hydrating. A Nice Cream
