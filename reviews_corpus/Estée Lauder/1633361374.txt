I received this eye cream as a free sample in exchange for an honest review. I think it has definitely reduced my dark circles and made me look “less tired”. I am hoping over time my fine lines around my eyes will be diminished. I have only been using the product for ~1month. It does burn my eyes sometimes, so I use it every other night. A little bit goes a long way- good consistency and absorbs well.  Would recommend! Good Eye Cream
