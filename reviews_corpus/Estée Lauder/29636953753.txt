I received a free sample so is hard to leave a more detailed review. But the little bit that I was able to use I can say that I like it.  I like the texture is very light not thick or sticky. Love how smooth it leaves my skin. I love the smell it smells really good.  I also love how gentle it is on the skin for someone that has sensitive skin to fragranced products.   I will most defenitely continue to use thus product am excited to see the end results. Based on the what I was able to experience with estee lauder revitalizing supreme plus face cream I will most defenitely recommend this product. Great product
