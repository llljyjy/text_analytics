I received a sample sized Advanced Night Repair Eye Gel-Cream from Influenster to review. I have to say soon as I applied it to my undereye I could feel it work.There was a slight tingle and cooling feeling! I used this for about a month and definitely have seen a different in my overall appearance of the fine lines and puffiness.The texture is a light Gel like substance. I have already ordered a full size. I definitely suggest giving it a try if this is something you were thinking about using.  Itâ€™s definitely very effective and feels good on your under eyes!
