I received this complimentary product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This moisturizer did a great job on my very dry skin, although I have not seen any tightening of lessening off fine lines yet.  The product is thick, light, and absorbs very quickly. Donâ€™t let the small container fill you -  a little of this product goes a very long way. Overall, a very effective moisturizer for dry skin. Great moisturizer
