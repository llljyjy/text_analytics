I expected this product to work well because I currently use the Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Products. The moisturizer was instantly hydrating and my skin retained the moisture all day. The moisturizer is not super heavy and it absorbs quickly into skin. It’s a great addition to my skin care routine. nan
