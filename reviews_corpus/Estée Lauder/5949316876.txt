I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I am an Asian American woman in her upper 30s with combination skin. As I age, I notice that my dry spots get drier and some hyperpigmentation around my cheekbones that really “pops” if I spend any time in the sun. My usual routine includes a niacinamide serum from The Ordinary, a salicylic lotion, cerave cream, and a Neogen sunscreen (spf 50). I was excited to simplify this routine by eliminating the cerave cream and sunscreen and replacing it with one product.Pros- the cream provides ample moisture without feeling greasy or heavy. My skin felt balanced throughout the day and eliminating one step in my routine was great.Cons- low spf. I tend to purchase Asian (mainly Korean) branded sunscreen because I find they are high spf, odorless, and affordable. American branded sunscreen products are often low spf and have a distinct sunscreen smell that I dislike. Unfortunately, while the smell was faint, I could still detect it which kind of spoiled the product for me. Additionally, an SPF 15 feels too low and I would like to see more American products with spfs of 30 and higher. Good as moisturizer, mediocre as a sunscreen
