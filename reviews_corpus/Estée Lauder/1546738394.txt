I really loved this moisturizer! It’s very lightweight but moisturizing. It has a nice cucumber and aloe smell which is very light and fades quickly. It doesn’t absorb super quickly but also not slowly. A little goes a long way so I used another SPF on top.  I had no problem using it under makeup. My skin felt so soft and plump using this! I didnt notice any huge differences but my skin loved it. I didn’t gwt the flaking feom using a mask all day like I normally do. nan
