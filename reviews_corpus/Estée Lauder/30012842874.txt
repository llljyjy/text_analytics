I received this product complimentary from Estee Lauder and Influenster for my honest review. I received a .24oz sample so I must say I didn’t use it very long, but a little goes a long way, so I achieved twice a day for about a week. I have combination skin, and I regularly use toner in my skincare regimen, and I must say this essence is on my list to fully try! It is lightweight, soaks right into your skin, and they aren’t lying about the hydration, you can feel it immediately. The way the texture of my skin started to change I truly believe with the proper time the results they are aiming for will be achieved. Can't wait to add it to my routine!
