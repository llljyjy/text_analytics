I received this product complimentary. I have perpetually dry skin and am 50. I have a skincare regimen in place that includes, among other things, moisturizer.The thing that stunned me with the Revitalizing Surpreme+ was that when I used it overnight, the next morning my skin actually felt like I’d used an overnight mask!This moisturizer definitely is fragrant, and, even with my head acting up with scent sensitivity was still at a level I was fine with and I did not feel a need to chill it to reduce it.Overall, I’d definitely recommend it. Who needs a sleep facial mask?
