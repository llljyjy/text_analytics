I received a sample of this produce from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Overall, I really enjoyed how hydrating this gel cream felt on my skin! The texture of the product is light, refreshing and absorbs nicely. I do have some fine lines and slight dark circles. This is a lovely high end night cream, but I did not see much of a change in the appearance of my skin during the month I used it. nan
