I’ve been using this a few times a week and have noticed minor improvement in the concerns I have around my eyes (dark circles, puffiness, and fine lines). I wouldn’t go out and buy one myself, but it’s a good formula to have in my skincare routine while I find a better eye cream. I received this product from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. Feels very nice
