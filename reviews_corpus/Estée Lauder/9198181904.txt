I didn’t expect much from this eye cream in terms of helping with dark circles. However I noticed a significant difference from the very first few uses. It works incredibly well to firm the under eye area but also reduces dark circles which is pretty impressive. Most eye creams on the market make such claims, but aren’t honest. So I’m throughly impressed with this eye cream. It works great for my oily skin with the gel texture. Holy Grail of eye creams
