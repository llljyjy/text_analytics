This is a nice, light moisturizer. I noticed a small amount of foundation pilling around my nose when it was applied after the moisturizer. I was careful to let it soak in fully before applying foundation, so itâ€™s something to watch out for. I did enjoy it on no-makeup days, my skin felt very hydrated. nan
