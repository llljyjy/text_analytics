I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ll preface by saying I have extremely dry skin. When I put this cream on, it went on very smooth. A little goes a long way so use sparingly. Results weren’t immediate, but I did feel like my skin was more hydrated after a few days. It seems to have helped with the bags under my eyes. I have not noticed a difference in the fine lines, but that may change with regular use. Overall, I would recommend this eye cream! nan
