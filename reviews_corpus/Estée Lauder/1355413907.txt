Estée Lauder’s new Advanced Night Repair Eye Gel-Creme is a thick, moisturizing eye cream to target under eye fine lines and dark circles. I liked the feeling of this gel creme on my skin. The packaging instructs to apply AM and PM, but only apply it at night as I don’t think it would set well under my makeup during the day. I think after regular use of this gel creme I would see noticeable differences in my dark circles - but for now I’m content with the moisturizing benefits! Mouisturizing Under Eye Night Creme
