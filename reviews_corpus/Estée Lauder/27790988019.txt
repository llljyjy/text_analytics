I received a free sample from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I liked that this didn’t have a scent and the feel was pretty close to Vaseline. However, I also didn’t really notice any changes after using this over the course of a few weeks. No burning or negative effects though. I don’t normally use a separate eye cream with my usual face cream, so I probably wouldn’t buy. nan
