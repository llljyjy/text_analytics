First of all I have oily skin, but have been using retinols, so I was a little dry. I used this product in he AM, it was very hydrating. I thought it would leave me greasy, but I was just the right amount of suppleness. There was no stinging, no strong scent. No breakouts. I will continue to wear this and review. Long wearing moisture
