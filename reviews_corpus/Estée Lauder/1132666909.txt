I didn’t hate it but it didn’t really do anything for me.  While it was quite hydrating and made my skin feel soft there was no visible change. The sample I received was small so many after longer use you could see something but nothing was noticeable.  I used it twice a day for about a week.  You don’t need much, a little goes a long way. Hydrating but no difference
