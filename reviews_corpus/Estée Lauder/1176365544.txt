I love EL products and been using the ANR serum for years. That being said, this Revitalizing Supreme+Youth Power Cream is another great product from EL! The cream texture is velvety and glide easily on my skin. Unfortunately, the sample was too small to tell the difference on my fine lines. I felt like this cream wasnâ€™t providing enough hydration for my skin during winter. I will try a full size product in the future though! nan
