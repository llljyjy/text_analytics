This is a great cream if you enjoy thick and creamy textured moisturizers. I really enjoyed it as a night cream since I enjoy this kind of texture for sleeping. I have dry combination skin so I really enjoy this as a night time moisturizer. It is heavy and it feels quite oily which for me is a plus, but keep that in mind as it might not be ideal for more oily prone skin. My skin feels ver hydrated, glowy, plumper after using it for a week. Honestly I didnâ€™t see any minimizing of lines but the sample I received only had enough for a couple of uses. It also has a nice light and elegant fragrance that I really enjoy. nan
