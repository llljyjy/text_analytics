I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. I have to say, I’m not really a fan of eye creams. I find most creams are too greasy which causes my eye makeup to crease too. However this is a gel with a cream like consistency that glides on smoothly and it’s hydrating. It doesn’t affect my makeup application. So far I really like it! nan
