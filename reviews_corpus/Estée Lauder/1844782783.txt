I received a sample to try and was skeptical on how long it would last. Boy was I surprised! It has a smooth creamy consistency. I really did not have to use a whole lot to get coverage. It left my face feeling smooth and hydrated. I do have fine lines and wrinkles and I think I seen some improvement but not much. Really hard to tell, wish I was able to sample longer. nan
