I received this product complimentary from Estee lauder and influenster for my honest review. First off I really like that the scent is not overwhelming in any way, it is light and fresh smelling. When I first felt the thick texture of the cream I figured that it might not sink in all the way and cause pulling with my foundation because itâ€™s a very rich cream but to my surprise it was soaked in only minutes after applying and my skin felt very soft and supple. I had no issue with pulling with either foundation I tried with it. My skin type is typically pretty dry and this gave me much needed hydration without feeling heavy in any way. All around a really good moisturizer. Really like this for my dry skin!
