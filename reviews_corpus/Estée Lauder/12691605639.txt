This has a nice scent and is thick and creamy. It didn’t feel heavy on my face though. I received this as a sample so didn’t get to use it long enough for true results but when I did use it my skin felt a tad tighter. However,  it did break me out which I’m not prone to. Not a bad product its just not good for my skin unfortunately. Works well.
