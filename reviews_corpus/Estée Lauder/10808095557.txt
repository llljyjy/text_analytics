I quite enjoyed the cream. It felt very luxurious and felt great on my skin. As for the benefits I did not notice anything but I also did not have it for a lengthy period of time. I would recommend this cream to friends who have drier skin than I do. I say this because it did seem to appear and feel oiler on my skin than my usual moisturizer. Overall it is a great feeling product that I would suggest people I know to try out for at least 2 months to see a change, if any. It was a nice moisturizer
