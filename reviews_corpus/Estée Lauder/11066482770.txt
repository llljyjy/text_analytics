Because of chronic health problems skin is highly sensitive and very dry reactive. Most acids not able to tolerate. Drs recommend VERY EXPENSIVE fancy products. Good news is this product works well for me about 60% less cost than other recommended products. It is heavier but for my very dry skin just drank it up with no clogged pores or grease issues.  Did help with firming and discoloration but also must use SPF 45 underneath. Appreciate High Quality and Function for Less
