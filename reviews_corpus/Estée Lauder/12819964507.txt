I got this to try and give my review.Honestly I really liked the texture, it does not have an scent which is great. Is not oily and feels great on the eye area, very delicate and smooth, I believe that the gel formula has a lot do with it.My biggest concern was the fine lines, because I do not really have dark circles, but every once in a while when I get those it does work. Great
