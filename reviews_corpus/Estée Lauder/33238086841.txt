I’ve tried all different kinds of eye creams for my dark circles. I like the feel of this one going on. It’s soft and doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky. However, I didn’t see much of a change in my dark circles after using it for a couple weeks. Maybe a tiny bit better. I don’t have wrinkles so I can’t comment on that. nan
