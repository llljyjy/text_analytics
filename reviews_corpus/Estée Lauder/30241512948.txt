I received a free trail of this product in exchange for my honest review. Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme + Youth Power Creme has a lightweight, silky texture with a soft subtle scent. I like to use it at night because of its anti-aging properties. I wake up with soft, smooth and supple skin. This moisturizer is infused with Moringa, Hibiscus Morning Bloom, Cactus Stem Cell Extract and Hyaluronic Acid. Moringa and Hibiscus Morning Bloom give my skin a more youthful appearance. Cactus Stem Cell Extract helps to reveal a stronger and more nourished skin. Hyaluronic Acid attracts and retains water to increase moisture in skin. It’s hydrating and absorbs well into into the skin without leaving any greasy residue behind. My face is firmer, smoother and hydrated. My skin feels so soft and supple. After using it for one week I’ve seen significant improvements. My fine lines and wrinkles feel smoother. It doesn’t clog my pores or break me out. It also plays well with my other skincare products. Overall this is a great moisturizer. I highly recommend it !! Amazing !
