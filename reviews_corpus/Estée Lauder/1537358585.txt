Compared to other creams I’ve tried, this isn’t much different. It did make my skin more hydrated, but it seemed to only be temporary. It’s a thick formula without a distinct scent to it. My sample was too small to notice any skin improvements. I wouldn’t particularly recommend it, but I also don’t hate it. It does the job, but my preference is a lighter cream.#complimentary #EsteeLauderxInfluenster @Influenster @esteelauder nan
