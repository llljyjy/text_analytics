I personally donâ€™t believe any eye cream or gel can lighten dark circles or lighten fine lines but this does help smooth out the under eye area. It has a velvety gel like texture that dries quickly and wears well underneath make up. It also hydrates the area pretty well. So all in all this is a pretty decent eye gel when compared to many others I have tried and I would recommend it. nan
