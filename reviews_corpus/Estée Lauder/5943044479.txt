I received this eye cream as a sample to test out and have been using it at night for a few weeks now. It is very rich and moisturizing which I like for my drier skin. I feel that it smooths out fine lines and leaves the under eye area hydrated in the morning. I unfortunately havenâ€™t noticed much improvement in my dark circles or puffiness. Worth a try!
