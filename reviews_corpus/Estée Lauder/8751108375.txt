I like the packaging of the tiny glass bottle which makes using the cream very easy till the last use. The texture is smooth and creamy making application easy and the cream itself is effective. I could see the difference with just a few uses but the size is too small and the dark circles are still there with the cream being almost over. For $70 I would expect either faster and lasting results or a bigger size of the bottle. Tiny but mighty
