This moisturizer cream definitely makes your face feel tight upon first treatment. So much so that I accidentally got some on my eyelashes and most likely in my eye and it has felt awful all day! Thatâ€™s why I give it 4 stars. Aside from my clumsy mistake, my face has felt moisturized and taught. The perfect firm!
