This is creamy and smooth without leaving an oily feeling. It absorbs quickly and kind of just melted into my skin. I have combination skin that tends to be more oily. This left my skin feeling hydrated during our cold winter but didnâ€™t leave me feeling more oily than usual. I used at night as I do with any moisturizer and it felt like it helped throughout the day without reapplying. Fragrance is low on the ingredients list but the scent was strong, not bad just stronger so those with absensitive should be aware. Soft and smooth
