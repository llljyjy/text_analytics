So glad I received this cream to test in exchange for my honest review. Let’s start with my skin type. I’m in my late 30s and have combo Hispanic skin. At my age my main concern is minimizing wrinkles, moisturizing and having radiant skin. I usually wear two different moisturizers in the AM and PM but Estée Lauder hit it out of the ball park with the revitalizing supreme moisturizer. I apply it morning and night. But my absolute favorite time is in the AM under my makeup. It leaves my skin velvety soft and my makeup sits so well on top. The texture is almost of a makeup primer but you can feel it moisturizing at the same time. There is no scent if you worry about that. My skin always looks radiant and I feel/see that’s it’s starting to minimize my large pores. I’d definitely recommend to anyone and will continue to repurchase. Filter skin
