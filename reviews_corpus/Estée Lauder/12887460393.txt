From the texture & scent to how instantly you can see results how easy it is to squeeze into your daily regiment... this is an all around amazing product in my eyes. I received this product for free for an honest review. Estee lauder hardly ever disappoints in my eyes. The price tag looks a little too steep in my opinion but for as far as it goes totally worth it. I am definitely willing to pay the sticker price for results! Instantly starts to repair
