This may sound strange but I love the consistency of this eye cream! I haven’t seen any others really like it. It is a mixture of angel and a cream and what j love most about it is how easy it is to rub in and how a little goes a very long way! I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and my under eyes feel very hydrated! I’ve seen some improvement in my under eye lines as well - excited to keep using it Solid eye cream! Great for dry skin!
