I have fairly dry skin and used my hands to apply the product. A little goes a LONG way which is important considering the price point. The smell was subtle and clean, and the results were pretty much immediate. My skin felt clean and soft. I only had a sample size of the product so Iâ€™m not sure of the long term results, but I will say I was pleasantly surprised. nan
