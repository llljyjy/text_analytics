I don’t necessarily love this product. BUT that’s because of my skin type. First off, fragrance is a big no for my skin type. I get gnarly small blisters with intense fragrance and sometimes oils. This does have an eau de toilet smell to it if you know what I mean. Although, it did have a pretty glow to it and made my skin feel softerI received this product free for my honest review nan
