I received a .5 oz sample for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review.The cucumber fragrance is light. Which is nice because I think too many companies got a little heavy handed with the cucumber fragrance in the 90s. It has a lovely texture too, not too thick and not too greasy. I like that it’s SPF 15, but I would like stronger protection because melanoma runs in my family.Overall I think it’s fine. I don’t think I’ll switch to it, but I will finish using the sample. nan
