I received a sample from Influenster and Estée Lauder to review in exchange for my honest opinion. I unfortunately didn’t love this lotion. I have dry and acne-prone, sensitive skin so I tend to steer clear of scented products. While the rose scent is pleasant, I do feel it was a bit heavy. After using this product for a week I did feel my skin was soft, but I did not see much of difference from using the product. I didn’t see a glowy effect as others have stated they experienced. I can appreciate the consistency of the product. It applied easily with my finger tips and a little product goes a long way. Sadly I don’t think it’s a necessary product to add to my skincare routine. Just ok
