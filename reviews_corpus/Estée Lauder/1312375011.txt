I wasn’t sure what to think about Estee Lauder Micro Essence treatment lotion when I received it. It doesn’t seem like a lotion at all, as it has the consistency of a toner. It does, however, have a slightly silky feel and smoothes over my skin easily. My skin drinks it in instantly, leaving it look moisturized and somehow brighter. I enjoy how my skin looks and feels after using this product. A luxurious addition to my skincare regimen
