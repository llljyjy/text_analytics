I got this product as a free first trial and was so excited because I love Estée Lauder! But I don’t think this product is right for me. Besides the fact that it’s super hydrating and perfect to prepare your skin for following serums I think the added fragrance is so strong! I do have a sensitive skin and also allergies so I always prefer products with no or minimal fragrance. But if you don’t mind by the smell it’s a good product to test it out! nan
