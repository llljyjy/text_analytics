I received a sample of this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I used it for a few weeks. I loved the lightweight, non-sticky texture. It is lightly fragranced. Once I ran out of my sample and stopped using this product, I noticed my undereyes starting to look drier during the day, which leads me to believe that using this creme at night provided me all-day undereye hydration the next day, which reduced the look of the wrinkles under my eyes. Overall, I think this eye cream was effective in hydrating and reducing some fine lines. nan
