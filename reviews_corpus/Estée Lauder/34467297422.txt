I received this for free from Influenster for my honest review. I’ve recently become a huge fan of this moisturiser! My combination skin struggles to find a moisturiser that doesn’t feel either too oily or too drying, but this one seems to strike the perfect balance. The light, whipped texture absorbs really nicely and feels very comfortable on the skin, not exacerbating any oil and not feeling tight or dry. I love that it contains glycerin and hyaluronic acid to really hydrate the skin, and that it contains a (small amount of) SPF - although I still use a dedicated sunscreen before leaving the house, and there is no interference with this moisturiser pilling or causing any issues. The packaging is gorgeous and feels really high end, and the whole experience of applying the product to yourself is just a pleasant one. I was slightly surprised that the product itself is a slightly blue/green shade and that it has a really fresh scent of cucumber. I was concerned this might put me off at first but it doesn’t linger once it’s been applied, and it does add to the general hydrating feel of the product. Overall, I would highly recommend this moisturiser and have already made a note to buy another for my sister! Love it. I would definitely recommend it! #Influenster #sephora #esteelauder Love it!
