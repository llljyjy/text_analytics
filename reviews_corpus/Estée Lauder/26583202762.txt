I have oily/dry skin and have always struggled with finding a good moisturizer that doesn’t make me look shiny or break out. This works really well at keeping me moisturized, keeping my skin barrier intact especially during the fall time. I’ve noticed after using it regularly for a few weeks now, there are now days where I don’t need to apply it in the morning since I am still well hydrated from the application the night before. I loved the rich texture, it felt amazing on my skin, absorbs well without leaving me feel greasy or as though I had not moisturize. I feel moisturized when I wear it and that my skin can breathe at the same time. And when I say my skin can breathe I mean when I put on the moisturizer I don’t immediately start sweating because my pores are blocked. If you have a skincare fridge, this is definitely a moisturizer worth storing inside as it feels even more soothing when applying chilled. Great Product
