I received a sample of this to review. This is avery luxurious hydrating cream that really isbetween a gel and cream. I enjoyed it and it didfeel like it made my eye area more hydrated.Personally my eye area tends to break out if Iused too thick of a cream so this was too thickfor me to use more than a couple times a weekBut if you like a more thick eye cream that wouldbe amazing. nan
