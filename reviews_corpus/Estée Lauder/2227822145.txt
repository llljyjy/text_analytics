So this is kind of a weird product for me. I liked it. It seemed to moisturize pretty well. However, the consistency is not something I would typically seek out for a lotion/moisturizer. Even with the tiny bottle I received to test, a lot came out at once—too much—which I find a little problematic. Is there a reason for the runnier consistency? Or are you just hoping we’ll spill it and have to buy more? I’ve used other moisturizers that were a thicker, more manageable cream consistency that hydrated just as well without feeling heavy. Or perhaps, just call it a serum and your customers will expect it. Overall, I liked it, but generally find it a little confusing. Interesting “lotion”
