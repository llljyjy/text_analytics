The Estee Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion claims to lock in moisture, fight redness, and fortify the skin’s barrier. It has a watery consistency with a very faint fragrance. I apply just a couple of drops into my palms and lightly tap into my skin.  It dissipates very quickly and my skin immediately feels soothed and softer.  After using it twice daily for the past few weeks, it has definitely made a difference in how my skin looks and feels.  I’ve noticed my skin looks and feels healthier and more radiant, while my pores and fine lines seem minimized. I think it fits very well into my daily skincare regimen, and most likely will be purchasing in the near future. Noticeable Results
