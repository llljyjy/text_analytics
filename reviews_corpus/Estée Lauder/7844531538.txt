I recently tried Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-Creme in exchange for my honest opinion thanks to #influenster#estèelauder. I like to use this before bed at night to help with my dark circles and fine lines. This formula is soothing but it does cause your skin to tingle which can become an issue if it begins burning or makes contact with your eyes which is why I didn’t give a higher rating. So apply carefully and overtime you’ll see positive results. I would recommend this product to family and friends looking to add or replace night repair eye creams and want a noticeable change quickly. I have tried other eye repair creams but didn’t have a good experience using them so I look forward to using this product from now on. Estèe Lauder Advanced Night Repair Gel-Creme
