I received this cream from  Influenster and Estée Lauder to test the product.Since the size of a sampler is tiny, I haven’t seen improvement in my fine lines BUT I definitely noticed good moisturizing effect after applying the cream. The texture of the Youth Power Cream is a little sick (which I like) but at the same time feels lightweight on my skin. My skin can be oily and dry at the same time and the cream doesn’t leave my face oily and shiny (which is great).I used it at night, and my skin looked moisturized in the morning. Also I added this product in my morning routine, and cream gave me a good base for my foundation.I’m thinking about to purchase a full version of the Youth Power Cream after I finish my previous moisturizer. Good cream!
