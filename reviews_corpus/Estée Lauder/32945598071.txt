I received a sample to try through influenster & I love how light weight it feels. I had been using another eye cream that was thick and hard to rub into my skin and it felt like it sat at the surface - not this one! It went on nice and was easy to apply, and a little does go a LONG way. I have crows feet and always have bags under my eyes and I feel like this has helped a lot since using it. nan
