This cream was very smooth to put on and didn’t make my skin feel oily, which is nice. It was lightweight. I’ve been using it in the morning and evening both and am excited to see the results! The only downside was that I didn’t enjoy the smell. It wasn’t strong, but it made me think of baby powder. nan
