I received this eye cream free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I like this gel cream formula it’s super hydrating. I’ve been using Esteé Lauder products long before getting this VoxBox and I’m always impressed with them. My favorite products are the advanced night repair serum and the revitalizing supreme plus moisturizer. This eye cream goes with these products perfectly! The only thing is, I’d like this eye cream to be more tightening. It’s really hydrating and plumping but I want a tighter look. Pretty Good
