I do not play when it comes to skincare, especially my under eyes cause I’m trying to preserve my face. This gel-cream is hella expensive, but hella worth it! Very nourishing, hydrating,smooth, lightweight, and sinks into the skin quickly. Best of all - it doesn’t pill when used with other products. Literally can’t say enough good things about this! It is a little fragranced, but it doesn’t bother me and it doesn’t deter from the product. It’s always sold out, so if you can get it - BUY IT. It’s so worth it! HOLY MOLY
