I received a sample from Influenster for my honest review of this product. The sample I received was extremely tiny. It did have a soft pleasant scent and it felt a little heavy in the skin at first but soaked in fairly quickly leaving my skin very soft. I would have liked to have tried it longer then a week to see the full benefits though. I will probably purchase a full size to try long term. Left my skin soft
