I received this from Influenster and was disappointed, because every skincare that I’ve gotten as a freebie from this brand has not worked for my skin. I gave it a fair shot, however, and I like how thick the gel/cream is and my sensitive skin didn’t have any issues with this product. It does take awhile to absorb into the skin, but it definitely made my undereyes feel moisturized. I haven’t been able to tell a difference in the fine lines in the couple of months I’ve been using it, for that reason I don’t think I would purchase when this tub runs out. Feels Nice, Haven't Seen Results
