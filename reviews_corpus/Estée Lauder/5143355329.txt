**This is an incentivized review. I received a free sample of this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion.** I’ll start by saying I have the driest of dry skin so there aren’t a lot of creams on the market that are powerful enough on their own to keep me moisturized throughout the day- this one is no exception. On its own, it moisturizes my skin for maybe an hour tops and then I feel dry as a bone for the rest of the day. As a base moisturizer with aquaphor layered on top or a facial oil mixed in, it’s fine (but just about any cream is). I tried to compensate by using a little extra one day to see if I could get the moisture to last longer but that caused my makeup to pill. It smells straight up like an Estée Lauder perfume (I can’t think of the specific one) which smells nice objectively but my skin is also sensitive so rubbing something on my face that smells exactly like perfume didn’t sit quite right with me. Overall, I just didn’t feel like this product was doing my skin any favors when I was using it. I have very specific skin care needs, though. Somebody whose skin is lower maintenance may find some benefit to using this product. Not for dry/high-maintenance skin
