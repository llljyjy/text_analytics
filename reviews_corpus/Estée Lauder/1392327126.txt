I received a free sample of this product through Influenster and was not expecting to love this eye cream as much as I do! It really does what it says it does! I noticed my eye area got smoother and my dark circles have faded after just a few uses. It is a heavier/richer eye cream so I did have to limit use due to some milia or clogged pores in my eye area but the good results will probably keep me coming back to it. Excellent high-quality product. Better than I expected!
