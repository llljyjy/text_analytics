Was really excited to try out this new moisturizer and it didn’t disappoint! Texture goes on great and smoothly but feels thick enough to last like you would want a night cream to last, leaving my skin feeling hydrated. I didn’t notice a difference in fine lines but my sample size only lasted about a week so it’s too soon to say—def want to try for longer next time! nan
