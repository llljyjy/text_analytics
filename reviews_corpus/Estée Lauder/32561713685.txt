I received this product as a complementary sample in return to my honest review. The cream has light pleasant smell and fully absorbs into the skin in about 5 min. No tackiness or sticky feelings. Gave 4 starts because you need to use more than usual amount of the product in order to fully cover the face. Overall, I liked it and enjoyed using it. Itâ€™s impossible for me to predict long term results since I had a small sample. Good moisturizer
