#sponsored by Influenster to try the Estée Lauder’s Micro Essence Treatment Lotion with Bio-Ferment for free, in exchange of my honest opinion.I wasn’t really sure what it was supposed to do until I looked it up, but it’s kind of confusing still as to what this product really is. It helps optimize your skin’s barrier and to help significantly boost skin’s first line of resistant to external aggressors. The essence also helps lock in moisture and soothe skin to minimize the look of redness. Skin is hydrated, smoothed and radiant, with the appearance of pores reduced.This was a sample size, and I didnt want to waste any of it, so luckily I have extra droppers from a different sampling opportunity that I ended up using to reduce any waste. It had a very light scent, and feels like and looks like water. This product goes on great, does not feel oily or greasy. Almost a watery feel to it. It feels really good when applied to your skin. This product is described as a lotion which it is not. To me it looks, feels and acts just like water, but slightly more viscous. It’s for all skin types, although ideal for dry skin, redness or irritation, pores, and healthy-looking skinIts key ingredient is What the company calls a micronutrient bio-ferment, a concentrate of peptides that support cellular renewal A little bit of this micro essence will leave your skin soft, smooth, and glowing. A little goes a long way, so one bottle should last a long time. I enjoyed using it and would use again, if the price wasn’t so high.#AsherzReviews1120 @Influenster @EsteeLauder #esteelauder #microessence #skincare #influenster #VoxBox #realreviews #honestreview   #beauty #review #Recommendation Left my skin soft, hydrated and redness free.
