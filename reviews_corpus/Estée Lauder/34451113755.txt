I received a free sample from Influenster to try in exchange for my honest review. The bottle is very pretty. The treatment lotion is a gel like liquid. I ended up using a cotton pad to apply it. My first attempt of applying with my hands ended up a mess. I didn’t realize how watery it is. I haven’t noticed anything at all, after three weeks of twice a day usage. My pores and fine lines are still noticeable. It does absorb quickly and is not sticky. It is very expensive. I’m glad I tried it for free because I would not buy it. nan
