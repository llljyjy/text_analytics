This the second Estée Lauder Creams i have used. They don’t disappoint. I was glad to get a free sample from Influenster. I have combination skin so I used this cream at night. I like the thickness and smooth creamy feel and it felt really nice on my skin. I would need to use it a longer time to see if it firms and does other things. I really liked it. Really nice cream
