I received a sample of this product complimentary through Influenster for my honest review. I found this to be a nice, light, hydrating essence. It’s really good for days I don’t want a thick moisturizer on my face but it would it be a daily moisturizer replacement for me. I wish it didn’t have fragrance, but my skin likes it and it feels really nice when applied. Hydrating Essence
