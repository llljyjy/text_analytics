I’ve used this product for a few weeks now and I love the result. The moisturizer is thick, but not sticky and greasy; it’s easy to apply and blends into skin flawlessly. My sensitive skin did really well with this product and I am pleased with outcome. I feel like it’s a great product for someone looking for extra moisture and help getting that plump supple look back in their face! A new fave!
