I received this product for free for an honestreview. I have used this night cream for the pastfew weeks I really like this formula it feels thickgoing onto the face but once it’s on it’s a littlegel like. It ends up almost being oily, but not ina bad way. I haven’t noticed a huge differenceyet, but I think it’s because it’s only been a fewweeks. I will definitely be buying this again. Great Product
