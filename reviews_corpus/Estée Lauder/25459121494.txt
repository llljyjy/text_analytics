I received this as a sample to try for my honest opinion and I must say, I was impressed!It made my skin feel and look soft and silky. I noticed after a couple weeks that my fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead were less noticeable. My face soaked it up instantly! I felt like I needed to use more. The cream was smooth and had a very strong perfume smell. The scent dissipated quickly after putting it on. Iâ€™d recommend this to anyone looking for a cream that takes the edge off your wrinkles and fine lines. It works! But not a miracle worker.
