One star off because I didn’t notice anything particularly revitalizing about the moisturizer but otherwise, this was a really lovely product. It was thicker than I expected so I only used it at night. My skin is dry, but also prone to breakouts and clogged pores and I found that this product didn’t irritate my skin at all and left it feeling supple.  Be aware that the cream is heavily scented, kind of like a musky smell. It smells good! I received this product for free as part of an Influenster campaign and I’m not sure I’d buy it on my own after seeing the price point. But if you have the budget, than it’s a great moisturizer. Luxurious, thick, scented face cream
