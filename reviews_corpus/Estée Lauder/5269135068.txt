I received this moisturizer as part of an incentivized review. These are my actual opinions. In general, I find Estee products to be a bit to heavily perfumed for my personal preferences. I was excited to find that this cream is not that way. It has a light and fresh scent, not perfumey at all. I only received a sample size, so I can’t speak to long term results. However, I found it hydrating, not sticky, didn’t cause any clogs or break outs for me. I could wear this under makeup without any pilling. It’s a very nice thicker cream. My skin is normal, starting to mature. I use a lot of products and I like that this is just a solid moisturizer that i can use with my more powerful actives without any adverse effects. The packaging is very nice and would make this a lovely gift of something to display on your vanity. Nice all around moisturizer
