I was gifted a tester of this product for my honest review. This eye cream is silky and luxurious! It’s everything you could hope for in an eye cream. Thick without feeling heavy, silky without feeling sticky, all around amazing cream that de-puffs, brightens the eye area, and leaves you feeling bright eyed and refreshed! Took off a star for the price point. I’m not sure I’d repurchase because of the $70 price but honestly after using it I am tempted. It’s a little piece of a heaven in a jar. Heaven in a jar
