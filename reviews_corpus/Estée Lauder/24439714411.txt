Pretty expensive, so I can’t give it 5 stars. I’m in my late 30s and LOVE water gel creams though and this is the PERFECT compromise for a winter moisturizer. It goes on like a thick water gel cream, but melted right into my skin. I’m fact my skin drank it RIGHT up. Easy to use at night, but also before makeup for that very reason. Didn’t get a very large sample so don’t ask me about long term results, but 10/10 for texture and absorption for me! Melts right into skin
