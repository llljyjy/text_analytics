I really liked this product! It’s a thick gel-like consistency that feels really good under the eyes. I am not able to wear this during the day however since it takes a while to soak in and leaves a slippery layer until absorbed. I will say that I didn’t notice a huge difference in under eye darkness but my eyes did look overall refreshed and plump in the mornings. I got this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. nan
