I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion.  The size product I received was sample size.  I waited one month to give my skin time to properly assess its effect on my skin.  After a week of use, I was pleasantly surprised with a slightly glowier face, but I did experience some breaking out as my skin is hyper sensitive to changes in product.  I continued to use for the next 3 weeks and felt that overall, it was a great moisturizer, but there wasnâ€™t anything overly exciting that would make me run out to buy it. nan
