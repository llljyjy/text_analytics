I received a sample size of this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I like it. It seems to do very well for wrinkles. The sample was very small so I was not able to use it all over face and neck as reccomended. Instead I applied it to one area on my forehead where I have a large wrinkle. After 2 weeks of twice a day application I noticed a significant difference. I can now barely see the wrinkle. Since I didnt have enough to apply over whole face I do not know how well it moisturizes. But as far as wrinkles are concerned it is top notch! Tip notch for wrinkles
