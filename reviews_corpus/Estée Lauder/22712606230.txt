I love this product, and I am picky about eye skincare products. I am a fan of the serum consistency since its a gel cream. A little goes a long way. You don’t have to worry about it being runny. It’s great. I marked it down a star because it doesn’t come in the most convenient unit. I wish it had either an accessory spatula or it was a unit with a pump or dropper. To get the gel cream out with nails is not the most fun thing when you’re tired and go in digging instead of using the back of your nail. Just my 2 cents since I’m willing to give way more than 2 cents in purchasing it. nan
