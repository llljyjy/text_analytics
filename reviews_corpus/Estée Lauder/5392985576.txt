I am always skeptical about trying sample sized products as sometimes you can’t really see the benefits being it’s a small sample. However with this particular product a little bit truly goes a long way! I’ve been using this for almost 2 months and while I can’t see dramatic results, I do FEEL a difference in my skin. Definitely smoother and soft feeling, I put the cream on at night and wake up with more firm, hydrated skin. (My skin is normal.) I did take away 1 star because for now this is out of my price range. Other than that, I would recommend. nan
