I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The thing that surprised me most about this product was the texture. I was expecting something thinner and more water-based feeling, but what I discovered was, in hindsight, perfectly described by the productâ€™s name: a gel-creme. It is emollient without being greasy and both absorbs into the skin and leaves a hydrating layer on top. While using it, I found my under eye skin appeared healthy and soft. I did not notice any dramatic results in terms of fine lines over time, but the moisture and brightness of the skin certainly has anti-aging qualities. Overall I would recommend this as a quality eye cream that would likely work for a wide variety of skin types. Unique Eye Cream
