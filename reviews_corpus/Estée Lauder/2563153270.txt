I received a free sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using it in the morning and evening and it’s good but I don’t see a lot of change in my dark circles. However, I love the texture and how moisturizing it is. It does make my skin feel soft and smooth and it layers well under makeup. I am planning on purchasing a full size to see if it improves my dark circles if I use it for a longer period of time. It’s good
