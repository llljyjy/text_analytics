I received this from influenster to try and review and they sent us the tiniest sample to review. I got two uses out of it because it’s so small so take these reviews with a grain of salt. It’s hydrating but you can do that with a different serum that’s cheaper. I have no idea about the long term effects because I couldn’t use it long enough to tell. Hydrating but not worth it
