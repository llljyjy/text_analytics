I received a free sample of this to try from Influenster for my review. The formula felt nice on my skin but I didn’t notice too much of a difference. The texture of the product was almost a silicone consistency and was a bit thicker. I tried it on a dry patch of skin and did notice a difference in both the hydration and appearance, so it worked well in that scenario. The fragrance is also very light (smells very clean so I don’t know if that’s just because of the formula or if it is fragranced). While I did like it, there are other moisturizers that are less expensive, so I’m not sure I’d repurchase. If you like Estee Lauder, though, you won’t be disappointed as it was still a very nice cream. Nice texture, light fragrance
