I received this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I really like this nightly eye cream. I have sensitive eyes, and the formula doesn’t cause any irritation. It has a lightweight, creamy, gel consistency that blends into the skin well. It does take a while to absorb completely and leaves a slightly greasy feel, but with it being a night cream, this doesn’t bother me. I haven’t used it long enough for long-term results, but my eye area is noticably more hydrated after use. I do wish the jar was bigger for the price. Little Jar of Goodness
