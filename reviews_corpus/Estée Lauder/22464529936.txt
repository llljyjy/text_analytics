I don’t have issues with firmness, but my skin has been a bit more dry as I have aged. This product has provided pretty good moisturizing results and my skin looks a bit more radiant after using it for a couple of weeks. It also didn’t break my skin out. Although I wish the ingredients were a bit more clean, I loved the factthag it has several plant extracts in it. However, I did not like the fragrance. It was too strong, especially for night use. I received this product complimentary from Influenster. nan
