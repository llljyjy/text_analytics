I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. While I felt this product was very hydrating on my skin, the product itself was very small and also didn’t give me the payoff in terms of skin brightness and hydration I expected. I’ve used other products that do just as well, if not better, for a lower price. It was nice but nothing spectacular. The cream feels great on the skin but I can see this as being heavy for some with oilier skin. Nice, but nothing to write home about
