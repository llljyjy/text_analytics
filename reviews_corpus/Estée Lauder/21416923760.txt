I have been given this complimentary product in return for an honest review.  I’ve been using it before bed each night for a few weeks now, and so far it’s working to reduce the puffy “just woke up” eye look I loathe. I love how silky it glides on and it doesn’t burn my eyes or cause any redness. It’s great to wake up feeling more refreshed and with no puffiness. I would definitely recommend. So far so good!
