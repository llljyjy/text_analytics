I was concerned the gel texture would leave a sticky feel but it did not. You only need a very small amount of the product and it dries quickly. There is a slight scent but I wouldnâ€™t necessarily call it scented. It was barely noticeable. The gel felt great and did not irritate my skin. A Very Nice Eye Gel-Cream
