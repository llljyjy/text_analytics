I received this for free from Influenster and Estaste Laudee for my honest opinion. I got this a few weeks ago and i wanted to give it a plenty of time before I gave my review and I’m so glad I did. It has change my under eyes for the better I don’t have the bags anymore like I usually do, and it has help my puffy eyes and made may eyes brighter. Also in the few weeks that I have been using it I can tell that my fine lines around my eyes are being decrease which is so nice I can’t believe it. I was very surprised. Now I do use it every morning and night during my skin care route. Also it’s so hydrating when it gets absorbed into your skin if feels so soft this is probably one of the best eye creams I have tried and I have tried serval. I will be buying more of this cause I’m hooked Bye bye under eyes
