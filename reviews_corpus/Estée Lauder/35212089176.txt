I received this product for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. This was a really nice surprise. When I first got this product I thought it was going to be greasy and heavy on my skin. But when I put it on, it felt rich and luxurious and absorbed quick. It has a nice subtle smell. The next day my skin was really smooth, radiant and with a youthful feeling. I have sensitive skin, but this didnâ€™t break me out or irritated my skin. I am buying the full size for sure. I love it
