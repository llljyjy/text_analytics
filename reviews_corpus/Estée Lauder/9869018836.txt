I love how silky this feels going on. It is somehow thick and light at the same time - meaning it has great coverage (a little goes a long way) but it soaks in and doesn’t feel greasy or overbearing at all. Since I’ve been using this, I find myself skipping under eye concealer more often, so I do think it is having a positive effect on my dark circles. I received a sample for free from influenster for my honest review. nan
