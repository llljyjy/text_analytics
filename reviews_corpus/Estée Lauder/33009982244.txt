Blown awayI have some sensitivity and this was a beautiful formula without burning or redness It helped the appearance of some fine lines and my under eye puffiness and circles within days of using a small amount. It was nourishing and moisturized my under eye with ease. Slaying my fellow 30+ women!! I saw results in a week and will be purchasing. I received a sample free for review and so grateful. This is a holy grail product!!! Happily Surprised
