I really enjoyed this toner.  It was super hydrating and calming.  It made my skin look refreshed as soon as I used it.  It helped maintain my moisture barrier while skiing in Colorado for a week.  I am from a humid state and the mountain air was dry and I also dealt with wind and sun.  This did a wonderful job of keeping my skin calm and soothed.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of the price.  It is VERY similar to the La Mer Tonic but is over $30 more expensive. Both products have a probiotic component to them (one of the reasons they are so great), but I donâ€™t find many things that are more expensive than my La Mer products and this one is. Very good but very spendy.
