I got this product for free from Influenster and Estēe Lauder in return for my honest review.In truth I think it is a great moisturizer that will work wonders for most people. I was a bit skeptical on my first application as it is very thick and creamy and I was not sure it was actually going to absorb! The great thing with texture is that a little bit goes a very long way so your product really lasts! Also I found that within 20-30 minutes it was totally absorbed (which is what I give everything before bed - I don’t really check absorption in the AM as I do not wear foundation. It might be faster, but it is not longer.) The product absorbs to a soft almost mate finish. My skin after several weeks is soft and a bit brighter.The moisturizer does have a light scent which could easily become overwhelming for the scent sensitivities.I have had mild breakouts on my cheeks since starting this product and now have a larger zit on my chin as well. It looks like part of my skin loves this product but another part is not so jazzed about it. Because of this I’m giving what is otherwise a fabulous product 4/5 stars. If you have sensitive skin, know this might cause some breakouts initially or even just not be for you. Consult with a professional before buying in that case :)Really it is lovely stuff otherwise and what it does for fine lines? Whew! I’m bummed I am in the cannot use it camp! For the rest of y’all it is a gem! *The “before” picture is the cream sweater and the “after” is the blue shirt and shoulder just in case you cannot tell ;) Almost perfect and still a gem!
