I tried this product for a month after receiving a complimentary sample. It was very moisturizing and I think I saw some skin brightening around the eye but it didnâ€™t seem to do anything noticeable for the fine lines around me eyes. Since turning 40, I want anti aging benefits in my skin care to reduce the appearance of fine lines and hopefully hold off the inevitable of more from appearing. Almost perfect
