My favorite thing about this product is it has a velvety feel to the gel and goes on soo smooth. It has a very nice consistency and doesnâ€™t have fragrance in it. My skin is sensitive and this does not bother my skin what so ever. Its safe for sensitive skin & has a nice feel to it after it applied. As for dark circle not sure if it helped mine too much I have fair skin & have had a dark circle problem for a long time. It is super hydrating and imSure will eventually help with wrinkles the more you wear it. velvet gel
