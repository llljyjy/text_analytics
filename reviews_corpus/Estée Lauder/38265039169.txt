I was so excited to receive this product complimentary to try after I ran out of my normal eye cream. The container has an easy to open lid and you just dip your finger in and get a small amount. A little goes a long ways. The texture is a thick creamy gel and seemed like it would be super moisturizing. Unfortunately the few times I tried it, it gave a burning sensation under my eyes which I have never had before, so I had to stop using it. I was really excited to try it out and see the results but it just did not work out for me. nan
