The texture was great and the hydration to the undereye area was delicious! Unfortunately there was a slight minty scent and feel to this product that caused my eyes to burn shortly after applying it.  I had to remove the product.  While I wouldnâ€™t recommend this for someone with sensitive skin/eyes, the non sensitive will probably love this! Not for me
