First time trying out Estée Lauder. Always saw the brand as a mature skincare only but have been changing my mind about that. I have a sensitive oily dehydrated acne prone skin so I’m very mindful about what I put on my face. I got a mini from Influenster and had the opportunity of using it for around two weeks. Didn’t get any bad reaction to it. Gave me enough moisture for the winter nights, and Woke up with this gorgeous glowy complexion! About the fine lines didn’t see much difference but I guess I should use it for a longer period to see consistent results. Well, I love it! Just got myself a bottle after that experience.
