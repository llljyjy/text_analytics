I have tried several anti-aging products from Estee Lauder, and this definitely worked the best for my skin. Heavy creams and anti-aging products are always too heavy for me, leaving me greasy, and with clogged pores. This gel cream is much lighter and soaked into my skin, leaving a clean finish with no grease or pilling. I definitely noticed smoother, plumper skin around my eyes, and I would recommend this to anyone. My favorite from Estee Lauder so far
