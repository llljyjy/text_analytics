I’ve been using this product for a few weeks, and while I like it a lot and it helps my face feel hydrated especially during the winter months, I don’t notice much more of a difference.  This product was especially nice, however, after I got back from vacation and helped my sun damaged skin go back to a normal, smooth texture without dealing peeling or blotchiness Good for dryer skin
