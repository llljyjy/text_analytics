I was happy to receive this product free from Influenster for my review. Although I only received a small sample size to test, the formula of this creme is really luxurious. I find the creme to be a thick gel like texture that leaves my skin feeling hydrated but not greasy. I’ve been using this creme as my last step in the evening and when I wake up my skin still feels moisturized. Although I enjoy the product, I didn’t receive enough product to test it for the length of time needed to see results concerning firmness or fine lines or wrinkles. However, I do really enjoy the feel and performance of the creme so far. Luxurious and hydrating creme
