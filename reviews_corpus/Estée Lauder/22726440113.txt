I received this product complementary from Influenster in exchange for my review…I’ve used this product in the past and I really like it. My undereyes seem more hydrated in the morning and less puffy. I continue to use this products nightly on top of the Estée Lauder face serum. You did you use with no distinctive smells and a nice even coating that isn’t sticky. Highly recommend. Less puffy under eyes!
