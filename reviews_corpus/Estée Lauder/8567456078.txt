I received this product for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. The sample size I received was only enough for two uses so I didn’t get to see results over time. It felt nice and hydrating on my skin but didn’t stand out among other similar products. A little too scented for my taste. don’t know what to think..
