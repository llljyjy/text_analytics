I received a trial size jar in exchange for my honest review. I used this for about a week and I liked that it left my skin feeling hydrated for hours. It isn’t greasy feeling and I love that it has SPF. The only thing I didn’t like is the scent. It is a really strong smell and I prefer face products with a lighter scent. nan
