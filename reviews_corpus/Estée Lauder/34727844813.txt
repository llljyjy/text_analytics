I loved the texture of this moisturizer. When applying it to my skin, I felt that it went on super smooth. Despite being a cream type, it absorbed completely into my skin without any greasiness. I have combination skin and this seemed to help with some of the dry patches that sometimes pop up from time to time. In addition, the scent was light and refreshing - a winning combination. Fantastic Moisturizer plus Great Scent
