I began using my Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel Creme as soon as I received it. I am very excited with the results! This product doesn’t really seem to have a smell, but I don’t mind it being unscented. A little goes a long way, so this product will last a long while if you use it sparingly. It is a very soft and silky feeling gel. It has made the area under my eyes so much more smooth! It has also reduced the lines around my eyes! I am in love with this product! I definitely recommend it to everyone! Silky and Smooth
