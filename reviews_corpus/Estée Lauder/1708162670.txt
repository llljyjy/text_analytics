Initially, after immediately putting it on I was quite impressed. Here’s what I liked and what I didn’t.What I liked:This moisturizer smells amazing. It’s an unobtrusive scent as well. It’s pleasant without being cloying. It has a fresh, cucumber scent that dissipates slowly.Another thing I liked about this moisturizer is how nice it felt going on and how soft it left my skin! It has a lovely slip to it that leaves my skin feeling moisturized and baby soft.What I didn’t like:After several hours, about 6-8, my face was an oil slick. It was so disappointing because initially I really liked this cream for how it made my skin feel. I also didn’t like that the SPF factor was only 15. Dermatologists recommend a factor of 30 for daytime wear. If you market it as “Day Wear“ then have the SPF factor appropriate for daytime wear.To sum up, I would not purchase this cream nor would I reccomend in as a daytime cream. Perhaps I would wear it overnight as a sleeping mask. But then again I have dry skin and this left me feeling very oily. Is this really "DayWear"?
