I was given the opportunity to try this product for free from Influenter and Ester Lauder and let me tell you I loved it that I will be repurchasing. This product was not sticky at all on my face a little goes a long way , I did receive a small sample but I want to say it lasted me about 3 weeks using it only in the morning.The scent wasn’t to strong I felt like it left my face moisturized all day. My skin felt soft . I know with a small sample it wasn’t enough to see that much change but I will continue to use it and will see how much more improvements I can see Love it
