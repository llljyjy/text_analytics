I love this razor because it left my skin super soft. I have tried other razors and they have left my skin dry. I like that this razor has a longer handle. It makes it easier to use. I also like that this razor lasts longer because it does not rust. It is very durable since it is a metal razor. I recommend it. This was gifted by hanni. nan
