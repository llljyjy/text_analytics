I was a little scared that I’d cut myself with the weighted blade but it’s a pretty nice concept that leaves a smooth shave. The blade is sturdy and high quality. Shaving my legs is easy because it’s fine hair, but I kinda got scared on my armpits and bikini line. It takes a little practice to maneuver the razor when it comes to angles because of the weight. I still exfoliate my skin before putting on the pillow shave for the best results to get smooth skin. The pillow shave gives a thin film that I had to layer a lot to feel suffice for a shave. The other pieces in the kit like the razor holder and bin are cute but if you had to budget, the razor and blades are good enough. Follow @sassandskincare on IG for more reviews! *Gifted by Hanni.
