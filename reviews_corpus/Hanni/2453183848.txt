it took me a while to get the courage to use this, and I wish I did it sooner, it is definitely the closest shave I’ve ever had! I will need to work on my technique because I did get a nick in my shin, but it was otherwise great! the shave pillow is awesome too, I’ve been using it a while with my Athena Club razor, but it is even better paired with the hanni razor. amazing shave!
