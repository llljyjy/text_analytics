I received this gifted by the brand. This is a single blade razor so that was something I had to get used to and I honestly did not expect this to be so sharp. After getting the hang of letting the razor glide itself versus pulling I was very pleased with how soft and smooth my skin felt. I highly recommend this razor and kit. Excellent for coarse hair and a close shave. nan
