This razor is just not worth the money. Yes the branding, packaging, etc is pleasing but the actual shave is worse than most razors I’ve tried, except the very first shave on a new blade. After the first use it’s dulled and you have to go over the same spot several times and it misses so many hairs. Yes I’m at the correct angle and hear the crackle but it will still blatantly miss a hair I just went over. I still get ingrowns and the shave certainly doesn’t last any longer. Again, first use of blade is smooth but how sustainable and affordable is it to switch the blade out for every shave? Not worth the money, results aren’t impressive
