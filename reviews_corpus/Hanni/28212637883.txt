The BEST razor I’ve ever used! I’ve never experienced a shave as close as with the Hanni razor, it leaves my skin feeling so smooth! The razor is weighted, and really helps control the shave so well! I’m never borrowing my husband’s razor again! Lol Not to mention how beautiful the razor and holder look on the vanity/shower!! I also LOVE the Shave pillow, I think we’ve all suffered the razor burns from dry shaving at some point, and that’s where Shave Pillow comes to the rescue! The convenience of shaving outside the shower is priceless! The best shave ever!
