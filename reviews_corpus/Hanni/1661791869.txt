I bought the Hanni razor to use after I broke my last safety razor. I saw this online and was super surprised Sephora was carrying it. Very excited. The color is beautiful and the packaging is really great. However, there is one major downfall to this razor and I would not suggest purchasing it. The downfall is that this razor requires you to buy proprietary blades from Hanni that are way more expensive than regular stainless steel blades on Amazon. There is literally no reason why the razor blades should be that expensive and there is no reason why this razor should be designed to only fit their razor blades. What if this company goes out of business? What happens then? This is completely unsustainable and a terrible business practice. Iâ€™m returning this promptly as I cannot support a brand that makes it hard for the consumer to use in the future. Do not buy if you want to buy razor blades elsewhe
