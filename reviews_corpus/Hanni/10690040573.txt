This Hanni weighted razor kit in the beautiful blush color is such a game changer. This starter kit comes with everything you will need to get that smooth close shave.First of all, this razor looks so premium with the beautiful blush color and the nice-looking hero holder to keep the razor nicely stored. I love the silicone travel cap that keeps the sharp blades protected. It is very easy to put the blades into the razor. I love the unique design that you just twist the razor knob on the bottom of the handle to open the Hanni wings. I then take one of the Swedish stainless steel double-edged blades and place them in the razor. The razor is ready for use. I first use the shave pillow and rub to activate it. At first, I needed some time to get used to the new way of shaving because this heavy, sturdy weighted razor does all the work for you. No need for pressing into the skin. Just gently let it glide along in short strokes. It provides such an extra-close, precise shave. My skin feels so soft and smooth without any nicks or cuts. The set also has a blade bin for the used blades which need to be changed after 4-6 uses to ensure a close and smooth shave. I highly recommend this set. It is the only razor system that you will need from now on. Beautiful set, close share
