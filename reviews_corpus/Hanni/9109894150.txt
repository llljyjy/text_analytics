Complimentary from Hanni. I normally shave when I’m in the shower. However, there are times when I need a quick shave for my underarms but do not want to take a shower. I will simply wet my razor and shave my underarms because I don’t have the habit of using shaving cream either. Most of the time, I will get razor burns. Hence, this is such a game-changer because I can simply apply the product on my underarms like deodorant and it makes shaving so much easier, hassle-free, and no more razor burns! It also keeps my underarms soft, smooth, and moisturized. The best part is that it’s tiny and portable, so I can literally take it wherever I go. No more razor burns!
