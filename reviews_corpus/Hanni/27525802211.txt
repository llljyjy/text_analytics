I was pretty disappointed by this set. I really wanted to like this, but I was not impressed. First, the shave pillow smells very manly. It’s main note is bergamot, and I don’t like that scent at all. It should come in different scents. Next, the razor is weighted so you don’t have to press down hard when shaving. I felt like it could easily slip out of my hands, which would not be good. You can’t get a good grip on it, especially if your hands are wet from getting out of the shower. I found shaving took much longer than it should have. Not impressed
