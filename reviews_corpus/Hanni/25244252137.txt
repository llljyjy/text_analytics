The Hanni Starter Set includes all the essentials to get an expert close, shave. The razor is uniquely designed with a single blade that gives a super close, shave without any irritation or accidental cuts. The weighted razor has sturdy, dual ended design and comfortable grip. My favorite part of the razor is how easy it is to rinse and keep clean. This set includes 5 replacement blades that are also easy to rinse and replace when needed. A mini tin to store used blades, a shave balm, as well as a stand and cap for the razor complete the set. The included Shave Pillow is a solid balm texture that can be used on wet or dry skin as the formula does not need to be rinsed off. It has a soft scent and silky texture that instantly smooths the skin. It helps soothe and hydrate the skin for the perfect shave in or out of the shower. It can even be used alone as a moisturizing agent for the skin. This set is truly amazing and offers a great shaving experience! nan
