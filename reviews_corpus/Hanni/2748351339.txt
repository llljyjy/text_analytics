I wanted to love this! I have dark hair that grows back quickly and am always looking for a better, closer, longer lasting shave. The reviews were so promising... but sadly, they are all incentivized reviews and clearly not telling the full truth about this product line. First of all, using the shave pillow is ridiculous. I was skeptical (but again, the reviews swayed me) and I was right. It’s like trying to shave with a thin layer of Aquaphor or Vaseline on your legs. Within 2 strokes the blade is completely clogged with the stuff, and to really clean it off you have to untwist the handle to rinse it out. But even when rinsed, the pillow remains as a film on the blade and prevents it from really cutting the hair. I spent probably 45 minutes going over and over and over the same areas and could never get a close shave with the pillow. I did it at night before bed and when I woke up it felt like I hadn’t even shaved. Ridiculous. I was willing to give the razor itself another try with regular shaving cream. To test if it was truly a good shave, I thought I’d use my old razor on one leg and the Hanni on the other. Halfway through the Hanni leg I just gave up... again, I was going over and over the same spots and yet still feeling the hair there when I rubbed up on my leg. This razor just does not sufficiently reach and cut the hairs. I tried it in my armpits and same deal, it’s impossible to get the angle right for the blade to even cut the hair. My big warning to anyone considering this: DON’T BELIEVE THE REVIEWS, they are all incentivized. It might work ok if you have very fine, light hair - but if that’s the case why do you need this expensive razor? Pass on it. SO DISAPPOINTED
