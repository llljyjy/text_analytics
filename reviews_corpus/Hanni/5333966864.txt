I’m going to be honest, I was quite intimidated by this razor at first because I have never used anything like it before. Once I watched the how to video, it made a lot more sense and put me at ease. I love that it has a case to cover the top for traveling, included blades so you don’t run out for awhile, a blade case to keep it contained and safe, a stand to keep in your shower to protect your blade and shave pillow which allows you to shave anywhere with or without water and moisturize your skin all the same. The handle is heavy and gives the weight you need to easily glide the razor across your skin. Was tricky at first but once I got the hang of it, it was so much easier to use. My skin feels so much softer and I get such a smooth shave now. Much better than anything I’ve previously tried. Overall I highly recommend! Gifted by Hanni in exchange for my honest review. Love It!
