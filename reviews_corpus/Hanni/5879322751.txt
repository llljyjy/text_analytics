First of all, I will say that this is a great shaving system.  The blade does provide a close shave and has completely reduced my strawberry skin and bumps to almost none after every shave.  The shave pillow was weird at first because I was expecting a typical shave cream experience but it’s totally different.  The shave pillow is absolutely a game-changer for the blade because the razor will just smoothly glide as you shave. The reason I gave this 4 stars and unfortunately had to return is because I’ve had too many knicks and it takes too much time/focus that I do not have to devote to shaving. it is a very sharp blade, follow the directions and apply absolutely no pressure.  You have to go slow. And you have to take short strokes.  I just don’t have time for that and if you are rushed or do not pay total attention, you will always cut yourself.  I do love this product, but I do not have the luxury of spending 5+ minutes shaving with the increased chance I’m going to cut myself. Great system BUT time consuming
