I actually purchased this set off the Hanni website right before they joined with Sephora so my color (Flame) isnt listed. I was a bit hesitant bc ofthe price as well as my ability to not massacre my legs but I’m happy to say its worth every cent. I love that nothing is sitting in a landfill and the shave itself is so smooth. Much smoother than pink taxed disposables. The weight itself slows my actions down. It’s really a matter of shorter, gliding strips versus the lond, repeated strokes of a disposable. The gell provided can be used alone or on wet skin and really protects your skin. I’ve also used shaving soap and my husbands gel without problem. Its super easy to put the blade on and I clean it out every other use. As we move into summer, I’ll be shaving more and probably go thru more blades but one blade lasts 4-5 uses for me(below the knee and armpits only :)) I find its even more effective in sensitive areas like the curve of your armpit or that place near your ankle tendon that gets nicked every.time. It’s really not as complicated aas I feared and I’ve only nicked myself once when I rushed. It was no worse than any nick. Mostly, since you but the razor ONCE, you save money + the planet. Worth every cent. Easy and Eco Friendly
