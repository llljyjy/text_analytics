Great razor but the product listing is wrong. The product description bullets currently say it includes the shower holder. It doesn’t. Only the hero holder pictures in the photo. I’ve reported it to customer service so hopefully they will fix it. I would have ordered the shower holder separately if I had known, now I have to pay to ship it in a separate order. Not taking a star off the product rating for Sephora’s mixup, but still disappointed. the listing is incorrect but product is great
