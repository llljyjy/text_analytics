I was skeptical in buying this razor because I couldn’t justify the price but once I researched it, I went and bought it. I can’t LOVE THIS enough! I’m a very hairy person (TMI) this razor was like a dream. At first I (like everyone else) was cut up all over my legs but once I read the instructions , I noticed how you’re supposed to do short strokes and just glide it over the hair (not apply pressure) and that was a game changer. No ingrown hairs. Smooth , clean shave. I’m obsessed! If you’re thinking of buying it, do it! Favorite Razor of All Time
