A new fave! This razor is definitely unlike any other I’ve used in the past. It took me a few tries before learning how to use it properly, but it’s definitely worth it. I was worried at first, but I didn’t experience any cuts and left my skin feeling very smooth! This is so much better than disposable razors! Love it!
