This is my first safety razor so to say I was nervous was an understatement!! It was super easy to pop the boss in and all the components feel quality and sturdy. I shaved my legs in the shower and was impressed with how easily it glides over the skin. It doesn’t even feel like there is a razor touching you! I had to keep checking to see if I was actually shaving lol. This majorly reduced irritation on my legs and i was left smooth with no nicks. I’m going to keep practicing to get my closest shave but I love how simple it was to transition from my plastic razor. This majorly reduces waste and I can see me switching over completely to Hanni. Such an easy switch!
