This razor is beautiful and works better than any drugstore razor I’ve ever purchased! It’s so heavy, so I don’t feel like I’m going to drop it or lose control of the razor. You have to be careful the first few times you use it until you get comfortable, but after that it’s the closest shave you’ll ever have. My skin was so smooth after! nan
