this was my first time trying a safety razor and the experience was so great! the razor itself is weighted so you donâ€™t need to apply any extra pressure. putting in the blade was very easy and the stand that comes with the kit is so aesthetic. The shave pillow worked wonderfully with and without water! I actually preferred it outside of the shower rather than in since the water washed away the product before I was able to shave it. complimentary from hanni nan
