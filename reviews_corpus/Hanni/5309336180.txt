Just want to say “WOW” this would make a great gift set! There is so much in there- I like that they even have a little box to safely dispense of razors. It does take a bit to get the angle right but it didn’t take me more than a few tries. Also the shaver itself is so freaking cool! You twist a thing and the head “opens up” so you can put a razor in. I felt like I was using some futuristic thing lol. Gifted by hanni nan
