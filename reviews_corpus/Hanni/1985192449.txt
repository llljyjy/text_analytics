I don’t usually get all hyped up about shaving products, but this hanni razor is awesome. I’ve always had to shave pretty much every day because my legs and underarms get like a dark 5 o’clock shadow after just a few hours. With hanni I can go at least 3 days between shaves and there is NO SHADOW! I especially love it for the arm pit area because the blade sticks out on both sides which means I can shave up and then down super easily. It finds those couple hairs I usually miss because they grow in a different direction. If you have coarse, dark hair or visible shadow this is the razor you need in your life! L-O-V-E this razor!
