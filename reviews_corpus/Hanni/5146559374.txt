Okay WOW.First off the packaging. I’ve never had a more LUXE shaver then this one. Second, The blade was *chefs kiss* it glides and slides and left my legs soft. However, be careful!! It is very sharp. My first time did end up with cuts. But I was also moving fast. It literally says to do slow strides. But wow. This thing is amazing. Best razor I have ever used in my entire life.Gifted by Hanni. But don’t be fooled. I was gifted this item and am so lucky I was. This item is heaven sent. WOW
