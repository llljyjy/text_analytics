This is the first safety-blade type razor I’ve ever tried and I’m impressed! I was a bit nervous I’d cut myself but the instructions are clear and simple: don’t push, just glide. I haven’t cut myself yet and I’ve been using this for a week! With shorter strokes and a little bit of slowing down, I’ve been getting the closest shave I’ve ever gotten! Definitely a new staple of mine! Gifted by Hanni but thoughts are my own. nan
