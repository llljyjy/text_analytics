I’m beyond impressed with this razor and I had no idea what to expect with a weighted razor. At first I was a little nervous, as it emphasizes to not push hard. Yet it was very very easy to not cut myself, as it has a really thoughtful and functional setup. Although it’s still taking a bit of learning, it got such a close shave with no efforts at all. It didn’t leave my feeling dry and stripped like when I use any other traditional razor. I really enjoy how inexpensive the razors are, at $6 that will last you over a month. And I would spend over $30 easily for the same amount before. My legs felt so soft after shaving and I’m really excited about this razor. Absolutely BLOWN away
