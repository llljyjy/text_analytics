I really like this razor gifted by hanni because of the fact that it is weighted and I don’t have to apply any pressure for it to remove the hair. It does remove the hair pretty well. I have light blonde fine like hair, so it is hard to see the hair and I did have to go over a few spots more than once but overall this is one of the best razors I’ve ever tried. I also like the fact that I was able to dry shave outside if the shower with their shaving cream and not get any razor burn! nan
