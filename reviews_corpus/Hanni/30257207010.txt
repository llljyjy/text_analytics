The Hanni Starter Set gifted by Hanni is great for smooth skin. This razor is so unique in that you glide slow and don’t apply pressure because of sharper blades. The blades come separate but are easy to insert. The pillow shave is nice because it can be used on dry or wet skin and I like that it’s less messy than shave cream. My skin feels so smooth, this razor set works great. Works great
