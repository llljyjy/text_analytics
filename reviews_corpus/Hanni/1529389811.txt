Beautiful razor, beautiful shave! Shaving with this razor is different (going slow and short strokes worked best for me) — but it leaves my skin smoother than ever before. It’s great for legs and underarms but I especially loved it for the bikini area. It easily shaves even coarse, curly hair. Of course it looks stunning in my bathroom and I love the weighted feel. nan
