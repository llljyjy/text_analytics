#giftedbyhanni #loveisallmineThe Hanni shaving system is simple: Swipe the gel stick on the skin, rub in the formula, and then glide the razor.The extra-long handle with finger indent and grips make it easy to hold and maneuver, and the weight of the pink metal razor allows you to shave your underarms and legs without applying any pressure whatsoever. All you have to do is gently glide hanni against the skin to reveal what I have found to be the smoothest shave ever. The shave pillow is packaged in a deodorant-like tube, so when you open it, you’ll notice a white-ish gel substance that transforms into a hydrating liquid film when it touches the skin. It feels amazing. My smooth, nick-free legs are so thankful and I don’t think I’ll be going back to a disposable, multi-blade razor ever again.Thank You, Hanni! Smoothest Shave Ever
