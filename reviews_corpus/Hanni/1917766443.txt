the price may seem steep but it’s actually right on track for a metal razor (with accessories.) my husband has used traditional razors to shave his head for years. being curious, and jealous of his epic smoothness, I purchased my own. now HE is using the Hanni over his collection of razors. perfectly weighted, easy to use, and the closest shave of your life.however, the rpofuct description on the app is WRONG. it does not include the shower holder. it includes the inferior hero holder. grab yourself the shower holder for $12, it’s better.
