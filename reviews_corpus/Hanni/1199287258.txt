One of the things I’ve hated about shaving is shaving cream. This is genius. Well designed and smells lovely. Non irritating and helps the razor glide effortlessly. I’ve used it in and out the shower and it  works well in both environments. You should try it and tell me I’m wrong. Haha will repurchase
