This is the most luxurious razor I’ve ever had. I love everything about the packaging-soft to the touch razor and cool girly colors. I also love the idea “use longer-waste less”, perfect for Earth month! They even included a little blade bin for safe disposal. The razor is very gentle to the skin, you don’t need to apply any pressure, it basically glides but itself and the shaving gel helps with it. Big big love!Complimentary from hanni Big love!
