I am already in love after just one shave! This is totally different from a regular shaving cream in that you don’t need water to rinse it away. It glides on and feels very cool and wet and the shave is so very smooth. And after yours finished, you just rub in whatever product is left over like it’s a moisturizer. I had no razor burn or irritation at all. I’m a big fan. This product was gifted by hanni for review. Game changer!
