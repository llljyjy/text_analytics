The Hanni Shave Pillow isn’t like any other shave gel/cream I’ve ever tried! I love that this doesn’t have to be rinsed off, which makes it perfect for taking on the go—this is a hairy girl must-have. It has a great spicy-herbal scent, and it leaves my skin feeling so soft. The stick form is absolutely genius, there’s no mess and it’s incredibly convenient. I wish I’d had this years ago! This was gifted by Hanni for the purpose of review. nan
