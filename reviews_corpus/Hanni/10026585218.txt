I love the weighted handle. No pressure to use, just the weight of the razor handle. Easy to replace the razors. It comes with a tin to dispose over a year’s supply of razors and the whole thing can be recycled. The pillow shave is amazing, can be used for dry shave which saves water, and especially when you’re in a rush and need to shave, or use it wet. It has a nice mild fragrance. They have thought of everything even the razor guard to protect the head. And a nice sturdy razor holder. I was a bit wary to use this type of razor, but it was an unnecessary concern. It provided a nice close shave, from both sides of the razor and this worked better than my current triple blade razor with moisturizing bar. Highly recommend! Better for the environment
