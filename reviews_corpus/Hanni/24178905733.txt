Not just for shaving:) Yes it’s amazing to use with the Hanni razor but on its own it’s so wonderful! It glides over skin and leaves it soft and hydrated. I keep it on my bathroom counter to use after washing as a moisturizer for my hands. When you use it for shaving it creates an invisible barrier so you don’t get razor burn and helps your razor glide easier. I love that unlike regular shaving cream you don’t need to rinse. So it’s not messy at all and perfect for traveling. Such a great versatile product! Complimentary from Hanni Amazing
