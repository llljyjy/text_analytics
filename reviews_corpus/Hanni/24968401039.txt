I wasn’t quite sure what to expect, but upon opening the package, I was immediately impressed with the quality of the contents! That razor base and the razor itself has a bit of weight to it. It’s a very cool concept. As I continued through opening up the package and putting things together, I realized that the razor is like an old-timey close shave razor. I’ve never owned one of these before. I immediately did a test patch with the “shave pillow” balm on my leg and it is the closest shave I’ve ever gotten. The shave pillow is just balm for your legs but it’s quite nice. It’s a neutral smelling product that glides on your legs almost like deodorant. The razor canister is really nice because you can just discard your used blades through the little slot. I mean, they really thought this through! complimentary from hanni Amazing Products!
