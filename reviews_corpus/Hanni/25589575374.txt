I really wanted to love it, but unfortunately it didn’t work for me. Packaging and branding are amazing + I love the idea of sustainability (much better option than cheap plastic razors). But usability for me wasn’t as easy as I’m used to with normal razors. I couldn’t really get my delicate zones since the razor is pretty big and the head of it doesn’t move around. After using it for the first time on my legs I cut myself, but that’s because I’m not used to it I guess. I’ll keep trying to get used to it, but so far I can’t really make a full switch to this razor, even though I’d love to :( nan
