*gifted by Hanni for my honest reviewThis razor kit is very unique and nothing like anything I’ve tried before! The razor itself is super luxurious, and heavy weight!! I had a bit of learning curve using it cause I’ve only used disposable razors before but once you feel comfortable with this razor, you won’t wana go back to normal razors!! Using this gave me the closest shave and made my legs and arms feel super soft! The shave pillow is sooooo good and very travel friendly as it’s a gel stick!! Overall, the starter kit is a good value to try out all of Hanni’s products available at Sephora! So luxurious!!
