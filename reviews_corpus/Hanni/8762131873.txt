The hype is real! Truly the closest shave I’ve ever gotten and makes my skin feel so smooth. It is definitely different than shaving with a plastic razor but I got used to it pretty quickly. Would recommend if you’re on the fence - yes it’s more expensive, but the sustainability aspect is really important to me and the blades are way cheaper than plastic refills so I think it pays off in the end.
