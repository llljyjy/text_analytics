My fave part about this razor is that I can use it out of the shower for post laser touch ups. Because I laser, I often don’t notice where I have a post laser patch when I’m in the shower. So I love that I can use it for quick touch ups when I notice them. Zero irritation, zero hassle =) AND it looks absolutely stunning in my shower. Love that too. FAVE for post laser TOUCH UPS + its a STUNNER!
