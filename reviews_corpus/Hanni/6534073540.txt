It feels like buttery whipped cream while applying. This helps give me a closer shave and keeps the moisture in my skin that shaving can sometimes take away. I felt like it did get stuck more in my razor. just a little more work to get off the razor then normal foaming cream. I would recommend to my friends! nan
