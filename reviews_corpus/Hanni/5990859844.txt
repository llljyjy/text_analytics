amazing! this is one of my favorite “specialty” razors on the market! it definitely had a little bit of a learning curve…you kind of have to unlearn the long, pressured strokes you’d typically use with a traditional razor. the single blade gives such a clean and close shave…i’m prone to ingrown hairs and i feel that this is helping avoid those! the weight, feel, and pretty shade of the razor is an added bonus! closest shave!
