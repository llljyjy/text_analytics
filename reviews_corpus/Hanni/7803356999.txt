I get that this is supposed to be travel friendly and be a waterless shave solution. However you can only shave about three strokes with your razor before it gets all clogged up with the waxy balm, defeating the purpose of making this a waterless solution because you’d have to clean your razor off every few strokes with water. I tried it in the shower and it works fine but it’s no better than shaving cream and in the shower it’s easy to just clean your razor off. It does smell nice if you like essential oil type smells. Clogs up razor, not for on-the-go
