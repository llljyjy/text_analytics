When I first opened this razor, I liked the feel and weight. It was super easy to place the blade into position, and I appreciate how easy it will be to change blades when the time comes. It was definitely different to shave with a single blade razor, but I liked it a lot and felt my skin was soft and not as irritated. This was gifted by hanni for an honest review. nan
