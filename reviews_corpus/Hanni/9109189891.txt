I have very sensitive skin and frequently cut myself during shaving . I have to say after trying this, I’m in love , never gonna use the disposable razors from the store ever again. The razor shaves even very coarse hair cleanly and smoothly without damaging the skin. I was impressed by how the hair doesn’t clog up the razor head, but instead funnels out the back of the razor and washes away easily. Super easy to keep clean. The best!!!
