I used my Hanni set for first time tonight to shave underarms. I love the Shave Pillow balm, it has a sweet cinnamon smell and it moisturized and gave enough slip to my underarms while shaving without washing off too quickly. The razor was easy to handle, the weight of handle was PERFECT, it practically shaves itself since it weighs itself down and gives the perfect amount of glide to shave. I had no cuts and a close shave with no stinging or irritation. I’m so happy I got this gifted by Hanni! can’t wait to shave my legs with it next smooth shave with no irritation
