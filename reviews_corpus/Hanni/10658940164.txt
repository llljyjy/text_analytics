this razor was gifted by hanni. wow this was my first time using a razor like this and i’m so impressed! the experience itself is just so amazing- the weighted razor feels so luxurious and sleek. i was initially scared to cut myself, but it’s actually super easy to use and gave me such a sleek shave. i also noticed way less irritation compared to the other razors i’ve used in the past. will definitely be using this in the future! amazing razor
