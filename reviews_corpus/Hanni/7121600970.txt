I like this shave kit so far, but I’m not sure if it’s something I would get again. You have the shave really slowly, per the instructions, which for me isn’t worth the time if you can shave at a normal speed with a regular, good quality razor. It’s a close shave but ends up leaving patches here and there because I’m worried about getting the speed right and not applying too much pressure, and less about precision. Maybe I just need to get used to it, but it seems like more trouble than it’s worth.  Gifted by Hanni nan
