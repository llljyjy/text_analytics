Ok not going to lie, I was a little nervous because I heard there was a learning curve but honestly I haven’t found that to be the case. I followed the instructions and didn’t apply alot of pressure and had THE BEST SHAVE I’ve ever had.  I always get razor burn and this left me without any. Like for the first time in my life, my skin is not irritated with shaving. 1000% converted. Goodbye Billie. Throwing my Billie away
