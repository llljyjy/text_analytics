the hanni weighted razor is 100% recyclable safety razor that is a single-blade, that gives u a super-smooth finish with no ingrown hairs or razor burn. This razor is expertly weighted so you don’t have to apply a ton of pressure to shave. To replace an old blade, all you have to do is twist the bottom of the razor’s shaft. This opens up the head so you can literally toss away the used blade without even touching it.  Hands down one of my favorite razors so far. I received this complimentary from Hanni. nan
