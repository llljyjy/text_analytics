I was supposed to receive this in exchange for a review.Unfortunately, it never got to me, so I cannot confidently say if this is a great product or not.In theory, the weight of the ravine offers balance, which can provide a smooth and even shave. I love the idea of it being different than just a standard throw away razor. Those are not completely eco-friendly.I wonder if, for someone like myself, that one blade will be enough. I usually have to do a few passes with a 5-blade for a smooth shave. nan
