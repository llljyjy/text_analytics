I’ve only used this in the shower and though it smells amazing, it does little for my skin. I can’t even feel the product on my skin when I apply. I might need to warm it beforehand but I don’t have time for that. I do want to try this on dry skin but haven’t had the chance yet. I do like the smell and it feels soft so I’m hoping the first try was just a fluke. nan
