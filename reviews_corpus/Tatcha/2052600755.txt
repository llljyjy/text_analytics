Really loved how this was easy to absorb on my skin and was light weight! I usually reapply after two hours and this did not feel like it was greasy in fact it left a great satin matte finish. It has an earthy like clay smell but it’s not strong. I wish it wasn’t so expensive but it is worth the price tag. The fact that it’s compact and easy to store in my purse is a plus too!
