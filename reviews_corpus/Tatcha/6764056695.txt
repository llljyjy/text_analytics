I had high hopes for this cream. Unfortunately, it did nothing at all.. I’m not sure how something can make you break out and give you dry skin at the same time but that’s what happened to me. I would MUCH rather use Nivea or cetaphil for a moisturizer- at least I know I’ll get some results and not break the bank buying a mediocre cream. Definitely not worth it, in my experience with this product. I thought I’d see some pretty amazing results and wanted to try something new, my search continues! not worth it!
