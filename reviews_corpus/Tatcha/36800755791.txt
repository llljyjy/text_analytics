.In Japanese, Tatcha represents the embodiment of simplicity, purity, and quality...all of which the Tatcha product line embodies. I spent ten-years on the island of Okinawa, Japan–a magical prefecture where my aging process “stood still.“ It is well known that Okinawans boast the longest life expectancy of any people of the world–for myriad reasons; many of which are packed inside the sacred vials of all things Tatcha. I have already reviewed Tatcha’s Rice Wash and Dewy Skin Cream, but allow me to discuss the wondrous effects of Tatcha’s Dewy Serum. During my 10 years living on Okinawa, Japan, I became quite intimate with its people, culture, diet, spirituality – simple ingredients for a wholesome life. It was there that we learned that all that lies within us, is of the earth. Tatcha Serum contains 73% Hadasei-3 complex, which is a fermentation of uji green tea, Okinawa Mozuku algae, and akita rice – a formulation of moisturizers that actually plump the skin’s appearance. If Cost is an issue, there are travel and mini sizes a available through Sephora and other beauty retailers, with a sufficient amount to allow one to “see for one’s self.“ Until I discovered Tatcha in recent months, I only used “Origins“ skin & body products because their products are nature-derived. I will continue to use Origins, but I will use Tatcha Rice Wash, Dewy Cream, and Dewy Serum for daily essential skin prep. Okinawan Botanicals are Key to Youthful Skin
