I love this moisturizer! I have bought so many different moisturizers from Sephora in the past and this is by far the best. No matter what, I always end up coming back to this one. I have semi sensitive skin and on average will break out with other lotion as they are too thick and my skin is a bit oily and in some spots also dry. This works best. Light clean smell, but doesnâ€™t ever sting or burn my face. It just absorbs into my skin so nicely. I use this with the Tatcha deep cleanse or the Rice Wash Skin-Softening cleanser and my skin looks and feels so good. I use the Youth to People peptide serum beforehand and they go great together. So happy they brought back the value size. I already ordered the standard size, but when I saw the other come back into stock, I TOOK NO CHANCES, had to order it as well. Well worth the purchase. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE ITTT! TACHA WATER CREAM ADDICTED!
