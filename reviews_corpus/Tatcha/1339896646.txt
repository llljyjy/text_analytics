Terrible packaging and inadequate sun protection. The feel and look of the sunscreen is like an oil but layers well with other products and leaves non greasy with no white film. Im not convinced the product works as intended. I was in the sun for 40 minutes and got burned. It was a high altitude location so that may be a contributing factor.Also, the package labeling starts deteriorating after a few weeks use, and actually gets on your hands. The shimmer from the packaging would end up everywhere. Also the cap leaves a mess. I never even finished the bottle and ended up throwing it away due to the mess.A waste. Bad packaging and poor performance in the sun
