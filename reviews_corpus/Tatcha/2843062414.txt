I have very dry skin and thought it would be great for me bases on reviews. Unfortunately it completely dried my skin out and made it flaky, rough, and painful which is disappointing because my skin was smooth and will now take time to get back to that. It would be great for those without dry skin because it definitely has a nice mix of cleansing and exfoliating to it. Not for very dry skin
