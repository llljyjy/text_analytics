I got a mini sample of this and the cleanser from the Dewy Line. Absolutely loved it, after only using it for 2 days my skin cleared so well  felt so soft and clean after the wash.  This is great because I have been looking for a moisturizer and cleanser to help my acne and oily skin. Definitely helped me after 2 days. Saw instant results from oily acne like skin to clear and less oily. Very Less breakouts. Iâ€™m so happy I found something perfect for my skin!! yes yes yes
