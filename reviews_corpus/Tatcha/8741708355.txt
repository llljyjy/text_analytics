I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. Firstly, the packaging is absolutely beautiful! This toner is gentle, lightweight, and doesn’t leave behind a sticky residue! I’ve been using this toner 3x a week and noticed some improvements in my combo skin. There was no irritation, and my skin looks calmer and feels smoother. There is a herbal almost licorice scent to it, but it does fade pretty quickly. Overall, this is a lovely toner. Beautiful toner!
