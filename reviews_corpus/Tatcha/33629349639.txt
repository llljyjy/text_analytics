It’s a good product, but the packaging is made heavy like the actual tin feels heavy but the amount of product they give is sooo little. I feel like I’m getting ripped off, and ngl for this price the product has to be made of good or freaking silver but it’s not so it’s pretty overpriced for a good product. Too freaking pricey
