This was a hard review to write. I am always searching for the best physical sunscreen for protection and to wear under makeup. Despite the price, I decided this one was worth a try. The first thing I noticed is that the packaging is AWFUL. The sunscreen is very thin and it just spills out of the packaging. It really should be in a pump container to prevent spilling and wasting the product. Now for the sunscreen itself: it goes on with no white cast due to the peachy color. I’m very fair and white casts usually aren’t an issue for me, so I’m unsure how this would work for POC. Overall it’s kind of unremarkable, which may be good thing in a sunscreen. It goes on smoothly and isn’t too hydrating or too drying. You can’t really tell you even put on sunscreen. It work well under makeup. I’ve tried it over my vitamin C serum and under my Nars and Makeup Forever Foundations with no issues. The only major issue with the product itself is that it will pill when paired with silicone based moisturizers and primers. I can see that being a problem for a lot of people. Overall, this has been the best physical sunscreen I’ve tried under makeup, despite the many caveats. I will likely repurchase, but please change the packaging!!! Great with some caveats…
