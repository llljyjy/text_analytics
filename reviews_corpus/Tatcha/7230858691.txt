I used this (mini sample size birthday gift that I got in AZ) at the gym/pool recently last week in the shower after my workout last week and wow, I think i might like the way this one cleanses more than the deep cleanse because it starts off kinda exfoliating & then instantly turns frothy and super soft, smooth and foamy. It really cleanses the face and no residue if cleansed well, leaves the face quite soft and very clean. Just the name “Rice Wash“ makes me go, oh, ew, but nahhh, cause its super good cleanser and leaves skin almost baby soft, really clean, and smells nice with a great texture. I’m sure if used everyday you would see results in your skin and complexion. nan
