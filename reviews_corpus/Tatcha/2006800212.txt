Like the previous reviewer (and several others), I got this as part of my birthday gift and I’m already in love and planning to head back to my local Sephora today for a full sized jar.  Everything in the name is true - it is dewy, plumping and hydrating.  Even though I’m fairly well stocked with moisturizers from other companies, with winter approaching, this cream will be really wonderful.  And the dewy fresh glow it adds will be welcome in the dull days of winter! Just WOW!
