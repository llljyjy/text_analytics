I am absolutely living for this cream! I bought the value size jar and the packaging is beautiful. the mild fragrance is pleasant and a little of this stuff goes a long way so I think it is worth the money. during the warm months I am using it at night and when I wake up my skin is plump and radiant, and it will be great in the winter when my skin gets more dry. Iâ€™m glad I finally bit the bullet and tried a Tatcha product, I will definitely be trying more products from this brand in the future. nan
