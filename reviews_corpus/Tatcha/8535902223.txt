I love this mask! Pricey yes! But I always tried masks that would eventually break my skin out. It’s part of my self care routine. I enjoy putting it on, reading a good book while it does it’s magic. It leaves my face radiant. Tatcha goes above and beyond with their products. Add this to your skincare/self care!
