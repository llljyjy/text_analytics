i bought this with my OWN money this isn’t a fake/incentivized review like so many others on the sephora website, and this is the BEST sunscreen on the market and i’ve tried alllllll of them. I have dry skin and it doesn’t pill, it isn’t greasy at all and i actually mean that (i hate when ppl say it’s “not greasy” when in reality it is), it’s super hydrating and does not leave a white cast! bc of the hyaluronic acid, i apply it to damp skin and it feels like a dream <3 i’m also a busy girl so i honestly use this as a daytime moisturizer/spf bc it feels so hydrating! -second best sunscreen ever is the shiseido stick but this tatcha sunscreen definitely beats it! nan
