i have normal to dry skin and this absolutely met my pretty high expectations. you really don’t need a lot of it to cover your face and it really make you feel hydrated, soft and smooth (as well as bougie). i took a star off because i felt like it should’ve lasted longer on my skin than it did, and because its literally $70 which is still absurd to me tbh if you can afford it, buy it
