I bought this product a couple years ago and I used up a full bottle and enjoyed it. Now fast forward to today. I bought another bottle to try out years later.It did not give me that clean feeling. It was very oily on my skin and I emulsified it with water into a milk wash and then I took a face cloth to wash off all my make up. I had to do that twice, to get all my makeup off and then do a second cleanse with something else.For the price, it’s too expensive to have to use another face wash on top of this for a double cleanse. After my face was washed with this, I felt a filmy residue left behind and my face did not completely feel clean. I also experienced a few breakouts, so sadly after a few days of using, I returned. I found this much more oily then I remembered it years ago. For me, it just felt like I was putting cooking oil on my face to remove my make up and to me, that’s not a nice feeling, so I returned it. Packaging was beautiful, but I cannot justify spending so much on a product that gave me minimal results and breakouts. I have combination oily skin with dry patches and this did not hydrate my skin at all. I really wanted to love this, but it did not work out for me. There are better face washes out there!
