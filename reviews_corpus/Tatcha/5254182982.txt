I was very excited to try this with it being on the higher SPF side and not being a fully chemical sunscreen and was horribly disappointed. It broke me out BAD and not a lot of products do that. Additionally it smells terrible, think old dry play dough. You also need a lot more product then you’d think with the liquidy consistency of the product as it doesn’t spread very smoothly. Definitely would not repurchase or recommend especially for $60 not for me
