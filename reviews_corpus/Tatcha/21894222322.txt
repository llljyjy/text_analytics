This is definitely my favorite moisturizer. It feels very light on skin almost feels like you are rubbing water. Leaves your skin feeling very hydrated and fresh. The very thin consistency worried me at first because I thought it would dry up quickly but it doesnt! After using for a few days my skin felt noticeably soft all day long. Definitely recommend for anyone with similar skin to me. For background I have an oily t zone the rest of my face is dry and I have a small amount of acne. My favorite moisturizer for years!
