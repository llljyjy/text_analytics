I found this to be an ok cleanser. It lathers up easy enough, not a super strong smell. Not the best at cleansing but does ok. I noticed no difference in my pores or texture of my skin. My skin did not feel dry afterwards, and I have dehydrated combo skin, and there was no reactions or redness. These are my honest opinions as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador. Ok.
