I have oily skin so not a moisturizer I use daily, but after facial scrubs it is literally the best. Less is more with this, covered my entire face with so little product. Since I have oily skin, I tend not to use moisturizers as much but this doesn’t make me feel oily at all (after facial scrubs) and it gives a nice little sheen without it looking oily. Smells super good but mild, so if you’re someone sensitive to smells then this would be good for you. All in all, would recommend to all genders and skin types. 10/10
