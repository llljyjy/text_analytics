I have dry skin and thought that this was very appealing to be able to use on my lips or face fast and discretely. Formula sucks, I would rather use chapstick otherwise my lips are dry after 2 minutes with this stuff. Also if you put it on your face plan to really rub it in with your hands which I would say slightly defeats the purpose of having a serum stick because if my hands are not clean enough to touch my moisturizer they are not clean enough to rub product onto my face. Iâ€™d rather get something I like in a travel size instead. Good idea, poor yet expensive execution.
