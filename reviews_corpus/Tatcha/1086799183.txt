I purchased a Tatcha gift set  a couple of months ago which included this cleanser and I’ve been enjoying it. My skin feels a lot less oily, but I haven’t really noticed a huge difference with the appearance of my pores. To give some perspective, my skin is oily all over, not just on the T-zone area and the amount of oil on my skin is insane. This cleanser has done a terrific job in combating the oiliness. I also love that my skin feels so soft after using this.I use this cleanser twice a day along with the Water Cream and the Silk Peony eye cream. After cleansing and before using the moisturizer, I use an astringent (Sea Breeze).I wound up purchasing the Deep Cleanse Gentle Exfoliating Cleanser in the full size as I’ve been happy with how it’s controlled the oil on my skin. I would recommend this product to anyone who has an over abundance of oil on their skin but I think for the best result, to use it twice a day. Great Cleanser for Very Oily Skin
