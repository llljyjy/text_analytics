I chose the Tatcha birthday gift and while I’m not a huge fan of the dewy moisturizer it came with, I’m totally in love with the Rice Wash cleanser! After using it just once, I had to get the full size right away. It feels so luxurious and pampering as you lather on your skin. It’s super gentle but is still an effective cleanser. I normally get at least one pimple somewhere on my face during “that time of the month,“ but since using this cleanser, I didn’t get any! Five stars! A new favorite!!!
