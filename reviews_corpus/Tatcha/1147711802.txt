This primer is amazing in the liquid form. It smooths my skin and does not ball up or flake prior to applying my foundation. My only complaint is how difficult it was to open the container to try to use up lots of leftover product. I literally had to break the very hard plastic bottle with a hammer to get to it! It shouldn’t be so difficult to get something like this open. For this reason I may have to look for another primer, I hate knowing there is wasted product that will be thrown away. Plus, I don’t find the packaging to be environmentally friendly. Nice Primer, Lots of Wasted Product Though
