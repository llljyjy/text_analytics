I have used many different clay masks over the years and this ranks at the top. Not surprised because it’s Tatcha - a brand I have come to rely on for exceptionally crafted skincare products - but it’s now in my clay mask rotation alongside GLAMGLOW Supermud and Chanel La Masque Vitamin Anti-Pollution Clay Mask. This is superb, thank you Tatcha! I love the calming, warming sensation which you can feel gently opening pores and cleaning them out. But what I love about this is that it’s not at all stripping like some clay masks I have tried in the past. When you remove it the skin feels soothed and moisturized. exceptional mask
