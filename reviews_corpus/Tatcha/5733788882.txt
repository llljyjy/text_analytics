This product is good the packaging is HORRENDOUS. So disappointed, I bought this before I needed because I was so excited to try a Tatcha product, causing it to be too late to return in the window. Complete waste. Regularly explodes all over my hands and counter. I try to clean it off and the bottle starts peeling. I try to save some product but some of the purple from the bottle makes it to my face. To date I’ve filled one bounty sheet full of this and had to wash some down the drain because of how much comes out. I put so much of it on my face and I still had the extra so I had no choice but to wash my money down the drain. Even if you think you’ve finally have it under control it starts erupting again. I am careful and try to predict the flow and go very slowly to carefully get a little and it just pours out. I complained to Sephora and got a $20 discount on a future product but I’m still ticked that I spent so much money on this. Sunscreen overall is great. But the packaging is enough to never make me want to buy this again. Picture is after second use. You’ll waste more than you’ll use.
