I got this in a birthday kit. I had used the moisturizer before and I loved that so I figured I would give the cleanser a try and I was so happy with the results. I used to have extremely textured skin and within a week the texture on my nose was pretty much gone. The stubborn pimples on my cheeks went away and the redness on my face went way down. This is definitely worth a try!! Highly recommend!! nan
