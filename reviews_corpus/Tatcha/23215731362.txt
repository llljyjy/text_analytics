I love this moisturizer! I have combination skin that is sometimes sensitive to changing products but this is so gentle I had zero issues with breaking out once switching to this. It’s a really creamy consistency and I personally wouldn’t wear it during the day, but at night before bed, it feels great and I wake up with hydrated skin. nan
