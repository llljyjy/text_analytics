wow！It dries out my lips badly. I didn’t have any expectation for it when I purchase, because I love collecting lip balms and so on, and Tatcha has a rep so I figured it wouldn’t be too bad anyway, at least average you know :) until one day I was sick, and my lips was so dry, I took it out and had it one my lips overnight. guess what, my lips completely dried out the next day xD it’s unbelievable you know. But then I figured maybe my illness was too bad for those non-medicine products to have an impact. The same day I took another lip balm brands Primera, Guess What! my lips are so much better after few hours xD then I realize Tatcha Camelia did nothing moisturizing to my lips and actually dried them out :) The product itself has a pleasant smell, even though it doesn’t do a massive impact on my lips during normal days, you can only tell the real effect when your body has a bad day you know just like my experience. Not sure if I’m the only one have this problem with this product xDBut I actually don’t hate it still, I’m not mad either, I have two stars because I just wanna be honest :) at least with my own experience. For a lip balm product, it didn’t moisturize my lips but the opposite :D just want to remind you guys. enjoy other Tatcha products as well~ wow！it dries out my lips :(
