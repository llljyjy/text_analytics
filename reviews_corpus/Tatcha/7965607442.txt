I really enjoyed this mask but then my skin started to itch so I was only able to keep it on for no longer than 2 minutes. My skin felt nice and soft afterwards I just hope my skin gets used to its ingredients. Iâ€™ll give this a 4 out of 5 as I will continue to use it a few times to give a final verdict. Gifted by tatcha. Nice mask, a little itchy
