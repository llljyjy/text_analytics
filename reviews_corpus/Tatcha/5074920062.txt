There’s a lot of products that are overhyped or overpriced and this one is top of both those lists right now. I wanted to love it, the soft tint was a great idea, the packaging was fine, the smell was pleasant, and for $60 you’d expect it to wear like a dream. It doesn’t.Makeup either slips right off, separates, or gets patchy.It’s definitely not the skin prep or the products since without the sunscreen it all looks beautiful together.But add in this product and you get a grab bag of issues you could run into before you’re even meant to reapply. I talked to a few of the workers to get suggestions on a replacement and found out they had similar experiences and am still trying out the other products. So far literally everything works better than this. Paying for a name, not product quality.
