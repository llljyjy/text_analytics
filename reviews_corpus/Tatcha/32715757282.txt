I’m excited to try the clarifying clay mask from Tatcha. I’ve tried a few of Tatcha’s products and they’ve all been fantastic. This mask is wonderful since it does not irritate my skin or make it dry out. However, it is still effective. It’s ideal for individuals with clogged pores or combination-oily skin.*Gifted by Tatcha nan
