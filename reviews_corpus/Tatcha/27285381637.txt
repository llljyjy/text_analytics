I liked this serum, it goes on with a nice gliding feeling and hydrates well. I didn’t see any noticeable brightening after using it every morning for a week but my complexion also wasn’t dull so it could be a gradual thing. This serum didn’t sting like other serums with a high concentration of vitamin c but there was a light buzzing sensation upon application. I likely won’t be purchasing this product myself but I’d recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality brightening serum. nan
