For the price & quality of this product the packaging is horrible. I actually really enjoy the product & the way it feels & how it works as a primer as well, but I won’t be repurchasing because after 1 use the top & lid have leaked !!! It gets everywhere if you aren’t careful because it’s a more liquidy formula than the other silk line products nan
