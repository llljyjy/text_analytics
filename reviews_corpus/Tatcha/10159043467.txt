I love all Tatcha cream products. I do have normal to dry type of skin. This one is meant for more oily skin, because it’s too watery and the texture is less smooth. I’ve got some skin irritation after using this green one. But the rest of these cream products feel so good on the skin and are easily absorbed. Not for dry skin.
