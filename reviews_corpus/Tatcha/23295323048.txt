The sunscreen/formula itself is fantastic. My skin is super sensitive and this leaves it feeling hydrated and doesn’t make me itchy like so many products do. But the second you take off the cap the liquid spills out everywhere and I always get more than I wanted and or it gets all over my clothes. Not sure if I will repurchase because for the price, it feels like product is being wasted and that’s hard to justify. I’d give 5 stars if not for the leaky/bad packaging love the product, HATE the packaging
