Mediocre product and not worth the price. This moisturizer is a little bit on the thicker side and leaves my skin glowing. Although it makes my skin look nice, I don’t like how greasy it feels on my face so I definitely wouldn’t recommend for people with greasy skin. The fragrance is also so bad and has a very strong lavender scent in my opinion. nan
