The end result of this cleanser was clean skin, not overly stripped but slightly irritated. The scent was over powering, and while I donâ€™t mind fragrance in wash off products it detracted from the experience rather than enhancing it. The texture was creamy with a slight gritty feeling that irritated my sensitive skin. It was also extremely thick and difficult to spread without adding a ton of water which I did not enjoy. nan
