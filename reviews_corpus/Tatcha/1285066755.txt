This clarifying clay mask that subtly warms to open pores, absorb excess oil, gently exfoliate, and decongest skin without drying. The mask applied really smoothly and I like the gentle warming feeling. Be sure to read instructions and not leave it on for too long, just like 3-5 min. Thatâ€™s another great thing, all the great benefits of a clay mask without having to keep it on for so long! I received this complimentary from Tatcha. Love the results
