I used this twice after doing a 24 Hr test patch prior. My skin was clear and smooth before trying it. My whole face is now completely covered in tiny white heads and so oily. Even areas where i have never ever struggled with acne- like my forehead- there are tons of them! Itâ€™s going to take me ages to get my skin to recover from this. So. Many. White heads.
