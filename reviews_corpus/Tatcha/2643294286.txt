I’ve tried many exfoliants over the years but I just keep coming back to this one. It’s gentle but effective and feels good on the skin while you use it. Potential downsides: it can take a few tries to figure out your preferred powder/water ratio since you mix it yourself. I have also found the full size pours faster than the travel size so on my first use I poured out way too much.In my opinion it’s still well worth it! I will repurchase in the future. All Time Fave
