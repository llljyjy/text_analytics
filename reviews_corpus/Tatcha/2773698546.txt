I finally tried this and it’s divine. I think I like it better than the Laneige and Fresh lip masks that I’ve been using for years. It’s super moisturizing and feels luxurious. The amount of product you get is pretty little though. It’s pricey but I think it’s worth repurchasing. So far Tatcha products haven’t disappointed me. Insanely moisturizing and feels luxurious
