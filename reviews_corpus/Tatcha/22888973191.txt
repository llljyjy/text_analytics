Pros: -Goes on feeling weightless/has no fragrance.-Zero breakouts/clogged pores, irritation, or redness.-Finally a sunscreen that does NOT make my sensitive eyes water/irritated (have tried all Supergoop, Peter Thomas Roth, Dr Gross, etc).- Minimizes pores & preferred over the liquid silk canvas primer for my makeup.Cons: Packaging. At first glance the packaging looks very sleek, but by the second use it peeled off flaking all over my hands & was very hard to get off. The viscous formula drips out of the bottle like crazy, & easily leaks.-Slight white cast (I have olive skin) that does oxidize down ever so slightly with time. It does pill if too much product is used so less is more.Iâ€™m all for investing in formula>packing but this does need to be fixed for me to spend $60 on 1.7oz of spf again. Ultimately will likely repurchase. nan
