Used to love the original formula, esp in the winter.  Was disappointed to see a new formula when I needed to replenish, but wanted to give this a try.  Totally different customer for this product- used to be soothing, thick balm for when skin was irritated and dry -now is a thinner formula, not soothing, with active ingredients that make me break out.  Really disappointed.  Probably better for general consumption but not for the targeted use before Not like the original, made me breakout
