I’ve been struggling with hormonal breakouts /sensitive skin for a while and have been trying to treat it. As a result my face got extremely dry and agitated. This caused more breakouts and so much frustration. I tried so many different products and treatment and nothing was working! My makeup was also so patchy and I wasn’t confident at all.  This was highly recommended but given the price I wasn’t wanting to try. Let me tell you TRY IT. My face hasn’t had one pimple since I started using it  week ago and it treated all my dry spots immediately. I can’t tell you how happy I am. More than amazing
