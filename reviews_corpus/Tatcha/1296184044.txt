Product is the same, but let’s face it, part of Tatcha is the luxury. This ain’t it. When I first got it, I thought that they forgot to put the jar in the box. It was so light. I bought the Indigo overnight serum at the same time and that container was weighty. The cream is marvelous so I can’t fault it, but when you buy luxury you look for the luxury. I’d recommend it if you like the cream as you get good value in this. Inside is great, but packaging is cheap
