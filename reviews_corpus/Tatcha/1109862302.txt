I am very happy with this mask. First of all it washes off easily- having to rub my skin to remove a mask is a big no for me. After using it my skin felt smooth and soft. I didnâ€™t experience any dryness which is usually common with clay make. It has some fragrance, but I enjoyed it.The package is beautiful as it is usually the case with Tatcha products. This product was gifted by Tatcha. Easy to remove!
