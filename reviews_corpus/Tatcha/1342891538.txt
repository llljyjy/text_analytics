Ok, Ok, the packaging is terrible. Got it!, and glad to hear they are fixing it. BUT.... the product is wonderful! I have fair skin, usually clear, and older (65). After a light moisturizer (Water Cream), I use Tatcha’s liquid Silk Primer, and then the Sunscreen over it- and that’s it for the day. Nothing feels heavy at all. Light & Wonderful
