This is definitely my favorite sunscreen i have tried so far. It’s very light weight and easy to reapply throughout the day. This is a full mineral spf 50++++ that doesn’t leave a white cast and even with the tint i can still wear it. This isn’t really a tinted sunscreen since it goes clear after application but my skin looks a little more even and glowing which i love since im to pale for tinted sunscreens. My only complaint is the packaging. The paint chips off so i have to check my hands before applying or i get paint on my face and when i first opened it i spilled a little because it was so liquidy that holding the bottle squeezed it out. I hold it from the sides now so that doesn’t happen. For me i find it worth the price because it’s hard for me to continually reapply sunscreens because im acne prone and i have combination skin that gets really oily in the summer. This is so thin i don’t have an issue with reapplying and if i get to shiny i can go over with a powder sunscreen later.  I only removed one star because i feel like the product is really good it’s just the packaging that really needs an upgrade. Love this but packaging needs a fix
