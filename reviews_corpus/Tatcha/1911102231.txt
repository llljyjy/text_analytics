35 years old with hormonal acne, texture/scarring and the starting of fine lines. This is my holy grail product for the last 2 years. I’ve never broken out from it, the scent/fragrance doesn’t bother me or cause irritation, and besides the instant glow the cream gives, the long-term hydration is amazing. I used to have dehydrated skin that led to more acne. This is perfect for my skin type. (Not dry or oily). Even the tops of my hands look younger from wiping what’s left on them. Everything for me.
