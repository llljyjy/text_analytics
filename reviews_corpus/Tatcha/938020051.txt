I bought this immediately when reading this new Tatcha sunscreen was actually water resistant for 80 minutes.  This is because the Sephora picture descriptions showed this claim.  Upon receiving the item the bottle nor packaging says anything about water resistance AT ALL.  I then went to the Tatcha website and it also shows NOTHING about any claims of water resistance so please keep in mind when purchasing if you are also hoping to use this at the beach as I was.  I did try the suncreen itself and it was ok for oily skin but will be better for drier skin types.    It does feel very light on and did blur ever so slightly but since this is not water resistant I am returning it. NOT WATER RESISTANT for 80 MINUTES!
