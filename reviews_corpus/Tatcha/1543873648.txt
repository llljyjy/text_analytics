Gifted by Tatcha, but the review is my I really enjoyed this mask experience. I love that it’s only 3-5 minutes so it’s super easy for me to fit into my evening skincare routine. Wipes off easily with a soft cloth and leaves my skin feeling soft, clean but not stripped or tight. Clean without stripping
