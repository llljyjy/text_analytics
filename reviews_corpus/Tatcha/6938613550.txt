This is the best sunscreen I have ever used. Dry, oily, combo, normal skin types will all love this. No pilling, no greasy heavy feeling, no white cast. Just a gorgeous formula. Is it worth the money? Yes. Spf is the only proven anti agong product, the only product to stop you from getting skin cancer. And if you hate spf absolutely this is worth it. I have tried hundreds of spfs at this point (including koren and other japanese) and non hold a candle to this one. God send.
