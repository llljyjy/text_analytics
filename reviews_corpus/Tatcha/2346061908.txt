I think this moisturizer is pretty nice, but honestly not worth the price. I got a sample in an Ipsy bag and liked it enough to buy the value size jar, but after using it up I’ll be looking for a less expensive alternative. If the price point gives you even a moment’s pause, skip it; I’ve used $6 moisturizers  that gave me comparable results. just ok
