I was recently gifted by Tatcha their new Silk Sunscreen. This formula is so lovely. Its an SPF 50 mineral sunscreen with 12.6% zinc & It feels just like their silk primer on my skin.  Sinks into the skin beautifully & is perfect under makeup. Tatcha has really outdone themselves with this formula. Incredible Mineral Sunscreen
