I love Tatcha’s SPF 30 so I was looking forward to trying this new formula. A lot of mineral sunscreens feel heavy, greasy, and or grainy in texture. Thankfully Tatcha’s has a nice lightweight, runny texture! I found it hydrating but didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy. On the downside, the tint ended up looking grey on my skin tone. It looks pretty unflattering unless I wore some sort of concealer or foundation. It’s hard to tell in photos but is really obvious IRL. I do think people with lighter skin tones who want an elegant mineral sunscreen, will enjoy this formula! But the tint didn’t work out on my medium, tan skin tone.*gifted by Tatcha but all thoughts are my own nan
