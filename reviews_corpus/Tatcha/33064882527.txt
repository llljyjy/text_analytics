I received a free sample and didnâ€™t love this. The dewy texture seems to come from a vaseline-y ingredient so it goes on very thick and feels heavy...if using this plus an SPF it can feel like a lot for the first hour.That said it is very hydrating and does leave skin softer. Sticky but nourishing
