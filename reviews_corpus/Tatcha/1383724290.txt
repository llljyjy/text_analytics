The sunscreen itself is not bad… Blends nicely and gives the skin a soft glow - not oily and doesn’t irritate. The packaging is the WORST. I don’t understand how this passed quality check. When first opened, the product gushed out and wouldn’t stop for a good minute. A week later, I started to notice little specks of purple on my face and realized that the paint from the packaging was peeling off. It’s such a light layer of paint that it easily stuck to my fingers and my face during application. I brought this to Sephora and the associate said this was a common issue due to the natural / clean packaging, and suggested to use scotch tape to wrap around the bottle. I literally lol-ed. Went home and used a Clorox wipe to take off the remaining paint from the bottle so I can actually use the sunscreen. Would recommend only if Tatcha changes the packaging.
