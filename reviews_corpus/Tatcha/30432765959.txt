This is the best makeup remover. The ingredients are clean and itâ€™s gentle yet effective. Gently massage it into your skin and your makeup will pretty much melt off. I will say that I use an additional face cleanser afterwards but I love it as a first step to my evening routine! the best clean makeup remover!
