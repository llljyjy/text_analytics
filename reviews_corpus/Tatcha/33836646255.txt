The Tatcha Dewy Skin cream doesn’t need another glowing review, but here I am anyway. This was my first luxury skincare purchase. I do not regret it! First off it smells heavenly. But it’s not so fragranced that it causes me a headache or irritation. It’s a divine lavender scent. It applies so smoothly and feels incredible on the skin. I’ve found a few moisturizers that I like in the 5ish months I’ve been on tretinoin and this is my favorite. I top with a squalane oil on rest nights and wake up looking dewy! The epitome of luxury moisturizers!
