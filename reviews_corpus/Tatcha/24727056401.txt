When I tried out the product at first impression i wasnt the biggest fan, it was a little heavy for my oily skin and took a bit long to dry on the skin. But then I started using after shower (after I cleanse my face) and I learned that a little goes a long way, with a smaller amount and using after I cleanse it has been a life saver for my oily skin, I noticed a lot less acne after using this product and my skin feels a lot more hydrated and soft, as far as minimizing pores I still havent noticed a difference, but I suppose that comes from continuous use. I love it and recommend for oily skin types!! Specially if you live somewhere hot So good for oily acne prone skin!!!
