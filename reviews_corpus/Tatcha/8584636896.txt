Love this product! I’ve been using religiously for over two years and my skin has never meshed this well with a cleanser. Ever! Really bummed Sephora stopped carrying the value size - I now purchase through Tatcha’s website directly. Sucks because I love getting the points through Sephora. Fingers crossed they’ll see this and decide to bring it back. Lol Great cleanser! Great value!
