This is the most adorable sunscreen ever! The design makes it so convenient to slip in your pocket or keep in your purse. It has a precision applicator tip so perfect for the face and reapplication. Zero white cast. The texture has a tint and is a little runny but absorbs beautifully. At first it gives a dewy sheen but absorbs to matte. In my pic you can see the texture straight out of the bottle. I do have a layer of the sunscreen already absorbed in on the top of my hand so you can see how it looks once applied.This product is weightless and plays well with makeup. It is hydrating for a sunscreen; however, I would not rely on this soley for hydration with dry skin. This is overall a really nice product. I was gifted by Tatcha in exchange for an honest review.
