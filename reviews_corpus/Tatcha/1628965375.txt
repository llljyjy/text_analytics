Two days in and I’m obsessed. Use a pea sized amount on very wet hands, lather first on your hands, then smooth over your face in upward circles for SIXTY seconds. Supple, moisture-balanced, bouncy CLEAN skin awaits. On the pricier side of cleansers for me but considering a little goes a long way, I don’t see myself going through it quickly. 10/10. Dare I say Perfection?
