This lip mask is very hydrating for me, I naturally have lips that dry out so easily, I always have to have some type of lip balm or oil or mask on it or my lips will start cracking. I put this on before bed and my lips are hydrated in the morning when I wake up. A little definitely goes a long way and the packaging is so cute, love thatâ€™s tiny spatula scoop is included too Hydrating and cute packaging!
