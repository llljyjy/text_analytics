When Tatcha first came out I was interested in purchasing a lot of the products however when I talked to an employee (FYI with flawless skin) she told me that Tasha is fine but it has a lot of extra/unnecessary ingredients which is why she doesn’t use it. This is important because fast-forward a few years and I finally decided to buy some Tatcha products. For reference I have sensitive combination/oily skin. Its very rare that my skin breaks out and I don’t really have any skin issues, I mainly use products to prevent aging. So I purchased this treatment serum and for the first week all was fine and it did plump and hydrate my face, maybe a little too much because i started to notice my face did tend to feel a bit greasy by the end of the day. The following weeks my skin started to go south. I started to get pimples every so often then I started getting those deep under the skin pimples, I was noticing the pores on my nose and chin and my skin just started to look rough. I finally stopped using this product and all those issues started to disappear. So the product does deliver in terms of plumping and hydrating but I think the extra ingredients were clogging my pores so my skin was just fighting with this product. I think if you dry skin this likely won’t be an issues, but if you have sensitive combo/oily skin beware. Plumps and hydrates but breakout city
