Beautiful product, the formula is amazing and I really wish that the packaging didn’t suck. I carry this in my makeup bag and it’s just all scratched which ideally shouldn’t happen especially with tatcha & it isn’t the biggest deal but the small pieces of the packaging so get on ur fingers and on your face. Tatcha please change the packaging. Formula is good, packaging is horrible
