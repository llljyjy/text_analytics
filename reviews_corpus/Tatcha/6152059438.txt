I’m 45 years old... so this is thru the lens of a middle-aged woman. If you want a LOT of hydration, I’d go for both this and also the dewy skin mist they sell. This is probably one of the most hydrating things I’ve used on my face, but it’s not hugely irritating and fairly creamy (not heavy) for the amount of hydration it gives you. I have very sensitive skin and this brand doesn’t bother my skin. The two products that seem to be the winners for my skin are this and Sulwhasoo’s anti-aging First Care Serum. I use the Tatcha oil Cleanser to take off my makeup, the Sulwhasoo serum after, and then this as my moisturizer. The first picture is 6 hours after I put on my makeup with this moisturizer underneath and I used the Dewy Mist just for fun- I am not sure I even needed to use the Mist. The second picture is with my makeup off and after going thru my cleansing routine. If you think these are good results and you’re around my age, I’d try this. P.S. If you double cleanse and have sensitive skin like I do, be mindful. The oil cleanser is great, but I have noticed that double cleansing can be highly irritating- just my opinion with my own skin sensitivity and likely the age of my skin. If I just use the routine I listed above? Perfect. Very hydrating on middle-aged skin.
