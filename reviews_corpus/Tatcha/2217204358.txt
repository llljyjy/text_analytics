I don’t really get how it works or what it actually does, but what I do know is that now I can’t seem to go a day without using it! Especially on my no makeup days I just roll it on over anyplace i have wrinkles + undereye dryness and it just makes my skin feel better. It’s also really good for wherever you have makeup that creases, it prevents that. I dunno, I wasn’t sold at first but I’ve learned to depend on this little stick! nan
