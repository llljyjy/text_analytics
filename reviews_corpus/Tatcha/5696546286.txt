This is a good physical sunscreen.  Shake it up good and carefully dispense on your fingertips, then press into skin.  It is watery, but that helps it to absorb much more quickly.  It doesn’t leave a white cast on the skin.  I have combo skin so this actually acts as a moisturizer in places on my face where I normally don’t put any moisturizer.  I have used this everyday for a week with no adverse effect on my skin.  The sleek shape of the container makes it easy to carry around in case you need a touchup. Good Product, Beautiful Packaging
