Girls with nails, listen. This mask comes with a golden spatula so we can feel luxe while applying and not get it under our sexy fingernails. Beyond that, in my decade or so of caring about my skin, this is the best clay mask I’ve used.Anyway, it’s thick like a clay mask, but somehow lightweight. I don’t know how to describe it other than saying my skin doesn’t feel suffocated with this mask on. A lot of other masks have felt very heavy and suffocating. This is such a smooth, creamy product and smells great. Definitely would buy again. Best clay mask I’ve used
