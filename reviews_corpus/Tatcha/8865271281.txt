I actually love this moisturizer, BUT I was extremely disappointed to find that 1/3 of the container was AIR. It feels great, and my skin loves it, but for the price, not filling the product completely feels very scammy. I can literally see the bottom of the container and it’s untouched by product, so this isn’t a case of the product settling strangely during transit. It’s a pretty sizable air pocket. I’m looking for a new moisturizer b/c it’s a no for me. I don’t care how much I like it, if I’m not getting the amount I paid for. Very Expensive Air Bubble
