Great for anything but dry.  I gave this was along with the rice moisturize a good 30 days.  It was great for the first 2 weeks then started to dry my face out.  Immediately after the shower I would pat dry and I could already see the dryness in my face start flaking.  Felt like it was making my dryness worse.  I use soft water in my house if that helps.  Gave 4 stars for its ability to remove makeup well.  Better face washes out there for this price in my opinion. Great for anything but dry
