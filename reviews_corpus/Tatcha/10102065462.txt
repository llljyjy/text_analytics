I LOVE this moisturizer for daytime.  I have aged skin (40â€™s here) and we have to take different routes as our skin ages.  This moisturizer is the base of my day.  I apply it after cleansing as my first layer prior to applying any sort of foundation.  I did remove one star simply because, if I do not completely avoid my entire eyebrow area, the moisturizer builds up,dries out and will flake.  It feels smooth and creamy and the packaging is just adorable. nan
