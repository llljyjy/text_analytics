I’m pretty picky on my face cleansers because I usually want them to DO IT ALL! I want it to remove my makeup, deep clean but not dry out my face, I want some kind of exfoliation that is gentle enough to use daily, plus I want it to hydrate and give me some skin benefits. This face wash delivers and then some. Granted, I don’t wear heavy makeup so it always takes off my bb creams and light mascara no problem. This creamy face wash starts off like a light exfoliant but then turns buttery smooth. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry or tight afterwards, and doesn’t leave any kind of film. This stuff is amazing. Took me a while to find it and I haven’t looked back since. Now that it’s in a bigger size bottle I’m so ecstatic, and worth the price to me. Try it out, you won't be disappointed!
