It’s a good product I got it as my birthday gift and at first it was helping my skin. It left it glowing and it was very hydrating but then I started getting redness and irritation on my skin and around my nose due to the fragrance but that’s just how my skin reacted to it. It’s still a good moisturizer. If your face doesn’t have a bad reaction to fragrance then I say you should get this product it’s still very good it just wasn’t right for me. nan
