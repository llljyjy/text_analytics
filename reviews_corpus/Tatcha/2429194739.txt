I was on the fence about this product vs the other tatcha gloss with gold flecks. While that one is thinner, this is definitely more cushiony and best for overnight use. I used to use the gold one morning under makeup and in evening with lasting power. Sometimes I feel this one dries out a little quicker if it rubs off. Otherwise just using before bed, it does what it promised. nan
