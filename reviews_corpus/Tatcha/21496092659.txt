I initially received the birthday sample of this and loved it so much I bought the large version as it made my skin look super dewy and plump. I have dry combo skin and after approx 2 weeks I started getting small breakouts on both my cheeks. Once I stopped using the cream, the breakouts stopped. Wonâ€™t be repurchasing Very hydrating but caused breakouts
