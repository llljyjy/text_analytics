I purchased this when it was first released and loved the formula but hated the packaging. I wrote to Tatcha earlier this summer expressing as much and they said they were aware of the packaging issues and would send me a free replacement in the new and improved packaging when it launched in the fall.I received the replacement about 3 weeks ago and now I can finally say I love everything about this sunscreen. The formula is light, hydrating, and vanishes into my skin once itâ€™s rubbed in. And the new packaging is great too! The dispensing spout feels more controlled than in the previous version, and most importantly the packaging no longer flakes and peels with even light handling.Tatcha did a great job with this formulation and with acknowledging and offering support for the packaging issues with the initial launch. Great job Tatcha! New packaging is great, Tatcha support is too!
