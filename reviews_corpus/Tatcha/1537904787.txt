I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review.My skin is kind of sensitive and love that texture tonic is so gentle yet shows amazing results!I used it for 3 weeks before writing this review to allow my skin time to take in the product but I literally saw results in like 2 days. This product isn’t like any other exfoliator I’ve used. Its very light on the skin and doesn’t dry the skin out. My skin is visibly firmer and pores are small. Definitely recommend this product! Results for days!
