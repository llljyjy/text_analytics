This is a lovely lovely lovely skin treat.  It is a little pricey but worth it.  It is luxurious and gentle.  It is very softening, calming and clean product. I do see the difference when I apply/don’t apply.  For the summer I have been storing it in the fridge and it feels so nice .. for the winter I’ll let it be room temp.  Best texture ever. Gorgeous
