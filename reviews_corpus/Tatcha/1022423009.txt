I might be in the minority here, but I didn’t like this product at all!! I love Tatcha products, and I don’t mind spending money on skincare that works. I’m also someone who takes sun care very seriously, so I’ve been using Japanese and Korean sunscreens literally my whole life. Unfortunately, this whole product was terrible for me and I returned it. The bottle is terrible designed. It’s very wide and thin, so when I shake the product it oozes out the top when I unscrew the lid. The pigment is meant to even out skin tone, but I didn’t notice that much difference and I’ve got fair skin. The application is thick and blends well, but it doesn’t necessarily feel like it absorbs. It just felt thick and just sitting on top of my skin. I gave it a fair try, but every time I’d apply it I couldn’t wait to take it off at the end of the day. I don’t recommend. nan
