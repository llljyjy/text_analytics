Think it’s way too oily for me (I have combination skin but tend to use heavier moisturizers such Dr. Jart etc). I really wanted to like it especially when I spent so much money but it’s just not that great. It sits on top of my skin and makes everything feel greasy and I just don’t appreciate how strong the smell is. Like it’s almost perfumed. If anything I love the packaging and everything but it just didn’t do it for me. Greasy
