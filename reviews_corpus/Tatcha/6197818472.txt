This 2 in 1 makeup remover doesn’t remove mascara or eyeliner. I don’t use waterproof eye makeup and I still have to use my Clarins eye makeup remover. If you barely wear makeup and want a soft oil to remove it then this is the product. It’s a complete waste for me since I always wear mascara. I’ve even tried using this twice followed by my YTP cleanser and I still have raccoon eyes Not for removing eye makeup
