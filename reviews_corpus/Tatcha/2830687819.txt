I love how lightweight this mineral sunscreen is. I do wish it were just a teensy but more hydrating on my dry middle aged face. I’ll probably appreciate it more in the more humid summer months (I live in a fairly dry climate). I HATE the packaging, as others have stated. I’m about to put some clear packaging tape all over the bottle so as to stop it from flaking off anymore. Please Tatcha, do better with the packaging. Once they switch it I’d amend my review to 4 stars. Lightweight layerable formula but Garbage packing
