I wanted to love this water cream so badly because everyone that i know that has used this loves it. however that wasn’t the case for me. i have a love hate relationship. i love how lightweight but nourishing this feels. but i hate how it breaks me out. i’ve been using this for 5 days now (morning and night) and noticed that by the end of the day and when i wake up i’ll find a new pimple. the pimples aren’t large pustules, but they are small under the surface bumps and white heads. i kept blaming it on other things in my skincare, however everything else in my skincare was the same and i had to face the reality that the water cream had broken me out.
