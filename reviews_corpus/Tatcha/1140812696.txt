Okay I avoided this brand for a while because it felt like another heavily marketed trend but I finally tried this and WOW. Love it. Cleansers seem to have more affect on my skin than other skincare products and this one cleanses well without making my skin super tight and dry. I usually use Mad Hippie’s cleanser because it also cleanses well without over drying and keeps my combination skin in check, but this one is a little better at removing makeup. When I feel like splurging I’ll get this. Lives up to the hype
