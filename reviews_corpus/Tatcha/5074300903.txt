I thought this would be a great product based on reviews and brand. I have dry skin and when I use this I don’t feel it really does anything to provide “instant hydration”. Just feels like I’m adding water to my face… I’ve been using for about a week and haven’t noticed any changes from that either. I will finish the bottle and hopefully I notice a better result but I find myself feeling like I have to use it because of the price instead of wanting to. Surprisingly disappointed
