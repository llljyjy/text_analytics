Very very slight lemongrass-y scent. Has a very slight grittiness to it which I was pleasantly surprised and is a thick-ish creamy consistency. Washed off my makeup no problem yet still gentle enough that there was no tight, dry feeling. I didn’t need to use as much moisturizer today as per usual. I can’t justify paying this price for a cleanser unless it’s amazing… and it pretty much is. Gentle & Effective Rice cleanser
