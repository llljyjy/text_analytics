Love this eye cream. It really is sooo silky and it’s non irritating to me which I love !! I’ve been using eye creams for a couple years now and I feel like this one has made a more noticeable difference in keeping my eyes smooth and bright. Highly recommend!! Used to use the biossance squalane one which was also nice, but not AS great (sometimes bothered my eyes and results not as noticeable). for the extra 10$ or whatever the difference is, I’d say the tatcha is worth the extra spend nan
