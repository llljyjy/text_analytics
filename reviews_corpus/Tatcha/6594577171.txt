I really wanted to like this moisturizer, especially given the price point, but was disappointed. I am swapping all beauty and wellness products to cruelty free alternatives and have been looking for a good substitute for my Cera Ve moisturizer, which is excellent for year-round use. I am in my 30s so I am focused on anti-aging and repair and am seeking a cost-effective cruelty free moisturizer than sinks in well, maintains moisture for long periods of time, and doesn’t cause breakouts. I LOVED the glowy finish on this moisturizer but noticed after a couple of days that my skin was getting really dry while using this product. I tried coupling this moisturizer with a heavier serum/face oil, but no luck. After a week of use, I had a couple of flaky, dry spots on my face and had to relinquish this to neck and hand moisturizer. If you have less dry skin, I could see this as being a great option. Cruelty free status is a bonus but the combination of cost, plastic packaging, and no “sticking power” to this moisturizer means that it won’t join my permanent line up. Love the Glow But Doesn’t Stick Around
