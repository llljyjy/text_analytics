Although Tatcha’s wasn’t the very first enzyme powder I tried, it was the one that blew my mind and finally convinced me to stray away from more vigorous physical exfoliants. Back then, I had incredibly inflamed, acne-prone skin with cystic breakouts - and would use too many acids/scrubs in an attempt to clean & detox. The truth is, slow & steady wins the race. Using an enzyme powder ensured that I didn’t further inflame my skin, while also gently sloughing off the skin that could get stuck in my pores and create new breakouts. Lastly, being able to consistently exfoliate without causing more acne was helpful in brightening up dark spots from previous breakouts! Also to note - I reached out to Victoria Tsai (Tatcha’s founder) personally after having tried this product because it made such an impression on me. It will always have a place in my heart for the way it made me rethink caring for my skin! Redefining (healthy) exfoliation
