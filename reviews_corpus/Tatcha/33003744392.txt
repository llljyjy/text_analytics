I received this product from the birthday gift set. I chose the product because of all the hype and good reviews. I have combination skin (super oily nose and normal skin everywhere else) and this product resulted in me having EXTREMELY dry and flaky skin. I didn’t add any other new product to my routine except this but about two days after using this, I started to see some flakiness and eventually dryness. This really confuses me because everyone else said that it’s either too oily or perfect so I might’ve gotten a bad batch or something. Overall I had a terrible experience with this product. Bad Just Bad…
