I bought this during the sale because $$$. I will buy it again at full price when it runs out. It’s beautiful. I have fair skin with a lot of freckles, often looking splotchy. This sunscreen spreads easily (it is very fluid) and somehow seems to even out my skin without really adding any coverage. I don’t understand how that’s possible. It dries down to a beautiful glow, not greasy-looking at all. I don’t use this every day, but it is my go-to if I have 5 minutes to get ready and don’t have time for any foundation. Even hours later, my skin looks naturally gorgeous. I hate how much I love this stuff
