I’ve been looking for a face sunscreen that doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy. This one does not! The texture of this is lightweight and the skin absorbs quickly not leaving a white cast on my skin. It also leaves my skin smooth and it’s great as a primer under makeup as well. It feels more like a moisturizer than a sunscreen. I will definitely be repurchasing this! nan
