Tatcha clarifying clay mask exfoliating pore treatment is a creamy grainy texture and itâ€™s lightly scented. The clay mask is a sea green color before application and turns light brick red upon warmth from the finger tips/ face. The product gives a gently exfoliation when massaging the product onto the skin. It does not strip away my natural oils, my skin feels hydrated and glowy. Gifted by Tatcha. nan
