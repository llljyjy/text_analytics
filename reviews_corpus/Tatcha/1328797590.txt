This sunscreen is fantastic.  I’ve tried the other Tatcha sunscreen and loved the way it made my skin feel, but I just needed a bit more protection (my skin is a lot more sensitive since being indoors so much from the pandemic).  It’s a nice, smooth powdery finish, and unlike the sister product it does offer a bit of color for my skin so I can go out with just this and no makeup.  It does have a strange clay smell, but it’s not overwhelming.  The bottle design leaves a bit to be desired, especially when their other product comes in such a handy tube.  When you shake this, as instructed, it can bubble out of the applicator tip so definitely be aware of product spilling over. nan
