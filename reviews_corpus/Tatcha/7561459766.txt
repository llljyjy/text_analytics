Do not recommend for acne prone skin. Just feels like a very thick face wash that is similar to neutrogena or some cheap over the counter Walmart face wash. If you’re paying this much money for a face wash it better have the key ingredients and this product just has 0 benefits & no key ingredients to help cleanse skin and reduce acne or other breakouts. Over priced Don’t Recommend
