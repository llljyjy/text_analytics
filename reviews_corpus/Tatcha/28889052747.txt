Best cream to use when living in Waterloo. Recently, I made the transition from Vancouver to Waterloo. Genuinely did not realize how DRY my skin could get in this cold weather. This cream saved my skin from drying and breaking out. It also doesnâ€™t feel as greasy and sticky as other hydrating creams are. Moisturizing without being too much.
