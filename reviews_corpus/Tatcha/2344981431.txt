I received sample for this and the accompanying rice wash and used it for about 2 weeks.  Results were great so I bought full sizes. Then after about a few weeks, I started getting itchy tiny bumps on my hairline and jawline. I didn’t really think it was the Tatcha products coz I’ve been using it for a month at this point but after a week with no relief from the dry, itchy and bumpy face I went to see. dermatologist and was given hydrocortisone cream and stopped using Tatcha. Once it has cleared, I would use the Tatcha products on and off to test if it really is what was causing the reaction. Lo and behold! Every time I use it, I would get a skin breakout! I think it’s great product (coz it was good when I first tried it) but not for me, sadly. nan
