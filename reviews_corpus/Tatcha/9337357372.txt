I’ve been using Tatcha for years. This is by far THE best moisturizer. It melts in the face and it’s really incredible, it’s hard to describe. It’s thick but doesn’t leave the face feeling weighed down or having a layer of stuff on the face. Price point is high, but worth it! If not this one, Dewy or Water cream are great as well. AMAZING
