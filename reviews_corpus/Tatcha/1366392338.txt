This sunscreen is a lovely way to add a natural glow under any makeup while providing sun protection. However, the packaging very quickly begins to peel. The iridescent purple flakes stick everywhere and are hard to separate after application or remove beforehand. I would still recommend it because of the wonderful formulation but I dearly hope Tatcha redesigns the packaging. LOVE the product, HATE the packaging
