Love the product, hate the packaging. I won’t be repurchasing because of the packaging until they change it which is a shame because its made a big improvement in my skin. My esthetician and husband have commented on how hydrated & soft my skin is. The only thing I changed that I could think of was this sunscreen. The tint is barely noticeable and it layers great on my skincare. I did have some piling to begin with, but when I switched vitamin c serums it stopped occurring. The only con besides the price (luxury brand) is the packaging. For awhile my purple bottle didn’t start falling off, but it since has. I reapplied after funeral services and that’s when I noticed I had a giant lilac metallic flake on my face.  Also since transporting it, the nozzle must trap air bubbles because sometimes it starts leaking out the top when I reopen it. It’s just super messy and I feel like I’m wasting so much of this expensive product. Please Tatcha, change your packaging because I love this sunscreen. nan
