I like this exfoliating toner a lot, as it definitely works, yet is still gentle enough that it would be an ideal starting point for anyone looking to try out/begin using chemical exfoliants in their skincare routine, or for when you want to help prevent congestion. Despite applying this immediately after cleansing (which is when you should apply a liquid exfoliant and/or toner), I did find that it took a while to sink in fully, which I suspect is due to the various plant oils included in the ingredients - it’s not necessarily a bad thing, since the oils can help offset dryness caused by the acids, but conversely, they can also be irritants on some skin (particularly those sensitive to essential oils). It’s not a deal breaker, especially since it didn’t cause any subsequent absorption issues with any of the products I applied afterwards, but still worth noting. If you like to use multiple products afterwards, definitely give them time to sink in to avoid pilling. I think this will be more useful in warmer weather at reducing oil, and it does help a bit in evening out skin. Definitely depends on your skin type and the climate. On the whole, it’s a product I enjoy, but not a game changer. Gifted by Tatcha. nan
