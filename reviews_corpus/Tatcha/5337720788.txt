I love this cleanser so much. It doesnâ€™t leave my face tight, it feels so clean and smooth and definitely makes my face seem very toned evenly with visible pore minimization but of course the minimization of the pores can be reversed depending on how you apply products afterwards. I have 2 routines, one to keep acne under control, and this one to assist with hyperpigmentation from post-acne marks and minimizing pores to hopefully minimize future break outs. nan
