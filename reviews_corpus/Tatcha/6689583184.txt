“I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review“I was looking for a toner to help keep my skin balanced and have some added benefits and this did just that! I love the formula, the smell isn’t overbearing and this product is straight to the point and does exactly what it’s suppose to do. My skin is pretty normal and I do experience many breakouts so the added AHA very bumped up my skincare game. Great Add To My Everyday Skin Routine.
