I can not get over how amazing this moisturizer is!  I always told myself there was no way I’d ever spend this kind of money on a moisturizer, but…. After trying the birthday sample.. I get it!  This moisturizer leaves your skin so soft and supple and plum and very dewy.  My makeup goes on so nice too.  I quickly decided to buy the biggest jar I could.  100% recommend. It is worth it.
