I love this cleanser, it makes me WANT to wash my face! I love the thick texture and how soft my skin is immediantly after use, and I like the slight smell. But if you dont add enough water, you can end up over exfoliating, so be careful.I have dry skin and this sometimes leaves my skin feeling tight and somewhat dry, but iâ€™d still repurchase because Its the only cleanser ive tried that I look forward to using.
