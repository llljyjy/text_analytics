I’ve purchased all of the Tatcha Kissu lip masks over the years and kept with that tradition when I picked up this newest Plum Blossom shade. The original Kissu lip mask has more of a jelly-like consistency. Tatcha has since released two tinted versions, both limited edition - Red Camilla which launched October, 2021 and most recently, Plum Blossom. This is my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador based on my experience with this newest lip mask to the Tatcha Kissu collection.Plum Blossom is a pinky-plum shade that leaves a hint of color and sheen to my naturally pigmented lips. I can get more color if I add another layer. It has a balmy-gel consistency that allows it to glide smoothly onto the lips. There’s a slight tack to the product but it’s subtle. My lips feel moisturized even after the color disappears. The presentation on this lip mask, from the design of the jar to the packaging is signature Tatcha - aesthetically elegant with the gorgeous illustration on the top of the jar and it includes a mini spatula for picking up the product and spreading it over the lips. This lip mask doesn’t just look lovely on my lips, it’s beautiful sitting atop my vanity table. It makes a wonderful gift too! Plum Blossom = pinky-plum tinted gel balm, fabulou
