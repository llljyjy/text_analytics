This is so moisturizing! I love how this feels on my skin and I see such a good difference, especially in the winter. Depending on your skin type, this is a great moisturizer for the winter, if you have dry skin you could use it in the summer as well. If you don’t have dry skin I wouldn’t use it in the summer, it may make you oily and ’over moisturized’. LOVE IT!
