If you struggle with very dry skin this is the product for you! I would recommend using less than you think as a little of this product goes a long way! I also want to say that I am fortunate to not struggle with acne so havenâ€™t had the problem some people mentioned. I have however struggled with insanely dry and dull skin my whole life and this has been the BEST product to meet my needs. Dry skin gone!
