I might be crazy, but on my first day trying this out, I got a sunburn on my face. I was out on a soccer field on a sunny day for about an hour. My cheeks and chin were red when I got home. Faded after a couple of days. I’m going to give this another try because I like the feel of it and the color actually works for me. I’m sharing an awful photo of myself when I got home and assessed. I’ll update this review after another try when my skin is ready. Does it actually protect from the sun?
