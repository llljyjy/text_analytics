I have been using this wash for the last 2 months and haven’t really seen a lot of changes, except for my blemishes are diminishing, that’s why I gave it a 2 star. However, I have noticed that pores seemed to be clogging more because I am getting more whiteheads on my nose and chin area. I figured this shouldn’t be happening with expensive wash, so I don’t think this is for combination oily skin and it’s too creamy for my skin type. nan
