I bought this to use as the first step in double cleansing. I am super disappointed in the “makeup remover” function of this cleanser. I wear super light eye makeup and it does a terrible job of getting off my eye makeup. It’s a nice oil cleanser in general, but not worth it if you are looking for a makeup remover. Not a Worthwhile Makeup Remover
