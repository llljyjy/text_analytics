I’m so happy I decided to give tatcha a try, my face and skin has never felt better. This moisturizer is perfect for me, since I have oily skin, this water based product doesn’t add to my oiliness yet hydrates my skin. It’s silky and a little goes a long way. So I’m not using tons of product to cover my face making this product worth its price point. I also use the tatcha cleanser and eye cream in combination with this moisturizer and oh I love. BEST. MONEY. I’VE. EVER. SPENT.
