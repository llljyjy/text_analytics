Wow! This has to be the best moisturizer on the market. I know not all skin is the same but for my slightly dry skin, this is magic in a bottle. I have mature skin (40 years old) and I see a visible difference is plumpness and dewiness which give me a more youthful look. It has a nice scent too, a light lavender mint but not too strong, I guess would be my best description. Unless you have super oily skin, you are going to love this! Itâ€™s a little pricey but worth every Penny. About to purchase my 2nd 2.5 oz jar. Makes skin plump and dewy!
