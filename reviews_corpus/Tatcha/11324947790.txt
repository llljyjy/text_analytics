After trying the solid liquid silk canvas I was eager to try this one. It immediately reduces the look of pores, and is great under Charlotte Tilbury flawless filter to give a subtle glow from within sort of natural look. Ive never had it pill  with any of my products (moisturizers, sunscreen, cc cream etc). Highly recommend, and I think its worth the price tag, Pricey but worth it
