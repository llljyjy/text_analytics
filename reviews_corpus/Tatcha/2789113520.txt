I absolutely HATE how much I LOVE this friggin mist.  Spending half of what I spend on a weeks worth of groceries, on a *mist* is highly questionable. Mostly I wish I didn’t judge myself for buying this mist time after time. One spray brings my dry skin back to life! Makes your skin GLOW, your makeup less cakey and just feels good. Mario Badescu Rose Water who?? (It’s low key insulting to compare the two tbh so forgive me!!) unfortunately worth the hype (I’m not rich)
