A refreshing tingle was my first impression of this tonic! I have had oily skin my entire life & this was such a lovely addition to my skincare routine. After a full week of use I could feel the difference this was making on my skin. It felt smoother than before! I also noticed that my skin wasn’t getting as oily. I love this! I’ve been using this for nearly a month now & have experienced no irritation or skin sensitivities. My skin is glowing & looks so much healthier! Oily girl’s BFF
