I’ve been using this cleanser for the past 5 months (I bought the value size, and it lasts a long time) and I’ve noticed a considerable difference in my skin - I have oily skin, visible pores and dark spots. After 2 months, my family noticed that my pores looked smaller and my face got less oily throughout the day. I didn’t get any breakouts/bad reactions from this cleanser, and a definite pro is that it made my dark spots brighter, they’re less noticeable now! I would recommend it if you’re looking for a cleanser that provides a deep clean for your pores and is gentle enough not to strip away too much moisture for my oily skin girls.
