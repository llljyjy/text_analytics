Despite the title, this sunscreen is my new favorite, a pretty solid “Holy Grail” skincare product for me!The positives: has such a light, smooth texture, melts into my skin like no other product, allowing ease of reapplication throughout the day as well as general enjoyment of putting it on every day (im just one of those people that wont apply it daily unless I enjoy the experience) Additionally, i love that its a mineral filtered sunscreen (ive got eye sensitivities that prevent me from using chemical filtered spf on my face) as well as the luxurious ingredients and overall formula that agrees with my acne prone skin. I didnt experience any white cast, as it does have a very faint tint but I do have pale skin, so take that into consideration. Despite being white, I do still notice a huge difference between formulas that give a white cast versus those that dont, however I only have my and my friend (who has a much deeper skin tone than me) as real-world anecdotal evidence on the white cast of this product, so obviously thats not a huge sample size.The negatives: the PACKAGING for the cost is pretty abysmal… not only can you not look at this product without the lavender paint peeling off, but you just cant expect consumers to be that careful with a product they (should be) carrying around in their purses to reapply throughout the day! Especially because this is a $60 product from a HUGE name brand company that could very easily have paid more to develop better packaging. The overall bottle isnt bad, i love how thin it is and the dropper/applicator makes it a breeze to carry around and apply, but the paint flaking makes it look cheap. It may be a small gripe to some, but it really bothers me. I ended up taking a scrub brush to it and purposely removing the entire exterior paint on the bottle so that it didnt look so gross and bad. I shouldnt have to do that for a $60 product, Tatcha…. (almost) the perfect sunscreen
