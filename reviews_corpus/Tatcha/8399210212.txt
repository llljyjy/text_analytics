I really love this sunscreen and the tint that it has. It goes on very hydrating but dries down which is important for me because I wear a lot of powder foundation and some sunscreens leave a tacky base so the powder foundation clings and looks patchy when applied. Gave it 4 stars because it expensive but I would repurchase! DRY SKIN APPROVED!
