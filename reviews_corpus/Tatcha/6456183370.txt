I wanted to love this, but as soon as it touched my skin burning sensation and redness. I only gave it a week because my skin was breaking out, it has been 2 weeks that I have stopped using it and when back to glow skin care and my skin has no more pimples. I’m sure it’s a good product just not for my skin. nan
