I bought this originally for my boyfriend after trying a sample. After using it a few times he said he did like it at first because he has really dry skin and even gets red especially after shaving, and it seemed to do well as far as moisturize, but it gives off more of a greasy look than a dewy look. I had same problem when I gave it a try because I did not want to waste that money. Thats where my second complaint comes in. $22 for not even half an oz is ridiculously overpriced. It would be better not to even get involved with this skincare line because you have to pay out the rear to keep up with your skincare routine. Definatly not worth the price or the hype. Too pricey
