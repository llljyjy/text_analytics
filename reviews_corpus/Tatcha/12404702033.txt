I received a sample size of the rice wash and after only a few uses I think I might have to buy a whole bottle. After adding a little water, it suds up over the skin very nicely and feels so soft! I wasn’t expecting it to be so gentle. I’m rationing the remaining product for now, but can see myself using it daily with no issue. nan
