I absolutely loved the Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream so I decided to splurge and also try this Indigo Night Cream. the Indigo Cream is nice also, quite a bit thicker than the Dewy Cream, but still nice. It feels like it has an oil base (much like coconut oil feels on the face) but thicker and it needs to be gently massaged onto the face and it loosens up more smoothly as it is worked into the skin to leave a very silky smooth finish. I do like this cream, but I think I like the Dewy Skin Cream more for the price. Another wonderful cream from Tatcha
