My experience with this cleanser was awful. When first putting the product on my face, the texture felt extremely grainy (almost like a scrub) then turned to foam. The fragrance was extreme and nauseating. After washing it off, my face felt extremely dry and tight. So disappointed!! Left my face feeling dry
