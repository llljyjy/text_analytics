I bought this mask because of all the amazing reviews despite it being extremely pricey! I’m sure it does work for a lot of people but it has caused me to have the worst skin of my life ! I’m always skeptical of people saying products cause breakouts because it could just be a coincidence that a breakout happens around the time of starting a new product. When I used this the first time within the next day every inch of my face was covered in tiny blemishes. I really wanted it to not be the mask so I waited a few weeks and tried again -the same thing happened ! I still wanted to give it a try to I used it the other day and my skin has never looked worse. I made sure to moisturize after and didn’t leave it on too long ! Just be careful if you have acne prone or sensitive skin and don’t use it right before a big event! extreme breakouts- sensitive / acne prone skin
