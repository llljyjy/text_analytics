As with several of these reviews, I love the product but hate the packaging. I have to peel purple flecks from my face every time I use this product. Not only is the bottle falling apart, but the bottle design just doesn’t work for me. It’s a flat rectangle.Honestly, Tatcha, give me a simple tube of this product and I will repurchase. Until then, I am wasting so much time and product. Tempted to return my purchase. Don’t buy pre-bottle redesign
