This product left my skin feeling wet and oily. It made me break out big time. I did not like it one bit. I want a moisturizer to absorb in and leave me dry after putting it on. This product did not do it. Do not recommend for combo skin, it was meant for someone with super dry skin. It was the bday gift they sent me. It smelled good but that was all. nan
