(Kylie’s 42y/o mom writing this) THIS is one of the most amazing eye creams I’ve ever used! I have dark circles, hooded eyes (from age), and fine lines forming under the eye and in the corners.  Aging is my deepest fear... and this completely smoothed my lines and reduced the dark circles to almost nothing.  I am completely in love with this product and can’t wait to see what their moisturizer can do to help me with the rest of my face and neck.  Getting older has been the most difficult thing to me and not being a position to afford surgical help has had me desperately trying so many different brands within Sephora (and even recently their competition).  This is the first eye cream (with its subtle peony scent) that not only applies flawlessly- with the smallest amount needed, that actually reduces the look of my lines & circles, feels like I’m applying a satin layer of $500 cream around my eyes, and stays put under my (all Sephora purchased) (Peter Thomas Roth) primer, (Tarte shape tape) concealer, (Fenty Pro Filt’r Matte)  foundation, and (Laura Mercier Translucent) powder.  Don’t get me wrong... I love my age.  I hate the physical aging that goes along with it.  This is my new go-to for eye cream. 100%.  Never going back.  Now I need to work my way through the Tatcha collection one product at a time...(I am NOT a bot nor was I paid to do this, i just want others to know how awesome it is!) Game Changer for a Mom over 40
