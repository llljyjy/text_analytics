I got the mini size on my birthday, and I’ve been using this almost every day and night as an eye cream. I know this is supposed to moisturize the face, but since I had very little, I tried to make the most of it. In the first 7 months, it did all the great things an eye cream was supposed to do: hydrating, lightweight, brightening, plump, and supple. So if you’re looking for an eye cream that’s not over $50, this could be it. The expiration date is 6 months, so I stopped using it on my face during the 8th month because it started to feel greasy and thick like the other reviews had said. Now, I just use what’s left of it on my hands as a second layer for the winter cold. I would give it a 4-star rating if it was used as an eye cream because it’s cost-effective and it works, but as a moisturizer, probably not. Eye cream?
