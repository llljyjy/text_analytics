The texture of this is a perfect fit for my dry skin. Love how hydrating it feels and how effortlessly it applies- spreads easily without tugging or caking. It leaves my skin feeling nourished, soft, and protected. Layers well. Gives a nice lit from within glow. Mineral sunscreens can sometimes feel chalky but this really is weightless and almost feels like a watery moisturizer. I didn’t experience any whitecast (my skin tone is fair). One of the best zinc oxide sunscreens I’ve tried! I received this complimentary from Tatcha. Adore the texture and finish!
