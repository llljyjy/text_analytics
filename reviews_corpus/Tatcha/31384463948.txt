I started to try this product during vacation. I have dry skin, but i tend to have blackheads on my nose since i’m a teenager. Within a few days of use (morning and night), I really saw a big difference ; I had less blackheards and my pores became smaller! I told myself that it could also be because I was nearby the sea and in a less polluted area. I’m back in the city since a week and so far the product is still doing its magic! I hope it will continue to help! I combine this with Glow receipe Toner. So far it’s magic !!
