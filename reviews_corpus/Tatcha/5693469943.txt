Before I bought this sunscreen I got a sample, and I really enjoyed it! This is a smooth and runny formula that’s easy to apply and provides a dewy finish. I decided to splurge and purchase it. Sadly, I should have read the reviews *before* purchasing it. Everyone is spot on with the product gushing out and the label coming off. I thought that the product coming out might have been user error, but I was stunned when I opened the bottle for the very first time and the sunscreen literally spewed all over the place. Given that this is a $60 sunscreen, I was astonished to see how much product was wasted! And, like other reviewers said, the label started chipping off after just one use! This packaging truly is problematic, and I’ll be returning this sunscreen. The packaging is a deal breaker :-(
