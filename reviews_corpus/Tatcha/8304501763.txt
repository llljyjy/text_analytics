I’ve been using this cleanser for months or even a year now and I find it works really well with my skin! I have mainly oily skin and I find it doesn’t dry me out completely or not do enough to get rid of my natural oils, it’s the perfect amount. It’s not scented as well from what I can tell so even my bf with sensitive skin loves using it. He has dry, acne prone skin and steals it all the time! Love it!!
