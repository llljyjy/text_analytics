Okay yeah I love this product. This is the second time I’ve bought this product. The scent is very light but beautiful. It gives you a at home spa experience in the best way possible. The exfoliating beads are mild and won’t scratch your skin, (they could actually put more in there lol) I’ve had a hard time finding a exfoliating wash that doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I MUST add that a little goes a long way!! The price is pretty hefty but you literally only need a pea size amount on your face and it spreads very easily. It will last you a while! YEAAAHHHH BBBBBBB
