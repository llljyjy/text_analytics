Obsessed with the Tatcha rice wash and the essence water but, I cannot recommend this! It gave me terrible deep breakouts on my chin, when I normally have little to none ever (even around my time of the month). I’m extremely bummed because I wanted to love this product, I guess they can’t all be winners. If you have acne prone skin this is not for you. It’s a no from me
