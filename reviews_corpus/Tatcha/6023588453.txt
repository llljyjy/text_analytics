This is something I want to love so bad…but I find it just okay. I didn’t get any wow out of it, my skin felt clean, but your face SHOULD feel clean after washing it; it didn’t feel anything else other than just washed, if that makes sense. I expected a little more “scrub,” but it was gentle, that could be good or bad depending on what you want. The scent I got was floral, and it’s noticeably scented, which doesn’t bother me, but for some it might! It’s a good cleanser so I really don’t have any real complaints, other than it is slightly pricey (CAD $ over here) and I just expected more. If you’re looking for a gentle exfoliating cleanser, than I suppose this would be great, but I think I just envisioned the hype differently. I wouldn’t “not” recommend it, but just my experience :) I Don’t Know…
