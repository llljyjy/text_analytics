This is a really nice, gentle exfoliator if you’re looking for something that isnt rough on the skin. But it does have its downsides. 1) The price, it’s a nice product and you get a sizable amount. But I don’t really think it’s worth $65… 2) It can leave your skin feeling stripped. This has left my skin stripped every single time I have used it. It’s not the end of the world for me since i moisturize after I use it, but definitely uncomfortable. 3) The amount of powder vs the amount of water you use with this does affect how it performs. Not enough water and it becomes almost doughy, too much and it isn’t exfoliating. All in all, I think it’s a nice product but I won’t be repurchasing it. I love that it’s gentle but I just can’t get over the price, so I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone either. Great product, not so great price
