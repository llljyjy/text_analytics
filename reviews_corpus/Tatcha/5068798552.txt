I normally have oily skin, but it was become very dry after using tretinoin. So I tried a small sample of this. Just using a tiny bit made my face super greasy! Like spreading butter or Crisco on your face. It doesn’t soak in. I pressed a kleenex to my face and it hung there! Also it’s very shiny! Pass. Yuk!
