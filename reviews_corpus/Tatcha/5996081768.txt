I can hardly justify the price for this except it’s so fancy that I feel good using it lol. It’s a good lip mask, I alternate between this and the laneige and they both work equally well just different textures. I won’t repurchase because it’s expensive but I sure enjoy using it because it’s so beautiful and the product isn’t bad at all. nan
