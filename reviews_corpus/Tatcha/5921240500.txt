I like using this in the morning in place of moisturizer because I use a hydrating primer that is creamy like a moisturizer already (the coconut smoothie fron FAB). I do find this to be enough in the am, especially with using the Dewy cream at night. I honestly donâ€™t mind pricy products, but I do feel like we need a full 2oz in the bottle to justify the price. I imagine I will repurchase this when I run out, but maybe not right away- I can live without it. It is a good winter product, though. Nice but not a must have
