I usually never write reviews but I often struggle to find reviews for mineral sunscreens from people who have my skin color. I really didn’t know if this would work for me based with it being 100% mineral filters and usually they are very ashy looking on brown skin. I have medium tan skin (I wear a 330 in the matte fenty foundation) and this leaves no white case on my skin. I think it’s important to apply it in light layers and wait a few minutes to let your moisturizer fully absorb into your skin before applying this sunscreen. It feels like it would work great as a makeup primer and it’s super lightweight. I’m very impressed (price point aside). I definitely think it’s worth a shot especially for my brown skinned people! medium/tan skintone friendly!
