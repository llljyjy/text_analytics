I’ve used up the whole bottle b4 I write my opinion here. I enjoy dewy skin n this gives me the that little  glow!♡ the product is really liquid so be careful when u use the sunscreen. it blends in so well on my skin, I did not have a hard time blending it in like some other sunscreen. it does not give me break out. this sunscreen only last me 2 1/2 week because I used it continuously. 60 bucks is alot for this product I wish the price can go lower. the packaging is really cute but the outside layer of the package keeps on peeling. it would get on my face, so I used a paper towel on the outer area while holding it. I believe it gives me sun protection because I have not got any sunburn and no redness.  I have sensitive skin n it does not break me out. I love this sunscreen n will buyit again. I hope they fix the package for it to stop peeling. the only wo sunscreen that I enjoy wearing is this one and supergoop unseen sunscreen. I enjoy using both of these. I prefer to use sunscreen that I enjoy using because it motivates me to remember to put it on..also it gives me a fun experience as well. bad package
