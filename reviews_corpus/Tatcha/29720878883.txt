I received this cleanser for my birthday and at first I didnâ€™t care much for the light scent, it reminded me of a spice of sorts.  I am sensitive to strong smells in products, my eyes will burn and become red, my skin will become irritated but I had no problem with this light scent.  I tried it and fell in love with this amazing product!  My skin is dry to normal, sensitive and will break out if moisturizers or makeup are too heavy. My skin feels so soothed, soft and smooth after using it, as if I had applied a moisturizer already.  I have noticed my fine lines are lighter and I love how young this makes me look.  I have even decided I kind of like the scent now. I bought more for myself and plan to buy some for my mom and sister-in-law for Christmas. Game Changer!
