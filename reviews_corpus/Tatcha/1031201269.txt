For many years I’ve struggled to find a sunscreen that soaks into your skin and looks good under makeup. Something that doesn’t look greasy or too luminous. This Tatcha silk sunscreen is exactly what I’ve been looking for. It’s lightweight and immediately soaks in. It also acts as a primer under makeup. This is perfection. An added bonus is the bottle is very travel friendly. Amazing!!!
