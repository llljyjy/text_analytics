My favorite and holy grail primer for year-round use! It smooths my face with a very light and fragrance free formulation and it is easily spreadable over all my moisturizers.  Definitely prefer this over the original Silk Canvas primer mostly because of the pump applicator and lighter feel..I will buy this over and over again! nan
