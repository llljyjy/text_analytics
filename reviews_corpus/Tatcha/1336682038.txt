Although I do like this, I’m slightly disappointed. It is extremely lightweight so I do combine with a primer like the ordinary high adherence. It does a nice job of blurring but it’s not as blurring as something silicone based. Overall it’s a very nice primer but I would only get it again on sale. I chose the liquid over the solid as I didn’t want to have anything that thick on my skin with my large pores. If you’re a large pored person like myself, choose this over the solid. Deducting the one star for the cost and not as much oomph as some of the other primers I’ve used. nan
