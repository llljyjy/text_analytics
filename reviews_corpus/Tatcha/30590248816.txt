For the price, I expected more. This cleanser is good and feels good on the skin but needs double cleansing when washing makeup off. When you say “deep cleanse“ I expect better performance. I don’t mind double cleansing but for the asking price and the product promise, I shouldn’t have to. It's ok but not great... for me.
