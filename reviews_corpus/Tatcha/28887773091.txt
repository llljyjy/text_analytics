This face wash has been super awesome for my skin! I originally received a sample of this in my birthday gift and I got hooked. I have combo skin, but during the winter my skin gets super dry and flaky. This wash is helps moisturize my skin and doesn’t leave me feeling all dried out afterwords. I know a lot of people have issues with the slightly gritty texture of the face wash, but I actually love it. Its super gentle on my skin and helps exfoliate. You also don’t need to use much of this at a time. I use about a pea sized drop each wash. Great for Dry Skin! Worth the Price
