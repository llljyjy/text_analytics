Yikes. Can’t even use it because of the faulty packaging. I JUST got this delivered and the bottle is already peeling off?? And the product WONT STOP COMING OUT!! It got everywhere! If it was a cheap item I would just put it into another container but for this price it’s not worth the hassle and I shouldn’t be having these problems. Returning… really bummed something this price has problems they should have noticed easily in product development/quality control. Very faulty packaging
