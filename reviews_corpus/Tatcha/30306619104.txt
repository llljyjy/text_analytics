This wash feels extraordinary and you really have to compliment tatcha for the formulation here if nothing else. There is a mild “grit“ to the cleanser when it first comes out of the tube which immediately dissolves as you rub your hands together and spread it over your face. It never creates a harsh lather, but rather cleans your skin almost like an balm or an oil, easily removing dirt and oil from your pores. It feels very rich never leaves you dry. I think this would probably work for all skin types with exception to extremely oily skin. If you’ve got very oily skin or clogged pores, I recommend the Hyper Skin Gentle Brightening Gel, which is my favorite cleanser at the moment for reducing the look of pores. This Tatcha rice wash comes in second place, as it’s super calming and I always reach for this when I want a cleanser to make me feel like I’m at a spa. Be aware that their is some mild fragrance. This really shouldn’t cause any issues even on sensitive skin, BUT as always if you have a damaged skin barrier from going too hard on the chemical exfoliates or treatments (can look like small red patches or general stinging when applying products) then I would put down all fragrance products until your skin heals. Really good; Review from a Tatcha Skeptic
