I am impressed with this mask considering I wasn’t buying the hype and many positive reviews I had seen prior to purchasing. Well, I am so glad to experience positive, almost immediate results after using this. My pores are refined and tightened, my complexion has a subtle luster, and my skin is supple and nourished. It’s not cheap for sure, but we’re talking Tatcha - a line that’s at a higher price point. I’ve used comparable masks like this one from Glow Recipe and Josie Maran, and like each but have to say this one might be my fave. If you have some money to spare and are curious about the product, give it a try as you might be pleasantly surprised by how much you like the mask like I was. My skin is normal overall though on the dry, sensitive side. A little goes a long way. nan
