I have combo dry skin and saw this new product wanted to give it stet since I love their blue sunscreen for summer, and this new product has hyaluronic acid which is good for my dry area. It doesn’t disappoint! No scent or white cast, moisturizing yet light! I already recommended this to friends! And this was not gifted so it’s my honest review! Just give it a try! I know it’s expensive but if you hate regular sunscreen smell like me, you will love this another amazing tatcha product!
