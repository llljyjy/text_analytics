Very gentle on the skin. One of the sales associates at my local Sephora said this is gentle enough to use everyday. I tend to use it maybe 2-3 times a week. I use a pea size amount and it is plenty to lather my face with it. Unsure if I will repurchase in the future or try something new (the price of the product makes me not want to repurchase it). Overall, great if you looking for something gentle on the skin. Leaves your skin feeling smooth. Gentle Exfoliator
