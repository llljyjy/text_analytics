Best moisturizer I’ve ever used (and I’ve tried a lot lol). It is extremely hydrating and preps skin for makeup really well. Also has a clean feel and smell to it which I like. I’ve noticed my skin has improved quite a bit since I started using this. I’m about 6 months into using this product 5-6 times a week and my skin is much more hydrated and clear than before working it into my daily routine. nan
