First time I used this I thought it made me break out but realized it wasn’t due to the moisturizer, but other factors (likely crappy diet at the time and menstrual cycle). I’ve bought it twice since then, and love how moist it keeps my skin. I use it at night after washing my face and in the morning. love how soft my skin feels
