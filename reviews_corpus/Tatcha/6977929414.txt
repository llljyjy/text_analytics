I am an avid Tatcha user but I hadn’t tried their liquid treatment formulas yet. My cheeks have been experiencing flakiness, dullness, irritation, redness and surface acne from the coke weather and mask wearing. I decided to give this exfoliating treatment and try and within three days of using this morning and night my cheeks are already less flaky and my surface acne and redness is almost completely gone! Love this product I think it’s extremely effective yet gentle. It’s a little tingly at first on the skin but not irritating and the smell is different than normal Tatcha smells but I would say it smell is energizing and fresh. Amazing! Helped my redness and surface acne
