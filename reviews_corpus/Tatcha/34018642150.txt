I really like this cleanser! I don’t wear a lot of makeup everyday, but it’s good enough to wash off my sunscreen. It has a nice floral scent and helps unplug pores; it really helped me with my black heads. The downside is that it’s terrible to travel with; half the bottle leaked out when I packed it in my check-in bag. Good product, but not for travel
