Amazing! I have very dry acne prone skin that I have struggled with for the last 6 years, and since I started using this moisturizer and the Tatcha rice wash cream about a month ago, my dry patches are gone and most of my acne has cleared as well and my skin is just getting better. I would not recommend it for people with oily skin, it would be too heavy. But if you have dry patchy skin, get it! nan
