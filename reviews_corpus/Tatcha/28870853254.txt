I absolutely love the formula and how it makes my skin & makeup look. I’ve used this on brides for their big day but my biggest complaint is the packaging needs to be changed a little, particularly the nozzle because it’s to get a even mist. You would be able to save so much product and it would last longer if the nozzle worked correctly. New Packaging Please
