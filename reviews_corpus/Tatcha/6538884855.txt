First off, I absolutely love the sleek and modern the packaging. It’s great to keep at home or to throw in my bag to have on the go! It applies smoothly and doesn’t irritate my skin. It leaves a subtle glow, but doesn’t feel overly greasy like other SPFs. It doesn’t leave any white cast or gross feeling to my skin. This was gifted by Tatcha for my honest review.
