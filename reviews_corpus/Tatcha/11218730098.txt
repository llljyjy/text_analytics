I got this product as a birthday gift from Sephora as usually, Tatcha products were too expensive for me to try in the first place. My Gosh have I been missing out! This wash plus the moisturizing is perfect during the winter time here in Canada. If you are like me and you have that weird combo of oily-dry skin (in the summer you are oily like fried food and in the winter you are dryer than a desert plus dehydrated) this is perfect for that! However, if you know that while your face gets oily (doesn’t matter if naturally or by any product) and becomes acne prone I would agree to stay away. This product is very rich in hydration so it might end up causing more breakouts for you. Given that everyone’s skin is different if you get the opportunity to try it through a B-day gift like me, use it as a trial phase! My skin has never felt more alive, healthy, soft, and supple in my entire life, not even a drugstore product can do this for me! So soft and supple!
