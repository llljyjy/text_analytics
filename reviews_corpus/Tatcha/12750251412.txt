I tested this primer out a few times, with different foundations because I wanted it to work so bad. Each time, my makeup looked average right after application, I didn’t find it to be skin smoothing like it was advertised. But that was okay, I mainly bought this because I struggle a lot with transfer and the reviews said it kept makeup intact. I tried this with both silicone and water-based foundations (like I said I realllly wanted to give it a fair shot), and within a few hours with the mask on my T-zone would turn into an oily mess. I have combo skin and that usually happens every day, hence my search for a good primer. I found it gave lots of mask transfer as well… I used the same setting powder and spray I always use. I know my powder is solid, I have been on the hunt for a better setting spray, but I just expected this to work on its own without needing an extra hand, considering it was so pricey. Not the worst ever primer, but I expected it to do wayyy more. It was kind of just meh. Overpriced
