This is on the pricier side, but it definitely feels so luxurious on my skin. It has a beautiful scent, and hydrates my skin sooo well. I wake up with soft and glowy skin. If your skin is excessively oily, I wouldn’t recommend this. It’s really perfect for the winter months, especially because my skin is extra dry when the weather gets colder. Luxurious
