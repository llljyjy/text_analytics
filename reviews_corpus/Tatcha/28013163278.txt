This is my new favorite clay mask! It’s so good at absorbing impurities and leaving my skin feeling and looking refreshed and clear.  It feels so nice on application; it’s very smooth and feels almost cooling, and is pretty easy to wash off as well. I struggle with acne, but since incorporating this mask twice weekly into my skincare routine, I’ve had less blackheads, and my skin looks all around brighter and healthier. Love it! nan
