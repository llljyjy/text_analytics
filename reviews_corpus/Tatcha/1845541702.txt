I got this in a sample set with the moisturizer. I have combination skin and struggle with cystic acne on my cheeks and acne on chin.I used this for 2 weeks and I immediately felt softer skin after washed and it felt hydrated and clean. I bought the large size and it’s been 2 months. my skin is more smooth and even texture. barely any acne on my chin and my cheeks mostly cleared up. I wear  N95s at work so it’s impossible to avoid maskne. The price is actually reasonable considering I only need a pea size amount for each wash. highly recommend! nan
