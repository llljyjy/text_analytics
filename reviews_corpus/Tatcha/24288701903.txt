I received this cream as a gift and was super excited to try it out. But after 3 days of using this cream, I got 4 big pimples and I’m so upset. The cream is very greasy, felt like oil when I put it on my facefelt on the face, and in the morning my face has never been so greasy, as if in oil. probably it is well suited for old ladies 80+ or ​​people with very dry skin. price is not quality!
