Honestly, this product is probably the best SPF I’ve ever used. Absolute holy grail in spite of the price. That being said, if I’m paying $60 for 50mL of product, I expect the paint on the packaging not to flake off & stick to my face, hands, clothes, & everything in my purse. Please fix. Amazing product! Packaging ruins it!
