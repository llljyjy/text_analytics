I LOVE this primer. It feels luscious, and makes my skin so soft. It also immediately makes my skin look so much better! I have a lot of acne scarring, and it helps diminish their appearance. I feel so much better in my skin using this. My only gripe is that it’s so expensive for such a little bottle. I don’t wear makeup very often and even then it’s only lasted me about eight months. Expensive but worth it!
