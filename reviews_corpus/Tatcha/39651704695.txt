I received this product as apart of my birthday gift and when it ran out, I went straight to sephora to buy the big bottle. This cleanser is amazing. It has a little texture to it, so it does exfoliate and it leaves my skin sooo hydrated. It also smells very natural. If you have dry skin I definitely recommend this and the dewy skin moisturizer by Tacha. amazing for dry skin
