I just got this so the review may be too soon but wow, is this amazing.  I love and use a number a Tatcha products but this one has jumped to the top of the list.  I don’t use this as my toner, I use a more moisturizing product for that.  I use this in place of the peel pads I used to use.  After about a week, my skin is smoother.  I just love the little bit of tingle I get from it.  So far I’m only using it once a day, over time I might increase it to twice a day.  if you have very sensitive skin, I would do a patch test for a few days first.  While I’m sure younger people will jump on this, I want to assure mature ladies that this is a winner for us too. Replacing my peel pads
