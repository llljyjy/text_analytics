The last Tatcha product I tried was a slam dunk, so I was excited to try this mask that sounded perfect for my occasionally acne-prone, oily to combination skin. I love that it draws out oil and impurities in just 3 minutes - it’s so quick, which is great because sometimes I don’t have the time to sit around in a mask. The packaging, like their other products, feels heavyweight and luxurious, and I love to show it off on my vanity. The scent isn’t overwhelming - I’m usually pretty sensitive to scents in my skincare, but I like this one and it doesn’t bother me. The warning sensation is a little odd and takes a little getting used to, but isn’t uncomfortable. My skin feels clearer and so clean after using this!This product was gifted by Tatcha in exchange for my honest review. nan
