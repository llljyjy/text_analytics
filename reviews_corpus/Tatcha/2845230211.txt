This is my all time favorite product. I’ve read a lot of the comments about how it’s heavy and sticky but I think it’s because they might be using too much product. The first night I used it, I was sticking to my pillow so the following night, I barely dabbed my finger in the excess on the lid and it was perfect. I also only use it on my cheeks and I would normally wake up with a little bit of rosacea in that area but now I wake up with even and clear skin. I got this as a free sample (5 mL) from either points or from spending a certain amount on an order and genuinely think it’ll last me a year. Def recommend. great for rosacea!
