Lightweight, leaves a dewy finish. This always leaves my face feeling fresh and protected from daily pollution/grime build up. I have found liquid make up sits better on top of it but powder works well too. Make up lasts longer. My all time favorite- I switched from smashbox photo blur to this and never looked back. nan
