I am on my 3rd bottle. This is magic in a bottle. It is hydrating & gives you a very dewy look. I have sensitive skin that gets red and itchy when products have ingredients that are irritating to my skin. So I tend to switch products to see what works. This moisturizer works so well with my sensitive skin. I put it on daily mornings and nights. It doesnâ€™t seem to absorb, it stays on the skin but it still keeps my skin feeling hydrated. Honestly all I have been using lately is this moisturizer, an eye cream at night, and sunscreen during the day and my skin feels and looks good with no breakouts or irritation. I definitely recommend this product. magic in a bottle
