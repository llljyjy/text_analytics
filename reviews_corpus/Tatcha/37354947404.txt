Originally I would have never bought this product due to the price point. Sephora sent me a free sample as a birthday gift and I LOVED IT! Makes my skin feel so hydrated and glowy. I put this on before bed and when I wake up I still feel super moisturized. A little bit goes a long way so it will last you a while. I went and bought the big container and have seen a difference in my eczema prone skin. My only complaint is the container. Itâ€™s hard to get it out without getting the product under your nails. So I just use a little spoon. But overall you truly do get what you pay for with this product!!! Is it worth it?
