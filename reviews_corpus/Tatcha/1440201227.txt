I was never quite sure how I felt about essences, but after receiving the Fresh Kombucha Treatment Essence I then went all in on essences. The tatcha had been on my list for a while and pulled the trigger on the holiday gift set since it has a mini before commiting to the whole thing - and got some great travel sized cleansing oil and the enzyme cleanser out of it which are also phenomemal. Showed my mom this essence and it really does add an extra UMPH to your skincare. If you aren’t doing a bunch of other products or steps like a good C, HA, moisturizer, etc. this essence isn’t for you. But if you’re doing everything else and still looking for something to help plump the fine lines, etc. then this is it! Especially going into winter, and even with oily skin, I can sense my skin’s dehydration and haven’t felt that since using it! Not a must have, but it is phenomenal.
