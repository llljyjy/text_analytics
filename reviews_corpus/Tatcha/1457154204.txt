I am forever on a quest for a face sunscreen with high spf that plays well with my other skincare products and doesn’t break me out. At first, this seemed like the one. But oh my goodness, what a complete packaging fail! I had read the other reviews and thought people might be overreacting - I should have listened. The bottle has never left my bathroom counter and the label is still flaking off all over my hands every time I touch it. Really heartbreaking because the formula is great, but it’s basically unusable unless you want tiny bits of purple all over your face. Might try salvaging the rest by putting it into another container, but I won’t be purchasing again unless the packaging changes. Skip this unless the packaging changes.
