I do like this product. I notice my skin does feel softer. But I’m not 100% is a necessity. I use it first before I use toner serums etcI wish I knew 100% what it was doing for my skin that all my other products weren’t doing. I’ve always had great skin so I’m not sure about this one. I have everything else by tatcha. The dewy moisturizer is enough for me. I don’t know if I’ll buy this again unless I hear from the extorts what this is doing for me. And the price well I think it’s to high. I love the brand but again I’m not 100% sure on this and I would be shocked if I bought this again I hope it works for you but I’m not sure what it’s doing for me Not sure about this one
