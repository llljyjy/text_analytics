Ok so,I am a gal with dry/hormonal acne skin. I’m always a little hesitant to go beyond the scope of La Roche-Posay and CeraVe.BUT, I have to say, this has noticeably evened my skintone in the past few days. I apply it at night after I wash my face. I mix like 2 drops of this with 2 drops of Peach Slices’s snail mucin toner (dw, that one is cheap) and my skin is glowy, hydrated and even.P.S. I got it 25% off on their website during Black Friday. Even without the sale, I’ll probably repurchase it. Dry/Acne love!
