I was sent this complimentary from tatcha but all my thoughts are my own. I have been a tatcha stan since day one and this product is no different. This worked well for my fair complected, sensitive, irritation and sunburn prone skin. I reapplied throughout the day while I was out and it layered well without much pilling. Couldnt ask for more. Great sunscreen for sensitive skin
