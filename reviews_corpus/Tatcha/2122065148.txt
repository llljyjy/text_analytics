I am a huge fan of Tatcha products and LOVE the Indigo Cream so thought I’d give this a try. Unfortunately this was a rare Tatcha miss for me. It didn’t sink into my skin like the cream does,  the consistency feels almost like donut glaze, and my skin felt suffocated more than anything else. Two stars because like all Tatcha products the quality is stellar but will be returning. nan
