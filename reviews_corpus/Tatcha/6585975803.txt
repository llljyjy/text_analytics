All my skincare products have been replaced with Tatcha skincare. I am absolutely in love with this brand, and especially the rice wash cleanser. I never realized that rice was something my skin had been missing, but this cleanser has done my skin wonders. It’s so easy to put on. I can just scrub with my fingers and I can already feel it working its way deep into my skin, and it rinses off so nice, that I just need to splash water onto my face 2 or 3 times, and then I am set. It does not leave my skin feeling rough, or a burning feeling afterwards. My skin feels smooth and soft. I do not breakout as much as I used to it, I don’t even breakout really anymore. My redness has disappeared a lot. I love this cleanser. nan
