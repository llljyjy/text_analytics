I really struggle with sunscreen. I get terrible breakouts, I’ve had allergic reactions, and weepy eyes from sunscreen on my face. I really like this sunscreen. It goes on smooth leaving my skin feeling silky and nice. It’s not greasy like every other sunscreen I’ve tried (even those claiming they aren’t greasy). I have worn it under makeup and it performs well. My only two complaints are the price and the packaging. The price is incredibly high for a product you need to use multiple times a day but due to skin allergies this seems to be the only one that doesn’t irritate me. The packaging isn’t too bad at first but like others over time the packaging starts to peel and it’s like having glitter everywhere which is a problem for sensitive eyes. And speaking of eyes this is definitely not one you can put on your eyelids. I have polarized sunglasses so I’m hoping they protect my eyelids enough. I’ve used Australian Gold with success on my lids before but can’t get that stuff to sink into my skin and you definitely can’t wear makeup over it. best sunscreen so far
