Received this as my birthday gift from sephora, it lasted me probably a week n a half. i would only use it at night, for the first 2 times applying it made my skin feel a little itchy in a few places for a few minutes before going away but it wasn’t bad enough to stop making me use it. it was also really oily when applying which is why i only used it at night, but within an hour it would dry a bit and wasn’t as bad. i noticed small changes in how my face felt in the morning, super smooth and soft and definitely looked healthier. definitely will be buying again!
