I have somewhat dry, sensitive skin and am always looking for something that eliminates texture without burning my skin or causing redness. Iâ€™ve used this in the evening followed by dewy skin cream and by morning I can see differences in clarity and texture. Even at the high price I will likely repurchase this in the future. For reference, it has a very similar texture to their rice wash. (gifted by Tatcha) Smoother and Softer Skin
