I use this in the shower after my face wash and WOW. It cleaned my pores out so nicely and left my face feeling smooth but without the redness that other pore masks create. You donâ€™t have to leave this on to fully dry which is nice I just leave it on for like 3 minutes and can feel it working as it warms up on the skin a bit. Gifted by Tatcha nan
