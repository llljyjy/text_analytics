I have combination skin with dryness around my forehead and cheeks. I really wanted to like this product but felt it was too thin and didn’t provide enough coverage. My skin would be dry after a few hours and I’d have to reapply. It also leaves a white residue on your face if you don’t take the time to get the product in your skin. Overall I didn’t feel like it was worth the price. Leaves a white residue and is thin. I'd pass !
