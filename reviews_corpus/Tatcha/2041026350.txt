I got this as a sample and I cannot believe the difference it makes in my skin. Itâ€™s so hydrating and makes my skin so soft! This was particularly shocking for me because I have combination skin, but even my more oilier spots love this. I will absolutely be purchasing the full size.For the record, this is not something that can just be replaced with a more affordable dupe and Tatcha knows it. I think what makes it so special is the rice ferment filtrate and algae blend. My skin is bouncier, more plump, and perfectly dewy after using this. It also feels so much healthier! I had no idea what I was missing. I had no business loving this so much
