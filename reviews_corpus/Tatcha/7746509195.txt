Love the product but the packaging has to go! I’ve bought not one , not two, but three of these sunscreens and they all have the same issues. The bottle will flake and get onto your hands which will transfer to your face or anything else you touch. Then with the bottle itself, when I take off the cap the product instantly starts pouring out and will not stop. I love the formula of this and the way it feels on my skin with or without makeup but I have had to return it every single time due to the packaging. As soon as it’s changed I’ll be back to buy again! The Packaging Has To Go
