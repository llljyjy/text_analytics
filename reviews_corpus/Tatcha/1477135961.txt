I got this as a part of a tatcha sample set from Sephora. A little goes a long way. To me it is just like applying a stickier version of vaseline. I don’t know what the price is on buying this standalone, but if its more than cost of tub of petroleum jelly then it is not worth the $. If you are read the list of ingredients it isn’t anything special. If you apply alone stays on no more than 15 min. By comparison, I also own the Dior exfoliating balm in universal that I apply every night or before matte lipstick. Dior has actual skincare ingredients and stays on for a long time, isn’t sticky, and does what it says it will do. Since i own kissu now i just dab it on top of the Dior at night, bc why not as it has occlusive ingredients, so it just makes the Dior stay on longer. Won’t repurchase. Sticky version of petroleum jelly, not worth it
