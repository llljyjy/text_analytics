Tatcha products are so luxurious to me, and this sunscreen was no exception. For a mineral sunscreen it was incredibly easy to rub in, and since it’s tinted it didn’t leave a white cast while not being so tinted that it looks orange on my fair skin. I think the price per ounce is a bit crazy, but luckily this was gifted by Tatcha. Overall this is a really nice sunscreen. Really lovely but really expensive
