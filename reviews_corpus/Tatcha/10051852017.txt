I chose this as a birthday gift and I’m very happy with it. I LOVE the rich, creamy texture and plumping effect it has on my skin. I have sensitive, but dry skin so I’m always using serums in addition to my day and/or night cream. This cream has made a difference to my skin. I will consider buying it or another product from this brand to add to my skincare routine. Love the rich, creamy texture it adds to my skin!
