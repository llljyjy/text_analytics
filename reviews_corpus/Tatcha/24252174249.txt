I give this 2 stars bc I’m honestly still unsure about it but i’m thinking it’s definitely gonna be a no for me at least. at first i really liked it and it feels nice on my face. i feel like the exfoliating part doesn’t do too much but i also don’t see any difference in my pores. before this i only had some hormonal acne on my chin, but now i have bumps & black heads all over my chin & cheeks. there’s even bumps coming up on my forehead now (the don’t have a head but they’re still red bumps) so definitely think i’m gonna stop using this for a bit and see if anything changes. i’ve been using the moisturizer with it but it was a small kind of sample sized one & so i’ll probably just use the rest of it. but even the moisturizer is too watery for me i thought it would be perfect but if i don’t put it over my serums and use an oil after it just feels like wet but dry it’s weird. and at first they both seemed to be doing okay i think i even gave a good review on the moisturizer i can’t remember but after using both for a straight month i think it’s just making my face worse. those were the only things i changed up. i still have some of the face wash i’ve been using plus another sample sized one also that came in the pack with the small moisturizer so i may see if i can go back to it later but if i see one bump after use i won’t be using it again. right now i’ll have to find something that can clear up my face now because i do believe it’s the face wash doing it think this is causing my breakouts
