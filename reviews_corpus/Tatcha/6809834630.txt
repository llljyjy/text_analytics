this stuff is a holy grail product, for people like me who have dry skin. i’ve heard it really doesn’t work for oily and combo skin! i tried tatcha’s other moisturizer (in the green bottle) and it broke me out. turns out, it’s for oily/combo skin! but this one, it works wonders for me. i have had so many people ask me what my skin care routine is and it’s just this and a cleanser. the price tag is hefty but it lasts FOREVERRRR and a little goes a loooong way. 10/10 recommend! AMAZING! for *dry* skin.
