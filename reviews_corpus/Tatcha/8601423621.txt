Mica in skincare?? Really?? I tried the sample size and then went over the ingredients list, mica in skincare just to achieve the artificial glow? If u can’t achieve glow using skincare ingredients then don’t advertise yourself as such, and then slap on a ridiculously high price to push the “glow” agenda, not to mention straight up alcohol in it as well, I know tons of skincare use different type of alcohol in them, but this ingredient list straight up alcohol in the list, plus the mica, I can’t get over that, it’s so cheating to put mica in and to advertise it as “glow skincare” Mica in skincare??
