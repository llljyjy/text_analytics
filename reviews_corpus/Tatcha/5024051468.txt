The paper is super nice and works amazingly! The only downside to it is that the pack is small and doesnâ€™t last long. I have combo skin and I often need to wipe my T-zone more often and as annoying as that is, the paper worked great, I just ran out faster. I do think the paper is also larger than other brands? (I could totally be wrong here) Besides my oily issues lol the paper is awesome-the packaging is super cute too. (: love
