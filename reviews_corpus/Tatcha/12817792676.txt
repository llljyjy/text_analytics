This is the mineral sunscreen I’ve been waiting for. It just melts into your skin and doesn’t leave you overly shiny despite being water resistant. It is also pinky peach tinted instead of being orange, unlike every other tinted sunscreen, which is a gift to those of us with cooler tinted skin. It smooths over and hides rough and dry patches on the skin  and blurs pores too. I love it enough to pay the high price. To me, it’s worth it! The best mineral sunscreen ever
