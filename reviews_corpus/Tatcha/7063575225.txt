I am so torn on this product! It works AMAZING for texture! After just two nights of using this, my skin is the SOFTEST it’s ever been my whole adult life. My redness significantly decreased. I didn’t notice any difference with my pores. My issue with this product is that it’s not good for dry skin. My skin felt very tight after application and the next morning I woke up with extremely oily and greasy skin because this stripped my already dry skin. I am really torn on returning this or keeping it and just using it less. It REALLY works for texture but dry skin babes, proceed with caution. Maybe get a sample first before committing to the full size bottle. I definitely recommend this to the oily skin people out there with texture problems. not for dry skin
