I received the new clarifying clay mask complimentary from Tatcha. After trying this mask out for about a of couple weeks, I have to say I’m a big fan! It leaves my dry, sensitive skin feeling soft and smooth. My only complaint is that the product isn’t fragrance free, however it does not irritate my sensitive skin. nan
