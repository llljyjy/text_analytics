I don’t love this product nearly as much as I wanted to, unfortunately! This left my skin feeling unusually sensitive, even after following the directions to only leave on for a few minutes. I also don’t find the product application process to feel that great either - the mask has a gritty texture. Even though this was gifted by Tatcha to me, it’s a pass for me. nan
