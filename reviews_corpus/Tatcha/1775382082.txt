I like this product. I had gotten a sample for another and while I liked the results, the flavor was not my favorite. The Tatcha Kissu Lip Mask is pretty much flavorless. I use it nightly and my chapped lips have gone down to nothing. I also like the applicator, I feel like I waste less than using my finger. At first I was like “night mask? Isn’t that going to get all over my pillows?“ But it doesn’t. I don’t gob it on though. Just a thin layer. Works well. (It will get on a surgical mask though. Some days I tried that when I was having a chapped lip episode and had to go out while masking was a thing. It did work well on my lips but it also ended up on the mask.)This is a repeat purchase for me. I highly recommend it. Nice night mask with good results.
