This product does not deliver on some of the most basic claims it makes: Melts into the skin? No. Ideal for prepping eyes for make up application? Absolutely not. This cream is technically not even a cream due to its consistency. It’s far too thick for it to spread and absorb evenly and smoothly under eyes, you simply can’t do that without really pulling and stretching the skin around your eyes. As a consequence, make up application over it is simply awful, my concealer looked so bad I had to wash it off and skip using this cream altogether. This product is far too expensive for it to fail on such basic level. Do not buy. nan
