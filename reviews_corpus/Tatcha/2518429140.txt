The sunscreen is okay. It has a white cast until you rub it out completely & that takes a while to do. It is very watery and the packaging as others have mentioned is AWFUL! It glops out non stop.. I was wiping it down yesterday, I was not squeezing it at all. It was coming out, getting everywhere after I had just finished cleaning it off. I gave up. I prefer my Supergoop glow sunscreen for many reasons! Save your $$$$
