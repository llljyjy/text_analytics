I really wanted this sunscreen to work for me because it’s so light weight and tried down so nicely. It left a nice sheen/glow but not an oily or greasy look. It just left a slight white cast. I have dry skin and dark/deep complexion. Not a horrible cast but enough to need to dust a powder or light foundation on top. For this price, I don’t want to have to apply something on top to help the cast. Im extremely sad this didn’t work for me. I would definitely recommend this but if you are dark to deep, know that it will leave a slight cast. Soooo good but….
