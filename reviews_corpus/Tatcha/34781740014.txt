I absolutely love this. I bought the mini because I like to test things out. it is almost gone now! My skin is normal and not sensitive. This product has fragrance but I donâ€™t find it an issue at all. I like to use this moisturizer at night as it is a bit heavy feeling for me during the day. I have found that it hydrates my skin very nicely and has added softness to the feeling of my skin.with it almost gone now and since I liked it a lot I have ordered the value size now. Very Dewy!
