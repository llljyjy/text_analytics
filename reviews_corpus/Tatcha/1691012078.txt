I love this cleanser. I was hesitant because of the price vs size of bottle but a friend recommend it to me so I gave it a try. I have such dry skin and washing my skin with this (plus oils to moisturize after) left my skin more hydrated then it has been in a while. Plus a little goes a long way- it’s quite concentrated so you can use a little bit and just add water and it really lasts a while. I’ve tried many face washes and this has been the best so far! Great for dry skin!
