As upsetting as this is to say(financially), I found my forever sunscreen. This 100% mineral spf is runny and light and has absolutely no white cast on me. I have fair skin and a lot of tinted spf makes my face look orange but this is just the perfect tone for my skin type. I have seen darker skin tones that have a slight white cast with this product though. The smell is similar to the Paula’s choice mineral spf 30 if you’ve used that before. It smells like of like clay. Not anything that lasts more than a few seconds. If I’m forced to complain about one thing, it’s the packaging. It’s so sleek and pretty but it’s hard to put the product in your hand and put the lid on because it doesn’t stand up on its own. It’s the size of a mens wallet. There is as much product as the other popular sunscreens out there. For me, the price is well worth is because I have looked high and low for a mineral sunscreen that works for me. This has the perks that a chemical spf has, without the issues sensitive skin can have with them. I’m very happy and will be repurchasing. I use this as my first spf and try to reapply with a powder or something else just because I’m trying to not run through it too fast. I have dry skin and this kept my face from being dry and matte, but also didn’t feel heavy or greasy. It feels like nothing tbh. I’d go for it if you can afford it, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed! Also I’m just a normal customer I didn’t get paid to leave a review or anything I bought this myself and wanted to share my experience. nan
