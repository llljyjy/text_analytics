I have acneic skin which is oily and also sensitive to what I put on it.   I have my routines set up that have drastically changed the game for my skin and these issues have been tamed incredibly well but I wanted to add a cleanser with a physical exfoliant factor (over chemical/acid exfoliants) and I came across Tatcha’s Deep Cleanse Gentle Exfoliating Cleanser and I am very happy so far with it.  Tatcha always interested me but their prices have thrown me off of quite a few of their products but this one I can agree with wanting to pay $53.00 because it does. what. it. says!  It has a very gentle exfoliating scrub to it, my face feels cleanser after using and doesn’t feel stripped and dry after, my skin loves it overall with a glow and no redness whatsoever+ it smells heavenly without being overpowering.  Which was another turn off for me as I heard they used a lot of perfume typically in their products, but can’t say that’s the case with this one.  Very pleased overall, the packaging is cute and seems to have been improved over previous packaging model(s) which is nice.    Would recommend trying, I know I’ll be sticking with this one! Is indeed a super "Gentle Exfoliating Cleanser"
