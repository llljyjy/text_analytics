I wanted to love this, I really did, but my skin seems to hate everything I try from Tatcha. This cleanser left my skin horribly dried out, which was even more of a bummer because it’s advertised as being suited for dry skin. I didn’t enjoy the scent and the product had a gritty texture that irritated my skin. Maybe this would be better for people with an oilier skin type, but if you have dry, sensitive skin like I do, imo stay away from this cleanser. Hard pass for dry skin
