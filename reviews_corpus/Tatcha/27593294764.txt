This was an amazing moisturizer, really thick and hydrating. I love Tatcha’s Hadasei- 3 complex and found it helped plump and hydrate my skin. I initially bought this assuming it would work on combination - dry skin however I found it was too heavy at times and made my skin oily. I would recommend this if you have extremely dry or mature skin but maybe not otherwise. I also didn’t love the inclusion of Mica and fragrance in the ingredients list even if it’s in trace amounts - but a pretty solid product overall. Didn't work for me
