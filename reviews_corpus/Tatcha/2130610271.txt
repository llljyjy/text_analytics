This is my perfect facial sunscreen! It is so silky and lightweight. Most sunscreens feel way too heavy and greasy on my skin. This also pairs wonderfully under makeup! This purchase was a big splurge for me, but I’ve been on the hunt for a good sunscreen to wear with makeup that isn’t heavy or has too obvious of a tint. I have rosacea so sunscreen is my most important skincare step, but with combo sensitive skin it is really tricky to find something that works for me. Such a dream! Highly recommend. nan
