I’ve been impatiently waiting for volition to restock their 50spf primer and thought I’d try this out because I have had great experience with other tatcha products. I really like this formula (although I’d still prefer volition) but this bottle is terrible. it dispenses way too much product without even moving trying to. I travel a lot for work and I know if I fly with this, I’ll probably lose half the bottle when I use it after a flight. wish they would’ve thought about how much product is being wasted by this design. I won’t buy it again because of that nan
