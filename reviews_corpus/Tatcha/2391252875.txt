I ignored the negativity regarding the packaging because the product itself was such a draw and good, actually. But... aside from the mess, the package cannot stand up, and the outside of the package flakes onto your hands? Honestly surprised that there is so much agreement among reviewers and not a move right away to put this package on clearance and a new version on pump--or tube--or anything but this.
