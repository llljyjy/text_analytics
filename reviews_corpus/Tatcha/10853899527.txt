I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I was currently looking into trying out a new toner and so I decided to give this a try. I have been using this toner now for about three weeks and definitely see great improvement overall. Itâ€™s lightweight and has a refreshing scent. After using it for a week my pores appeared smaller and cleared out some redness. I have used a few other products to help with my oily skin and this toner seems to have done the best so far. I also have very sensitive skin so trying new products are always a risk but I am glad I went for it. It does nothing but make my skin feel amazing! This is my first time trying out a product from this brand and I am very impressed and looking into getting the moisturizing cream to go with it. nan
