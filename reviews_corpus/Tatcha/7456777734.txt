Nice, light-weight moisturizer with moderate coverage. I use this at nighttime after the Tatcha Essence for my combo skin. There is perfume and alcohol in this but even so doesn’t seem to bother my sensitive skin. While it’s a very nice moisturizer I don’t see being able to justify the pricey $125 tag. I would love to see more eco-friendly (read: glass with refill pack options) packaging for such a pricey product too. Fun experience for a spa/girls night in but I don’t see myself committing to it as a daily/long-term HG due to the price and the perfume (which on my bad days can be a bit too strong for me). Nice, luxury moisturizer
