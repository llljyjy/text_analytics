I tried this first as a deluxe sample and loved it. When I started using the full size bottle I realized that the primer was a little thicker and more drying than I expected. I have dry skin, and use it over my moisturizer and before a BB cream. It creates a silky finish but it is ultimately drying on me. I will not repurchase. Silky finish but not for dry skin
