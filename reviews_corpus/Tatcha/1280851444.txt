Amazing sunscreen - but it doesn’t matter bc the packaging is horrible. And for the exorbitant price, I would expect them to get that right. I will not purchase again even though the sunscreen is everything I’ve always wanted. I’m sure there’s a brand out there that does it just as well and actually cares about the consumer experience with the packaging. Amazing sunscreen… but HORRIBLE packaging
