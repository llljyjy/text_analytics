a beautiful spray that felt wonderful and made my skin look absolutely stellar. however i cannot really feel the product touching my skin when i spray it, so i often overuse which leads to running out of it faster. which sucks because itâ€™s such an expensive product. unfortunately other setting sprays can do the exact same. nan
