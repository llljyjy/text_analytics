This moisturizer makes your face look and feel greasy for as long as you have it on and I have dry skin. I would use this at night but never during the day it does not combine well with primer or foundation over top. It helps with the dryness but doesnâ€™t do anything extra or special to justify the price. Ponds cold cream does a better job at least I can wear makeup overtop of that. Definitely not worth it for the price
