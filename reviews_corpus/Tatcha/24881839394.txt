Chose the Tatcha cream for my birthday gift. The fragrance is too much for a moisturizer ( lavendar-ish??) And by the end of the day my face itched and had breakouts. Tried it on two separate days to see if it was indeed this product. I liked the all day hydrated look, but its a no for me Smell and breakouts
