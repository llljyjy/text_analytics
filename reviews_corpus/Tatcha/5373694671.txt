Pros: hydrating, non greasy, didn’t cause any breakouts, pleasant smell.Cons: expensive for how much product I felt I had to use each time to moisturize my face. It felt like trying to use an eye cream on my whole face. It’s definitely not the case of “a little goes a long way” in my opinion.Conclusion: I like the product but bc I had to use an usual amount of product to really moisturize it’s too expensive. My skin: dry + sensitive Lovely but had to use a lot of product
