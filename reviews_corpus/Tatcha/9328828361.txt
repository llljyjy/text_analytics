After reading a lot of reviews I decided to try this. Sephora was the only place the red camellia color is sold so Iâ€™m happy I was able to get one. It is a pretty color, just enough that I can use it for any winter occasion.  It hydrated all day too so my lips never looked chapped. Beautiful color and great for winter.
