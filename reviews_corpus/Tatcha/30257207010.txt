The Silk Sunscreen Hydrating Mineral SPF gifted by Tatcha is great. I absolutely love the weightless liquid formula that is sheer and absorbs instantly, it leaves skin looking softer and moisturized. This awesome mineral sunscreen acts as a moisturizer but protects skin as a mineral sunscreen. There is absolutely no white residue and just instantly more hydrated, smoother and even skin. Love
