Complimentary from tatcha for reviewing purposes.The texture of the spf is luxe and silk as it stated. I prefer to use a measuring spoon for a proper amount of the spf. the tint is barely seen on my fair skin. i was a bit skeptical about tinted spf becaseit might look orange on my skin tone. the coverage is less than medium. it covers some blemishes, but not completely. the spf sinks into my skin seamlesslyand effortlessly. I refer to apply on bare dry skin right after washing my face in the morning. it might get slightly oilier throughout the day if other skincare products applied under this spf. the packaging is the most beautiful that iâ€™ve seen. Its a sleek flat bottle in my favourite lavender color with a screw cap on top. silky & luxe sunscreen amazing tint for fair skin
