Incredible!!! I have combo skin and use it every night in the end of skincare routine after DE Lalaretro moisturizer. My skin drinks it up and I wakeup with glowy supple skin, doesn’t break me out. Amazing after retinol. it’s soo soothing and calming and the texture is out of this world,  such a unique luxury experience unlike anything on the market. haven’t used it during summer yet though. will buy again and again, hooked forever! Miracle in a jar!
