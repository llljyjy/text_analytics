I have never found a face wash that I REALLY like, and I think I’ve finally found the one! It was the packaging that got me at first honestly lol. I’ve always had oily skin but as im getting older I think I have combination now. I needed something that wasn’t going to dry me out completely but still made my face feel squeaky clean. And this did just that! I love it, the scent, the consistency and the fresh feeling after. I ended up buying the tatcha toner and suncreen as well which I love also! My skin is also very sensitive and this didn’t leave me red. nan
