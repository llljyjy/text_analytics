I am an esthetician who works with luxury skincare. I have tried many creams some that cost upwards of $300. NOTHING compares to Tatcha Dewy cream. I am a 32 year old woman with dry and dehydrated skin and nothing makes my skin feel like this cream does. Let’s start by talking about the packaging it’s sturdy and luxurious. Love that it comes with a scoop to keep bacteria out. The smell is perfect. The feel is like wrapping your skin in a silk blanket. SO comforting and rich while still remaining silky and absorbent.  It feels expensive and luxurious. I was recently supplementing with a different cream and repurchased my tatcha today and nearly cried with joy. I tell my husband it’s one of the small luxuries of my day. My skin immediately feels better. I’ll never be able to use anything but the dewy cream! It’s the best! BEST CREAM EVER!!
