This is an amazing mist but only if you like a dewy and moisturized look. I grab it with me when I run errands or have a busy day out with no make up on, spray when my skin feels a little dry under the mask and I love how “silky” it makes my skin look. If it helps, my friend prefers matte look so she hates this product since she thinks it makes the skin look too shiny. nan
