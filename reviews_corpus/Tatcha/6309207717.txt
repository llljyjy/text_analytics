I went from “ ehhh this is nice but do I really want to spend $60 on it ? “ to finally biting the bullet and getting the full bottle after using up my tiny sample. My colleague from zoom call this morning : “ did you get new makeup ? Your face is glowing ! You looks so pretty ! “ Me: Nope. No makeup at all, just my bare skin and sunscreen ;) So seriously. If you can afford it, buy it. The texture is amazing used alone or combined with foundation. It gives you such a nice healthy complexion and glow. Expensive .. but Holy Grail
