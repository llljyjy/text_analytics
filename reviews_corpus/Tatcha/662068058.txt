I tried this based on recommendation. I like Laneige lip mask, but this mask is far less sticky, and more moisturizing. I decided to purchase this tinted version as a lipstick/gloss alternative for wearing at home. I have extremely dry lips, and this is coming in handy as Winter is approaching. So moisturizing!
