For reference, I am in my mid 40s and have fine lines and wrinkles, texture, hyperpigmentation, and enormous pores. I always wear foundation so every primer I use must work under foundation, and this one does.PROS:Natural finish.A little goes a long way.It has some good skin care ingredients.It is best for oily, combination and normal skin but I found it hydrating and I think it can work for dry skin as well.Clean at Sephora CONS:It is too light for my liking. It does not minimize my pores as good as the original formula does.It is an expensive primer.I didnâ€™t feel that it extended the life of my makeup. It has perfume, which I like but it is not necessary and it can be irritating for sensitive skin.I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador I prefer the original Silk Canvas formula
