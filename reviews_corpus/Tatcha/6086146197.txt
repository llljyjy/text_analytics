Layers really nicely over serums and under makeup (no pilling) and blends in easily to my skin while also hydrating. The scent is a little intense when you first apply it, but doesn’t last too long so it doesn’t bother me. When I use it on its own (no makeup or product over it) it gives my skin a nice glow without looking oily and doesn’t have any white cast. Although the product is a pale skin tone color, it’s thin enough to blend invisibly into my skin, so doesn’t have to match my exact skin tone. The price is a little steep for the amount of product, so I’ll have to see how long it lasts. Pricey but delivers
