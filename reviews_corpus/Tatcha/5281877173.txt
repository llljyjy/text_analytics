I tried this cleanser like two years ago and I have been using it ever since. I have seen a really big difference in my skin. I have combination/ sensitive skin with mild acne and I have used almost everything from the drugstore and I’ve used medical grade products from doctors and my skin just didn’t take well to anything. I have noticed that I have less break outs and my skin texture has been more smooth. I realize that this cleanser is a little on the pricey side, but it has been worth it for me. I also feel like it takes me a long time to get through a bottle as I only wash my face at night and I use like less than a dimes worth. I don’t feel like I need a lot of it in order to cleanse my face thoroughly. Definitely Give It A Try
