Stay away if you have sensitive skin!!! Holy makeup gurus. Left this mask on for three minutes and washed it off with cool water per instructions and I looked like a boiled lobster. My poor cheeks were soooo red and irritated. Also it takes a lot of work to spread a thin layer because the mask has an incredibly thick texture. It took a couple rinses to come off. Skip it!!! Worth $70 bucks? Only if they slip you $65 dollars with each purchase. Nope, horrible, nope!
