I have combo/normal skin, I get dry in winter and oilier in the summer. I like glowy foundations, powders and concealers, I’m fine looking like a donut…The first thing I thought was: this smells so bad(floral pine-sole but worse?)… why does is feel like vaseline… I feel like I put grease on my face and I’m gonna break out if I keep using it…That’s the only “plumping” sensation I got.Got it for the Sephora birthday gift and it didn’t live up to the hype, I’ll stick to my gel moisturizers. Only get this if your skin is in a constant state of the Sahara and crackling like a reptile and even still tread lightly. Overpriced Vaseline
