I was just gifted by Tatcha their new clarifying clay mask a couple weeks ago and I am so excited that I did. It comes in the classic packaging and the mask starts off a greenish color and quickly turns more of a pink tone. I like that this mask doesnâ€™t have to dry down completely because those types of masks always make my face feel extra dry. After applying my skin feels soft and smooth. Love it
