The packaging is what ruins this product - each time you open it the product squeezes out all over the place and it somehow eats through the bottle paint - as you can see in other reviews - the product itself is nice ! But for 60 dollar sunscreen to leak out all over the Place is ridiculous!!! I exchanged it for their lower SFF one pore perfecting sunscreen which I love love love - itâ€™s 8 dollars more $68 worst packaging everrrrr! legit ever
