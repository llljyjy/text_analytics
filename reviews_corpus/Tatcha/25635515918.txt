I got the birthday testers of this moisturizer and the face wash, i have fair skin, dont really get zits, and my skin is almost always clear. I used the face wash and was fairly impressed with the first couple uses. The moisturizer is definitely hydrating, however ive noticed i began breaking out after just a couple days. I have red spots all over my jaw line, alongside my nose, across my forehead, and both my cheeks, aswell as multiple white head zits. Its pretty gnarly.Im super bummed as i heard good things about this brand, but it definitely will not be used again by me. Id save your money and go a different route for sure. Caused crazy break outs.
