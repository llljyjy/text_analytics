I am absolutely shocked with how amazing this eye cream is. I have used everything on the market. From drug store eye creams to high end brands. I thought I had a good eye cream till I tried this one. Not only does it moisturize your eyes but it makes them look so much younger. I bought a jar a about a year ago and used it daily. The jar lasted me a year because a little goes a long way. I ran out of the eye cream about a week ago and had to reorder it on line. While waiting for it I needed to use another brand and my eyes look horrible. I feel like I aged 10 years around my eyes. I have been trying to find something that will work till this arrives and nothing is working. I have super sensitive skin and this weather is making it so dry. My eyes hurt from being so dry yet I am using product twice a day. Thankfully i have my new jar because it was like my eyes snapped back after one use of this eye cream. I will makesure I never run out again. The difference in the way my makeup looks with and with out this eye cream is like a 180. My eyeshadow goes on so smooth and blends out amazing. With out this Tatcha eye cream my makes up made me look like the crypt keeper. I didnâ€™t even want to leave the house. I will NEVER allow myself to fun out of this eye cream ever again. I am shocked that anyone gave this stuff under a 4. It is hands down a 10 out of 10. If you pay attention to your skin before and after using this you will be shocked. A few days with out it and I was mortified not having my eye cream. Go get it now. You will not be disappointed at all. This is the best eye cream on the planet
