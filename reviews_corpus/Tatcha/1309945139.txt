I was looking for a water based moisturizer to help with my dehydrated, acne prone sensitive skin with dark spots. The cream smells very light and clean and feels good to put on but literally did nothing to improve the appearance or texture of my skin. So if you’ve got good skin this may work but if you’re looking to improve your skin, this was an expensive pretty jar but did nothing for my skin. Did not minimize pores and didn’t really help for dehydration either. Good news is that I didn’t break out while using it though. Didn’t do anything
