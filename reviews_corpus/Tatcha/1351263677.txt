Absolutely love this! I have very dry skin, and have found that it’s only become more dry and sensitive as I’ve gotten older. One of my children has severe food allergies, so I try to avoid nut and seed products in my skincare as best as possible. Turns out that is NOT EASY when it comes to hydrating creams! Nothing I was trying was cutting it... until this! It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, is super hydrating, leaves a beautiful glow, and works well under makeup. The only con I can think of is the price, especially considering I find that I have to use more than the pea-sized amount recommended. But I’ll suck it up and keep buying it. It’s that good. Skin saver!
