I put off buying this product for a long time because of the price. I tried so many other moisturizers and hydrating products for my dry winter skin, all helped but none fixed my dry skin. About a week of using this and the tatcha indigo overnight repair i could tell a difference, my friends and family could see a difference too. Tatcha products definitely saved my skin. Daily Must Have! Worth the price!!!
