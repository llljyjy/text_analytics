I’ve tried most Tatcha products — although they are a little out of my budget, this is the one I’ll get religiously no matter what. It’s great as a nighttime moisturizer for irritable, acne-prone combo skin, for starters. But it really showed its true power when I launched into using retinol too quickly thinking my skin could take it and inevitably burned my face. I tried numerous soothing & hydrating moisturizers, including the FAB ultra repair face cream, Glow Recipe’s plum hyaluronic gel cream, and even Inkey’s polyglutamaic acid serum, but low and behold, Tatcha indigo repair was the ONLY product besides pure cica that did not sting my fragile, angry skin. It brought the redness and burning sensation down really quickly — it only took a couple of days of use before I was able to start using retinol again. As much as I love cycling through all my different products, I keep coming back to this one. I use it as my nighttime moisturizer/last step in my regimen, but I’ll also use it during the day if I need the extra soothing. Although it’s heavily moisturizing & hydrating, it doesn’t feel heavy, greasy, oily, or anything that would make it unappealing for daytime use. My skin barrier loves me for it. If you’re on the fence, jump off and grab a pot :) Holy Grail. Doesn’t sting after retinol
