5 stars for the product,  0 stars for the packaging. I knew this from looking at the reviews, but I had to try it anyway. I’m glad I did. It was perfect for taking on a trip for a week. By the last day of the trip the packaging was flaking and I had to pick it off my hands before applying the product. The travel size wasn’t too bad, but I can’t imagine dealing with that every morning with the normal size. For the price, I wouldn’t repurchase until the packaging issue is fixed. The product inside is everything I wanted it to be though and would still recommend the travel size. nan
