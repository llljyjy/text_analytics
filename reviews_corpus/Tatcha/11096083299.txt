I AM IN LOVE THIS SKIN CREAM! It makes my skin feel so soft and supple its AMAZING! I can put it on before bed and in the morning my face feels just as soft and glowing as it did before bedtime! I feel like I only have to use this cream once a day which is a huge help for time! I have used so many different skin care products and lately because of having toddlers and no time for skin care twice a day(only once) I was just purchasing the Sephora brand skin cream and every other face product. I got this cream for my birthday gift in the trial size, I have been using it for about two weeks so far and I am sooo in LOVE! I want to try all the Tatcha products now!!!!!! My husband and I also both love everything with Japanese ingredients in them, and Japanese culture so that’s a plus. Even though the products are pricey I really believe they are worth it and I got the go ahead from my husband to purchase every product in the line! It will be a lot of money and I’m worried about the price but this cream has made my face so soft and silky!! I have dry skin lately and its been a lifesaver!!!!! and such a time saver!!! A MUST HAVE! ESPECIALLY FOR MOMS WITH LITTLE TIME!
