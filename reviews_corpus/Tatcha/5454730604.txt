LOVE this sunscreen â€” feels great on my dry skin and leaves a hydrated and dewy look. But I have to agree with everyone else about the packaging. The purple on the outside is peeling off and because the formula is so liquidy, it short of spills out of the top like nothing. I will continue to buy because the formula is amazing, but PLEASE Tatcha, fix the packaging. Great sunscreen, bad packaging
