After using this product for the better part of a year, I can say that it is without a doubt one of the only products I use absolutely everyday - it’s become a staple in my purse like my keys and lip balm. I like to think of this like lip balm for your face but even better! I often use it over makeup when I’m feeling a little dry (especially around my eyes) and it really doesn’t disturb my makeup. Whether I use over makeup or on clean skin, this provides instant hydration to my skin and much like a balm, lasts for a while. I had no idea how much I would love this and need this when I purchased but I’m so happy I did. Also, even though I use this a lot - you can barely tell that I’ve made a dent in it so this will last you for a while! A Must-Have For Everyone
