I have dry to normal skin, and this works so well!! I had a few acne marks that hadn’t gone away in a while, but after 2 days of using this, they had gone away!!! Makes my skin so, so soft. Amazing to wear under makeup, I’ve noticed that it’s made my base look so smooth. I’ve heard that this product doesn’t work as well for those who have oily skin, so think about that before buying! SO good
