I love how velvety and smooth this primer makes my skin feel. I’ve been experimenting with new foundations and this primer seems to work with all of them. It’s also great for no makeup days when you want a light blurring effect and glow. I have dry to normal skin. I don’t think this would be a good primer for oily skin. Go To Primer
