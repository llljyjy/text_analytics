Wow! I always love a good clay mask and was absolutely blown away with the results of this one! Smells so good like their other products and very luxe. I wish the scooper was metal versus cheap plastic, especially for the price of their products. It works great on my pores and itâ€™s a fab exfoliating treatment and easy to rinse off! Love it and recommend if you want to be a bit luxe! nan
