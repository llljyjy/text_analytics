I got a mini size using my points and I’ve been using this for the last couple weeks. It’s a fairly thin consistency but very hydrating and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I don’t think it would be enough moisture for my skin in the winter but it’s been great for a soothing and effective moisturizer in warmer months. nan
