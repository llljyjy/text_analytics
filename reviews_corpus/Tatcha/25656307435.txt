I was using the sample size of this and i’m not joking when i tell you this is the best cleanser i’ve ever used. I had these tiny pimples on my forehead for MONTHS that wouldn’t go away, and after using this cleanser for two weeks they were all gone. I thought my skin wouldn’t like this since i have sensitive skin and this product has fragrance and exfoliating bits in it, but it performed better than any other cleansers. love this stuff and definitely buying a full size. nan
