I love this cleanser. It smells so good and feels really nice on the skin. Also makes my skin so soft and doesn’t dry it out at all. The packaging it pretty too :) The only thing stopping me from giving this 5 stars is the fact it feels like an exfoliant which confused me. It has that gritty texture but I’m not complaining. It also doesn’t foam easily, I end up applying too much water to it in attempt to make it foam. Still recommend though :) Very nice!
