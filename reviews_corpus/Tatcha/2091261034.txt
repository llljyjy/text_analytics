Excellent moisturizer! In container, cream has lavender tint. On top of container there is small hole spoon that allows you to access small amount without contaminating with fingers. Feels light and fresh, but provides real moisture! In comparison with drunk elephant lala retro, this has much lighter feel but provides same moisture. Does not make skin oily. highly recommend! Best moisturizer out there! excellent
