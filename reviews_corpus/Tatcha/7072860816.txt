I was pleasantly surprised that this didn’t strip my skin or make it feel tight given that it contains a very mild physical exfoliant. The texture is great and the scent is light and not overpowering. Unfortunately, I find it to be pricey which is why I only gave 4 stars. Wouldn’t recommend for daily use for those with sensitive/reactive skin as I could see this potentially damaging the moisture barrier from over exfoliation. I keep it on hand as a luxury that I use when I want to indulge and add a little boost to my routine. nan
