i bought this product a little bit over two weeks ago and if i’m being honest i’m not entirely sure if i’ve seen much of a difference. i find when i use it my skin appears much oilier than it is? i think i’ll give it time and some consistency to see if it’ll stick with me, i know some products take awhile to either work with you or for you to fall in love with it. i think this product would look beautiful on dryer skin though, to give that radiant “glazed donut” kind of finish :) a little undecided!
