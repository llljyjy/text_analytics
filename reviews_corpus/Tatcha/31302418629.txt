I hate that I love this. Because it’s so expensive. It feels really good on the skin and I haven’t had any breakouts. I’m not sure if it helps with redness though or my skin is just super red. Either way it’s definitely something I want to buy again unless I find a cheaper dupe. Highly recommend If you have the spare change. nan
