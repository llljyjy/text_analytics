alright now im a combo girl to the T. I’m talking about a super oily t-zone with cheeks and nose creases drier than the desert. If we add on the fact that I have acne prone skin as well, we’ll just say my skin is a mess most of the time. I have tried so many moisturizers to help my dry patches without making my skin look like a greaseball, and right when I was about to admit defeat I got this as a sample for my birthday. I finally ran out of my sample after a month and yo... when I tell ya this was the only thing keeping my skin happy- its crazy. My skin looked amazing while using this. Dry patches? gone. Oily skin? controlled. Acne? not irritated. The only downfall is the price, but I will def purchase a full size one if it meant I had the perfect moisturizer for me. im in love
