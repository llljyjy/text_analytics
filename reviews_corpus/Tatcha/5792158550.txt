I have oily skin,m and had high hopes for this. This does not layer well at all, if you have clean skin with absolutely no product it’s nice. If you have any other products under this and have oily skin this is not for you. I’ve tried it with multiple different foundations and it always comes out patchy and cakey. Super glad I just purchased the mini and didn’t invest too much. Very disappointed with Tatcha on this one. not for oily skin
