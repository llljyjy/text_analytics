I have normal to oily skin however it is still acne prone , I’m a teen and get really bad breakouts from time to time, I heard many people say it’s nothing special but everyone’s different. I got the sample size to try it out first before I buy the full size and this cream is literally amazinggggg !!!! Face creams are an important part in my skincare routine and I’m forever willing to splurge . This softened my skin within the matter of a few days , my acne cleared up, and the overall texture and appearance of my skin is amazing !!!!!! I definitely recommend this however get the travel size first to see whether you like it or not , I’m forever buying this cream it’s a literal staple I’m never using anything else. Perf staple coming from a girl always on the go
