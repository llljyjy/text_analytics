By far one of my favorite moisturizers. I’ve tried this dewy skin cream and the water cream from Tatcha and they are honestly some of my favorites. This dewy skin cream does exactly what it’s called, it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and hydrated. I love wearing this under makeup and have come to also love a few other Tatcha products. I’ve tried many moisturizers and decided to repurchase this one because it doesn’t leave a thick sticky layer for me as some of other moisturizers do. nan
