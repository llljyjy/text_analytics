I am in love with every aspect of this product, from the smell (an unusual but lovely scent that reminds me of the outdoorsy freshness of woods after a rain) to the texture (grainy when first squeezed out but quickly melts into a luscious cream) to the results (revived and fresh feeling skin). I wanted to like the companion moisturizer but it was too “dewy“ for me. I use this face wash in the morning, and then Fresh Soy cleanser at night (it’s better at make-up removal, I find). For me, they’re a winning combination. I love trying new products, but I have found that this is “the one“ and I’m happy to settle down with it for the foreseeable future. Lovely
