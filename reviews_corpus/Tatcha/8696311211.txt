I am giving three stars because the bottle is horrible! The sunscreen would not stop oozing out and the outer part of the bottle deteriorates. It causes a lot of wasted product that I can’t use. For the price and amount of the product per bottle, Tatcha needs to correct this problem.  HOWEVER, the sunscreen is great! I love that it doesn’t leave a greasy film on my face. I just wish the zinc oxide is higher. Love the product but...
