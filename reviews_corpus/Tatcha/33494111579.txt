I received a travel size cream and cleanser from this line as today is my birthday. This cream is very good. It plumps, hydrates and leaves the skin soft for a long time. Lately my skin is a little bit irritated by a new retinol serum I started to use and this cream did not react harshly with it as some others I use did. Unscented. Non greasy. My only thing is ... as good as this cream is, it is way overpriced. Good product
