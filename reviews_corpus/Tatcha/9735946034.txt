Don’t get me wrong, the formula is great. The issue I have with this product is the packaging. You cannot hold the side of the product without the sunscreen spilling out. You can have the lightest touch and it will still spill. It just seems like the product is wasting and for the price it’s just not worth it. You’re basically buying half of the bottle because the other half will spill out overtime. If the packaging was different it would be 5 stars but the packaging just ruins this product. won’t be purchasing again :(
