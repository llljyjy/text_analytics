Didn’t like this primer very much. I have combination skin (dry on my cheeks, oily t-zone), and it really didn’t look good on my dry spots. I tried it a few times and ended up returning it. I prefer Milk’s primer for days I am indoors, and Supergoop’s Unseen formula for sunscreen/primer on days I am out and about. Dries out my skin
