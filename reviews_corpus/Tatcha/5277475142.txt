A little goes a long way! I usually go through an eye cream within weeks, but this eye cream has lasted me a very long time! You only need the smallest amount. Have I noticed a difference in my under eye lines? No they are still there, but it does feel like its moisturizing that area well. Would repurchase because the product lasts so long. Helps also when applying my eye shadow when I put a little on my top lid. A little goes a long way!
