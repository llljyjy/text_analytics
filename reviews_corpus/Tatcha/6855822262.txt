I tried the sample size of the Dewy Skin Cream and it was amazing. It lasted for two weeks off evening use so I had a good trial of it. I typically have acne prone skin and it can be difficult to try something new in hopes that it doesn’t aggravate. There was absolutely no problem for me using this product. It really moisturized my skin, which is rare that overnight I would feel its benefits the next day with my skin actually feeling moisturized and give me really nice soft skin. I will be purchasing the full size of this moisturizer since I got such good results… I can’t stop raving about how much this improved my skin (smooth skin, truly moisturized skin the next day, glowing skin). It really works
