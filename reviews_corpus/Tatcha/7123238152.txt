This cleanser is the absolute best! I’ve repurchased 4+ times and will be loyal to this product forever. I’ve seen reviews saying it’s gritty or feels like expensive st ives - if you rub it between your fingers for a second with water it foams and is no longer gritty… it is so gentle on my face, i use it daily and then use the rice powder to exfoliate once a week. LOVE 100% my favorite cleanser
