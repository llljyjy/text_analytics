I’ve been searching for a moisturizing, mineral sunscreen forever and I’ve finally find “the one” here. Usually sunscreens sit on my face and cause pilling, or they leave a sticky residue that makes it hard to apply makeup over them. But the silk sunscreen absorbs nicely, doesn’t cause pilling, doesn’t feel like an extra layer on my face, and doesn’t leave me super shiny. The one thing I didn’t realize when purchasing is that the sunscreen is tinted. Some people may not like this (it’s a lighter color) but for me that just makes it better because I don’t wear a full face of makeup during on weekdays, and it’s nice to have a gentle base. This is 100% worth that price point in my opinion. Best mineral sunscreen out there
