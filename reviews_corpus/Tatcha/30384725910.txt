Well worth the cost! A little goes a long way and lasts awhile. I’ve never been able to find a creamy moisturiser that didn’t make me break out, until this one.  My skin is so happy! I use it just for overnight and wake up with the softest bright skin. Thanks to Sephora for offering this as the birthday gift for June! Worth the splurge!
