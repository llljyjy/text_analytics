Absolutely love this primer. I first purchased the one that is more of a cream and then purchased this liquid version and I’m sold. Bought my second bottle last week and I’m still as in love with it as ever. The scent is light and fruity and the matte-like effect is so pleasing and non drying. Very happy with the product. My favourite primer for sure
