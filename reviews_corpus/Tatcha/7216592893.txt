I have been using it for couple weeks. First of all what I noticed from day one is the horrible smell which if you put a little bit of it on lips or close to nose it gives me really terrible taste in my mouth. I dont understand why is it but its really weird. Second minus is that it gave me new acnes. Third, I dont like the formula, its watery but greasy. I was trying very hard to like it but I am giving up.. bad smell, acneâ€¦
