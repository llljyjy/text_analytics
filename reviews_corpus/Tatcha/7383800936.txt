I was looking for a new makeup remover since the makeup wipes I was using were not getting all my makeup off and made me break-out, but THIS, this has to be hands down one of the best products Iâ€™ve ever used in my life! It took all my makeup off, even eyeliner and mascara (I use the Fenty Flyliner), and my skin felt SO silky smooth afterwards! JUST BUY IT!!
