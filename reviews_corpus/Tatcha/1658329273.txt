I’ve been pretty loyal to Supergoop’s Unseen Sunscreen but I read so many great reviews about Tatcha’s The Silk Sunscreen that I wanted to give it a try.  I liked it enough the first time that I bought a second bottle.  It doesn’t leave a white cast, feel heavy on my skin or cause breakouts.  However, I have experienced some pilling when layering with certain facial products and the packaging is awful.  The purple peels off, sticks to your hands and gets all over your face.  I’m not sure I’ll be buying it again. nan
