I’ve used both the Deep Cleanse and the Rice Wash and I was expecting to live this one more than the Rice Wash since I have oily combo skin but I tend to reach for the Rice one instead. Don’t get me wrong it’s a good cleanser but the texture is too thin and runny and I went through it quickly within a month of using it twice a day. Overall, a good cleanser but I will purchase the Rice Wash next time! Gentle yet effective but pricey
