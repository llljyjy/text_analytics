So I always wanted to try this so I redeemed my birthday gift early so i could get the sample set. I really enjoyed the face wash and this cream but when I purchased the full size of both, thatâ€™s when I started to have issues. The face wash is fine but the Dewey skin cream is a whole other story. the sample set one felt more creamy and made my skin feel really hydrated and it would last throughout the day, I also would have no reaction. Once I got the full size it felt a little thinner than what the sample size felt like (creamy) , and when I put it on after washing my face with the rice wash face cleanser or my clinique acne wash, it made my skin feel itchy and not as hydrated as it should be, along with it felt irritated and within a few hours my skin was incredibly oily. My skin also seems to dry out overnight when i wake up in the morning after using it. Will be returning. I wish it worked out better. Ill be sticking to my shiseido benifiance cream Sample worked well.... Full size not so much.
