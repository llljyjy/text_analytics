This was #gifted by Tatcha for my honest review. I’m a daily sunscreen user & lover of Korean & Japanese sunscreens for their smooth finish & skincare ingredients. I have LOVED using this one - I feel that Tatcha really did their research and came up for the perfect product for sunscreen & makeup users (i.e., people who like to use sunscreen in addition to makeup, not sunscreen in their makeup only). This is the PERFECT sunscreen for using before makeup application; it acts as a primer as well, helping your makeup last longer & giving a lovely dewy (but not greasy) glow. Make sure to let it “dry down“ first before applying makeup. I find that I can use less makeup with this, as it does reduce redness & give a very sheer color correction. It is so lightweight & blends easily (it’s like a nano-physical sunscreen, if you’ve used the Sun Essence from Missha or the Airy Light sunscreen from Etude House you’ll be familiar). I love that it’s tinted so you can see where you’ve applied, & it doesn’t gunk up your hands. The bottle is flat & fits perfectly in a purse or pocket so you can reapply during the day. There’s no weird sunscreen smell. Overall, this is an excellent product. It’s a shame it’s so expensive; I would repurchase but maybe save for days when I’ll be wearing makeup. Or heck, just treat myself! This is one product I would spend the $$ on. They did it...perfect tinted sunscreen!
