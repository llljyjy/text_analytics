I’ve been wanting the kissu lip mask for awhile & when the plum blossom came out, I was super excited & got it. That’s as far as any good feelings towards it goes. I have NO IDEA why anyone left ANY good reviews about this stuff because the color is all it’s got going. It literally did NOT do what it says it will & does the opposite! It dried out my life-like using vaseline would even be better & the consistency isnt far off from it but what a disappointment& waste of money this one was. I don’t wear lipsticks but I’m a junkie for lip glosses, chapsticks, balms, slicks & oils...this is the worst I’ve tried in my life. Tinted vaseline lip balm is better than this!
