Used my normal morning products except used the Tatcha instead of my normal sunscreen.  My face looked great but after an hour, I noticed my face felt felt dry and tight. An unusual feeling for me as I have oily skin. I will try using it again but will be using more moisturizer prior to application of sunscreen. Might work better for me during the summer months. Will need to experiment
