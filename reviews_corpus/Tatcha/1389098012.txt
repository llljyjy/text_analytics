I was so excited to be able to finally try one of the most coveted and pricey moisturizers. The initial reaction was very luxurious. I liked its fragrance and texture, how it was absorbed in my skin, and the healthy glow it gave. My experience turned sour after a week of continously using it day and night. I ended up with breakouts all over my face (cheeks, under the nose and chin) and my skin is generally clear. I know this product was the culprit because it was the only product I replaced in my regular regimen. Returned. Tatcha Water Cream
