Love it, I use it with the Dewy Skin Cream Plumping & Hydrating Moisturizer and Violet-C Brightening Serum. My skin is normal but more to the dry side. It works great as is or with my makeup, I just set it with the Laura Mercier Translucent Powder if I apply concealer/foundation to avoid creases. Love It, Go Too
