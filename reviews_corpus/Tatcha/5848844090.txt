I like the product itself a lot, it stays on all night, isn’t sticky. It worked really well for me, more than the Laneige mask which caused rash-like dry patches on the edges of my lips (I have sensitive skin so maybe that’s why), but I really hate this packaging. It looks nice and cute when you first take it out of the box but then actually using it is an impractical hassle. Try opening this with moisturized hands or think about what it’s like to travel with (I’ve done these, it’s annoying, and it was dropped many times). I’d prefer if this came in a tube (it’s soft enough), and for the price, I’m not willing to buy my own tubes along with this just to make it easier to use. I have a drugstore lip balm for severely dry lips that comes in a squeeze tube and works just as well (purchased out of desperation, but unfortunately it’s not cruelty free or pretty looking). As much as I’d love to buy this again, I probably won’t unless they offer an alternative packaging option. So my lip mask/balm hunt continues. Two stars for the great formula, minus three for the combo price/packaging. Obnoxious Packaging
