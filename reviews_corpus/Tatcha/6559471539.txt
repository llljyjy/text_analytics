First and foremost Ive purchase this product with my own funds.  I’ve been using this product for about 2 months and I have emptied the bottle. This product blends into my skin complexion and easy to spread ( foundation shade is Aruba in Nars). It does a slight cast but once it melts into your skin it truly does fades. I had a few acne spots on my face and with the use of this products and actives (in my routine) it does prevent the acne spots from leaving any scars. It is very liquid like a serum so it does soak into skin pretty quickly compared other mineral sunscreens. It leaves a glow but not intensively or greasy like most mineral sunscreens.For price it is a good serum and accessible. However I am not prone to sunburns so for folks who are easily sunburn I don’t know how effective this product is. I’ve removed a star because the packing isn’t the best. It doesn’t stand on its own well. So far as In package flaking, I wrap my package with  clear tegaderm which prevents the flaking. It’s easy to travel with. It layers well under my NARs skin tint and other skin care products. Im not sure how it layers with heavier make up. I have no pilling products with my moisturizer and serums. Overall I think it’s a decent product and would be awesome if it was package differently.  For me it’s a hit. Hit or Miss
