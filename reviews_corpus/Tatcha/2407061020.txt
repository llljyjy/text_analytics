If you have super dry skin or its flaking or you’re going through chemotherapy like me: RUN don’t walk to get this. I was recommended this cream by a sephora employee and Im OBSESSED!!! because of chemo my skin has been extremely dry, but this has saved me, its worth every penny. Also a little goes a long way. If chemo got you dry this is for you!
