I have been loving the Tatcha line for oily skin, and I wasn’t quite sure what this was until I used it, and wow! It is unbelievably refreshing right after cleansing! Definitely go with the instructions to put some in your palms and then press on your face and neck after cleansing; if you put it on a cotton pad like a toner, you don’t get the same sensation. It’s hard to classify this product, but it really does make a difference, and moisturizer and serum seem to work more effectively after applying it. Skin feel smoother, too! One Word: Refreshing!
