I’m going to say right out of the gate if you plan on wearing this during the day look elsewhere. This is 100% a overnight lip mask that will repair chapped lips or keep them hydrated. I sleep with fans on my face year round and especially with wearing a mask during the day my lips can get pretty destroyed. I’m not going to exaggerate by saying this repaired my lips in one night but I will say it repaired them in two nights. The spatula is plastic but I really can’t complain because I don’t use it. I hear a lot of people complaining about the price of this product but then I go and find other companies that I will not name that are selling lip products for just as much if not more that do less. A little bit goes a long ways so definitely do not overdo it. This product has no scent or taste which is also a huge plus for me. Works great for what it is
