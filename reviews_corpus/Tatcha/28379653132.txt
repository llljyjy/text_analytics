This is my absolute favorite moisturizer of all time. It’s so soothing and calming. I have combination, leaning oily skin that’s super sensitive and prone to breakouts. This moisturizer not only feels like an absolute dream during application, but it never irritates my skin. Of course I wish it weren’t so pricey, but it’s 100% worth it. nan
