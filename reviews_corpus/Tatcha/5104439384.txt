This is one luxurious clay mask! Tatcha always has the most stunning packaging, and this one was no different. The mask has a grainy texture that provides some physical exfoliation. I mostly use this on my t zone as my cheek area is most sensitive so I prefer not to use a grainy texture there. My face felt so smooth after using this mask and the pores on my looked clearer. This was gifted to me by Tatcha for an honest review. nan
