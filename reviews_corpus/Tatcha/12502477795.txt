I’ve been using Too Faced Hangover Replenishing Face Primer for years, but I needed to try something new because my skin has changed significantly in the past year. It’s much dryer, which makes my lines a lot more noticeable with foundation. A Sephora consultant recommended a primer with dimethicone to help smooth out my lines and I had a sample of Tatcha Liquid Silk Canvas Primer to try. The texture is very light and silky smooth. My foundation applies beautifully over it, and I feel that my lines are less noticeable. I purchased the 0.35 oz. size and have been so pleased! I haven’t experienced any breakouts, irritation or other ill effects. My new go-to primer!
