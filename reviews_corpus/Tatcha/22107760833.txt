It’s so worth it. I have dry skin. Very dry that my nose peels sadly :/. I had this product a year ago and loved it but ran out and tried other products but they didn’t help. I recently bought it again and my nose is not peeling and my whole face is just healthier in general. I love it even tho it’s pricey :) Buy it
