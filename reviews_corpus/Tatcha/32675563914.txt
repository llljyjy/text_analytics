Listen. I love buying useless things and I love splurging. And this works so well for me you’d think I’d have no problem repurchasing something so useful but I really do. Does it smell amazing? Yup. Does it moisturize my dry skin just the right amount without drenching me in grease? Yup. Does it pill and look icky over other products? Nope. Does it prevent bumpy forehead acne unlike other moisturizers? Yes it does. Does it make my skin brighter? For sure. But the price man!!!!!!!!!! I have really expensive serums and essences but for whatever reason I cannot justify buying this again. I use a moisturizer from Avene now and even that isn’t crazy cheap but I just cannot justify spending this much on this cream. Would I recommend the product itself? Yes I would. Price Hurts My Soul
