I have textured, sensitive, combo (oily leaning), dehydrated skin with dark marks and large pores on my nose. I’ve used this cream morning and night for exactly 2 weeks and can visibly see a difference in my skin texture (smoother, pores appear smaller) and my dark marks are slightly fading. I use a sunscreen that mattifies my face so I’m not too oily by the end of an 8 hr work day but my face is left a bit oily looking after my night time routine when it’s applied directly to a freshly washed and toned face. However, with my skin concerns and usually immediately breaking out with milia when moisturizers settle “oily“ on me, I’ve had absolutely no adverse reactions to this cream and again- my skin has actually improved all around in a short time. A light hand works best and it spreads FAR. Definitely a new staple for me. I See A Difference In Texture
