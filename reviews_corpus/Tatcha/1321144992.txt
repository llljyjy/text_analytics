This mask is incredible! It’s pretty much replaced all of my lip products for all day wear. I use a little less product during the day and then layer it up at night. My lips are smoother and I have fewer dry skin cracks. My only wish was that the product design itself somehow incorporated the applicator, but it’s not a huge deal. I just keep it it a small bag next to the jar on my counter. nan
