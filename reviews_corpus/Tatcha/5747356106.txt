I’ve tried numerous mineral sunscreens and have had no luck in finding one that does not pill on my dry skin as you rub it in and cling to dry patches. This product is the only one I’ve tried that does not!! I’m so happy I finally decided to purchase. I do think the heavy price tag is worth the application and glowing finish it provides, however, I would expect for $60 that the packaging would be a little more luxurious than just a plastic component. Good for dry skin!!!
