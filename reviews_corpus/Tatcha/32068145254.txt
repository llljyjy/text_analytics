Bought this recently because of the innovative technology of serum in cream treatment. I needed an overnight treatment and had the perception that it would be rather be hydrating to the skin then moisturizing.But it feels more like a silicone based moisturizer. Packageing is 10/10, no powerful smell and moisturizer. However, itâ€™s too early tomake any assumptions regarding its improvement on my skin or not. nan
