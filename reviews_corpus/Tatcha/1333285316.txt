If you’re like me, you take your skincare routine seriously, but still have some nights where you’re too tired to go through the full routine. Enter the serum stick! I swipe it on my cheeks and around my eyes when I’m feeling exhausted (I’ve got a toddler) and I still feel like I’ve taken care of my skin and not abandoned her :) This is also great for traveling or to keep in your purse! Great skincare on the go! nan
