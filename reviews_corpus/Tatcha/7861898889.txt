Love this product so much!!! I got a sample one (very small size) and tried it to see the hype and it didn’t disappoint. I dont usually buy from tatcha cause it’s a bit expensive for me but I just fell in love with this product and caved in to buy the regular size. Unlike other moisturizer (cerave - i still love this too), it doesnt give me that greasy feeling after long hours, considering I have very oily skin. I also used this while I was in Mexico and the weather was hot but it surely did its magic. My skin felt more hydrated without feeling too greasy. The best part is it absorbs quickly and blends well with my makeup. I could definitely say that I found a moisturizer that works for me very well. Love it!!!!
