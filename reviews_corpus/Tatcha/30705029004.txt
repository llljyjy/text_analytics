I have dry skin and this worked wonders for me but now it seems as though the formula changed or maybe the other person that thinks it changed and I got the same batch and it wasn’t mixed properly? I’m not sure, I just opened my new one and it isn’t nearly as moisturizing as it usually is and i’ve been using it for years. I’m not sure what to do, i’m just hoping my skin will tolerate this batch because i’d hate to scrap it. Not sure if i should just find a new moisturizer or try to add an essence or serum to my routine now... I guess time will tell. Formula Change???
