This is everything I would want in a moisturizer - heavenly soft and REALLY plumping, keeps skin feeling perfect for probably 24 hours if I left it long enough, smells divine, has a great list of ingredients for dry skin, AND you barely need a small dot to cover the whole face.The issue: I just hate how expensive it is, but I will definitely give up and buy it as soon as it runs out. I will miss the feeling too much. Curses, in the best way, Tatcha, you absolutely live up to the hype. Amazing, best feeling cream
