I generally don’t go for items this pricey, but I got this as a gift and I plan to rebuy it as soon as I run out. It is my new favorite moisturizer. It is truly unlike anything I’ve ever tried. The texture is the perfect gel/cream balance, and it’s unbelievably soothing both going on and in how it treats the skin. It’s soft and doesn’t leave any sticky residue, and works well both over serums and under oils. It’s a miracle product when my skin is hypersensitive or I just need a skin reboot. I really cannot say enough good things about it. My only thing is the packaging, other tatcha creams come with a little hook for the spatula to rest in, but this one doesn’t for some reason, so it’s basically impossible for it to stay together with the tub. I feel like for this price they could add a magnet or little stand. But the product itself is incredible! Best moisturizer ever
