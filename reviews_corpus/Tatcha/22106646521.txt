I received a mini bottle as my birthday gift and wow this is unbelievably good. As soon as I used it I knew I would be buying it. It makes the face feel so good, and my skin looks significantly better after I use it. One of the cleansers that makes you wake up with less “problematic” skin.Bear in mind: I’ve been using Dr kart cicapair cleanser for the past year and this is the first cleanser that i think it is worth switching to! nan
