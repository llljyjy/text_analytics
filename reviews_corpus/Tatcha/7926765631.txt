Awesome sunscreen.  I often wished that the silk primer had sunscreen and although this doesnâ€™t say primer, I can swear works just the same plus added benefit of spf.  It is light weight, no cast, sinks in, dries to a matte finish, and works just as good alone. Highly recommend. light weight and great under makeup!! :-)
