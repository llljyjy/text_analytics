LOVE this product. So creamy and moisturizing, but not greasy. Nice light scent that doesn’t linger. I am very sensitive to fragrances and this one doesn’t bother me at all. I got the Tatcha bday gift set a few days ago. Used the face cream 2x and went and purchased the value size container. Beautiful Product and Packaging
