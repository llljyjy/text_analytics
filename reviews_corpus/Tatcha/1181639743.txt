This is actually a decent primer. I usually never use primers because I find they get weirdly tacky and don’t layer well over SPF. If they made an SPF primer, that would be ideal but nobody has made it there yet. This one actually layers over SPF well and does not end up being too sticky or having a weird texture. I only knocked off a star because it’s expensive and I still am not convinced primer is necessary. But I think if I were to invest in any primer, it would be this one. Best primer I've tried.
