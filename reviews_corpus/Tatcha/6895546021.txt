I bought the travel sized kit that came with this cleaner, the dewy serum and the dewy cream. I have super dry skin, especially in the winter months, and these 3 products did wonders for how my skin looked and felt. Once I ran out, I bought some cheaper products because ngl, this stuff is expensive. However, the cheaper stuff I got made me break out badly so I invested in this and the other tat ha products. Well worth it in my eyes! Must Have!
