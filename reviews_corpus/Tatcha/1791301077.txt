Well I didn’t want to love this, but it finally won me over & it’s totally worth the hype. I received this & the Tatcha Cleanser from Sephora as my birthday gift. This is an incredibly lovely moisturizer! I love the beautiful healthy skin appearance this gives. I have very dull dry skin, I’m 45, use Retin-A & live in a dry climate. This product makes my skin look & feel great! Worth the Hype!
