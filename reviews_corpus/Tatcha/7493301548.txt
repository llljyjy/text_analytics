got the sample size in october with my birthday gift set and oh my gosh i’ve never tried a better moisturizer in my life. i have insanely dry skin all year round, and usually have to moisturize multiple times a day to stop my skin from feeling so tight… but after trying this, i only use it once a day before bed and my skin feels amazing the next day. i also love how you barely need to use any product cause it spreads so easily. (a little goes a long way).i noticed a lot of other reviews said it’s too greasy, and yes, it does go on pretty greasy but because i have such dry skin it soaks in completely within 30 minutes. so would probably only recommend if you have really really dry skin. especially for the winter months !! i already know this is gonna be a forever product for me. a must have if you have really dry skin!!
