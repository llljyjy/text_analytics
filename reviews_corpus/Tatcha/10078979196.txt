I have purchased multiple bottles of this product at the exorbitant $88 price point because the serum is effective. However, the packaging is wasteful and designed to gouge customers even more than we already get gouged buying premium products. You have no idea how much is left in the bottle and the pump splashes liquid everywhere. I might get 2-3 weeks of use from an $88 product. I’m done with tatcha now and i’ll go back to using separate lactic acid and vitamin c products instead of this crap Wasteful packaging ensures product is wasted
