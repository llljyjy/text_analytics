Haven’t really been a fan of the whole dewy skin trend. To me, it looks oily and greasy, and not radiant and hydrated like I think people are trying to go for. (I realize this is a dewy moisturizer, but I love Tatcha and this was included in the free Beauty Insider birthday gift I chose this year.) This is exactly what happens with this moisturizer: I look greasy and oily, but have more dry than oily skin. I feel like I have to rub it in a few times after I applied, like a bad body lotion. I was afraid it would break me out with how heavy it feels, but it hasn’t. Those with oily skin, I would stay away. "Dewy" = Greasy
