Now I am aware this is expensive. I let my mind go down the rabbit hole of “it’s only on my face temporarily…can I find a cheaper alternative?” I tried some other options that were cheaper (Peach & Lily oil cleanser, etc.) and didn’t have fragrance listed as an ingredient…and I began getting clogged pores and small pimples in locations I never do. For whatever reason my skin just loves this. I also appreciate the consistency of the oil. Other oils made me feel as though I was dragging my skin around. This just lets your hands glide around removing that first layer of debris from your face so you can go in with your real cleanser. My skin is very sensitive and a bit acne prone so for my specific situation, i’d rather bite the bullet and repurchase this instead of trying out cheaper alternatives only to wreak havoc on my skin. The oil just feels so nice and light on the skin too. Others felt heavier and made me question immediately whether breakouts would ensue. 10/10 from me! Yes from Me
