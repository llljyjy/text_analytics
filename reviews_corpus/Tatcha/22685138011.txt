An incredible mask that only requires three minutes on your face? Count me in! This mask smells amazing but is not too overpowering, feels substantial but not too thick on the face, and makes my skin look smoother and clearer immediately. This product was gifted by Tatcha in exchange for an honest review. My new favorite mask!
