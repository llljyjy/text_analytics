One of the best moisturizer I have tried. It is prefect if you have very dry skin and sensitive. I can see the plumpness in my skin after using it. It has also helped the redness and itchy that sometimes appears. Very relieving. It has not pill for me when using makeup as others have mentioned. A little goes a long way. Perfect for dry skin. Plump skin.
