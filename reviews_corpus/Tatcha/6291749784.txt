I used to live in Southern ON, and used Dr. Jart’s Ceramidin Moisturizer. However, when I moved to SK, my skin was so dull and dry because it’s so dry out here. Although pricey, it’s so worth it, my skin is nicely highly hydrated without feeling like it’s too heavy! I love this and highly recommend it. Remember that a little goes a long way!
