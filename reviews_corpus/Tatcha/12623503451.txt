I had some pretty high expectations for this product as I love the brand, but this didn’t turn out to be as moisturizing as I thought it would be. I honestly think the Tatcha Gold Spun lip balm does a better job. I would buy the lip balm again for sure as it’s moisturizing and lasts, but not this. This didn’t dry my lips out but it didn’t improve them either. nan
