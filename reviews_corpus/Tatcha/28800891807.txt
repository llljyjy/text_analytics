i have used this product for about 9 months now, and i have to say it is definitely worth the money. i finished the sample size container in about 1-2 months, and am halfway done the regular sized container, which is being used once or twice a day for 7-8 months. itâ€™s still not empty yet and gives me super hydrated skin. worth the money for dry skin!
