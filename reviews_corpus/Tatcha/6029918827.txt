Like a lot of people I thought this was yet snother overhyped product so I never even considered trying it. I was an option for this tears birthday gift from sephora, so I opted to try it. To my surprise it works magnificently. I have very dry skin all year round, and this moisturizes so well. I always trying new moisturizers in hopes to find one that works for my skin, and this is it, my holy grail. I don’t think this is a great option for oily or even combination skin, but for dry skin it’s perfect. Lives up to the hype
