I purchased this moisturizer over a year ago and loved it SO much. Smelled good, felt luxurious, and really moisturized my skin. I decided to buy it again about two months ago because other, more affordable moisturizers weren’t getting the job done like this one did. The second time around, this product no longer worked for me. It doesn’t sink into the skin and pills on my face (which is my #1 skincare peeve). I can no longer put makeup on top of this moisturizer without my makeup looking like a hot mess and rolling off my face. Not sure if the formula changed, but I will not be repurchasing. I think Tatcha’s Water Cream is a much better option! New Formula?
