I knocked one star off for the fragrance, it’s pleasant and not an overwhelming, lavender smell and it does dissipate after application. This is a thick, light purple colored, cream. I have repurchased twice now, I do really enjoy it, it is very hydrating and I have never experienced any negative side effects. This is actually one of the few heavier creams that I can use daily without breaking out. I avoided Tatcha products for the longest time, the price and reviews stating they weren’t great considering the price. There is something about them, they give a noticeable hydration and glow to the skin. I don’t need to apply much of this cream, the jar always lasts a very long time. I have been using Tatcha moisturizers and Drunk Elephant F Balm for almost a year now, I can honestly say that my skin has never looked better. Definitely worth the investment
