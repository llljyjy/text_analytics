I got mine as a birthday gift like many others, I LOVE the way it feels on my skin, the way it smells, and the way it makes my skin feel clean after using. HOWEVER, it broke my skin out SO bad. I do normally have acne here and there but nothing like what I have after using this cleanerâ€¦ :( so sad because I want to love it!! I want to love it but..
