Love!! If you have dyhrated skin or dry skin, youll love this and the finish, it soaks in but also leaves you glowy and skin plump during makeup routine. I wouldnt reccomend for oily/combo skin, it gives you that “greasy/glazed donut” feel! Only reason I knocked off a star is because the ingredients arent the best for you, and the cost of this cream. yes
