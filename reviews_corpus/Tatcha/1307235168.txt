WOW.  I asked for a sample of this at Sephora based on the great reviews.  After using it for one night I was shocked at how amazing my faced looked in the morning.  I never realized how much redness I had until I saw how much paler my face looked in the morning.  The texture of my skin looked like glass and the existing pimples I had significantly reduced in sized and looked lighter.  I wish I had taken a before and after.  I immediately when to the store the next day and bought a bottle.  I’ve been using it for a few days now and my skin keeps looking better.  The best part is that my face is very oily and I noticed that it minimizes the shine and oil production of my skin.  So good!  I can’t wait to see how my skin looks in a month. Wow.  Made my skin looked refined overnight
