I have acne prone skin that tends to get clogged pores easily due to excess sebum on my skin. As a result, I love doing clay masks that can help draw out the oil/sebum to leave my skin feeling fresher and to help prevent further acne. This mask has been amazing on helping to keep my skin clear and allowing my makeup to sit on my skin without as much oil build up throughout the day. Def a must try product! This product was complimentary from Tatcha but does not impact my opinions. Great for acne prone skin!
