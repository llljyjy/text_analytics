I agree with all the other reviews here. The product itself is solid, but this is truly the worst packaging in the world. The product drips and leaks like CRAZY, and given the cost of the product, girl I wanna cry at how wasteful it is. I will literally leave the product sitting up for two seconds while I apply it and it starts gushing out product like an active volcano :( Please Tatcha, read this product feedback and make changes the packaging ASAP. I initially thought I had a defective one but itâ€™s clear that this is happening to everyone. Idk how this passed QC tests! This packaging makes me wanna cry
