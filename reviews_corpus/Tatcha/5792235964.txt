I’ll start with saying I’ve struggled with oily and sensitive skin for almost 20 years now.  It’s taken me so long to find a moisturizer that doesn’t clog my pores or even over dry my skin. I then initially received this as a free product and am sooo grateful I did. I’ve finally found a something that makes my skin feel and look smooth. Would give it 10 stars if I could. My only one complaint would be the price cuz times are tough lol but so worth it LOVE
