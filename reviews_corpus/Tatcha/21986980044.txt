I have extremely dry skin and have never loved a moisturizer more than this. It’s creamy, soft, and dewy but not greasy - my only regret ifs not having this years ago. I turned 60 this year and absolutely love what this does for my face.  It’s the perfect followup to the rice cleanser! I received a sample size as a birthday gift and just purchased the large size.  I intend to use this for many years to come! Best Moisturizer of All Time
