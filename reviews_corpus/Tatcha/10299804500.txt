the best moisturizer ever. leaves your skin GLOWING. it isn’t sticky and it smells so good. the scent isn’t too strong and the product isn’t too thick or too watery. been using the mini ones (and those last sooo long) finally decided to get the big one. also the packaging is so pretttty. love love love
