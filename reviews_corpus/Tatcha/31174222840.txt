I wanted to like this, but I couldn’t. The applicator is terrible. You shake it up and open it and product is spilling everywhere— lots of waste. It does not do a good job of hydrating my dry skin as it claims. It does give a beautiful glow, but not worth it given the other issues, especially for this price. I’ll stick to the laneige sunscreen. nan
