Gifted by Tatcha. Iâ€™ve always heard amazing things about Tatcha and I was so excited to try out this mask! I love doing masks on a weekly basis as I feel like it gives my skin a fresh start for the week and gives me an excuse to have a self-care day. It was easy to apply and my skin felt a lot softer afterwards! Must try!
