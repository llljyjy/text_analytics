Don’t get me wrong. I love the formula of this product. Please don’t change it. It literally blurs my face and keeps it smooth all day long. Love the way it feels and honestly helped my acne as well. Only negative is the packaging. It does peel after a few weeks and for how expensive it is it shouldn’t be doing that. The purple shavings do end up on the face if you’re not careful. Other than that great product, but change the packaging!! nan
