I remember the reason I got hooked onto this was when I purchased products from the tatcha website and they sent me samples of each kind of rice powder. I loved the gentle and classic the most and just decided to go with the classic. I have to say this cleanser is AMAZING. It’s not like your typical exfoliant, this helps get rid of dead skin with enzymes. It’s NOT like a scrub. For me personally, I am able to use this product daily after I remove my makeup and I use a very small amount to lather and cleanse with. Over the course of a few weeks I noticed my small breakouts I would get started to disappear, and people would compliment my skin frequently when I switched to this product. I love the smell, I love the results, and it’s honestly been lasting me MONTHS of use. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND you only put up the spout a tiny bit, not all the way up so you get a small amount of product dispensed. I usually get my hands wet first before pouring the product and lather with a little water before using it on my face. This is honestly my new holly grail skincare product and I can’t see myself without it. I have dry skin btw if that helps for reference! absolute FAVORITE cleanser
