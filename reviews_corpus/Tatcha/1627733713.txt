I’ve been using this product since it launched and after trying what felt like a hundred different cleansers, I finally found my holy grail. This cream cleanser foams into a gentle wash with a very, very fine grain to it, doesn’t strip your skin, and is a perfect cleanser for those with dry, sensitive skin like mine. I will never ever use another face wash!
