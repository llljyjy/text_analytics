I’ve been using this for about a week now, and I think I will continue to use it until the product runs out. Unsure if I will repurchase or not yet. Overall, the cream has a light fragrance, and it super thin. Soaks into the skin, goes on like water. I’ll tell you this gel-like cream will be amazing for oily skin, and I can use it as a daytime moisturizer before I apply my makeup. During the winter months especially I have combination skin. My T-zone stays oily but I’ll have dry flaky patches on the sides of my nostrils and sometimes on my cheeks. I apply this product and within 10 minutes my dry patches are already back. When we move into the summertime and my skin starts to heal itself and become more oily; it’s possible this product might become a holy grail. However currently, it’s simply okay. Great for daytime, a little pricey.
