I’ve been using this moisturizer for two months now and I’ve noticed the improvements to my skin recently. I use this moisturizer after the Tatcha rice wash cleanser but only have been using these at night. it doesn’t feel like it sits on top of my skin and it’s very breathable. I’ve noticed my skin is smoother now and it feels more elastic in a way, like it feels fuller when I touch my face (I guess that’s the plumping part of the name). I justified the price point of this product as a “treat myself” purchase, sometimes just having something with the label “luxury” helps with actually using the products and having a better routine for myself, but in the end I feel it’s very much worth the price. For as little as I use each night, I imagine this will last me a long time and it seems to have really turned my skin around. If you want to treat yourself, this is it!
