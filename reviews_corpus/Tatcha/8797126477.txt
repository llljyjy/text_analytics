$60 for a tube that peels off after contact with the sunscreen itself, really? Unhappy about it, I see a lot of people say the same. As for the sunscreen itself - it’s nice overall, however, it stings my eyes like chemical sunscreens do. And this is a mineral sunscreen, so it’s weird. I assume I’m sensitive to at least one of the ingredients. It doesn’t peel off and feels okay on the skin. It sort of sits on top as a layer, and can be moved easily. I expected more from Tatcha and at this price. Not worth the price
