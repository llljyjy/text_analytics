If I could give this 0 stars I would, I had super high expectations for this giving its a reputable brand and has super high rating. Typically I have acne prone skin, but with washing my face everyday I usually have little to no breakouts. I used the moisturizer with no problem, and started using the face wash and instantly had an insane breakout, and I even gave it a few days to clear up and it still continues to worsen. Seriously my face looked as if it was covered in hives, and I had terrible underground pimples that I never have had before. I washed my face with a different face wash the night after and it all basically disappeared overnight. I really don’t recommend this if you are prone to acne, don’t let the reviews fool you like they did me! Horrible for Acne Prone skin
