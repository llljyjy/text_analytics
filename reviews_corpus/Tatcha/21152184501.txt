I got this in the September birthday set and really wanted to love it, but it unfortunately broke my skin out so badly. I don’t have sensitive skin, but after just a few uses my skin broke out in cystic pimples and whiteheads. It does give the skin a beautiful dewy look while on the face, but it’s not worth the horrible breakout it caused me. Broke me out so badly
