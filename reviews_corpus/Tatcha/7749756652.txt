I got this as a sample for my birthday gift a year or so ago but never used it.  Packed it for vacation recently and one night I was so lazy to take my makeup off I just used this on my face. Washed twice and all my makeup was gone! Tried it again the next night and same results! Iâ€™ll definitely be purchasing the full size. It has little beads but not a lot. Might irritate you if you have sensitive skin. Worth the money
