This is a nice beauty oil and the flecks of gold makes you feel special when you use it but I can’t justify the price tag of it. I used it at night after I washed and under my moisturizer. I tried it alone and it made my face look oily but feel dry. It looks nice on my dresser but I don’t think that I will be repurchasing this item again in the future. Looks pretty but that's it
