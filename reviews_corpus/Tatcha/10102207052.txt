This was offered as one of this months birthday gifts and I’m so glad I picked it!!! I have combo/oily skin and I’ve been using this in the morning and I love how my skin is feeling!! Feels nice and smooth and clean. I def want to buy the full sized one when I run out. And a little goes a long way with this- you only need about a pee sized amount for the whole face Loving so far!!!
