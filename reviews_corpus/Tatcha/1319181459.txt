Ohhh my goodness, such a love for this. I have re-purchased this at least 6 times so far. It’s so expensive but Ive learned I just can’t live without it. I’ve tried every other product in relation to makeup setting, pore refining, moisture mist, and just plain amazing hydration. Nothing compares, trust me. I’ve tried maybe a dozen and nothing works better in this dry CO climate! Please don’t change anything about this product! nan
