I received this as my free birthday gift, and I’m sooo happy with it. I have sensitive, acne prone skin, and use a handful of prescribed acne medications that can be very drying - especially around my mouth. I don’t put acne medication around my mouth, but for some reason the area is ALWAYS always dry and scaly. I’ve tried many moisturizers that don’t give the area enough moisture, and my skin continues to be dry and peeling throughout the day. I received this product in the mail, and tried it the next day. Instantly happy. The product is a little thick, and leaves a glowy residue. Putting this product on my face is the the first time in years that my mouth is actually moisturized. I used to spend hours picking at the dry skin before going out, and being depressed over the dry skin around my mouth. This product has save me so much time, and has dramatically improved the moisture barrier around my mouth. I can now go out without worrying about my mouth cracking, and showing off embarrassing dry skin. Once the sample runs out, I will be rebuying (: A MUST HAVE for super dry skin.
