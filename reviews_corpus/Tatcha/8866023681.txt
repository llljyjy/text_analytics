I never ever thought I would love a tatcha cleanser but here I am. I have oily-combo acne prone skin so I need something that wonâ€™t cause breakouts but also keeps my skin balanced. This does the trick! I use this daily at night, I precleanse with the inkey list oat cleansing balm and then use this and it works wonders. It has a spa fragrance to it so beware if you are sensitive to fragrance. I just got the full size after using the mini, a little goes a long way so definitely worth the price. I am really impressed! my acne prone skin loves this!
