This is a really nice cleanser. It feels good on the skin, lathers to a nice creamy texture, and rinses off easily. Leaves my skin feeling silky soft without causing redness or breakouts. Product is advertised for dry skin but I have oily skin and still had good results with this cleanser. However, I feel like there are a lot of other cleansers that are equally good and less expensive so I probably won’t purchase the full size. I’m still glad I got to try it as part of my birthday gift set this year, though. Good but not $50 good
