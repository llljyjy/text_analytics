I selected the Tatcha dewy cream as the bday gift this year and I feel in love. However given that is summer I decided to buy the water cream since I tent to be more oily during this time of year. Boy was I disappointed, This cream cause a horrible breakouts not to mention it made me so oily I could cook an egg on my face. After a month of hoping and trying I decided to return it and try to save what’s left of my face ☹️ HARD PASS
