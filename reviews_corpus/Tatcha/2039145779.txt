Used this product for the first time this morning.  I was genuinely excited. My excitement wained after I followed the directions to shake well before use to discover the product spewing out of the bottle.  I was not going to waste any of the spewed product so I used more than I needed with first application,  essentially wasting some for another application.  It is a silky, colored serum like product that applied nicely on my face.  Slight initial stinging around my eyes that quickly dissipated.  For my next use,  I am just going to put some in my hands and stir with my finger next time to avoid spewing. Will most likely not purchase again due to cost and lack of effective application/ longevity of product. Meh product,  better it there
