I like that this is lightweight and water based. The fragrance smells good, but will prob be too strong for many. It’s a decent moisturizer for the day time, it’s been good to layer underneath my make up. The little spoon is also soooo Ed ya and unnecessary. Decent product, but I think it’s overpriced for what it is. Going to finish what I have, it won’t be a repurchase. Decent but Overpriced
