bought this the day I heard it came out, and it has not disappointed. been using about 2 weeks now. I have some rough texture on the sides of my face, from my temples down an inch. this has definitely made a visible improvement to that area. I also have uneven skintone with lots of redness on my cheeks and chin, and ive noticed that has calmed down a little as well. I use it right after cleansing and before my tatcha essence. love. it.
