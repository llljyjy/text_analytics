I cannot imagine using this daily. Once a week is plenty for my oily and somewhat sensitive skin. That said, this is the only cleansing powder I’ve ever really liked and only the second physical exfoliant I’ve ever been able to use regularly. I like it’s lack of fragrance and ease of use. Agree with the other reviewers that the dispenser is hard to control and spills product. Also, the shiny, bright plastic looks a bit cheesy at this price point. I think this is worth the investment if you like physical exfoliants (or don’t like chemical ones), and your skin isn’t super sensitive. Other than the removal of minor flakiness, I see no benefit to this, but wouldn’t expect to since I’m only using it weekly. nan
