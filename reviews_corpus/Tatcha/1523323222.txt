This is a great mask for my skin.  I have combination/ oily skin. This mask left my skin smooth and soft. I noticed it helped clear breakouts when I had them and used the mask. After using this mask my face was less oily and it was slightly tighter but my skin did not have that dry tight feeling. I love watching the mama change color. As the mask is massaged in, the color shifts from sage green to soft red which I like kinda tells you when youâ€™ve massaged it in enough. Great for combo/oily skin
