My skin has been so itchy lately. The itchiness is especially bad on my chest and lower stomach area. I tried this kit and it has really helped. My skin is no longer itchy and actually feels hydrated and smooth. I would definitely recommend this to otherâ€™s who are suffering from itchy eczema skin. nan
