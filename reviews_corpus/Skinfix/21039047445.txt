With a beautiful lightweight creamy texture, this gel cream gently hydrates and moisturizes my skin.  It is fragrance free and made without harmful ingredients, which makes it safe for sensitive skin like mine.  Since my skin is so dry, I prefer a cream with a heavier density for the cold months, while then, I will keep using it daily, it is still working well now during the fall. nan
