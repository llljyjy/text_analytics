I don’t break out super often, but when I do, I get the large painful pimples that benefit from a spot treatment in addition to pimple patches. This product is a great one! It’s a step up from the typical 2% salicylic acid product you could get from the drugstore.  It’s worked well to keep my pimples from getting larger/more inflamed and to reduce size over the course of a few days. For the size of the tube itself, this is rather expensive though - so even though I think the product is good and I recommend it, YMMV on whether you think it’s worth the $30 or not! Good product, but expensive for what it is
