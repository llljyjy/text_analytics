I’ve been using this as my primary cleanser in my morning and night skincare routines for the past two weeks, and I really love it so far! I haven’t had any major hormone blemishes,  and it leaves my face feeling refreshed, deeply clean & bright! My partner has enjoyed using it as well and hasn’t experienced any breakouts. nan
