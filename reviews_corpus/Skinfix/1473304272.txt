This is one of the best facewashes I’ve ever used. It feels like silk going on and your skin feels super clean, but not stripped of moisture. I’ve been suffering form Perioral Dermatitis for years and this is the first face was I’ve used that didn’t leave my skin feeling dry. I’ve used EVERYTHING from prescription sulfur washes (yuck) to Cerave. Even if you don’t have sensitive skin I recommend this to protect the barrier of your skin. Life Changing!!!
