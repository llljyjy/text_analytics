I have been using the hand repair cream, targeted  body balm, and body wash for about a week now. I didn’t use the face balm, I don’t have eczema on my face. The body wash is ok but not hydrating enough for me.The hand lotion is good, it’s my favorite of the kit. It moisturizes my dry hands without leaving them greasy and it has a very mild scent which is good for me.The target body balm leaves my eczema spots dry, worst. It’s ok while it’s on the spots but once I wash off, not good.This kit is just not for me but it may be good for others.I have eczema on my fingers, My fingers are dry, flaky and itching. These products works while using but once washed off my fingers are back to the way it was before.The Not working for me
