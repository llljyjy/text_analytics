I’ve used this product for several months now and really like it. After cleansing I use a 1/4 of a pad in my face, neck and décolletage. A fourth of a pad you say! Yes! The pads are large, so I cut the circular pad into 4’s. The pads have plenty of product to go all the places I need them and I have so many more to use as they aren’t cheap. I often will use another 1/4 to do the tops of my hands and reapply to areas with some skin decoloration. I haven’t really noticed a difference with minimzing sun spots, but texture seems better as well as the reduction in redness and pore size. Keeps my face looking brighter. I don’t know if it is this product or the skin regime I’ve been using for the past 9 months, but I get compliments on my complexion frequently and I never use to…it’s not like I’m a youngster, so I have to be doing something right with product use. Worth the Money.
