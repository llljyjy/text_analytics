I love this stuff! This cream is for dry skin, but I have combination skin. Because I am on tretinoin, I occasionally have small dry patches. This, better than any other moisturizer [including Dr Jart’s Ceramidin (sp?) cream], corrects those within a day. Also, because I have a rather oily forehead, I don’t always put it within an inch or so of my hairline or I get really oily there. But that’s my only consideration when I’m putting this on my face at night. During the day I use a different moisturizer that isn’t quite as emollient. I am so happy I tried this stuff, which I did after watching a Doctorly episode on YouTube. I started out with the mini and almost immediately got the 3 oz size because I don’t want to be without it. Worth every penny! Love this stuff!
