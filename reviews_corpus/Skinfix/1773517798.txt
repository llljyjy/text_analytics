I was gifted the acne spot treatment,  I’m so thrilled to have it in my collection as I get bad hormonal breakouts which sometimes they take a long time to calm down And heal. I had gotten 2 breakouts and both painful, I applied the treatment on and around the area and within 1 night , pain went down by 2nd night you couldn’t really see it nor feel it. Definitely recommend it for anyone which deals with acne p.s. I only use 1x per day while fresh break out I’d also recommend waiting a minute or 2 before layering any other serum Magic Spot Treatment
