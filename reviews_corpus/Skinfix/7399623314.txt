Ok so I tried this for the first time, wore it before going to bed and I woke up and my pimple was completely flat!!! Like it crawled back into my skin and I’m so impressed. My skin was also super soft where the pimple used to be. I’m excited to keep using it whenever I have pimples pop up on my face. Not a big fan of the packaging, the part that unscrews takes a bit to twist back and sometimes it gets stuck and I have to unscrew and rescrew but the product inside makes it worth it! Excited to continue to use it
