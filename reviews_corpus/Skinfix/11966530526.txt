I am honestly so impressed by this cleanser. I have very stubborn acne on my forehead and cheeks so I have tried basically everything and this has slowly helped. It did take about a week and a half to notice a different but I am getting smaller bumps that go away faster! I would recommend this to anyone who regularly wears masks or who sees a lot of build up acne on their forehead/chin. nan
