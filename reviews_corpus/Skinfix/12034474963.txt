This cleanser is fine. No fragrance. Fine. BUT i feel like it was mid-advertised to me. I ordered an Azelaic acid + AHA/BHA Cleanser. I don’t know if that’s what I received because they slapped a sticker on top of that description on the bottle that states it is just a 2% BHA CLEANSER. Likely salicylic acid. That’s fine but what did I receive? Did I get the Azelaic acid cleanser or strictly a salicylic acid cleanser? This is mis-advertising and I would not have purchased if I knew they were slapping stickers on products saying it’s something it is not. And the worst part is I HAVE NO IDEA. The acne spot treatment is exactly the same. I ordered both and they both have had stickers slapped on top like the product inside did not reflect the packaging description and should be that way on the website. I feel like I did not receive what I was led to believe I had ordered. I added photos Very annoyed
