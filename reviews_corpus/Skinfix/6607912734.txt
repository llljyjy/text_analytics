I generally love skin fix products, but this one was just average. My skin typically responds very well to BHAs, but with this spot treatment, I noticed no observable difference overnight or over a few days. It might have minimized the growth of acne, but didn’t shrink it. I’m going to keep using this and see if it helps more over long periods of time. Fine
