I really enjoy this cleanser! Iâ€™ve been using it for a few days and like how it leaves my skin after using. I have more combination skin (leans oily in the summer) and I am acne prone so finding products that work for my skin is important. BHAs works very well for my acne so this will definitely continue to be in my daily rotation. nan
