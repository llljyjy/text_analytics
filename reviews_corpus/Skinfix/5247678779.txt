For most of my teenage years and early 20s, I had oily skin. Now being in my mid 20s, I noticed my skin has changed from being combo oily to dry/sensitive. The Kale cleanser from Youth to the People was my staple for years, and I wanted to give this cleanser a try because it seemed to be more hydrating for my skin type from how its formulated. After trying this just a couple times, I realized how the Kale Cleanser left my face feeling dry, whereas this cleanser leaves my skin feeling both clean and supple. I recommend this for anyone that has got dry sensitive skin! New Staple Facial Cleanser
