Yes, please!  This is great for removing dry skin.  My face is very combo and I get acne in the T zone and dry skin everywhere elseâ€¦It removes the old dead cells opening pores and peeling off any dry skin.  I use it like a mask for 1 suggestion of use on the product.  I apply after wash and toner and give it a few seconds to set.  I then rub the product on my face in small circles.  Whoa! Whoa!
