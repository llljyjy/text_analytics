This moisturizer is my favorite one I’ve ever tried, and I feel like I’ve tried it all! (Kiehls, La mer, skinceuticals, etc.) Perfect for normal to combination skin while actually still hydrating (sometimes I feel like gel creams are too light, and while not making me oily, not penetrating enough for significant hydration). Also as more of an added bonus, I have seborrheic dermatitis, and this is completely safe to use and hasn’t triggered any bumps whatsoever. I love that they specifically call it out because it’s hard to find a good moisturizer that doesn’t trigger that but is also still a good OTC option! I have been able to stop using any topics specifically for that. seborrheic dermatitis safe!
