This is such a great kit! It’s a nice size where you don’t feel like you’re going to buy it and worry about not liking it and having something you can’t use. It’s more than enough to find out if this set is good for you. I really like that this is such a gentle formula, I use it for myself and the cleanser I use occasionally on my daughter. Nearly no scent and hasn’t caused any issues. Plus it’s cruelty free, such a great thing!! nan
