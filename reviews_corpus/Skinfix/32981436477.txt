After using this cleanser for a few days, I can say it’s becoming one of my favorites. I’ve been looking to switch my skincare routine to all vegan products, so I decided to give this one a try. It makes my skin feel SO fresh & clean. My skin tends to get pretty oily by the end of the day, & i actually look forward to using this because of how clean it makes me feel. I don’t get much acne anymore besides the occasional hormonal acne, but I do have tons of scarring from when i was a teenager. This has already helped even out my skin tone & lighten those scars. Highly recommend for anyone with oily skin, acne, or acne scars. AMAZING cleanser
