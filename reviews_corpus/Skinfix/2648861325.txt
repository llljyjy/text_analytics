Over the holidays, my face broke out and I tried this product out. I can see a noticeable difference on my face. Particularly, that I didn’t see more pimple coming after starting using this product. This cleanser is not overly stripping either like some other acne cleanser. The texture is not too runny and foams up pretty great so it’s easy to ensure it doesn’t get into my eyes. Overall, a pretty good acne cleanser! Great Acne Cleanser
