This gentle cream has a nice hydrating formula but it doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. It doesn’t have an fragrance to it, which is great for sensitive skin types! The formula really seals in moisture and helps my skin look and feel healthier. It works beautifully under makeup and it really helps smooth out the texture of the skin. This moisturizer really helps increase my skin’s elasticity. Making it feel softer and bouncy. The niacinamide really helps refined my skin’s texture and minimizes pores over time. I love the lightweight gel-cream texture. This is a very soothing formula that is great for dry skin! I can’t recommend this cream enough! Deeply Hydrating and Refining
