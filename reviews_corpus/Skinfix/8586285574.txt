I was introduced to this Barrier+ Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream for the first time and just love how moisturizing the cream feels.  I apply 2 pumps twice a day and often on my neck to reduce the saggy look of my neck. Just see so much improvement and only been using for 2 weeks.  Skinfix was free for me to try for my honest review. nan
