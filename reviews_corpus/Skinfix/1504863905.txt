Love love love this. Was a lifesaver in the winter. I get extremely dry skin, and my skin would soak it up. Provided a natural glow once absorbed. And, have found it to be just as good now that the weather is getting warm. I’m combination skin, and it still is very absorbant, and does not leave me oily. Will continue to repurchase. And, love the pump feature so I don’t waste any product, and it is not messy. Love this.
