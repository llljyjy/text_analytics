This face cream is super hydrating. I’m in my late 30s with skin that has been very dry in the winter, like flaking and irritated and red. I used to have so much oil production that something like this would not have worked (can’t believe I miss those days now). Anyway, I use it morning and night after a vitamin c face oil and I really can’t say enough about how much I love it. Not sure I would want to use it in the summer yet but it has saved me in these frigid temps this winter! nan
