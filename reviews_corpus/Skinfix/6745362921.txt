This cleanser is targeted for oily acne prone skin, but I like BHA’s in my routine to combat my sebaceous filaments around my nose. That’s my problem area. It’s not a use once and get instant results, but after using it for 2 weeks, I have noticed a bit of a decrease in clogged pores in this area. I tend to see a lot of tiny black dots, but this has caused the black dots to appear slower. Before, I’d extract my pores every one to two weeks. With this product, even at two weeks I’m seeing less sebaceous filaments. A bonus to this product is the niacinamide and azelaic acid in the ingredient list. They’re both products I really enjoy incorporating into my current routine. Good for sebaceous filaments
