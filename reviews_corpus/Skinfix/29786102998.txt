I like this eczema care kit. There are four sizes in it, including eczema hands repair cream, targeted body balm, foaming oil body wash, and dermatitis face balm.  Easy to apply hand repair cream on my dry and rough skin hands. I used it twice daily and felt so smooth and comfortable on my skin. The scent of oil body wash is nice and helps clean and hydrate my skin. My favorite one is face balm. I applied it to spot and treat the skin eczema on my face. The same thing uses twice daily and felt very comfortable on my skin. I love this eczema care kit. I love this care kit!
