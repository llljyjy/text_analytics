I’ve had the most dry, rough, red and itchy eyelids for the past 2 years. Nothing I tried made any difference at all. I’ve been using this product for a week now and my eyelids are, so far, just about back to normal! I am so happy I found this and really recommend it. First product I've tried that actually works!
