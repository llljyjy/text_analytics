Great product! Has really helped with the dry patches on my face. I apply before bed and in the morning and have not found it to be too thick or heavy throughout the day.  As the weather warms up I could see myself using a lighter moisturizer in the AM and applying this one before bed though. Overall very happy and will repurchase in the future. Great product for dry skin
