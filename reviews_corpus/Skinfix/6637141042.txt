Iâ€™ve been looking for a new Serum that also has Collagen  in it and I absolutely love this one! First of all it is very soothing and moisturizing on the skin. I use it as a base before I apply makeup and the makeup glides on smoothly and nice! I highly recommend this serum to anyone who is looking for a serum with Collagen! nan
