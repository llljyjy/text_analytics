I was very happy to try this kit because I have sensitive skin that flares up from time to time,  especially in Winter. Great ingredients and cruelty free! All the products are unscented and are extremely hydrating which is a bonus when dealing with sensitivities and itchiness. I recommend this kit if you have Eczema or other skin sensitivities. Itâ€™s a great way to be able to try all of these products all at once. Great for travel too! Great Kit!
