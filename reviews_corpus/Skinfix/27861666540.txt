So far I like this product. I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks. I have very oily skin, and this keeps my oily skin at bay and keeps my makeup looking fresh for a couple extra hours. I haven’t noticed a lot of difference in the appearance of my skin yet, so I may need to leave this cleanser on for a couple of minutes before rinsing. nan
