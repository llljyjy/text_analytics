I usually use pimples patches, but this is a great alternative too. It’s great to treat angry pimples. A little goes a long way, so it lasts longer. Also, it’s lightweight and absorbs easily into the skin. It’s great to treat maskne pimples but requires patience. Make sure you only apply where you really need it because it can dry the skin. If you use it in the morning, make sure to apply sunscreen. The problem is that is expensive in comparison with other brands. Work a try!
