This is my new favourite moisturizer. It has the nicest lightweight gel cream texture but actually gets to work, providing all the barrier repair ingredients that my sensitive and acne-prone skin needs. Barrier repair creams can often be too heavy for my skin but this is just perfection. It absorbs super easily and really hydrates and protect my skin. I have a really sensitive patch on my nose that is always red and angry but this has totally calmed and repaired the skin! Such a fan of this product! So good!
