It’s an ok product. It’s very overhyped though. I like it, but I prefer my old night cream better. I have dry skin in winter, but I am also on the oily side so I can only use this as a night cream. I use another lighter moisturizer and other serums and I use this to seal it in. I tried it on it’s own and I didn’t feel like it was moisturizing enough, and it made my skin oily. It is heavy and you only need 1 pump for your face and neck. Again, it’s ok I just don’t know if I’ll miss it enough to repurchase. nan
