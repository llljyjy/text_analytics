I have used this product for several months now. I love it and highly recommend it to others. I don’t however, recommend the refill. I was excited to have less plastic waste but the refill cartridge does not fit in the original case such that the pump is capable of functioning nor the upper screw on component capable of sitting over the new cartridge. I have wasted a lot of product to try and get the refill to fit and that is pretty disappointing given the cost. At this point I’m going to literally scoop the components of the new cartridge into the old so that I don’t waste what’s left. Great idea in theory but poor execution. love the product - hate the refill
