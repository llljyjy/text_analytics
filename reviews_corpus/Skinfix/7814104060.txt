This product has good intentions but unfortunately i didn’t notice much of a difference with my skin. I appreciate how it caters to sensitive skin so it helped with that aspect. I specifically chose a gel cream because I thought it was going to be more lightweight than a regular cream but it just felt heavy on my face and had this dewy look which I wasn’t really going for. nan
