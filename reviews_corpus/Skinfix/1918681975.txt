I’m obsessed with there face cream. I have very dry skin and didn’t think that this lightweight formula would work. It’s light weight but it works !  Works into the skin quickly ,hydrates and moisturizer with just one pump. If you have dry skin. I would recommend it more for the morning or in the summer for morning and night time moisturizer. Hope this helpsBtw I did a video on it . YouTube MellyBE didn’t think it would work but it does!
