I was gifted this product from Skinfix in return for my honest review. I love that this product is cruelty free and does not have any harsh ingredients and it doesn’t have fragrance. Having sensitive skin like mine and dealing with flare ups it is nice that this brand clearly specializes in using ingredients that don’t irritate my skin. Not only did this help reduce redness from flare ups on my face I also used it in other stubborn areas and it worked amazing. This product I will use regularly and plan to purchase upon finishing this tube. Thank you Skinfix. It works
