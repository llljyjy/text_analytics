Skinfix never ceases to amaze me and their new Barrier+ Skin Barrier Niacinamide Restoring Gel Cream is no exception! While I do think the gel-cream consistency will personally be best for Spring/Summer, it manages to be both lightweight and nourishing. It sinks into the skin quickly upon application and doesnâ€™t leave the skin feeling sticky or greasy. The ingredients are absolutely phenomenal and I find that my skin feels balanced and appears to be visibly brighter after a few uses. While I do love the Barrier+ cream during the winter, the gel-cream texture of this makes it much more versatile and would suit a wide variety of skin types and concerns. Highly recommend! SO GOOD!!
