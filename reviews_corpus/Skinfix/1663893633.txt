The Skinfix Barrier+ Restoring Gel Cream is AWESOME. I have combination skin that leans more on the dry side in winter, but sometimes thick creams are still a little too much… This is seriously the perfect combo skin moisturizer. The gel texture is smooth and light, absorbing into skin easily with no greasy or sticky residue. It makes your skin feel immediately hydrated and keeps me feeling balanced through the long day. It’s not too much for my normal or oily areas and still packs enough punch to nourish my dry areas. I absolutely love this stuff! nan
