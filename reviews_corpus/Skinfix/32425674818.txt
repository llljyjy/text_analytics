This is my third purchase of this item. First two were the full cream, third was the refill and I seriously almost had a nervous breakdown trying to do the refill. I lost so much product. I followed the directions on the package to a T and they are NOT RIGHT. You  have to take out the white plastic bit left from the original to make this work. I was seriously losing my mind. Not user friendly at all, huge waste of product but I only knocked off one star cause... I love this stuff. Refill Problems
