You guys. I am OBSESSED with this product. I have been suffering from mild rosacea and super dry flaky skin. My skin is also very sensitive which is why I am so hesitant to try new products. My skin would burn after a shower I believe due to my skin barrier being ruined. Ever since I started consistently using this cream and its cleanser, my skin has been so much smoother. I am SO impressed with this cream. No more burning/drying of the skin after showers! I think I mightâ€™ve found my holy grail. HOLY GRAIL
