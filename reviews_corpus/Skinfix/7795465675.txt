Tales your momma didnâ€™t tell ya. Your skin changes dramatically after menopause! Life sucking horror is what happens to your skin! What your skin was before, in a blink of a hot flash it is no more.  I went from combo toward oily slick T Zone to something who knows what. Plus I developed freaking Rosecea, that was genetics not menopause. Well I needed something to help my skin and this is one of the products I hit on. It works. I use it as a night cream and your the other skinfix moisturizer during the day. I like the Barrier + better than Augustine Bader rich cream. Barrier+ leaves my skin soft and supple looking. Post Menopausal Skin LOVES THIS!
