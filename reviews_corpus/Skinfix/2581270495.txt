I was hesitant to get this balm because of the price point for such a small tube but im so glad i did! I developped perioral dermatitis under my nose and around my mouth about a month ago and no cream made it go away and it was itchy, scaly and painful. I’m glad to say that this balm made it go away in 3 days and i am no longer suffering! I’ll recommend it to anyone with eczema. Also a little bit goes a very long way so the tube will actually last a while. Expensive but well worth it!
