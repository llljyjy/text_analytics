I developed some dermatitis on the outside of my eye and onto my eyelid. After a few weeks of it not getting any better I did some research and ordered this product- and I’m so glad I did! After only two days of use morning and night (and no makeup) the skin on my eye has completely softened and gone back to it’s regular smoothness. A little goes a long way, and it immediately reduced the dry skin and itchiness associated with the dermatitis. I was very impressed that other products did relatively nothing to improve the area but after weeks this fixed it in a few days. Highly recommend! Dermatitis Gone After a Few Days
