I’ve been using skinfix barrier and my skin feels amazing! I put it on after cleansing but before my moisturizer and my skin feels great. It has everything I look for in a serum -vegan and cruelty free and helps to increase collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid. It also helps with dehydration which I struggle with, especially in the winter. It’s 4x more effective at retaining moisture. I’m so glad to have found a good serum that will help improve my skin! Must have serum!
