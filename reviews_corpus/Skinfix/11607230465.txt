I absolutely love Skinfix products and couldn’t wait to add this serum to my collection. I really like the lightweight, creamy texture, it absorbs quickly into my skin. It’s the perfect serum for the Winter time, it keeps my skin super hydrated all day long. Plus I’ve noticed my skin looks firmer,  plumper, and has a beautiful, healthy glow. So far I’m loving the results I’m getting and it agrees with my combo skin so well. This serum is definitely a keeper! This serum is a keeper!!
