I absolutely love this cream! It tremendously helps with my redness and dry skin from retinol use, without clogging my pores. It contains a myriad of ingredients I love, such as shea butter, jojoba oil, rice bran extract, squalane, rice protein, aloe leaf juice, tocopherol, sodium hyaluronate, ceramides and cholesterol. Usually I have to use several creams to get this variety of ingredients on my skin. Ideal for travel and a quick skincare routine that gives my skin what it needs! I can’t emphasize enough how much I love it. To me, it’s a plus that it does NOT contain Dimethicone, as my skin tends to break out from it. A treasure find. A treasure find, helps with my redness
