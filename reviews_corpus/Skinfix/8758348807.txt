I’m not sure why so many people don’t like this product in these reviews because I LOVE it! I use it at night followed by my Biossace squalane oil and my skin feels so silky soft and moisturized when I wake up in the morning. It’s is so hard to find moisturizers that are safe for acne prone skin and won’t break me out, but still hydrate my skin. This is the best acne safe moisturizer that I have found thus far, it actually does what it claims. It has so many amazing ingredients especially if you’re acne prone. The only thing I don’t like about it is the price and that it comes in a refillable pot but you can’t buy the refills anywhere. It would be nice to be able to buy the refills at a cheaper price and not waste so much plastic. SO GOOD BUT PLEASE MAKE REFILLS!!
