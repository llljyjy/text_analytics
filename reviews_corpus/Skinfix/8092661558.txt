I bought this product because I heard good things about it but unfortunately it didn’t work for me. I gave it 2 stars because the texture is thick which we dry skin love and no scent but it doesn’t absorbed into my skin I feel like it just stays on top of my skin. So kinda disappointed especially with the price. I only used it with rest of my beauty routine but I can never use it by itself. Not great for Dry Skin
