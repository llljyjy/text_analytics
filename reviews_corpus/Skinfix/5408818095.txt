I love this cream, first and foremost. It made my skin feel so soft, moisturized and smooth. I think it’s a perfect pre-makeup moisturizer because of how immediate the difference is. Obviously the ingredients are top tier, all serving their purpose without harsh fragrances, parabens, silicones, etc. and all while being cruelty free and vegan. The delivery of the product is really cool, it pumps out the product from a small opening in the top, so there isn’t any way for potential contamination. Definitely recommend this to any and everyone! Awesome!
