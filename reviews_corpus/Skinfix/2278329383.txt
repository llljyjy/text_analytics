Love the ceramide repair & collagen plump. Itâ€™s such a great hydrating and plumping serum. Love using it during my skin cycling in my skincare routine on nights when I want to take a break from using actives. My skin looks and feels amazing in the mornings after using this serum, highly recommend! Such a plumping serum!
