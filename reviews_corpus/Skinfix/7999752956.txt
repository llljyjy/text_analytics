I do like this a lot, but I don’t think it’s worth the money. It’s a little too watery consistency and a little does NOT go a long way. I went thru it in about 8 weeks. It feels nice going on and definitely moisturizes but I can’t say I saw results over any period of time. fine, not worth the dollars
