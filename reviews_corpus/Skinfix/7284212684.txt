I have sensitive, dry, and dehydrated skin. I really enjoy a calming, thick moisturizer. This doesn’t do it for me. I put on three pumps after my serums and it just isn’t enough. I don’t really enjoy the texture either. I’ll hold onto it and use in the spring and summer months when I don’t need as much moisture. It doesn’t seem to do anything extra for me than a clean, drugstore brand at half the price. If I splurge on a face cream I really want it to wow me. The only one I’ve found so far for my skin that I’m head over heels for is DE La La Retro Whipped cream. Not my holy grail
