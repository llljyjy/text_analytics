I was looking for a good moisturizer that kept my skin hydrated and this is it. The packaging is awesome. You just pump it when you need more product. It is lightweight and is barrier-nourishing. I love that it has saccharide isomerate with niacinamide, zinc PCA, and antimicrobial peptides to support skin. nan
