I also use this brands moisturizer and it’s hands down the best. I’m getting older and dryer. This face wash doesn’t dry me at all. It’s super clean no perfume. I’m gonna get body wash and their lip balm next. My favorite skin brand. If you have dry skin this is the only brand. It also doesn’t leave any residue of any kind. I have high standards too. I researched toxic ingredients. I’ve spent thousands of hours reading up on toxic ingredients and fake organic products. MY FAVORITE BRAND!
