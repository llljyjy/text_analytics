This acne treatment is a non-drying treatment which I didn’t care for because I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to rub it in or leave it to dry. It goes on without color or residue so I was able to use it during the day under my mask. I saw it was most effective on white heads versus under the surface pimples. It’s okay
