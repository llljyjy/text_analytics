I have combo skin and was really looking forward to this face cream because if all the good views. The cream was quite thick and didn’t soak into my skin, it left a layer of oil all over my skin which was quite noticeable, if I wiped my finger on my cheek I’d have a layer of oil on my finger even after 3 hours wouldn’t recommend, too greasy
