I have been using another Skinfix product- the Barrier +Triple Lipid Peptide Cream and it had quickly become one of my favorite creams. When I saw the Skinfix Barrier + Skin Barrier Restoring Gel cream, I knew I had to try it! If your skin barrier has been compromised, or if youâ€™re experiencing irritations (ie, from other skin care products), this product is your solution to healing and restoring your skin. The effectiveness of this product is larger due to its nourishing ingredients:Saccharide Isomerate - a water binding agent (humectant) that helps your skin retain water. This also helps your skin boost hyaluronic acid production, making skin plumper and hydrated. Love the lightweight feeling
