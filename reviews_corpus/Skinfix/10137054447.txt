I have dry/dehydrated skin that is super acne prone (currently on long term tretinoin and BPO). I switched to this after my last moisturizer was discontinued, and I honestly I’m happy I did!! It’s been about 3 months now. My skin has been the most hydrated it’s ever been and it’s given me a beautiful natural glow and even color. It pairs well under all of my makeup and doesn’t cause any sliding or separation. Big tip- You only need a pea sized amount to get the job done, too much does make it feel too heavy on your skin. I did have a few bumps on my skin when I was using too much, however all of that subsided when I used less and used micellar water prior to a face wash to help get a little deeper into my pores.Overall- definitely give this a chance if you’ve got sensitive, dry skin like mine! Love This!!
