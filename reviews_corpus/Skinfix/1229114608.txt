Huge fan of Skinfix products and the brand new Triple Lipid + Collagen Activating Serum $50/1oz does not disappoint!It is a moderately priced serum that delivers on its promise of smooth hydrated skin within an hour and worth every penny. I love how smooth and hydrated my skin feels even after just one use. This lightweight serum isnâ€™t greasy, absorbs well and has a non-tacky glowy finish. Moisturizer, Sunscreen & Makeup applies beautifully over the product. Highly recommend!!! Highly Recommended!
