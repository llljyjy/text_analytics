This was my first time trying a product fro Skinfix so I had no idea what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! This cream applies smoothly, barely smells like anything and Made my skin feel hydrated and protected from the elements throughout the day. I love the packaging so you know the exact amount to use each day. This cream will last you for a while. The texture of the product is creamy, yet light. There is no sticky feeling and my skin felt plump and supple. Youâ€™ll enjoy this too!
