I was kind of on the fence about this at first, but after using it for a few weeks I actually started to see an improvement in my skin. I’m in my early 50’s and have pretty good skin, but I was really starting to notice some loss of firmness/elasticity, especially in my jawline; plus I was struggling with increased sensitivity, irritation and constant breakouts on my forehead (ah, the joys of the menopausal transition). I am nearly to the end of my 1st bottle of this and have just re-ordered because WOW. My skin is noticeably firmer, I haven’t had a breakout in weeks, and my skin feels so much more hydrated, plump, calm and resilient. I really believe this has greatly improved my skin barrier and overall skin health. It does look a little white when first applied, but that completely disappears as it absorbs. I’m super happy with how my skin looks and feels  right now! Excellent Moisturizer
