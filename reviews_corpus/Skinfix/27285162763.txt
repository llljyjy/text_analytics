I got this cleanser when I was in a major breakout. Iâ€™ve been using it 6 day (paired with the skinfix moisturizer) and I already see a huge difference. If your worried about the price I would say go for it. I have no new breakouts and my last ones are healing beautifully. (has a nice smell lol) Definitely worth the money!
