I have been using this moisturizer consistently in the morning for over a year and a half. My skin is very sensitive and prior to this product my skin would react to anything I used for more than a few days in a row. Highly recommend for dry, sensitive skin. My skin looks plump and the one fine line I have on my forehead has significantly decreased. And my skin doesnâ€™t dry out. The only bad thing about this product is all the plastic packaging. I buy the large size and wish they would make a refill for it. great for dry, sensitive skin
