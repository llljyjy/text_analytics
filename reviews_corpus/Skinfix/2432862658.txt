I am pleasantly surprised with this moisturizer! I was looking for something lighter for the summer similar to the Drunk Elephant Polypeptide moisturizer, but even lighter, so I was expecting a translucent fluid, almost gel. I didn’t end up using it for the summer and opened it up in autumn when the weather was getting dry, and found it to be opaque white in colour, not oily, not heavy, and extremely moisturizing! It prevents my face from getting too dry in the day time, and gives my face enough moisture at bedtime so that I don’t wake up with a face full of oil (I have combination skin) in the morning.I like the ingredients of this lotion moisturizer. It has sodium hyaluronate, rice bran extract, and no silicones. I only wish it had colloidal oats, like the cream product in a jar from the same brand. Moisturizing, not Heavy
