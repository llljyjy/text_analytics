I am a fan of gel creams for my combo skin and this one has particularly blown me away. It is a lightweight hydrating cream that doesn’t make my skin greasy and plays well with sunscreen and makeup. I know Niacinamide is the new trendy ingredient, but for oily and combo skin, it really is a skinsaver! The packaging makes it so easy to control and it’s also more hygienic got those who don’t like to stick their fingers in the tub. Big fan of this gel cream, big fan! fantastic gel cream
