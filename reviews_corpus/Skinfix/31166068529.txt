Although it has the almost greasy texture of a balm, this one doesn’t at all make my skin seem glossy or oily. Skin Fix is fantastic; they utilize vegetable-based inks and packaging that is 100% recycled paper. How environmentally friendly! I like that their goods have been examined by ophthalmologists and are endorsed by objective dermatologists. Colloidal oat, shea butter, jojoba, and almond oils are among the fantastic components they use, and they are always devoid of silicones, parabens, gluten, and other unsavory substances that we don’t want in our products. The fact that you can use this Skinfix Dermatitis Face Balm on your eyelids and around your eyes is what I enjoy most about it. nan
