I surprisingly really enjoyed this gel cream. I have dry/dehydrated/sensitive skin and dealing with hormonal breakouts. I used this all summer long after applying Isntree Green Tea Toner and Hylamide Peptide Serum, and on days my skin felt dry I added Biossance Omega Cream on top. The Skinfix Gel Cream was the only new addition to my skincare routine and my breakouts literally disappeared! Amazing For Hormonal Acne
