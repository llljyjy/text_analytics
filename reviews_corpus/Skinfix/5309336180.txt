My biggest (and really only) struggle is hormonal acne during my menstrual cycle- I never had this issue when I was on the pill and now that I am off, having acne has really shaken my confidence at a time when I am already sensitive :/ I wanted to something to prevent my acne in the first place, not a spot treatment for when it already appears on my chin. I tried a 1% salicylic acid face wash and it made no difference. However, I had noticeably less chin acne (the hormonal kind) after using this a few days before and during my period! I am not sure how it is with daily use yet but this was a lifesaver for lessening hormonal chin acne. I could see this working well for people that have to wear a mask all day and get acne from that (I WFH so had no issues with my skin from that). As a bonus, itâ€™s cruelty free!! Which is my other MUST for any skin/makeup product I use. nan
