If you have really sensitive skin, this serum is an absolute winner. It has a great skin barrier focus, giving you the benefits of anti-aging but protects your skin barrier at the same time. The serum consistency is more like a cream, so I would use this as one of your last serums in your routine before your moisturiser. I have never had any issues with this serum negatively interacting with other products or causing pilling. It’s become one of my favourites and could easily become your “one and done“ serum! So hydrating, so perfect! I LOVE THIS
