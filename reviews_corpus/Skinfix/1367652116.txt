Great moisturizer. It leaves my skin soft and hydrated. My makeup applies smoothly over it. I use it as a night cream over my serum and I wake up to fresh and dewy skin. Not having two different moisturizers for day and night use made me pretty happy too. I like the pump although I can see how people would shy away from this type of dispenser. I havenâ€™t had any problems myself. One pump covers both my face and neck. My New Fav!
