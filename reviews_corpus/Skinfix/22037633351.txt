I have very dry skin and used to use First Aid Beauty’s Ultra Repair cream. This winter my skin got really dry from pregnancy and then from starting retinol in my routine. First Aid Beauty started burning my cheeks, so I needed another thick moisturizer. This was more money than I’m used to spending on moisturizer, but I gave it a try and I’m so glad I did. It’s SO hydrating for dry sensitive skin, I can use it morning and night and it’s perfect for keeping my skin moisturized 24/7. I’m almost done with my first tub and I’m really happy they sell a refill so there is less plastic waste. I’m also really excited they make a gel cream now for summer time that won’t be as heavy on humid hot days! nan
