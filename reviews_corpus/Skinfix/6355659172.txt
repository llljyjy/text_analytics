AMAZING!!! I suffer from hormonal acne, rosacea, and dryness on my face. I started using this product about a month ago and Iâ€™ve seen a really big change. My irritation and redness has gone down about 90%. (only redness left is from my acne) My hormonal acne as calmed down and I still have some blemishes but not as many as before. BUT the best thing, is that my face is feeling hydrated and soft! It has a glow and definitely looks a lot better than before using this product. I would definitely say this is my holy grail along with the facial cleanser. holy grail! absolutely love this face cream!
