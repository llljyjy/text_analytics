Ohhhh I am so in love!! I already loved their barrier+ cream, but felt it was a bit too heavy for my combo oily skin for the warmer weather and wisheddd for a gel or gel cream. Well dreams do come true!!! This stuff is amazing and is the perfect consistency for those looking for a more gel cream rather than a cream. Itâ€™s more lightweight but hydrating and even though I would prefer a heavier cream during the cooler weather, you bet I will be using this to the end during the warmer weather! Perfect for combo/oily skin!
