I really wanted to love this product but I don’t. I have extremely sensitive dry skin and have been using the aveeno daily moisturizer for years as it’s the only moisturizer that doesn’t make my skin burn but I was looking for something more hydrating as my eczema has been flaring up.This is very thick and creamy but it leaves a THICK layer of oil on top of your skin and made me look and feel extremely greasy which I hate. When I touched my face with my fingers it transferred and looked like I had dipped my them in a bowl of olive oil. I don’t know how people could ever wear this moisturizer during the day or under makeup. I gave this two stars because it is very moisturizing and didn’t burn my skin. Maybe I’ll use it as a night cream sometimes but I can’t stand how oily it is and I don’t even have oily skin. It does have shea butter and vegetable oil high up in the ingredients which is why. But you might as well just dump a bottle of vegetable oil all over your face. Way too oily and made my dry skin look greasy!
