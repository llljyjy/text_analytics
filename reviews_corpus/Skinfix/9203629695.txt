Let me start be saying I did not initially like this for what I purchased it for. This was supposed to be my day time moisturizer. However, I very quickly realized it was too thick for that and swapped to using it at night. It applies smooth and a little goes along way - like just 1 pump. Any more than that and you will be spending a lot of time rubbing it in. If you’re a dry person who lives in a dry place, this will be perfect for anytime use. If you’re oily or, in my case, live in a humid place, you might not like it for daytime use. This left my face feeling very well hydrated throughout the evening. I was surprised to still feel good when I woke up. You can apply instantly after toner but if you use a serum, I suggest waiting until that serum has been adequately absorbed.There is no fragrance. It is easy to get every last bit of product out of it. I thought my dispenser on the top was broken but when I unscrewed it, it was completely empty! Would recommend this to anyone who loves heavy moisturizers. Heavy but still good !
