I love the packaging of this product. Such a great way to minimize waste. I have oily skin, so gel products work best for me and this gel cream is no exception. It absorbs well into my skin and leaves it feeling so soft and supple. Itâ€™s lightweight and works well under makeup. Not to mention it has my favorite ingredient for my acne prone skin, Niacinamide! Definitely a great product! nan
