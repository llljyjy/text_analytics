Skinfix triple lipid + collagen activating serum has a light cream texture and feels super smooth. I experience a noticeable cooling sensation on my skin at application that fades after a few minutes. This serum contains no added fragrance, silicones, parabens, or essential oils. It does include an host of fruit and flower extracts and ferments. After using this serum for just a few days, I noticed that my skin looked tighter and plumper. Oddly, it also looked redder. It didn’t feel irritated at all, I just noticed slightly increased ruddiness. I wonder if the ingredients are increasing blood flow to the skin and that’s what’s causing it. Really works — and fast!
