This SkinFix Triple Lipid serum is one of the best serums I have ever used. I am so pleased with the consistency, itâ€™s effectiveness and how much my skin is in love it. I like to use 1 pump during the day and night as my first step after washing, then toning. It is a great primer and now a staple. Must have serum
