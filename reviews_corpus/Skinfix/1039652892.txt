This serum is thick! It almost feels like a moisturizer. It’s a lovely texture that absorbs nicely and makes my skin look healthy. I was hoping my husband’s sensitive skin would tolerate this serum, but it irritated his skin. I wouldn’t recommend for sensitive skin but would recommend otherwise. nan
