Combo people rejoice—this is the moisturizer for us (though I think this is suitable for all skin types depending on regimen)!!!! This product melts into the skin so nicely with no greasy feeling yet plumps and hydrates the skin. The niacinamide in here is also just perfection, I really do notice my skin smoother and softer after using this. I have combo leaning oily skin and only use this at night as I think it’s too much for daytime use (for me). I hope Skinfix comes out with refillable pouches for this product like their peptide moisturizer to reduce waste. One million times YES
