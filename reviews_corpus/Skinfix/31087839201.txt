This product is perfect for the first step in a double cleanse routine. It’s a creamy/gel like formula so if you don’t like the texture of a traditional oil cleanser but still want the benefits then you’ll love this! It’s very gentle and always leaves my skin feeling so smooth! Only downside is I wish there was more product for the price… but with 2x daily use I guess it’s to be expected! Perfect double cleanse!
