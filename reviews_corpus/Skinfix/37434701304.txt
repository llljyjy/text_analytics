Skinfix is a brand I’ve tried for the first time this year - I love how hydrating their products are and this serum is a perfect addition to my routine! After use my skin feels plump and glowy. I love the texture of the serum, it’s thicker and a little tacky on the skin and I wake up with healthier, hydrated skin. Since it’s thicker I do like to use this at night rather than the morning, but with the tackiness I can see it working well under makeup. At night it layers well with my other products and I feel like my skin looks smoother. A wonderful serum I’m so happy to have tried! A hydrating night serum
