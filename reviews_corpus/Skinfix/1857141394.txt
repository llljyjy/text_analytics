I have had the *worst* postpartum skin for 2.5yrs. I am 38, and I never had acne or dry skin as a kid, but I’ve been battling it something fierce lately. My skins has been SO dry  and patchy and bumpy lately and I felt like it was aging me by at least 5 yrs. But this cream has been a game changer. My tone and texture are even for the first time in what feels like a lifetime and when I look in the mirror I don’t see a total stranger anymore. I am totally shocked and over the moon happy. nan
