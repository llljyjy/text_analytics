I cannot say enough about this product. My skin is SO DRY in the cold weather, and it seems like nothing has ever helped. Within a week or so of using this product, I could tell a huge difference. My skin started to look so much more hydrated. I also LOVE the packaging/pump because I feel like I do not have to worry about wasting or getting more product than I need. Also, a little goes a long ways. I have recommended this product to every single person who has commented on my skin. This is going to forever be a staple in my skincare routine! A must have for those with dry skin
