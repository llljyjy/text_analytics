I received this Barrier+ Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream Refill from Skinfix for my honest review. This barrier cream has a super creamy, rich texture. It absorbs nicely and my skin feels supple and thoroughly moisturized. It has a very light scent but has no added fragrance. My skin feels smooth, soothed, and nourished. I was already a fan of this cream but love that it is now refillable. The refill pod is easy to replace and I love that it helps decrease waste. This is a wonderful moisturizer for my dry combination skin. Love the refillable design
