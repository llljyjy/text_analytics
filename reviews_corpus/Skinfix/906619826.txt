Iâ€™m not sure what the hype is about this product. I have been using it for two weeks and now have drier skin. I have much more flaking than when using Olay. I also dislike the dispenser method, I feel it is wasteful of an expensive product. I will not repurchase this again and am using this one up. Expensive waste of money
