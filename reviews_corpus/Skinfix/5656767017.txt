This is another SkinFix must have!!! I have oily/combo skin and I love this line for helping to keep my skin barrier in check and this product is another skin saving gem. This is a milky serum that delivers tons of hydration and keeps skin soft. I use this on off days and under certain actives to add extra hydration. Regardless of skin type, if your skin is dehydrated then I highly recommend! A True Skin Saver!
