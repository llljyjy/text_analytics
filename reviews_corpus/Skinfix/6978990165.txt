The container on this cream is brilliant- it is a push down system where only a little bit of cream comes up, so there is no cross contaminating the remainder of the cream. That is pretty much the highlight. The first few weeks of using it I found it to be just ok. Not too thick or sticky, ok scent, but nothing special. After a few weeks though it really started to smell unpleasant. I am not sure what happened, I store it with my other face creams at room temperature, and the delivery system should mean that nothing gets into the the cream. It started to smell like it has gone bad, and. it only got worse to the point that I threw out most of the cream. I would not purchase this cream or anything by this brand again just based on this experience. Started to smell terrible after a few weeks.
