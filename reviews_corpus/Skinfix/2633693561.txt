As someone who *actively* uses actives, I didn’t expect to love this as much as I did. In theory something that is only on your face for about a minute can’t be as effective as the traditional leave on treatments. Right? Wrong. This cleanser was an absolute treat! It defended my skin against acne with the same tenacity Gerard Butler had when defending Sparta. The next day I say an immediate difference in size and redness of my uninvited guests, and my face is smoother than a double blend scotch on the rocks. I’m not saying you need it, but if you don’t want perfect skin then that’s on you. Top shelf cleanser!
