As someone who is around 40, your facial moisturizer becomes VERY important to you. I used to regularly use Tatcha Dewy cream; which i always really liked despite the strong scent. However i received a sample of this with a purchase i got a few weeks ago. The sample was so small that i decided to just to use it on my under eye area. After a couple days the area under my eyes looked so moisturized and healthy and even a slight smile crease i had there became unnoticeable. I decided if it did this for my under eyes then i would take the chance and try it with my entire face. I ordered the regular size and i absolutely love it. It has made my skin feel and look better than it has in a long time. I use it twice a day. I guess this product just really vibes with me. This is now my permanent facial moisturizer as i have no need for anything more than it gives me. I still use this under my eyes whether that be right or wrong as i know products are made for specific under eye usage but this has turned mine around completely so I’ll keep doing what I’m doing. I like that it barely has a scent. It’s not greasy or shiny like Tatcha dewy cream yet my face has a healthy glow to it now. I do have rosacea and my skin is not irritated by this at all and is very calm and dormant. I think this is the first time i realized what a “holy grail” product is. My skin loves this
