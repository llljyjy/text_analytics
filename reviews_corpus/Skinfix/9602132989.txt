I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review. I’ve tried one other thing from this brand and it was excellent so I was very excited for this. First of all, the smell is very light and clean which is the number one thing for me because fragrance irritates my skin so much.I’m so happy with this, my skin feels so hydrated. Definitely recommend! Great!
