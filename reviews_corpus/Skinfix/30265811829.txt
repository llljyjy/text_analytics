I have been searching for a great eye cream and this is my fav so far. I’ve tried cereve, roc, Tatcha, Estee lauder, banana bright, ren, strivicin, drunk elephant (all nice)..... but this is my absolute favorite by leaps and bounds. I’ve only had it a few days and can see a difference. it is a great day cream, as it absorbs fast and leaves a smooth base. It has a subtile immediate effect without the shine that others have. wow!
