I’ve been using this for 4 consecutive days now. The fragrance is neutral and if anything, medicinal. I have dry skin and adult acne, but I’m starting to wonder if this dries my skin out too much. I’m definitely going to keep using and see how it goes to reduce the bumps on my face. Just based on how dry my face feels after I use it, I bet this would work great for drying up oily skin and oily breakouts. Maybe not for dry skin, but overall good
