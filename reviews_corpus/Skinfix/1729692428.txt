It’s a bit pricey and that’s my only true dislike for the product.  My skin is changing as I age from oily/combo to normal and I’m finding I have to use MORE product in order to get the moisture I need.  I’ll definitely switch back to their heavier cream after this bottle is done.  The gel cream does the job, but I just find that I need more of it and I’d rather not when paying this price for a bottle.  This is an excellent product for everyday and especially when I’ve accidentally damaged the skin barrier with my retin A or chemical acids.  I will repurchase! Lower the price and you'll get 5 Stars!
