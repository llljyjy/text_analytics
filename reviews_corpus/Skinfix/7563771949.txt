Really enjoyed this product even though itâ€™s only been 4 days of continued use. I had a big pimple a couple days back and used this. Immediately there was tingling and stinging which is to be expected from a highly concentrated acne solution, but soon died down. After four days of continued use (just a small dab on each spot), the pimple has basically gone away! Definitely one of my favorite spot treatments. nan
