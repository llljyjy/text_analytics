Finally a face cream that helps my dry skin. I’ve been struggling with some dry patches near my ears, maybe for face mask use or it’s hormonal, but I spent almost a year trying to figure ir out. Dermatologist cream was ok during the length of treatment but didn’t solve the problem. A month ago I tried this face cream and it repaired my skin since day one, I couldn’t believe it. It’s worth it! Solve dryness problem
