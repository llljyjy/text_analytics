A lightweight gel-cream to improve skin hydration that’s surprisingly worked well for my dry skin type. I normally stay away from gel formulas as I don’t find them moisturizing enough. However, after using this hybrid for several days my skin remained hydrated throughout the day. This is formulated with blemish prone skin in mind so this will be my go to moisturizer during that time of month. nan
