A very clean cleanser! contains salicylic acid, niacinamide, and azelaic acid that helps target my acne. With the weather getting warmer, my skin definitely takes a toll with the change, and this has definitely helped. Less acne pop ups making my skin clearer. I’ve been using this as a daily cleanser and so far, it’s been treating my skin well. Haven’t seen such results from anywhere else!! love it Clean and effective
