My skin is acne prone, very sensitive to products, very oily and I have large pores. I’ve been suffering from breakouts as an adult for the last few months and it seemed like my usual face products were making my acne worse. My skin looked awful, red, clogged pores and large pimples. Decided to try this as a last effort. I swear after the first use my redness decreased (didn’t go away totally of course), but it didn’t look as red as before when I tried other moisturizers. And my skin felt so comfortable. Like my skin has never felt so comfortable. I also see that my acne scars and active breakouts are lessening after just a few days. This has agreed with my skin so far. Throughout the day my skin is not as oily and it just feels balanced overall. I will always use this for my skin. HG moisturizer for my troubled skin
