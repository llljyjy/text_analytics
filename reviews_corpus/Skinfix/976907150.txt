This cleanser is perfect for sensitive and acne prone skin. I wish this was around when I was a teenager! Itâ€™s cleansing without stripping my skin barrier.  I appreciate that it is completely fragrance free, no essential oils which can sensitize skin. I saw some nice ingredients in the INCI list: niacinamide, tea tree extract (not oil!), glycerin, and glycolic acid. All things I know that my skin loves! This cleanser is a winner in my book. Great for my sensitive skin
