When the tube arrived, I thought I had accidentally ordered a mini size. Fortunately, a little of this goes a very long way. After trying a new product that really disagreed with my skin, I had eczema-like contact dermatitis above and at the corners of my eyes. Over only a couple of days, this completely took care of the issue. I was so impressed. The consistency is sort of like a thinner Vaseline, but I had been applying Vaseline prior to ordering this with far less impressive results. Iâ€™m grateful to have this in my arsenal of products, because the skin above my eyes sometimes also gets dry due to seasonal allergies. So effective, and a little goes a long way
