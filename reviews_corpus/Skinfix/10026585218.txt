My combination skin just loves the texture of gel creams. This Skinfix barrier+ restoring gel cream does not disappoint. This lightweight cream absorbs quickly into skin while it nourishes and hydrates while protecting my skin barrier. I love the hygienic dispenser pump top. No cross contamination. I didnâ€™t detect any scent. Carton is made from 100% recycled paper, using vegetable inks, and is also recyclable, and biodegradable. This is also vegan and cruelty-free. nan
