I was looking for a face cream that would be able to keep my skin hydrated without the sticky feeling. I’ve tried Skinfix’s lotion before so I thought I would also give this one a try - I’m so glad I did because it is exactly what I was looking for! Additionally, as someone who works in the healthcare setting which requires masking, I was worried about getting clogged pores. I’m happy to report that this cream did not give me any clogged pores! It can be a little thick, but my favorite way to put this cream on is actually by mixing my hyaluronic acid serum with it. It makes it easily spreadable. Would highly recommend this for the wintertime! I think it may be a little thick for the summer, especially if your region is more humid/hot. Great for Dry Skin!
