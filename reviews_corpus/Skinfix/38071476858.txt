I do love this moisturizer as it works well for my dry skin, give it time to soak in as it’s quite oily but what my skin needs. I’ve been looking for a Canadian brand that works well but is cruelty free and this fits the bill. I have recently purchased the refill however and it it was half empty, it seems to be a thing with these as a few others have noticed the same. This is a shame as you’re paying a decent amount to receive 50ml. I do recommend the moisturizer for dry skin though! Cruelty free and great for dry skin
