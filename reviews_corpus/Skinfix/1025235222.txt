I’ve had eczema all my life. It started as a teen and was really bad then and NOTHING helped, so I avoided all skincare. 40 years later I now get occasional flare-ups on my neck, chest, hands, and lips which is annoying and can keep me scratching throughout the night.My Dermatologist (in 2019) prescribed a great course that works when I adhere to it several times a week. Which is simply to keep my skin moisturized and not let it get dry. When it flares up apply my Rx Hydrocortisone and Vannicream lotion, cream or Vaseline after. It works! But I was excited to try something new to see if it would work as well. I deliberately irritated my skin so my eczema would flare for testing purposes (I do NOT advise this). Here’s my review of the following:Hand Repair Cream:The consistency of this is highly unappealing. It’s pasty and greasy. Greasy enough to have me wash it off (within an hour) the three times I tried it. I also found no improvement or benefit to my eczema.Targeted Body Balm:The consistency of this is highly uncomfortable. It’s a thick paste that doesn’t apply nicely. I applied this to my neck twice and it was uncomfortable in application. Both times I found I was itchier than before I applied it and had to apply my 2.5% Hydrocortisone Cream and moisturizer to stop the itch. It took a few days of applying my Rx cream and moisturizer for my neck to calm down.Foaming Oil Body Wash:Although I LOVE the texture of this, I don’t feel it cleanses and it did nothing for my eczema. Curious if it also assisted in increased itching or if that was only the balm applied after. I do like it for shaving my legs though. I wish the hand and body creams were this consistency.Dermatitis Face Balm:This one has a lovely texture. It’s a thinner Vaseline feel. But again, I didn’t find it helped with my eczema. But I don’t mind it at all. I wish the hand and body creams were this consistency. I like applying this at night for the feel alone. Not quite for me
