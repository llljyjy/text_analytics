OH. MY. GOSH. Stop what you’re doing, order this now. I used to have horrible acne a few years ago and haven’t had an issue up until wearing masks again. This is the one and only product I feel take over before my blemish even surfaces. You know, one of those “under the skin“ horribly painful problem spots? That’s it. This seriously clears it up like it never even happened. If and when you feel something coming up, dab this on and I swear it’ll be gone within a few hours. ORDER. THIS. NOW.
