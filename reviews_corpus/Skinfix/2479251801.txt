I thought this was the cream (the sample cream version I had was AMAZING) and not the lotion so to be fair I was expecting something heavier, but this is a pretty meh moisturizer on me.I have pale skin, in my early 30s, combination to dry. I use this as a daytime moisturizer and itâ€™s fine, but nothing special so far. Been using it for about a month now. If anything, it feels a little dulling on me. I use it as a daytime moisturizer with the Tatcha Rice Wash Cleanser. Okay but nothing amazing for me
