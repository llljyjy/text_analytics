I received this product as a gift from skinfix in exchange for my opinion. The brand is called skinfix. Which this is my first time using it or hearing about this brand. So this product is a skin barrier restoring gel cream. Cruelty-free and vegan. Nice packaging and the carton is 100% recycled paper and i love that. The jar is 1.7 fl oz. You want to use this product after cleansing am/pm and apply to your face and neck. It’s a pump so you just push down and poof. The color is white. Texture is very lightweight and watery kind of. Not thick and has no scent at all. Applies very nice to your skin. Not greasy or oily and tacky sticky residue. For me I have the t-zone area of oily skin. When it’s hot or summer time omg gets eve worse. So with that I was super excited for this product. I do have to say WOW it does help with that extra oily parts on your face. Not sure how it does it but takes it all away. It’s amazing. Also helps with those dry patches you get and hydrated all day long. I have some acne and blemishes on my face. This gel cream helps reduce them and the redness. Doesn’t clog up your pores either and helps mnimize your pores to. After using this product for a while, I can honestly say I feel my skin is improving so. Which I’m very thankful for that. It’s really hard to find a product that doesn’t add oily or greasy to your face. But now I can say I found one this product. I definitely recommend it for anyone who has similar issues like me. I going to look in to more of there products as well. Amazing!
