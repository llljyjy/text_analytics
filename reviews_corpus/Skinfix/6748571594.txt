Pros: This cream is so lovely and thick, perfect for those of us with very dry skin. It feels so soothing to apply! When I woke up, I could still feel the product on my face and my face still felt hydrated (usually I wake up and my face feels very dry in the AM)Cons: the price! I cry as I repurchase Perfect for very dry skin!
