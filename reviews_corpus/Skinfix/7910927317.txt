This stuff did wonders for my skin. It smoothed, softened and cleared it right up. After starting this cleanser I got so many compliments on my skin - no one has ever said I was glowing before. Plus, this is a pleasure to use. Itâ€™s creamy and substantial without being overly drying or stripping. I have found that rubbing it on to the skin and letting it sit for a minute or so almost like a quick mask helps the ingredients to work just that much better in my skin. I  obsessed with it. If SkinFix made a mask or a body wash out of this formula, I would definitely buy it. Absolutely Worth the Money
