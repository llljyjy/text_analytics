Iâ€™ve used this cleanser religiously since I love any product with azelaic acid in it. My texture with my skin got way worse, and this product was the only thing I changed in my routine. Also, after looking through these reviews, it seems like almost everybody did not purchase this product, but instead received it for free. That could explain why the reviews are overwhelmingly positive but the product is pretty mediocre. bleh
