I love everything I’ve tried from Skinfix and this product did not disappoint!First of all, I absolutely love the packaging and the airless pump as it makes very easy to dispense the product while also keeping it very sanitary.I have combination skin that tends to be slightly oily especially on the warmer months.I apply one or two pumps of this gel moisturizer at the end of my skincare routine. It absorbs easily, has a beautiful silky texture that’s not heavy on the skin but still nourishes, and does not irritate my sensitive skin. This feels very soothing and I have noticed healthier looking skin immediately after using it once. It keeps my skin barrier healthy and happy, especially when using harsher actives.This is perfect especially for the mornings since that’s when I prefer lighter weight gel moisturizers.Definitely recommend! Great light weight hydration
