As someone who has oily skin during the summer months, I look for a gel moisturizer that won’t leave my skin feeling heavy and will sit well under makeup. This gel cream has been amazing and hit all my requirements! I love how lightweight the gel is that leaves my skin feeling hydrated, but not oily. I also love that it sits well under my makeup without making it separate or become oily throughout the day. Overall, it’s an amazing product for anyone with oily or combo skin! Great for oily/combo skin
