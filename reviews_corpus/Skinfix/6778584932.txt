I have always suffered from horrendous dark circles under my eye and I get eczema on my eye lid and right under my tear line. Every eye cream I use stings a little bit (except the CBD eye cream from perricone MD). It’s so smooth and super hydrating. I only get irritation from it when I’ve had a really bad allergy night (eye crusties and running them) and even that is barely anything compared to what I’m used to. I used skinceuticals eye cream which burned but did give me some relief from my under eye circles, this is WAY better. I’m actually obsessed with it. THE BEST EYE CREAM FOR UNDER EYES!!!!
