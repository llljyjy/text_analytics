I have been loving this cleanser! I think it does a great job of helping with acne for me. I have definitely noticed a difference in using this cleanser. It works great as a second step in my cleanser routine because it does not take off my makeup. I like how there is a little exfoliating aspect to it as well. The only thing I would change is the slight chemical scent which is a little off putting. Works great
