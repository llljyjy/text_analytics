Love a good gel cream! This one is really nice. I do think it’s a bit pricey and there are other ones that are just as good for a lower price. But I don’t hate this one at all. I like to use this at night before a face oil. It doesn’t moisturize my skin enough so I don’t recommend for people with extremely dry skin nan
