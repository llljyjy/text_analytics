I’m a strong believer that the the ingredient list on a facial serum speaks for itself, and this product is amazing. Ingredients include jojoba oil, niacinamide, glycerin, hyaluronate & I’m obsessed. I use this in combination with my regular light moisturizer & it definitely helps with keeping my skin moisturized in the dry winter, with no heaviness.
