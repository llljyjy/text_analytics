I bought the mini to try it.  The texture is a very thick cream, which quickly softens with the warmth of your hands.  It does not leave a greasy feel and will stand up to the driest of winter skin.Pros: it is so softening and feels amazing on the skin.  I absolutely see a difference after only a few weeks.  Cons: you get very little for the price.  Frankly, I may repurchase anyway because it works that well. Pricey, but worth if
