This serum makes my skin look and feel healthier: it is brighten, firm & smooth. I’ve start seeing results after one week of using it. I love the texture of the serum. Usually I use it morning and night. I’ve notice that it pairs nicely with my make up products. Overall, this product is really really good. I’m so happy with it. Magic in the bottle
