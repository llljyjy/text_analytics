Was really hoping this would be a miracle worker for my long standing hormonal breakouts. Unfortunately, this hasnâ€™t been the case. It cleans and removes my make up just fine but getting rid of my break outs, it has yet to do so after 3 weeks of continuous use (at night before bed and a gentle facial cleanser in the morning). nan
