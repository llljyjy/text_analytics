pleasantly surprised with sephora’s skinfix line! I’ve gotten their moisturizers before and liked it enough to want it again. it’s nice and creamy and leaves my skin feeling really hydrated overnight - the container is also nice so if you have any other products on your hands then it only pumps the amount you need instead of sticking your hands in an open container. hydrated skin
