I’ve been using this for about two months now and I’ve had fantastic results. I typically have very dry flaky skin but recently I started using a topical retinoid that has made my skin even more dry and dehydrated. I got the mini size to try out and instantly loved it. It is very rich and heavy but dries down and doesn’t feel greasy at all. It has been amazing for my irritated skin barrier- no other product that I’ve tried in the past has even come close to this. It is now a staple in my nightly skincare routine and a must-have for anyone who has dry, dehydrated skin or a messed up skin barrier. I don’t usually use it in the mornings as it doesn’t work well with my sunscreen. My only complaint is that the pump dispenses MUCH more than you need-- if you apply the whole pump, the cream pills- especially if you have additional skincare steps after this one. You really don’t need that much of it. I use a hydrating mist (Cicapair or thermal spring water) before putting this on which I find also makes a huge difference and helps your skin soak it up. Definitely recommend. It only pills if you use too much
