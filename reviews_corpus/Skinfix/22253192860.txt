I’ve been hunting for a new spot treatment.and I’m still not sure I’ve found the one. This Skinfix is good but it seems to flake off after only a couple hours. So I feel like I’m not getting the full treatment I should be. Even if I put it on at night, it’s gone by morning. It helps, I just think it’d be more effective if it lasted longer on me. nan
