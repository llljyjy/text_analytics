I have freakishly sensitive skin that also breaks out especially when there is a change in weather, too much sweat and sunscreen, etc. This has been a skin saver for myself and my teenagers. Depending on what went on my face that day, I usually do a double cleanse with the foaming oil cleanser first. I follow with the new Barrier+ gel cream and my skin looks and feels fantastic. This does foam up a little, rinses clean and there are NO microbeads- not sure what people are talking about. Weâ€™re on our third tube and the product has been consistent each time. Effective and gentle for my sensitive skin
