At first, I wasn’t sure about this. Now, I attribute this product to helping ease my rosacea and redness flare ups during my third pregnancy . I tried every cream/face wash/ serum under the sun because I was so self conscious about the red dots that had developed in the second trimester of my pregnancy. This is a thick consistency and you need to make sure your face is thoroughly cleansed prior. Apply toner and serum and then gently pat thjs into skin until absorbs. There is a natural scent which is neither pleasant not disturbing and I have noticed a significant reduction in my redness since using this product. You can tell it’s natural and effective. I am very happy with this purchase and think it will work well on sensitive skin prone to redness . helped alleviate my pregnancy rosacea
