This saved my skin!  I had over done a BHA+AHA mask and wrecked my skin barrier.  My mid-50 skin was already dry and super sensitive, but I made it far worse accidentally.  After trying everything I had, I was desperate!  I tried this snd I’ll never go back to anything else!  I never noticed a smell at all.  I only use it as a night cream, and I wake up to plump, soft, hydrated skin.  I don’t know what it does with other products during the day, but I’ll keep it as a night cream!  Must have for dry sensitive skin! A must have for dry sensitive skin
