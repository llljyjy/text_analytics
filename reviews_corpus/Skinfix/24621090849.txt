This product has me HOOKED. I’ve been using it for almost a year now for my dry/combination skin, paired with vitamin C in the morning (with sunscreen!) and 0.2% retinol at night. I’m also obsessed with reducing plastic waste so I LOVE the refill option, which also means I can also save some $ on every purchase -- everybody wins! Love the refills!
