Every month I will get a few pimples from hormonal acne. Its usually on my chin or neck. I don’t like to use acne products on my whole face since I don’t get acne all over, so this on the spot treatment works amazingly. It’s smooth and absorbs quickly, so I can just apply on top of my zits before bed. I usually wake up with a less noticeable zit or most of the times almost dried and gone! Definitely recommend! nan
