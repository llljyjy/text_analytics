Iâ€™ve been using a topical retinoid for five months and in my experience, this moisturizer is good at preventing peeling and sensitivity. Four months after starting my retinoid treatment, I switched to another moisturizer I had on hand, as I ran out of this one. My skin broke out and started flaking even worse than when I began using retinoids. Thankfully, a week ago, I got back on Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream and, despite the flu, my skin is hydrated, soft, and nearly back to normal. I love this product and will keep repurchasing it in the future. I get the refills, as you get a little more for your money than other sizes. I hope they never discontinue it.
