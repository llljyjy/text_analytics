This spot treatment checks off everything I am looking for in a spot treatment. It makes my skin feel balanced and not irritated in any way. It didn’t dry out my skin a bit. A little goes a long way. The ingredients are on point, the BHA works well to unclog pores and brought my acne to surface, and eventually healed it. My acne flattened in a day or two and didn’t re appear. Also calmed the acne down and felt soothing upon application. nan
