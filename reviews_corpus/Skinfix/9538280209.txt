I have combination skin that super dry in winter and oily in warmer weather. I recommend to use this cream only in winter for those who have oily skin becuz the texture is super thick. However, it does a great job in hydrating ur skin. This is actually the best hydrating cream I ever used before. Even tho the texture itself is very thick, the feeling after applied on face doesn’t feel sticky or clogging my skin at all. No irritation, no acne trigger, no bad reaction —> perfect for sensitive skin. Nevertheless, as I said before, I recommend to use this in winter only for those who have oily skin. side note for oily skin
