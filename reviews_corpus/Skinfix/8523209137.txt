I’ve never had a face cream quite like this one. I’m currently using products that are extremely drying (benzoyl peroxide/ BHA + AHA chemical exfoliant) and experienced periods of extreme flakiness and scaly skin, but have found this particular product has done wonders in keeping my face hydrated and completely eliminate dryness/rough skin. I recommended getting the largest size offered, it lasts quite a long time and the touch-less pump definitely helps reduce bacteria from cream to face.  Price point is worth it, such soft skin as a result of this hydrating cream. Best face cream out there
