This is really moisturizing and didn’t irritate my super sensitive eyes and skin. After using it for a few months, I haven’t noticed any difference in fine lines or dark circles. It’s a good moisturizer but I think it’s a bit over-priced since I didn’t notice any other benefits. Also, the pump puts out too much product. I usually try to do a half pump which covers both my eyes so that I don’t waste product. good moisturizer
