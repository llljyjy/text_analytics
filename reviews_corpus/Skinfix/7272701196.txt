i have dry, sensitive skin that is prone to dermatitis and i use tretinoin. i have gone through two of these now. it is hydrating, melts into my skin well, and feels soothing upon application. there is absolutely no fragrance or fragrance disguised by essential oils which i appreciate :) dry & sensitive skin loves it!
