I’ve been using this lightweight gel cream for a few days and I woke up with soft, moisturized skin. It targets my dehydrated skin. I appreciate that it’s vegan and cruelty free. It is unscented. It contains Niacinamide, Zinc PCA, Saccharide Isomerate and a Hepapeptide Blend. These ingredients help balance my skin barrier. It’s made in Canada and has recyclable packaging. Would recommend! Protects the moisture barrier.
