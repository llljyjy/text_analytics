Skinfix is such an amazing brand for my sensitive skin. I have used their products throughout the years and never have I been disappointed. This serum is lovely, has a thin consistency that absorbs quickly but leaving the skin hydrated and soft. I use this am and pm with their face cream and my skin has retained its moisture during this dead of winter! Love it so much! Amazing serum
