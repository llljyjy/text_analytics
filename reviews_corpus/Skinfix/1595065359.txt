I am loving the initial results with this pimple spot treatment! I have combination skin with hormonal breakouts and a lot of redness/uneven skin tone. I was so excited that Skinfix included powerful ingredients like azelaic acid, niacinamide and 2% salicylic acid. Very thoughtful formula without the parabens or other harsh chemicals commonly found in acne products. Impressive blemish/acne treatment!
