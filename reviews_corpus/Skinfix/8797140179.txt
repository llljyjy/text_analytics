This really does seem to have instant results ! I’m brand new to skin care & watched some YouTube videos and saw the regular formula advertised and wanted to try it . I heard mixed things about the gel formula so I was hesitant to get it but I do have combo skin so thought I might be better offer with the gel formula . I have really sensitive skin and this doesn’t burn my skin at all! It’s only been 2 days and I see a noticeable difference! It’s a slight difference but I didn’t expect ti see any progress in just 2 days ! I’m blown away ! No filter on the after pic I swear ! results in 2 days !
