I have dry and sensitive skin & this moisturizer is so hydrating & doesnâ€™t irritate my face at all. I love the push-pump style lid vs sticking your hands in the container. Under makeup or layered with other skincare, it doesnt pill. I think this moisturizer is good for any skin type Perfect for any skin type
