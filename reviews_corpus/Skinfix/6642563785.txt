I have super sensitive, combo skin and this is the first spot treatment that’s strong enough to flatten my breakouts within a day, but not so strong that it dries out my skin and makes it flaky! I use this twice a day, under makeup and before I go to bed, and any pimples I have are always flat by the next day— I don’t really get cystic acne anymore so I can’t say how long it will take to clear those up with this product, but my everyday little pustules and red/white heads are no match for this spot treatment!! Great for sensitive skin!
