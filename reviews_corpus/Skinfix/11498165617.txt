As someone with constant low-level acne, I’m always searching for something that can help with my skins congestion and breaking out. This cleanser does a fantastic job of cleaning AND exfoliating the skin with BHA’s that smooth and keep sebum and bacteria from building up on the skin. I found this cleanser not to be too drying, although definitely follow with a good moisturizer after. Definitely great for those of you with acne or those who need a gentle exfoliant! Bye Acne
