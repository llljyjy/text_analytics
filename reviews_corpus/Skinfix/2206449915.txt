I received this in exchange for a review, but these are my honest opinions.PROS:- lightweight gel cream texture that sinks in quickly- easy-to-use airless pump that ensures you can get all of the product out- if you’re someone with a sensitivity to added fragrances or colorings, this formula does not contain eitherCONS:- for the price, I don’t know if this outperforms other fragrance-free gel cream formula I have tried (ie, Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion)- while I like that the airless pump means I can use all of the product up, the packaging is quite bulky for the amount of product, so this wouldn’t be my favorite to travel with good but pricey
