I am super impressed with this! I’ve been snacking on some holiday sweets which have left me with a couple of breakouts. I noticed after two applications a reduction in redness and swelling. One of the spots is completely gone. This doesn’t make my skin feel dry and I’ve been able to apply it multiple days in a row on the same spot without causing sensitivity. This has some of my favorite acne fighting ingredients and works so well! Definitely one I will continue to reach for. nan
