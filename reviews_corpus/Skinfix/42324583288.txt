I purchased this face balm for my under eye eczema. I apply it once in the morning and again before bed. The texture of the balm is almost like a salve so it feels very soothing. The hydration it gives my skin is fantastic and I would recommend this to anyone suffering with really dry spots. 10/10 :) Soothing and hydrating!
