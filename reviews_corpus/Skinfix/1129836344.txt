I used a cleanser that was new to my routine, and it was fine at first, but it started stripping my skin. Lucky, I have this gem to try to bring back my normal skin and wow!!! I underestimated this stuff.  At little goes a long way. It starts solid but breaks down to an oil deliciousness. Dehydrated dry will love this! Happy Purchase
