This balm is such a good product to have on hand when your skin is in trouble. It’s extremely soothing and easy to apply. I don’t personally have eczema, but I do sometimes get irritation around my eyes and nose from my prescription retinoid. The last time this happened I applied the balm to the red areas near my eyes and it almost immediately fixed the problem! The burning stopped right away, and by the morning the redness was gone.A tiny bit goes a super long way! It sort of melts in your hand and smooths on very easily. It feels surprisingly lightweight and not sticky. I look forward to having this in my arsenal for whenever my skin acts up. nan
