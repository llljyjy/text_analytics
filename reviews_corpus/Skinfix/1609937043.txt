I live in Northern Ontario and it’s winter time. This is doing a great job at keeping my sensitive skin properly moisturized without upsetting my rosacea. It is pricey but it’s definitely worth it! Love the dispenser, it gives the perfect amount to use & keeps the rest of the product clean. If your skin needs a little extra moisture & tlc I highly recommend! Skin saver!
