This moisturizer is solid! It is hydrating without being oily on my skin. It is lightweight and sinks into my skin easily without any irritation. I have been enjoying this moisturizer in my daily routine. the pump dispenser is also convenient to use. This was my first Skinfix product and  I am curious to try more. Nice and Lightweight!
