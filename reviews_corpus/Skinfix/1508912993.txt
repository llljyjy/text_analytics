This seems to be fragrance free, so it has kind of a weird smell. It’s not bad, and not nearly as strong as the biossance omega repair cream (which I think is very comparable to this in a lot of ways), but kind of like play dough maybe? Otherwise it’s excellent, so much so that the smell doesn’t remove a star. It’s increased the hydration of my skin significantly and it looks and feels better than ever. I get bored of moisturizers pretty quickly, but I imagine I will rebuy this because it’s so effective. nan
