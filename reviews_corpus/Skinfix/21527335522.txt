Amazing product! I was using the SKINFIX serum before this and plan to return to it during the summer as the face cream might be too rich for the humid Texas summer. However, this product has been wonderful during the colder months when it is dry and my skin begs for comforting moisture. It is the perfect balance and did not cause breakouts or dermatitis. nan
