I’m Impressed with the results!  These pics were taken one day apart.It did calm my blemishes and they don’t look red anymore. I applied it 2x  a day and it realky worked!What I love about this Acne spot treatment is that it is unscented, absorbs quickly, and gives you a matte effect. A tip if you’re heading out on a date: rub it in just a little so you don’t get a white cast...caused I believe by the Kaolin clay.So far so good...I’ll keep using it, a truly great product! I’ve been kindly gifted with this  spot acne treatment in exchange for my honest review. I’m Impressed with the results!
