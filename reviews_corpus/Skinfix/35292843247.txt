Best moisturizer for Dry/Patch skin. I have been using adapeline for my acne issues and this caused my skin dry. Skinfix moisturizer has been my go to to solve this issue. I would not suggest this moisturizer for people who like light weight moisturizer, this one is thick. Good for dry skin, thick moisturizer
