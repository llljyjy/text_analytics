This is another brand that I have yet to try something that I donâ€™t like. They can do no wrong in my book. This has even my angry red skin looking calm and smooth after just a week of use. It  is easy to use and goes on like a dream absorbing fully in just a bit of time, leaving no stickiness. My skin drinks it up and it shows in the form of hydrated, healthy skin. Love this stuff and will be getting another as soon as this runs out. Everything you need and then some.
