I received this product complimentary from SkinFix for my honest review. I honestly didn’t think I could love them more! I already use and love their Barrier cream, and I thought the gel would be less moisture, but omg! It’s amazing!! Even my dry skin drinks it up! It is so so silky and smooth. I’m totally obsessed now. It keeps the shine off my nose but visibly makes my skin look smoother! In love!
