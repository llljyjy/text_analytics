I have had combination, acne prone, sensitive skin my entire life and this is one of the only moisturizers that hasn’t caused a breakout, made me oily, or given little results. The smell is mild and it absorbs rather quickly, and doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky afterward. I’m a huge fan of Tatcha’s Water Cream and I’ve used it for years, but I find this product gives me similar results for less money. Will definitely repurchase when I run out. nan
