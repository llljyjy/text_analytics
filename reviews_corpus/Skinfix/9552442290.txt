my literal savior when it comes to dry skin. i’ve had oily skin for most of my life and around September of 2021 i started using tretinoin for my acne. i had the tightness, dryness, flaky, peeling skin associated with tret. it was uncomfortable and every move i made with my face reminded me of what my skin looked like. i would apply this and get IMMEDIATE relief. it is smooth, has never broken me out, never clogged my pores, and provides lasting hydration that i truly believe makes my skin better and better with each use. because i’m still on the oily side, i only use this at night. i was hesitant at first with the price, but it is truly worth every penny. the product is amazing and on top of that i LOVE the pump!! anti acne bacteria products have truly been amazing in clearing up my skin and i love the peace of mind of knowing i’m not getting germs into the product every time i use it. 1000/10. i can’t say enough good things about this!!
