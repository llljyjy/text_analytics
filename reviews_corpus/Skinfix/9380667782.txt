I have combo skin. My T-zone tends to be on the oily side and my cheeks gets dry and flaky. This face cream has my dry cheeks smoother and under control (being using it for almost 4 months). It doesnâ€™t make my T-zone any oilier. I recommend it! Give it a try. If you have really oily skin I recommend you to try the lotion instead of the cream. Love it!!!
