This is hands down my favorite spot treatment! It’s non-drying and has noticeably reduced inflammation and redness from my breakouts, even after a single use. It doesn’t make my pimples disappear overnight but it really does help them to heal much more quickly than they typically would. I find this spot treatment is most effective when used at the first sight of a pimple, before it’s had time to fully develop. It's a Winner!
