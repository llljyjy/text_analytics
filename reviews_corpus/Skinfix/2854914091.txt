I have been struggling with texture skin for some time now and the skin fix collagen activating serum has been good so far. I typically apply it at night after using a discoloration serum and a higher moronic acid and it pairs wonderfully with my other skin care products I’ve only been using it for about a week, but I’ve already noticed small changes to my skin barrier can’t wait to see the long-term effects. So far So good
