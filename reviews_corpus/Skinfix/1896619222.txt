Didn’t expect to love this. Was a rec online and I swear it makes me look more youthful or baby faced in the morning. It’s not a long term fix but I just love that my face still feels moisturized in the morning and skin is plump and glowing. Will upgrade to full size with sale. I don’t normally love a pump but will buy the big one anyways. I have dry, sensitive Scandinavian skin and live in harsh long winter. Would use this for all but the very hottest months here since I don’t think i can over-moisturize. fab! plumping.
