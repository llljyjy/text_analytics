I use this product twice a day and wash my face twice each time. Within the first few days of using it my acne started to go away and now, after about 3 ish weeks of using this face wash my acne is basically completely gone except my stress acne. I love the way that this product feels smooth on my face and doesn’t make it feel like my face is being dried out or like there is a small film over it as if i put a face mask on. I paired this with a cereave moisturizer that is also for acne and my face is so clear now. If you are looking for a face wash to help you clear your acne fast then this is something I 100% recommend. When I wash my face with it, I make sure to wet my face first, get a small bit on my fingers and then rub it in until it foams a little, rinse it off, repeat, then rinse again and dry my face. The wash doesn’t make big soapy foams but that is perfect for me. Please try this out if you are looking for a new face wash!! Made my acne go away fast
