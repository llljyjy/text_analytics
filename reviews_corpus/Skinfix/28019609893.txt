I don’t have acne prone skin but I have been suffering maskne due to constant asmk wearing and this product has been helping a lot with the breakouts and I believe also prevention. This works best on spots that have come to the surface to help it dry out. I think salicylic acid works better than sulfur for me personally. I didn’t find this product particularly dried out my skin but I do moisturize well. nan
