I don’t write reviews often, but this cleanser deserves it. I’ve tried many cleansers, but none that can serve as a powerful first cleanse, a clean washing second cleanse, and a nourishing morning cleanse easily. It removes mascara with ease, never feels drying, and rinses clean without leaving any residue behind. I also like to try new things, so I don’t usually repurchase skincare. I’ve bought this cleanser 5 times, and I never want to be without it. Best Cleanser Ever
