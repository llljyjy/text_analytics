This is a good moisturizer but I’m not sure if it’s worth the price. It spreads easily and is not very thick (more watery), so I don’t use a ton of this. I think it’ll last me a while, as even a little bit is hydrating enough for my skin. The texture and look of it is… an interesting milky white but I will use this up. It’s good for spring and fall.
