This product has great ingredients and can provide a variety of benefits to the skin, but it just wasn’t for my skin type! I have oily/combination skin and it made me feel more oily. It kind of just sat on top of my skin instead of sinking in. That doesn’t mean I would’t recommend it for those who are on the dryer side though, it’s still a great product and can help repair your moisture barrier, it’s just not for oily folks :) Not For Oily/Combo Skin
