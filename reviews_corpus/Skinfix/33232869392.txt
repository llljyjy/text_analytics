It has a light and very pleasant texture, I like that it is easily absorbed leaving a beautiful and soft glow, the skin feels soft and hydrated.Something I like is that it helps increase collagen, it is vegan and cruelty free.  It has been great on my skin and my favorite part is how soft it feels on the skin.I am excited to continue using it and see what else it can do for my skin. Feelâ€™s good on the skin!
