This is a really cool way to try out the products and decide which one works best for you and which is not. I like some of them. Body balm is very hydrating, but too greasy. Can be used at night only. Hand cream on the other hand is just right. Body wash Iâ€™m still not sure. It is very gentle, but does not clean your skin properly nan
