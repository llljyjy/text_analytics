I liked the texture/thickness and that it was not fragrant, but I couldn’t give this a fair shot because like some other reviewers, it irritated my eyes. It seemed to melt into my eyeballs  instead of the skin around my eyes. I’ve used dozens of eye creams and have only run into this problem once before and considering other reviewers are saying the same thing I can only deduce that the product has an irritant in it. nan
