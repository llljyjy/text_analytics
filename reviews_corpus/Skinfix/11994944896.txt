Iâ€™ve been on the lookout for months for an every day moisturizer for my oily/combo sensitive skin. My routine sometimes consists of lactic acid and chemical pads so I need a moisturizer that soothes and feels nourishing for my skin. This moisturizer does just that and better my skin is always left feeling plump and hydrated. Definitely adding to my list of holy grails! Perfect every day moisturizer!
