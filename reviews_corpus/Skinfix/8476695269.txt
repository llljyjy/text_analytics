I absolutely love this moisturizer. In a lot of reviews, I saw that a lot of people were using it at night because it is such a thick moisturizer. When I was using it during the day, I was using a little less and it wasn’t as heavy. I love this moisturizer in the winter, so I’m interested to see how it works as warmer weather arrives. Definitely going to be my go to moisturizer as the weather gets colder. AMAZING WINTER MOISTURIZER
