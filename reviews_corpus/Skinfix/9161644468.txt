I LOVE THIS CLEANSER!!! I have had a lot of trouble with breakouts lately and this face wash felt so incredible even after just the first few uses. It does not dry out my skin and my face feels extremely smooth and soft after using the cleanser. I really love that the product is free from a long list of ingredients, including fragrance, parabens, sulfates, benzoyl peroxide, tea tree oil, essential oils and many known triggers of malassezia folliculitis. I like that the cleanser is Vegan and cruelty-free. This product is also allergy tested and pH balanced- whatâ€™s not to love! I LOVE THIS CLEANSER
