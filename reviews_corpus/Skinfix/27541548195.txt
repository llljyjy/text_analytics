I bought the cream a few months back, an OK product and way too expensive. So when it was time to replace it I found the refill option - since the one thing I liked was the pump I decided to give it a try. Biggest mistake ever. Once you open the container, no amount of trying will get the pump to work again and I’ve been forced to forgo the pump. It’s just not worth it, specially given the price. Don’t buy the refill
