The smell is horrible. You canâ€™t breathe or go near anyone after using this product. It smells like feet.The store associate gave it to me and when I opened the package at home the tube was open. It also has this sticker as if they have changed the ingredients or sth. I tried it on a pimple and the white head got a lot worse overnight.Overall, waste of money. Horrible smell and texture
