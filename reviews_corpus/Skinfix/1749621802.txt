I was gifted by Skinfix their Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream in exchange for my honest thoughts on this product…here goes! I have been a big fan of pretty much every Skinfix product I’ve tried and this one did not disappoint! The only thing I’m not crazy about is the applicator. It isn’t the most convenient. Other than that, my sensitive skin loves this stuff!! Great product!!
