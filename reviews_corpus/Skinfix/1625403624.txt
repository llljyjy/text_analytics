I’d say this product is so-so. I’ve been using it as a spot treatment and it hasn’t completely taken any acne away, however it has slowly made them shrink down and prevent getting any bigger or worse. Like all acne treatments, it very drying on the skin so I try to only use when needed, and moisturize in-between uses. Works pretty well
