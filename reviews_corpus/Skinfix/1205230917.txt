I love trying out skincare and recently purchased the SkinFix spot treatment to treat some blemishes on my chin that were healing but leaving a reddish scar. In about two or three days, they are sooo much less noticeable and the redness has decreased dramatically. Highly recommend this stuff if you tend to get red scars from acne. One of the best products I have tried and definitely worth a try. A+. Miracle product
