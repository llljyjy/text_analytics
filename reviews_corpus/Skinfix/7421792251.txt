I’m sure it’s a great moisturizer but it was too heavy for my combination acne prone skin. I only used it for few days so it hasn’t broken me out but I have noticed my skin looking/feeling clogged and my t zone felt bumpy and scratchy(?). I wondered why it felt like that as I was washing my face then I realized it was this moisturizer.. Because it’s the only thing I changed in my skincare routine. I got it to use it for night time as the ac in my room has been drying out my skin but I had to switch back to my regular water cream. nan
