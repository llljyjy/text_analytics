This is a decent gel cream. Itâ€™s smooth and applies well. For extremely dehydrated or dry skin, this might require an extra serum for more hydration. Not moisturizing enough with just the cream and can lead to a tight/dry feeling. It can go great with an extra serum/oil as it is lightweight. Good but may require a serum for more hydration
