So this is actually the first time I’ve tried a moisturizer by them, and I have been dying to try it. This is their new gel cream, and I would say it is perfect for any skin type. I’ve previously had very oily skin, now I am dry, but this is has been my favorite for morning times. It has a really unique consistency, it’s light weight, yet sick enough that it really deeply moisturize your skin. It doesn’t leave me feeling greasy or sticky, and it absorbs into your skin super quickly. I feel like this would be a perfect moisturizer for summertime, because you could use it morning or night and it would be hydrating, yet not too thick. The ingredient list is incredible and I felt this would be worth every single penny due to how amazing the consistency and formulation is. After using this it makes me really want to get the other version of their moisturizer, because I know it would be just as amazing as this one. I really enjoyed the push applicator, very sanitary and easy to use. If you are looking for a new moisturizer I highly recommend this on ALL SKIN TYPES will love this!!!
