I’ve used the mini of the barrier triple lipid peptide cream but it was just too heavy for skin. Not that my skin doesn’t need the moisture but anything too heavy and occlusive will break me out. I was beyond excited to see the gel cream released!! This texture is just divine, bouncy, light, and gel with a creamy feel. It absorbs quickly, but most importantly it did not irritate or break me out. It is anti-microbial, with niacinamide, zinc PCA, all ingredients to restore the skin barrier. As we are in winter all of us need extra help to keep our barrier happy. I could not be happier with gel cream, it is exactly what I needed. Plus the packaging keeps the product sanitary. Love love!!! If you found the cream to be too heavy, this is what you need! Hydrating without breaking me out!
