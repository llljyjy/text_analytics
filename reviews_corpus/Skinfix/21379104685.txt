I have very sensitive skin. Before I used this cream, I had very bad irritations from using retinol. My skin was very red, burning, dry and itchy. So I was looking for a product that could heal my skin barrier, so I gave this cream a try. And the result was a WOW. My skin was not red and itchy in only 1 day and healed completely for about less than 1 week. Too bad I didnâ€™t take a picture before and after.Now... I use this cream as a base before using retinol and my skin is fine, no more irritation. I love this cream so much that my skin looks healthy, moisturized and glowing without feeling greasy. Magic cream for my irritation skin
