I really loved the packaging, you don’t have to stick your fingers inside the product. Which helps keep the product clean, also gives me the perfect amount each time. The product itself is very good, and I definitely see this product being perfect for someone with oily skin. The product is instantly absorbed into my skin, and doesn’t leave a greasy feel. I have sensitive skin, and have not had any bad side effects. Love the way my skin looks and feels! Skin looks and feels amazing
