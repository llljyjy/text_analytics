a sephora employee suggested this to me when i was looking for something very hydrating due to recent under eye dryness and my make-up not applying well. she explained all the science of it to me - hydrates deeply and surface level. i use eye creams but nothing seems to have long term impact. she said try for 2 week and if no difference, bring it back.1.5 weeks in using this product and truly there is a very noticeable difference. My under eye skin LOOKS better, make up applies well and there are no dry patches. this is a real deal eye cream that actually works! not a pointless eye cream
