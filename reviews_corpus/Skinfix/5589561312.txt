I had such bad sunburn 3 weeks ago that I could feel the damage to the skin on my face. it wasn’t peeling, but it was ROUGH - a texture I’ve never experienced before and never want again. Enter: Crystal from Sephora Bay Ridge. The minute I told her what was going on, she went straight to Skinfix and she was completely right. I felt a difference after ONE NIGHT, and after three my skin felt normal again. I’ve been using it ever since (at night only, with facial oil I already had) and I think it could be great for me during the winter. I was worried it would increase how oily I can get during the day but I have stayed totally balanced and I swear, I’m glowing from the hydration and my skin texture is better than ever before. I am now fully committed to skinfix
