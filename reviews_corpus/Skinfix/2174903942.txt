I have stress hormone induced atopic dermatitis on my neck & face. For me, this product was so-so.Pros: packaging earth friendly/sustainable, & product ingredients natural, particularly 5% colloidal oatmeal. For me, effective for reducing flaking skin.Cons: very little amount considering the price of the product. For me, not effective foe itch relief.Finding effective products for eczema, especially on the face, takes a lot of trial & error - so try it, it may work for you, it just unfortunately didnâ€™t do enough for me. So-so
