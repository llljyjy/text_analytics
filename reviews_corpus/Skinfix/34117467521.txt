To start I really loved the way this product smelled, very light in fragrance. I love that about products because I donâ€™t like too much fragrance in the products I use on my face. I would say 4 pea size dots will sufficiently wash your face. The texture is very milky based. It feels smooth on my skin, almost like I am rubbing a moisturizer into my skin which is good! I love products that are gentle on my skin. My skin in the winter is combination-dry and my acne is very hormonal at times so I think that this will be great for my skin. I also get acne on my chest so this definitely felt like really good when I used it on there. Really great first impressions I am excited to keep using it and see how it helps with my acne. Really gentle on my hormonal acne!
