I wear a mask 8 hours a day and have really struggled with “maskne”. I had a very red rash-like redness around my mouth and chin for months. I tried so many products to help the redness and post acne marks. I used this one time and noticed a difference within 24 hours with the redness on my chin! The acne scars are fading now after one week of use. It feels so good to finally find a product that actually works for me. I felt very self conscious and it’s given me some confidence back. nan
