I was extremely surprised by this cleanser, I have super oily skin so I love a cleanser that suds. This had a very pleasant texture to it and I love that it has BHA in it to help fight off acne.It left my skin feeling super clean, but not heavy with any residue. I will definitely be adding it to my skincare routine! Great for oily skin!
