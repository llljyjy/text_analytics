I love this cleanser. I never really got acne until recently. With stress, hormones, and a dirty phone, my face has gone haywire. I use this as my night time cleanser and it’s amazing. It doesn’t dry my face out and it leaves it clean and smooth. It doesn’t take my makeup off which isn’t a big deal since I don’t wear it often. My acne has cleared up (most of it on my cheeks) and I’m overall happy. GREAT NIGHTTIME CLEANSER
