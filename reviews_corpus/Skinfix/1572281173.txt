I found the spot treatment to be very helpful and decreasing the life of my pimples. I applied it at the first line of a pimple and within a few days the pimple was gone. It also made it less painful and it appeared to work pretty quickly, I used it during my morning and evening skin care routines and all in all I will continue to use it as it did dry them down pretty fast. I found it helpful!
