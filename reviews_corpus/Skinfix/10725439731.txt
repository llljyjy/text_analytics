This stuff is amazing. I struggle with acne on my chin and around my mouth pretty frequently, and this product cleared up my skin just in time for my wedding (!!!) Usually acne products make my pimples worse before they make them better, but this stuff can actually clear a pimple in a day or so. It actually does seem to be preventing new breakouts as well. I really can’t believe how well this works for my skin—obviously everyone’s skin is different, but if you struggle with acne prone skin around your mouth/chin, this is definitely worth a try!! Can’t recommend it enough! W O W !!!!
