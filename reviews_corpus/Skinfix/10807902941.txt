Really helped repair my moisture barrier and I found it really helped with my acne scarring. I would bathe in this moisturizer if it wasn’t so expensive. I saw a lot of people complaining about the refill not working, but I’m on my fourth refill cartridge and haven’t had a problem. Looks glorious under makeup. I will continue to repurchase this moisturizer. Best Moisturizer Ever
