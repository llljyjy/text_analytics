I really like this product! Even after a few uses, my skin was looking and feeling healthier. I used it after toner but before everything else and I felt as if it laid down a good base before the rest of my skincare routine. It has a really easy texture to work with and sits very nicely on my face—especially under my makeup. My skin hasn’t been the best this winter but I feel like this product helped get it back to a healthier place. nan
