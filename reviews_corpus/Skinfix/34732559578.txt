The skinfix acne cleanser was exactly was my skin needed. I’ve struggled for so long trying to find a brand that isn’t too harsh on my sensitive skin either by causing redness or drying my face out more then it already is. I have had zero issues with this face wash and look forward seeing how well it clears my skin up! Great for my sensitive skin.
