This is my all time favorite moisturizer, A little goes a long way & I love the packaging. Just wish the 90ml size has a refill. I have dry skin & this is great for a everyday night moisturizer. It’s a little heavy and can take a while to dry which is why I don’t use it for a morning moisturizer. My dry skin loves it!
