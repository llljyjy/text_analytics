I’ve been struggling with very dry and sensitive skin for the past year, and I’m so happy to have found this. It’s incredibly thick, and instantly feels soothing and protective when applied. My skin still feels great the next morning, which I don’t get from most moisturizers. I don’t plan on using it every day, but it’ll be a great option when my skin feels like it needs the extra help. thick & luxurious!
