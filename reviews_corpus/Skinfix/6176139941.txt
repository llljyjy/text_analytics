I already love Skinfix and have tried a bunch of their products and loved them . I love the clean more natural ingredients they really get along well with my acne prone sensitive skin type. This is such a great acne spot treatment! I’ve been using it for about a week now and already seeing awesome results. I have really been struggling with maskne lately as well as I get hormonal breakouts. Most of my breakouts are on my jawline. I’ve been applying this treatment day and night and the cystic acne is almost cleared up! I still have some hyperpigmentation and spots from where my acne was, but no new breakouts. I will definitely repurchase this product! Awesome spot treatment
