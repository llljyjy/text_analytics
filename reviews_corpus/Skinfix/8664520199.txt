I was looking to replace my previous oil cleanser that contained essential oils and I’m SO glad I found this. I have sensitive skin/rosacea and this is gentle yet effective. Removes all makeup and spf but doesn’t strip the skin. I used to double cleanse daily but with this I was able to remove the second step unless I’m wearing really heavy makeup. I will definitely by again. Gentle and effective
