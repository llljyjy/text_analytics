First things first: I love that this brand is so ethical and is not just vegan and cruelty free, but that they make sure to use reclaimed and recycled plastic for their packaging.  I thought this was nice and lightweight.  This is definitely going to be perfect in the summer when my skin gets a bit more oily.  It definitely kept my skin hydrated and I like that idea that itâ€™s helping strengthen and protect my skin barrier. nan
