This product is really nice! It definitely makes my skin feel more moisturized and hydrated. As someone with dry skin, I really enjoy this. This is a thicker serum and feels almost like a light weight moisturizer. I think my only criticisms of this product are the amount you get for the price and the packaging. The packaging feels a little bulky and you only get one ounce for $69. nan
