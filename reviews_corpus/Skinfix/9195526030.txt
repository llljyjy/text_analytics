Everything I have tried out from skin fix bas always been amazing and this one is no exception. I was excited to hear about this new product launch and couldn’t wait to try it and I am glad to say I am not disappointed. My dry skin loves this serum. It does what it’s supposed to do, has the cleanest ingredients that nourish my skin. Skin fix products are simple yet effective. A must have. So great
