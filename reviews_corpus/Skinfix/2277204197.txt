I typically reach for pimple patches whenever I’m trying to treat blemishes but this product has definitely impressed me with how easy it is to apply and sink in as well as the good results. I appreciate how it sinks in like any other skincare product in my routine and doesn’t make it obvious that I used a spot treatment like a sticker or white cream. I’m a big fan of this product. nan
