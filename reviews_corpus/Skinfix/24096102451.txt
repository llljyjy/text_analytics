This is possibly the worst lip balm I have tried... Firstly, the product itself is very thick so it doesnâ€™t make sense to have it in this squeezy tube. This packaging makes it impossible to use! And this is basically a glorified coconut oil product that is not moisturizing at all. Save your money and get literally any other lip balm. Terrible packaging and non-moisturizing
