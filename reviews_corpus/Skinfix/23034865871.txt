It’s a fine moisturizer. For the price, I expected my skin to look or feel healthier after using and finishing this product. My skin looks and feels the same as using a drugstore moisturizer. This gave my skin no improvements. That being said, it didn’t cause any irritation or breakouts either. Overall, just a very meh moisturizer for me. The reason I would discourage anyone from buying this is because it runs out incredibly quickly. The packaging is 10x the size of the product in there, and you will have no way of knowing how much your using due to the packaging. I had to use a lot of this to moisturize my face and was shocked how fast I ran out. For 52$ I expected this to last me more than a month or make my skin feel extra happy/ hydrated. Overhyped product. Overhyped
