I followed the directions and I have to admit- I initially did not like how this felt while washing my dash. It felt like a lotion almost BUT I got use to it. It did not dry my skin out or trigger my Winter sensitive areas. I breakout on my cheeks and nose sometimes and used this when I felt another round coming I used this as my wash. I believe this helped to clear up my breakout faster versus my staple acne wash. Remember to use sunscreen! nan
