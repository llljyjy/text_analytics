This is such an amazing serum! I have combo dry skin thatâ€™s very acne prone and when I saw the actives in this I was instantly excited to give it a try. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and not greasy because it sinks right in and I find the niacinamide not only helps my pores look reduced but also helps with breakouts as well. Great for combo skin
