This made my skin so incredibly soft the first time I used it but I felt like I just had to keep applying more for my skin to stay hydrated. I have combo/acne prone skin so I thought this would be the perfect in between for the cream & gel but I think because it’s getting colder out it wasn’t enough. I think for people with oily skin or for combo in the summer it would be perfect! A good moisturizer
