I couldn’t say enough about how much I love the packaging. It’s clean. easy to use, easy to control the amount, and easy to carry around.  It’s the best. Then about the product— absorbing immediately, lightweight and hydrate. Love it so much. I use it in my morning routine, it provides the hydration while won’t affect sunscreen application (sometimes the cream is a bit too thick and will make the spf pilling). Love it love it love it. Packaging is great, product is better!
