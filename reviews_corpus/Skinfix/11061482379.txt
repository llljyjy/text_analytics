My skin is sooo sensitive and I’m very picky about my cleansers, for that reason alone I can’t just use anything. It’s hard to find a good cleanser with great ingredients that doesn’t feel harsh on my skin. It didn’t make my skin feel dry or flaky. It’s 2% salicylic acid so it really does help fight acne. I’m also 6 months pregnant so hormonal acne is very real! It helped clear most of my breakouts within a week! Great for sensitive skin!
