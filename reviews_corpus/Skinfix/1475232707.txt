I really love this container and press pump. You don’t have to dip your fingers in a jar and one pump is the perfect amount dispensed. One pump was enough for my face and neck. It’s a nice cream texture. It absorbed fairly quickly and didn’t feel greasy or sticky afterwards. I think the price could be a little less but it is a really good cream. Really Good Cream
