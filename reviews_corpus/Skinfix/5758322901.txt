Bought this to combat dry skin on my eyelids. The tube is tiny, and the cream itself is very greasy once on. It did nothing for me, my skin still flaky and itchy after a few weeks of using it. Ended up getting a tub of aquaphor for half the price - similar texture and it worked like a charm! Don't Waste Your Money
