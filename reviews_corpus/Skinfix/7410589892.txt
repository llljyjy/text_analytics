This acne cleanser is wonderful. I wish that it foamed better but thats just me. Either way it works pretty darn good because i never get breakouts since using it and it really really helps with redness. I just wish they would change the packaging to a pump or something because the material on the sides starts to crack and chip away just from squeezing the bottle. Please SkinFix Change The Packaging On This!
