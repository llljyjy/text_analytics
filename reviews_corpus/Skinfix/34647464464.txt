This cream was a game changer from the one I used to use. My skin gets dry quickly, but this cream helps a lot with moisturizing it. It’s slightly cooling and lightweight, pretty easy to spread as well. Think of the consistency as liquid soap, but less runny. The cream absorbs quickly into my skin and really helped with the rough patches of skin I have near my jaw area. It also helped a lot with my acne scarring. One thing I have to note is that the amount of cream given is about half the size of the entire packaging; the rest is just empty. There also doesn’t seem to be any place that supply its refills right now. super hydrating, but where are the refills?
