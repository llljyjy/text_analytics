Everyone online with combination + oily skin is raving about this product so I decided to give it a try. The pump never worked properly. I had to shake it and turn it upside down every time I use it to dispense the product. At one point, I had to dip my (clean) finger inside the jar since the pump isn’t working properly.I also noticed, after a month of using this, that my skin became oilier. I use it at night after my retinol and my skin is oilier than ever when I wake up. I used to use the Aqua Bomb Brightening Vitamin C Cream but I find that too light, hence, I switch to this. I also liked the concept of just buying refills rather that the full size every time.I guess I’ll finish the remaining product when winter comes and see if it will help my combo + dry skin. Terrible packaging, makes my skin oilier
