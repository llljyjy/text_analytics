Skinfix Acne+ 2% BHA Acne Spot Treatment is just what I need for the occasional blemish.  I am in my 40s and have dry skin, but I still get zits. Instead of treating my whole face and possibly drying it out more, I like to use this spot treatment only where it is needed most. This allows my skin to heal without creating other issues. I love BHA and have used it for decades so this is a great addition to my skincare. Azelaic Acid is new to me, but I love that it helps with dark marks and scarring. great for occasional blemishes
