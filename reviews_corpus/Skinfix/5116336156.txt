I love every product I’ve tried from skinfix, and the original barrier+ cream is one of my favorites so I was super excited to try the gel cream version. Since I have oilier skin, this formula has actually been really great for me as it’s super hydrating but not heavy. It still feels really soothing and protecting but I can wear it day and night. Perfect for oily skin
