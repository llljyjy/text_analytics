I’ve been testing this cleanser for about two weeks now, and I have to say, it is phenomenal. It’s a 2% BHA (beta hydroxy acid) cleanser that target acne, and gently exfoliates by penetrating deeper into the skin. After only a few use I have noticed how glowy my skin has become afterwards. It’s a gentle, creamy, frothy cleanser that leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped. I haven’t had any reaction to the product, nor have I developed any new breakouts while using it. Again, it is phenomenal. LOVE LOVE LOVE
