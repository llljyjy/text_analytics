Not appropriate for actual winter. I need to reapply 3 times before bed and still I wake up with dry skin. Don’t see how this is better than cheaper face cream, which make me regret trying it out over staying with the more expensive Tatcha. I have very very sensitive skin and it doesn’t break me out, so at least there’s that. meh
