GREASE BALL! I have normal/combo skin and this just doesn’t do it for me. I look slick and oily and greasy. that being said its effects are nice, I only have the mini one and im using it at night for now till it runs out, but I won’t be repurchasing. try the gel version of this moisturizer instead honestly. nan
