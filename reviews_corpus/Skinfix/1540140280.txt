What a great cleanser for breakout prone skin. It is a very soft and mild cleanser that cleanses your skin without stripping its moisture barrier. It feels like my skin is a bit more balanced after this wash and doesnâ€™t feel tight. It reveals a brighter looking complexion. Works well with my sensitive skin. Great acne fighting wash for sensitive skin
