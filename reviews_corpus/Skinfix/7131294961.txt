The texture feels nice and thick that you would think that it will be so moisturizing. Unfortunately it wasn’t enough for my dry skin especially in the winter. I would wake up in the morning and my face would feel so dry. It would also pill up with the rest of my nighttime skincare products. Not impressed…
