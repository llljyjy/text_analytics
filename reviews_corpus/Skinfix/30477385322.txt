This gel cream is a nice, light consistency kind of like a water cream. I like the pump top so you donâ€™t have to dip your fingers into a pot of the product. I can definitely see that this product would be great for those with oily skin- I have dry skin, and this would be more of a summer product for me since my skin requires more heavy nourishment during the dryer months of the year. nan
