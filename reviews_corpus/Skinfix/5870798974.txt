So far I’m really enjoying this serum. It has been working wonders for my dry skin and it is very nourishing and blends out like butter. My skin feels so smooth and it’s perfect for repairing the skin barrier. My skin usually feels so rough and dry from the winter, but this has been a life saver! Amazing Serum
