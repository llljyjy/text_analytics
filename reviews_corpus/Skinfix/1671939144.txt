I love the skinfix barrier repair line! I have oily, acne-prone and sensitive skin. This triple lipid and collagen activating serum is great especially for this season when Iâ€™m dealing with some cold weather and dryness. This hydrates very well while still not being too heavy. My skin looks happier and feels healthy. Lovely
