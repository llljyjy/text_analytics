I received this product for free for my honest review, and I can honestly say I really enjoyed it! The pump was super convenient and hygienic and pushed out just enough product! The lotion itself was wonderful too! Very lightweight on the skin yet so hydrating! Iâ€™ve even used it on a healing tattoo and it worked wonders on it! I would recommend it and repurchase! Highly Recommend It!
