It’s a simple day moisturizer but with niacinamide  in it already so you can skip other serums. I love the glowy feel that is right after you apply in the morning. Doesn’t feel too heavy on the skin because it’s very light weight. It also has heptapeptide and zinc which help reduce oiliness throughout the day. Since summers are here i avoid oil based moisturizers instead gel cream which avoids excess sebum production. Skip the serums
