This has been working really well for my pre teen who is dealing with breakouts along with my occasional hormonal acne. We put a thin layer on at night and notice a huge improvement in size and redness by morning. It can be used up to 3x a day but our skin is sensitive so we use only once without any issues, but still recommend using good moisturizer and sun screen. It Works!
