This is only the second product I have ever gone as far as to call a “holy grail”—but for me, it really is one.I was two months into my retinoid journey (adapalene) when I picked this up. After two months of the retinol uglies, I was really starting to feel frustrated. Despite taking it really slow (1x/week…then finally working up to 2x and transitioning to 3x toward the end of month 2) with the retinoid, my skin’s barrier was constantly compromised, and it felt like there was no way to make retinoids work for me.Then I found this product. And it changed everything. Because my skin is oily, I learned I should only use it at night (since the product is so oil-forward, it’s just too much for me during the day). However, I have been using my retinoid more frequently and my skins barrier is in such great shape again (no peeling, no burning when I apply products to my face for pretty much the first time in my retinol journey). I really thought I was going to hate this product when I first put it in and felt how oily it is, but I will just NEVER go without it again. I am just so thoroughly impressed, and nothing I have tried before even comes remotely close to these results.The price tag seems steep, but it’s worth it IMO because it is so unlike anything else I’ve tried. I really have no product I can think of that even comes remotely close in terms of results. Also, I only use one pump on my face, neck, and chest, and it’s more than enough—so this product will likely last a while! Game changer for me—esp as retinoid user!
