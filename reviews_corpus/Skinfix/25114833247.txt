This moisturizer is one of the most moisturizing I have ever used. I will say however after 30 mins of application it does feel very light weight on the skin which I love. The only thing about it is the smell is horrible. I don’t know what it is but my nose hates it. I would pick the biossance omega repair cream over this one still but it’s a nice heavy duty moisturizer. extremely moisturizing but disgusting smell.
