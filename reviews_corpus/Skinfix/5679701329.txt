This was my first experience with a Skinfix product. I love that itâ€™s a cruelty free. The method of pumping the product out is very genius and I wish other companies would take notes. It just takes me about a pump and a half of the product to thoroughly cover my face and it feels very nice and not sticky, especially once it dries. It leaves my skin feeling very soft. Love it!
