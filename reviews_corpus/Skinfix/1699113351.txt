I love this! I have oily/combo skin and it’s always a challenge for me to find a cleanser that cleans without stripping. I use cetaphil to remove my makeup and this as a second cleanse. I only use a small amount and it covers my entire face- it doesn’t foam necessarily but I like that I can feel it on my skin while I’m cleansing (as opposed to some of the other more oil based cleansers). This is the first face wash I’ve ever used that doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight after washing. It seems pretty gentle but I do not have sensitive skin. Highly recommend! highly recommend!
