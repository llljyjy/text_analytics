I’ve been using the SkinFix Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream for about 2 weeks and here are my thoughts.  First, my skin is pretty normal but can get sensitive & reactive. I love their other products so I thought I’d give this a go. This contains some great ingredients like zinc PCA, niacinamide, green tea, squalane, hyaluronic acid & saccharide isomerate. I really love the lightweight texture & it absorbs well. It feels hydrating without the heaviness. I find it really soothing too. It’s made a great addition to my morning skincare routine. Normal, sensitive skin
