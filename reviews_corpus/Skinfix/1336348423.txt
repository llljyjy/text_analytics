I had heard a lot of good things about the Skinfix Acne+ 2% BHA Cleanser from many other skincare influencers so I was super excited to be gifted the cleanser by Skinfix to try in exchange for my honest opinion. So first impressions, this cleanser comes in a really nice easy to use squeeze tube packaging. The cleanser itself is very gentle and mild and perfect for use with a electronic cleansing device. I also found that the Skinfix Acne+ 2% BHA Cleanser lathers very well with just a little bit of product. The Skinfix Acne+ 2% BHA Cleanser promises to clear up skin and keep acne at bay by controlling sebum production with ingredients such as 2% salicylic acid in the form of BHA. As a person with oily to combination skin with some acne from masking since Covid, I noticed that the cleanser was great in keeping my t-zone area generally less oily and it was helpful in settling the acne and my inflamed skin where my maskne occurs. I would highly recommend the Skinfix Acne+ 2% BHA Cleanser to anyone looking for a mild cleanser that helps with acne. If you donâ€™t have acne issues, this cleanser is still good for preventative measures and daily use because it is so gentle. Great mild cleanser
