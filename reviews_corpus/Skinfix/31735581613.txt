First day of using it and I absolutely love how non-irritating it is! I have really dry, sensitive skin and this thankfully hasnâ€™t broken me out; it feels so silky on my skin + absorbs pretty fast, making it really comfortable to have on! I also love that it has niacinimide + heptapeptides, both amazing ingredients that I absolutely adore :)) Love it so far :))
