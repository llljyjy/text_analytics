I’ve been using this cleanser for almost 2 weeks, my skin hasn’t had any big breakouts. I have a oily tzone and have realized that I havent been as oily lately. I love that this cleanser has salicylic acid because it cleaned my pores. And the niacinamide minimized the look of my pores. The only thing I would say is I’m use to a product foaming and this didn’t. But over all it’s an amazing cleanser for acne prone skin. nan
