Love the cream itself, I would give it 5 stars but that’s not my issue... the refill DOES NOT work. It doesn’t fit in the original container and the pump doesn’t work. Frustrating because I threw all the packaging away and feel like I’d look stupid returning a refill with no lid or box to Sephora. Going to try to use it as if it was a tub of moisturizer but I’m not thrilled that I spent $40 on a faulty product. DONT BUY THE REFILL
