I have been using this product for a few months now and am a little disappointed in the product. Though my skin feels moisturized it is extremely shiny and my oils seem to be out of control. When I wake up in the morning I have an oily sheen on my face, which is what I was trying to avoid with this gel cream. I tried it during the day with no other product and still experienced the same issue. wanted to love it! Not for oily skin
