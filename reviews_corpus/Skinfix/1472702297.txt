Didn’t work for my skin at all. Within two days of use in the morning & at night, my skin was uncomfortably dry everywhere especially around my chin and mouth. Worst of all, I had 15+ tiny whiteheads all over my chin and forehead and this was the only new product I used so I can attribute the breakouts we’re likely from this, either an ingredient in it or just my skin trying to overcompensate for dryness but producing sebum which clogged my pores. nan
