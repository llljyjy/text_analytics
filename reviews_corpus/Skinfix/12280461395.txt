I was really wowed by the ingredients I saw was on this cleanser. A cleanser with actives to me doesn’t really work unless you mask it. This one has been my cleansing/mask duo that I love. It doesn’t have any fragrance or anything deterring me from enjoying it. It doesn’t dry up my skin and has helped with acne tremendously. nan
