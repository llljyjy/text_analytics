I don’t know if this product is good for combination skin and acne prone skin. I’m in my mid 20s, have acne prone skin, and am combination. I live in Florida. This product is nice but it’s very thick. I’ll apply a small amount and feel it leaving my skin greasy. I’ve been using it for about a month now but can definitely say I wouldn’t buy it again. I’m sure it’s be a good product for those that live in cold climates and have drier skin Not for acne prone/oily
