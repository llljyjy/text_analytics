This kit is a great way to try out the majority of the products from Skinfix’s Eczema+ line.  The dermatitis face balm is full size, has a jelly-like consistency, and is my new holy grail.  I had a patch of flaky, dry skin above my eyelid for months.  Moisturizers and eye creams hydrated it and made it temporarily disappear, but once the hydration wore off, the flakiness was visible again.  Within a week of using Skinfix’s face balm daily, the dry patch was completely healed and it hasn’t returned.  The body wash lathers well and cleans the skin without stripping its moisture.  The hand cream and body balm have thick paste consistencies so they penetrate deeply into the skin and provide long-lasting hydration.  Other hand and body lotions sink in quickly so I have to re-apply every few hours to feel the benefits.  With Skinfix’s body balm and hand cream, I only need to apply twice per day.  The hand cream has helped prevent the red, itchy scales that usually develop on my hands from being outside in the cold during the fall and winter.  All of these products have little to no scent so they won’t irritate sensitive skin. Skin saviors for dry, flaky patches on face/body!
