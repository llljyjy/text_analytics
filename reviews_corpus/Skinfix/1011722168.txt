I used to love skinfix lip balms when they came in flavours, but for some reason this one just isn’t the same. Maybe the formula has changed? It feels good at first, but then my lips just feel greasy, and then they dry out again. I wouldn’t buy this again, especially at this price. Oily and tastes bad
