I experienced some sort of dermatitis rash that started in one eyebrow, and eventually moved to my eyelid, my upper and bottom lash line, and my lower eye area. It also spread to my other eye. I believe it was caused by self tanner (st. tropez). I had to use this product for several days in a row before seeing results (which is fine with me!). Some reviewers wrote that they experienced immediate relief with this product, I did not. I actually felt more itchy the first few days I applied this to my eyelids. But I stayed consistent, and it eventually cleared up both eyes! It took about 6-7 days. I applied generously at night and then would apply a light layer in the morning before work. I did not wear ANY makeup while wearing this. It did leave a shiny residue on my skin, but thankfully no one at work really said anything lol, plus I didn’t really care- I’d rather look oily than deal with that awful flakey/itchy rash again. I took 1 star off because it is rather expensive for such a small amount. I also wish less was dispensed at a time, it sometimes was hard to control how much came out. Regardless of the price point I would purchase again because it does work! I will use this at night if I notice the dermatitis returning and it works amazingly. Thank you, skinfix!!! Stay Consistent & Patient- It Works!!!
