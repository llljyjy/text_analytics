I think this is a nice acne treatment, I would say itâ€™s a bit mild and not super strong so it would work well for those with sensitive skin I think. BHA is what works best for me and my skin when  it comes to dealing with breakouts so this did a good job of drying them out and getting rid of my breakouts. Really nice!
