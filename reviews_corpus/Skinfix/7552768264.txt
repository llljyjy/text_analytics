I absolutely love Skinfix, it’s an amazing brand and I love that all products are tested and reviewed by unbiased derms. The packaging is great, it’s very sturdy and functional and I love the way it dispenses. It’s a beautiful gel texture that feels amazing on the skin. It’s lightweight and comfortable, ans provides long lasting hydration. It absorbs quickly and instantly moisturizes. Ingredients like niacinamide, heptapeptides, and Zinc PCA help restore, strengthen,balance, and protect the skin barrier. nan
