I have super sensitive, dehydrated and acne primer skin so I’m always v nervous about trying new products but I am so glad I started using this skinfix serum!! It’s so hydrating and leaves me with a beautiful glow that lasts all day! It’s sooo gentle, my skin absolutely loves this product. I use it every morning & night as my last step (before sunscreen ofc) and also as a primer before makeup!! sensitive, acne prone skin friendly!!
