This is a really good balm for not only eczema but also really dry skin.  I get a couple dry patches on my eyelids this time of year, and this balm has worked wonders!  The ingredients list is free of any parabens, phthalates, preservatives and silicones, and they are cruelty free.  The balm does contain 5% colloidal oatmeal which is great for eczema.  The balm has a very light scent of sweet almond oil and beeswax, and it is super thick and moisturizing.  I apply it before bed so it can work overnight and wake up to super soft skin.  Finally, the packaging is made from 100% recycled paper with vegetable inks.  I definitely recommend this Skinfix product! Awesome product!
