My skin gets painfully dry in the winter no matter how hard I try to keep it moisturized. I decided to try this after hearing a YouTuber talk about it. I can not believe how good it is. The texture is almost a hybrid of a lotion and a balm so the moisture feels really sealed in and it lasts all night. It also absorbs Nicely when I put it on during the day. I recently ran out and tried another top selling Sephora moisturizer I had from a kit and it was no where near as moisturizing as this. If you live in a dry climate or have dry skin this is a must try product. Also, bonus points for having refills. Mind Blowingly Good
