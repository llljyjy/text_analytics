I love that Skinfix created these handy kits with travel friendly sizes of the skincare lines. It’s a great way to try out different products to figure out what you like and what works best. For me, since I’m getting “older“ (42) I figure it’s time to start with some preventative skincare to keep a healthy look and glow. Barrier+ Besties seemed like the logical choice. The cleanser is creamy and creates a light lather and a little goes a long way. It effectively removed my makeup, felt gentle and didn’t dry out my skin. The triple lipid peptide cream was a little heavy and sat on my skin a while before absorbing. I probably would only use this if I noticed a dry patch. The triple lipid hyaluronic Serum is actually a cream (I expected something lighter) which absorbed quickly and the eye cream was a similar texture and also absorbed quickly. Overall I’m happy with the set and benefits. Great travel-friendly set
