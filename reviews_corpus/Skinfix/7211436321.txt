I’ve unfortunately had problem skin since middle school and I’ve tried pretty much every brand or product out there. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that consistency is key - there’s no such thing as a miracle product. That being said, I’ve been consistent with this cleanser and gel for 2 weeks now and I see a HUGE reduction in my redness and evening out of my skin texture. I’m looking forward to seeing how my skin reacts after long term use, especially as we’re getting into dry skin season! Stay consistent for results!
