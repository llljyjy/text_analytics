I’m honestly obsessed with everything about this product. I love the packaging and how it’s refillable. I love that it’s vegan and cruelty free. I love how lightweight the product itself is. I love that it has niacinamide in it. And I looooove that I don’t have to stick my finger into the product to pick it up!! This cream is super lightweight, super moisturizing, and just makes my skin feel soft and dewy throughout the day. I did receive this product as a gift but I will 100% be buying it after it’s done, and I recommend it to everyone. nan
