My new favorite acne spot treatment. First at all I love skinfix so I never have doubts about trying this product. The ingredients are the bomb 10% Azelaic acid, Niacinamide and salicylic acid. Great combination for fighting acne.  It Is not greasy, it blends very Well. My only recommendation is not to use more than one or maximum two times per day, because it can dry your skin, but the results are amazing. My new favorite spot treatment
