These pads are a wonderful idea for the body with AHA/BHA exfoliation but they need to be more saturated.  I ordered a jar and thought I got a bad batch one because they were so dry and two because it was not sealed.  I went to my local Sephora to exchange them only to find out all of the jars are not sealed and all of them were dry.  If you donâ€™t mind the pads not being complete wet and saturated then you will love this product.  For me I had too returned them  because I felt that one pad did not cover enough of my body let alone one are. Great idea, but pads are too dry
