This cleanser was decent, not a top favorite but still effective and ideal for acne-prone skin. I found the light scent to be quite medicinal. It lathered nicely and did feel smooth on my skin, not too abrasive or irritating, and my skin didnâ€™t feel stripped after using it either. I would definitely recommend it for combo to oily skin types only due to the way it cleansed the skin. I received this product complimentary for review purposes, all opinions are my own. nan
