This moisturizer is a game changer. I tried this because with the cold weather I was getting dry patches on my face and my other moisturizers just weren’t doing the job. This stuff is really thick and heavy and after 2 days of use my dry patches on my face were completely gone!! I want to have a subscription to order this every month so I never run out!The one con is the packaging... every time i go to grab the jar i notice the letters coming off on my hands which is just a little annoying but i’ll live with it since i love the lotion so much. Total Game Changer!
