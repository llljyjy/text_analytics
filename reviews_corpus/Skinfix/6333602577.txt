The SkinFix BHA Cleanser works wonders for clearing up a current acne outbreak. I had a bad stress outbreak and within 3 days of using the cleanser once a day it cleared up all my active acne. It feels nice and exfoliating when using and foams up nicely. The biggest downside is that it makes me VERY oily, so I only use it when I have an outbreak of acne. nan
