I was excited to try this new gel formula, i needed a new moisturizer and this is working perfectly. It’s a nice lightweight formula and sinks well into my skin. I live in a humid climate so I’m loving the gel texture and  I definitely feel like my skin is more hydrated since I started using! Love this new formula!
