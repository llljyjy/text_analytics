I’ve been loving this serum. I’ve been using a benzoyl peroxide wash so my skin has been a bit dry and this has been helping to keep my skin balanced without any irritation. Like all Skinfix products this is a vary “safe” formula for my sensitive, acne prone skin. My only dislike is the packaging. I love the pump, I just dislike how long the cap is. It’s not the end of the world, but it’s just an awkward design for no reason. Overall I have really been enjoying this, although I do feel it’s overpriced. I don’t think I would repurchase this item when I’m done, but I like it for what it is now. nan
