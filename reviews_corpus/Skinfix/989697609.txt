I am a huge fan of SkinFix. Their night barrier cream is a staple in my skincare routine. So I was excited to try this new serum. Wow, it is fantastic. As a 46 year old woman, I need something to help combat aging and this has definitely helped. Since starting using this serum, I have seen improvements especially in the all important undereye area. This serum is a definite must to add to your skincare routine. A great addition to my skincare routine
