This is an excellent facial moisturizer for anyone with dry skin. Itâ€™s so thick and rich. I was previously using Cerave PM at night before bed and it was drying my skin out so, so bad. I switched to this one and after a day my face was back to how it should be. Makes my skin feel soft and hydrated all day long. Highly recommend this cream especially for night time! Great Moisturizing Cream
