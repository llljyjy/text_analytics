My skin gets so dry in the winter months that it practically cracks when I smile. This ultra-gentle, non-irritating serum instantly hydrates and feels like a tall glass of water for my parched skin. I layer it over my essence and under my thick moisturizer. It moisturizes, layers, beautifully, and plumps up my skin with a healthy dewy finish. Instant hydration!
