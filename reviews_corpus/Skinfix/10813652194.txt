I have been using this on acne scars and upcoming pimples and it has worked well for me! I do not have acne prone skin, however, I have been getting isolated breakouts due to masks. This has been working really well for me on the occasional pimples and also helps reduce the appearance of them after they are dying down. Would recommend! nan
