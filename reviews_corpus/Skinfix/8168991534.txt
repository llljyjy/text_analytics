I just used this product for the first time and I am really digging it! Overall It did not dry out my skinLike I thought I would! My skin felt clean and soft after using it!  The smell is a little odd but I prefer face wash without fragrance or dye! I love that it is vegan and cruelty free. Plus cute packaging! I am excited to see how this does I. The long haul and if it helps with my stubborn acne patches. Works great with sensitive skin!
