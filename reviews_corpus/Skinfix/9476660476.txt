I’m a huge fan of skin fix products. They have great ingredients and they tend to work really well for me. I like the texture of this spot treatment. It’s more of a cream than a gel which makes it easy to spread out. I tend to have large cystic acne and I find this doesn’t really help that much. I feel like it would work better for clogged pores than cystic acne. Not for cystic acne
