This is a really nice kit that has helped my very dry, flaky peeling skin.  The hand repair improved the peeling on my hands during the very first use.  The body balm is extremely thick and moisturizing. Since it’s white and so thick, it is hard to rub in thoroughly to where it’s not white on the skin anymore. The face face balm is moisturizing without leaving the face greasy so it can be used with makeup. The body wash is perfect for my sensitive skin and doesn’t irritate it.  I like that all these wonderful products come together in one kit and i highly recommend it to those with eczema or even just really dry skin. Great Kit
