This was my first time testing out this cream, and I really like the packaging because most moisturizers and creams don’t come in a application like this. If you get irritated with certain fragrances, I don’t recommend this cream as it has a heavier scent then I prefer. I do like how hydrating and moisturizing it is, but it leaves a slight greasy feeling. nan
