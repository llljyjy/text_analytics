I have both acne and dry skin, and salicylic acid serums can feel a bit drying. If that is the case for you as well, this may be a perfect fit for your needs.What this is: a 2% salicylic acid treatment made with soothing ingredients (green tea) and anti-redness ingredients (niacinamide, licorice, azelaic acid). This combo is practically unheard of, especially in such a non-irritating, fragrance-free formula. There is a bit of kaolin, which acts to draw out oils - perfect for a spot treatment as well.  The product does not feel drying when applied though.What I’ve found is that it decreases the size of my pimples overnight, and an important detail - it STAYS ON!! While this does mean you’ll have to wash off in the AM, I’m happy that it stays on through the night.My only minor critique is that I would love to know the percentage of azelaic acid- really just for curiosity’s sake! It’s listed second in the ingredients list which I would say is quite exciting. Whatever percent it is at seems to work well for me!Great product! Great for dry skin with acne
