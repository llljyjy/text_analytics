I’ve been looking for a moisturizer that works well for my combination skin - hydrates in all the right places, but doesn’t make my t-zone look like an oil slick. This moisturizer fits the bill! I love the airtight pump packaging, which makes the product so easy to dispense the correct amount while not having to worry about contamination. The gel formula is nice and light and perfect for both day and night, summer and winter. The texture isn’t thick like a cream would be and feels cool and smooth when applied to my face. Because it’s so light, it absorbs more quickly and provides a smooth canvas for my makeup application during the day. nan
