No guys..this moisturizer is not it. I only use face moisturizers that are fragrance free and this one smells cheap and like play dough. Also, just FYI, I remember seeing this brand years ago selling for significantly less..it seems that when they got in with sephora the price drastically increased. Don’t spend your hard earned money on this one. Smells like play dough …
