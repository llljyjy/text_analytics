I have not met many cleansers I would say are AMAZING or felt the need to rave about, but this one from SkinFix has earned it. My face feels soft, supple, and plump afterwards - and clean! It never feels stripping or irritating, even when my face is particularly red or sensitive. Most nights I use it as a single cleanse, but because it’s an oil cleanser, it’s a great 1st cleanse for the days when I’ve worn makeup, too. Love the ease of the pump packaging. A+++ cleanser
