I really wanted to like this. I was using cerave and wanted to switch to something cruelty free. But after using it for a month my skin got worse. I have small painful breakouts on my chin and cheeks. I have to switch back to cerave and hope that it gets better soon. I also got the barrier cream and that could also be making me breakout but I have a feeling it was more the cleanser. Sometimes I would tone with Paulaâ€™s choice bha and I could see dirt coming off after I washed my face. Overall definitely do not buy this is you have sensitive acne prone skin that is also dry. I will give it to my mom to finish up because I do think she would like it. Small painful breakouts :(
