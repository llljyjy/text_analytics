what I loved is seeing such a difference I saw a glow, a shine and stunning texture in my skin. I decided to change out my serum to skin fix and Iâ€™m pretty happy with my results . Love the ingredients and the packaging was cute it was my first time using skin fix brand. Plus I do have a dry/ sensitive skin so had no reaction I love the serum and happy to got a good experience with it. Perfect Shine
