I always keep a pimple treatment product in my skincare cabinet just in case I get a random breakout, and I’m so glad I picked this one! This treatment is surprisingly creamier and not a gel like consistency like other ones I’ve tried, but I’ve used it twice now and my pimples always look way less inflamed the day after. Would recommend! nan
