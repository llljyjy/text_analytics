Skinfix makes such wonderful skincare products. I use the Skinfix Triple Lipid + Collagen Activating Serum in my evening skincare routine. I love that this serum combines collagen and niacinamide, two of my favorite ingredients. This serum can be used in conjunction with Vitamin C and Retinol products. Love it!
