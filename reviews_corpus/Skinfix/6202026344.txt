I was so excited to try this product because I struggle with hormonal, under the skin acne that can take ages to dry up and heal. This product does a great job at jump starting the healing process and drying out the pore! I think $30 for this product is a bit high, because there are also AHA/BHA treatments at the drugstore that work well too! 4 stars because it works well, not quite 5 because I can find cheaper alternatives! I donâ€™t know if I would repurchase this, but with the small bit that you use, it will take anyone forever to use it up! nan
