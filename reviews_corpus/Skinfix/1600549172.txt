Impressions of this product; decent size for the price, but definitely not inexpensive. The ingredients are A+, and definitely geared towards treating acne. I found that with consistent, twice daily use, it did help reduce the size and inflammation of active pimples. Product provided gratis in exchange for feedback. A little pricy, but does the job
