As an acne sufferer, I’m a big fan of this cleanser. It has salicylic acid, glycolic acid, AND azelaic acid (to de-clog pores, exfoliate, and prevent breakouts). Plus it’s got niacinamide for brightening. It is a tiny bit drying, which for most oily-skinned people like myself, is not an issue.  If you’re having issues with drying, you can switch to using it every other day or a few days a week. It’s great for facial acne and body acne. Great acne treatment to keep in your arsenal
