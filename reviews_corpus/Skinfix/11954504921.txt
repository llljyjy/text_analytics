I was looking for a new face wash for my acne prone and sensitive skin and this one has been great. It has helped clear my stubborn acne and overall make my skin look better. I take off the star because of 2 reasons. First, $35for 5oz of a product I use everyday gets expensive and second, I don’t like the packaging. It’s hard to get the product out at the end. But overall, I would recommend this. Do recommend
