This definitely earned a spot on the shelf for life. Its in my skin care hall of fame now. I bought my first bottle last winter and it has been repurchased everytime Ive ran out since. A eczema flare up made me reach for this originally. Within one use I noticed significantly reduced redness the next morning. I reach for this during the winter months or when my skin flares up&needs some regulation&extra gentle tlc. It leaves skin feeling clean, without a tight stripping feeling. Great for sensitive skin& eczema. Staple Product
