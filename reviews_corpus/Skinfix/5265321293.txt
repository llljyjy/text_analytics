Having oily skin, I needed a moisturizer that was going to keep me hydrated but also feel lightweight. Because it has a gel-cream consistency it was perfect. It made my skin feel so hydrated and supple. It would help with the dry patches my skin was recently developing and made my skin feel so healthy! I also love the packaging! So sanitary and easy to use! nan
