Love the feeling of this gel moisturizer! It’s great for morning and night use and doesn’t leave my face feeling like there is a thick layer on it. I barely needed any product to cover my face and really enjoy the dispenser pump. There is no fragrance which I do not mind. This works for me on days where my skin has dry patches as well as when I feel oily. I even use it at night when I like to have extra moisture. nan
