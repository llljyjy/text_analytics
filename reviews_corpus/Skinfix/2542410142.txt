This is the only new product I recently added into my skincare regimen so I am positive this is the reason I am breaking out. I agree with other commenters that this moisturizer is on the greasier side which I don’t mind now that winter is approaching. I am giving this two stars because though I appreciate pump dispensers, I did also experience issues with it not pumping any product initially. Unfortunately, this just didn’t work out for me and for the price, it was a disappointing experience overall. I will be returning it and going back to using my tried and true products. Disappointed
