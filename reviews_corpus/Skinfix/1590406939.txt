It’s excellent.  Almost basic in a Chanel 10 cream kind of way.  This will not irritate sensitive skin.  I don’t love the packaging although I like how it dispenses the perfect amount of product.  It seems to only last 2 to 3 months so it seems a little expensive.  I have very dry, reactive, sensitive skin and this works very well!  I’m afraid to use anything else! nan
