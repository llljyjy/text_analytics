Finally some relief for my dry winter skin! I love the texture of this serum. The cream/lotion-like consistency makes my face (and hands) feel less irritated and tight. The pain is gone and so is the inflammation. I canâ€™t use it nightly because the ingredients are known to be pore-clogging, but paired with my SkinFix Lipid Gel, my skin is set!! Amazing!!!
