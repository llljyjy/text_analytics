Ok I’m shook how good this actually works!!! It’s a ‘Clean at Sephora’ product that’s highly concentrated (clinical-strength) and effectively works to improve any forms of acne!! I’ve been using this Skinfix Acne Spot Treatment for a few days on a huge zit I just got near my nose and omg within 2 days it’s decreased so much!!!! This works yall!! It’s anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory soo any acne doesn’t stan a chance! To use I did this: I applied directly onto my acne areas (after cleansing, toning and moisturizing) a few times daily… I actually tapped the product on the acne areas and made sure a thin layer stays on them as well… then boom! My acne definitely improved so much as you can tell by my before/after pic! I highly recommend you try this!! It works yall!!
