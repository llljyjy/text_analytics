I love this Skin Fix Triple Lipid and Collagen activating serum. It is amazing and it has helped my skin tone a lot. It seems to help me with my loss of elastin. It gave me more hydration than my last serums.  I used this after I wash my face then I use my moisturizer.  I find this serum works well with my retinol products and or Vitamin C products. I use this in the morning and at night on my face and neck and the back of my hands.  I am very pleased with my results. Gorgeous Product
