This gel cream felt so soothing on my oily skin areas. I love the way it applies and easily smooths on to my skin not making it feel greasy or weird. I love this because it feels so much suitable for my skin in the most problematic areas. I also saw this did not break me out and any redness that I had was calmed down thanks to this formula. Not to mention the oily areas were more balanced now and I didnâ€™t feel like washing it off unlike other creams I have tried. Great one!
