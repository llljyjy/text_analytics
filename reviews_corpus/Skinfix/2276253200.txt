This gel cream is very lightweight and easy to absorb. 2% Niacinamide helps with my overall skin tone and refine the pore size. Peptides are essential for anti-aging. The ingredients is great for sensitive skin, no fragrance whatsoever. Squalane is the second ingredient which is known for lock in moisture and repair skin barrier. Love it~ nan
