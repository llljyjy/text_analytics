This face cream has changed everything for me. I have extremely dry skin in winters and using this every morning and night has made my skin so plump and hydrated. This cream is worth all the hype. It’s working for me better than any other cream out there. Though it’s expensive I would continue to stick to this cream. No more flaky dry skin and am happy with how hydrating my face is throughout the day. Works Amazing!
