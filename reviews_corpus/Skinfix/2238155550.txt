I really enjoy this product for my skin. The thickness is spot on and it truly feels great. Nothing is ever *truly* unscented and it does have a bit of a smell that almost reminds me of chlorine. However, it goes away really quickly. BUT. I give the packaging 1 star. It’s terrible. All the writing has worn off and after awhile you have to unscrew the top to get it out because the pump doesn’t work. Also it’s a very large jar for the amount you get. At the moment, I’m not going to repurchase, I’m going to try something out. If I don’t find something that I like better I will repurchase this. 5 Star Product, 1 Star Packaging
