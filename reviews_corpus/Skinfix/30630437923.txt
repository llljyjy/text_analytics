This product was given free from skinfix for exchange my honest review.This is a restorative cream featuring 5% colloidal oatmeal.  The so-called oat colloid is to grind the oat kernel into fine powder and then make it into a colloid. It is rich in active ingredients such as beta-glucan and avenanthramide.  Among them, β-glucan can strengthen the skin’s immune barrier, resist ultraviolet radiation damage, and promote wound healing. 丨Oat anthracnamide - anti-oxidant, calming and soothing Avenanthramide has excellent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and soothing effects; and ferulic acid in oats is a comprehensive little expert, can effectively fight free radicals, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, to absorb ultraviolet rays, whitening, have one-handed,  The combination of the three is strong, and it is very suitable for after-sun repair and first aid. In addition, this cream also adds ceramide, squalane and other ingredients to repair the skin barrier, and does not add common irritating ingredients such as fragrance and alcohol, and can also be used for sensitive skin repair.  I recently used a high concentration of salicylic acid products, and my skin was a little peeling. After using this product, my skin condition gradually returned to stability.  The effect of the product is still very good, but the amount is too small. The formal size is only 13.5g, which is not as large as some products.  The price/performance ratio is not too high. Good face balm
