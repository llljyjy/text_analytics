I absolutely love the blend of ingredients in this. salicylic acid and niacinamide are two ofmy favorite ingredients ever, because they treat my skin so well. I have been using this for about a week now and Iâ€™ve been liking it. the consistency is very thin and unique, but I like it. I love how easy it is to wash off too! and it is very gentle on the skin. nan
