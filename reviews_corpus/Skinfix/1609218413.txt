I am LOVING Skinfix’s barrier+ peptide cream. I have facial skin that is very reactive to skincare (I break out like 70% of the time I introduce a new product). When I find something like this that has no unnecessary fragrance or dye and it’s meant to be gentle, I know I have a good chance of avoiding the purge phase. I’ve been using this cream for about a week, morning and night, and have had no breakouts so far, which is a miracle for a heavier cream. This seems like a great option for people who are using heavy actives like tretinoin and who need a moisturizer that isn’t going to add anything harsh to their already strong routine. For those people who say it’s greasy, I think they may be using too much. Just start with less than you think. nan
