Iâ€™m all about restoring my skin barrier as it is the most important part of keeping your skin healthy to prevent any issues. After using this product, there is immediate hydration, glow and pump to your skin. It moisturized my face like no other especially after a long night in the winter with the head on (dry dehydrated skin). I love using it as a base and applying other products as needed, but the serum alone works wonders!! Life saver!
