I was gifted the Skinfix Eczema Care Kit and to say I was very excited was an understatement. When I got the chance to review this Eczema kit I was so stoked, I myself suffer from Eczema outbreaks but lately they have been getting worse & making me feel more self-conscious. My hands looked so bad I wouldn’t put nail polish on or take pictures anywhere near my hands mainly because I just didn’t want to draw ANY extra attention to them. I’ve tried numerous OTC creams and lotions I even tried soaking them but I couldn’t find anything that helped, most would work “ok“ for a little while. They would relieve the itching for a bit or moisturize my hands until i washed them. Hot water was the worst pain ever but I had to keep my hands clean so I had to wash my hands in cold water. Nothing actually cleared up my eczema it just masked it. I was never able to find anything that would clear the redness. My hands looked like they had been scalded in hot water. The Skinfix Eczema Care Kit is on the way to completely clearing everything up. I’ve only been using the kit for a short time especially the one for hands and have to say I’m getting some good results from this. Within a week the itching was almost completely gone and my hands weren’t nearly as dry. Within a month the redness was completely gone so that even I couldn’t tell where the eczema had been. It takes a little bit of time but trust me it works. I would highly recommend the Skinfix Eczema Care Kit to anyone that has skin issues. I think this could be on my hero kits. My new hero Kit
