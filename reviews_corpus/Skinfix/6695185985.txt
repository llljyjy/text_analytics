love love love this moisurizer. I’m currently on accutane and needed something to quench my terribly dry and peeling skin, and this was the fix. I’ve been using it for 3 months now, super hydrating, a bit heavy, but definitely worth it for dry skin. I️ do have to say though, if layering w any serums, it will pill. So hydrating!!
