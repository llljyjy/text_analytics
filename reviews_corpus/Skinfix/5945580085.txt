I had severe eczema on my hands and face when I used this and I do think it helped some. It didnâ€™t work wonders but it is soothing and calms the skin. I would recommend this in combinations with other treatments. I did notice a good amount of improvement when using this on eye eczema. I have used like 6293 other creams and this one is one of the best along with bag balm from the drugstore. I would say it is a good investment
