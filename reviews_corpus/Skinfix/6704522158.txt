I wanted to love this moisturizer because it was clean, hydrating, and absorbed well—but unfortunately it broke me out. Within a week of starting to use this moisturizer I developed lots of small whiteheads. The whiteheads went away within a few days after I stopped using the product. Disappointed—Caused Breakouts
