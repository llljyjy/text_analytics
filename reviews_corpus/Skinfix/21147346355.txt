I would give this 5/5 if weren’t for the price. It’s truly a dry skin type’s saviour! It’s more than just a no-frills moisturizer. It has Ceramides and Fatty Acids to replenish your skin barrier, Peptides & Hyaluronic Acid to plump and hydrate skin, and Rice extracts to soothe and brighten. It’s really thicc dense texture so if you’re oily I’d avoid this. nan
