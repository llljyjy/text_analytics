Iâ€™ve struggled with acne since I was about 12 and now Iâ€™m an adult and Iâ€™ve never seen anything clear my skin like this. Its been a week and my skin is almost completely clear and itâ€™s smooth. It hurt me to take a star off, but the product came half empty ðŸ˜• gonna keep using it anyways but dang. Holy grail but half empty.
