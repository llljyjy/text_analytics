I donâ€™t understand why this product has such high reviews. The gel is very thick and even one pump is too much product (the directions recommend one or two pumps, twice a day). It also pills under makeup. Worse yet though is how little product is actually inside the container despite how big and heavy it looks. I ran out of this under a month after buying, even while only using one pump of it twice and later once a day. I was so excited to try this product since it seemed like it would address all my skin concerns perfectly, but I am so disappointed. I will never buy this again. Gigantic waste of money and plastic
