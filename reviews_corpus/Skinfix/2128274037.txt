Salicylic acid spot treatments have helped me with my maskne quite a bit this past year, and I was impressed with this one. At first, it has the texture of moisturizer but then it dries really matte. I donâ€™t think makeup would apply well on top of this one because it dries so matte. But it works amazingly well as an overnight spot treatment. I had a few blemishes that I was pretty sure would become full on pimples the next morning, but the redness and size of the pimple diminished overnight! I definitely will keep using this one. nan
