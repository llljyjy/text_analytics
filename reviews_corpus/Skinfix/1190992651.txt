Age 40, getting drier and irritated with starting tretinoin, in northeast. One of the best creams to help! Woke up with soft, plumper skin. It’s super greasy so I wouldn’t use in AM. Try not to get it in your eyes it burns. I love this with Krave beauty’s great barrier relief, and lanbelle cream for the morning. great for dry skin
