Hydrating, calming, protecting are just some of the words I would use to describe this serum. I love how great it lays under moisturizer and also makeup. Its the perfect first step for a simple yet effective skincare routine. I absolutely love how it makes my skin look, and immediately with even the first use my skin looked and felt more plump, supple and soft. A great serum!
