I have a combination skin type that is on the dryer side. I use this at night after I cleanse and dry my face.I love the pump on this product as it keeps the product sanitary and is easy to measure. I apply this lightly all over my face and, make a note, a little goes a long way. The gel cream is lightweight, on the oily and thicker side, however, it absorbs so nicely! It hydrates without leaving it feeling sticky or tacky. With the active lipids, peptides, and small particle hyaluronic acid in the product, my face looks significantly brighter and has improved my skinâ€™s overall elasticity. I genuinely recommend this if you are looking to highly help absorb excess oil, refine the appearance of pores, and moisturize while firming. This is great for winter months as your skin feels incredibly hydrated all day! Incredibly Hydrating & Restoring Gel Cream
