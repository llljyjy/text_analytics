WISH I COULD GIVE IT SIX STARS for treating dermatitis with allergic/reactive skin. Every time I get a cold, I develop brutal dermatitis around my nostrils/upper lip from blowing my nose. I also have reoccurring eczema on my eyelids. I decided to try this product after 2 weeks of nothing helping my most recent flare up. This treatment completely healed my swollen, flaking, bright red, itchy, painful and dry patch of dermatitis in 3 DAYS. A lot of the reviews said that it is just expensive vaseline - that is far from the truth when it comes to a bad bout of dermatitis. Vaseline has done the job for me with a mild reaction, but over the past two weeks it wasn’t making any difference. I then tried Aquafor - but was disappointed when it made it even worse. Like many cica creams and skincare marketed for sensitive skin, Aquafor has panthenol in it…. I am one of the very unlucky people who reacts to panthenol, so it was hard to find a product  without it that would take care of my dermatitis - then came in Skinfix!!!!Although it is pricey for the amount, if you have skin that reacts to even ingredients marketed for “sensitive skin” this is WORTH IT. I saw many complaints about the small bottle, but a little goes a long way and it is not something I would use in my every day skincare routine. I will definitely be keeping a tube on hand for the next flare up. WORTH IT for dermatitis with allergy prone skin
