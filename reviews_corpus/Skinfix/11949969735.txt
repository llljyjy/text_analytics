After spending money on dozens of moisturizers, this is the only one doing what I need. It penetrates my skin yet leaves a protective layer on top which works amazingly against difficult weather. Great for my sensitive skin, no irritation or stinging whatsoever. I have gone through multiple tubs. Favourite moisturizer for my dry sensitive skin
