Sometimes I get random acne spots that pop out throughout the month (usually during my period) and I needed something that was going to calm those red spots down as well as pass the test for my sensitive skin. I really like how this cleanser feels on my face. I have sensitive skin and this doesnâ€™t cause any flare ups instead it actually calms my redness and gives me noticeably smaller pores. I love that it has BHA in it! nan
