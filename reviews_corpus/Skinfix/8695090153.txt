(gifted in exchange for honest review) I tend to pay more for my serums than any other step so while the price doesn’t look inviting, I’m here for it when it works! My skin feels plump, hydrated & just feels healthy when using this. No issues with my other products, plays well & no pilling! So far I’ve noticed my skin looking bright & even with less redness for sure. As with anything I need to use this longer to speak to the long term benefits, but first impressions are solid! Solid serum!
