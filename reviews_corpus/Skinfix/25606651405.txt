Really wanted to love this and waited till I used all of it to form an opinion but it’s just not good. It feels kind of nice but it literally just sits on your face so not even sure if it’s actually helping if the skin isn’t absorbing it at all. I have dry skin but since this just sits there I end up looking oily. No hope of wearing make up after because the skin is still so slick. I even tried using a minuscule amount but no matter what it doesn’t get absorbed. Really bummed about this one. Really not worth it
