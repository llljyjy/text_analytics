this gel cream applied very smoothly. I have combination skin and it tends to be acne prone so Iâ€™ve been trying to find something that fits everything because I believe my acne is due to dry skin. overall, my impression after using it for a week is really good and I can see a visible difference in the moisture of my skin. nan
