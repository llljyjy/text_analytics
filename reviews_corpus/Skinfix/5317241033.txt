I’d describe this as a blessing in a bottle. I have super sensitize, acne prone skin (even as a 32 year old) so I’m always nervous to try new face washes since they seem to be the one skincare product that always breaks me out.However, I saw the reviews for this and decided to give it a try. My face was so milky and smooth afterwards. I woke up the next morning with no breakouts, only freshly dewyness. I’ll be keeping this one in my routine forever! Milky, Dewy, Soft, Wonderful
