No breakouts, doesn’t make me oily, and the skinfix website also lists this as noncomedogenic for anyone wondering :)I have really sensitive skin that’s prone to clogged pores/blemishes and I’ve always had a hard time finding products that didn’t enrage my skin. I had been using cetaphil lotion for a few years, idk why but it was the only one that worked for me but I wanted something ~new~ so I tried this and I rlyyyy like it!! For reference, I tried Cerave and it gave me a red rash all over my face so I was nervous to try this but I haven’t had a reaction to it!!I have normal/combo skin usually but with the winter weather it’s been 10x more dry and this cream has helped moisturize without making me break out. It’s also helped with the lines between my eyebrows that I get from being stressed or squinting without my glasses. I love the container and the little pump it comes with, but I wish there was more product for the price. Also, I noticed if I apply too much it pills on my skin which is annoying but other than that I like it a lot :) skinfix website lists this as noncomedogenic btw
