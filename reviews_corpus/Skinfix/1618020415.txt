I’d heard great things about this product and really love skin care products that use a pump style like this one to minimize the product’s exposure to air. However, despite having rather dry skin, applying this felt like putting a thick sunscreen on my face that mostly just sat there. Maybe this would just work as a night cream or a solo face product, but I also use the Clarins serum every morning and I’m not sure if they don’t mesh well. I switched over to Tula’s daily moisturizer and my skin feels much softer. Didn’t Absorb Well
