I am a huge fan of this gel cream! I have combination/oily acne-prone skin and this moisturizer is the perfect texture for my skin. It leaves my face feeling hydrated and nourished without feeling greasy! I love the packaging too, it is an airless pump and ensures that the product remains clear if any potential contaminants! Great for combo acne prone skin!
