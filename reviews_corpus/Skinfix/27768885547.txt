I love this product! I have acne prone skin and this has helped my skin tremendously! The only downside and why i gave 4 stars is because of the price. I stopped using it after my first bottle and switched to a different cleanser and regretted it a week later because my breakouts came back …bad! I am back using this cleanser and within 1-2weeks, my skin is back calm and bumps gone. Someone said “it’s just 2% Salicylic acid, you can get that in any wash”.. true, but it also has niacinamide and azelaic acid and for my skin, that’s what makes the difference.. I have used other 2% salicylic acid washes (cerave, inkey list) and they’ve done nothing for my skin. Great!…but pricey
