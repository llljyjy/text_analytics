Obsessed with how lightweight this cream is. It leaves no trace behind and it has no shine either. After application, your skin looks super hydrated and moisturized! It is honestly the MOST perfect product for layering. My skin absorbs this so quickly, even after I put on a couple serums before! For reference, my combo oily skin loves this and my skin stays perfectly matte all day without drying out! Perfect for Combo Skin!
