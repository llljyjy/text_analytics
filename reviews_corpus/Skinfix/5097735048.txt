I have been enjoying this lightweight but super moisturizing gel cream. It truly has  effective moisture that’s really lasts. This cream helps to work to protect all the way down to the skin barrier. I like that this formulation works on all skin types too so we both can use it.  This light weight but highly moisturizing gel cream targets dryness & dehydration for me. It absorbs quickly but is long lasting.  Some key aspects of this product are that it’s free from a lot of the big allergy & sensitivity triggers for me. You can use this morning and night and it plays nice with my make up. Gentle but long-lasting moisture
