This serum saved my skin during cold winter on the east coast. I live in CA so when I go east to visit my family my skin SUFFERS. However, the serum kept me dewy and glowing despite dry cold air. I also noticed that my acne really subsided meaning that itâ€™s helping repair my skin barrier! A WIN all around! nan
