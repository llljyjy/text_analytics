this is the best moisturizer i have ever used. i have extremely dry skin and have tried pretty much every moisturizer out there but nothing seems to really hydrate my skin. but this. THIS IS MAGIC!! it is so thick and hydrating but not greasy or oily. this also helped a lot with my damaged skin barrier and hyperpigmentation. although, i wouldnâ€™t recommend this for oily/combination skin as it may be too heavy. but if you have dry skin like me, this is for you! AMAZING FOR DRY SKIN
