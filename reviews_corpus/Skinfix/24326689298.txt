I like this product. I thought it was very hydrating and soothing for my skin. It applied really well and smoothly. It was easily to distribute along my skin. A little bit went a long way too. My skin looked dewy and brightened. I loved the packaging and the refill system that they have as well. It was in scented as far as I know so thatâ€™s always a plus for me. Also bonus points for including hyaluronic acid to the formula! Hydrated and Dewy Skin!
