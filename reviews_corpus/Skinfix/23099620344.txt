This is the only spot treatment I’ve ever used that pills this badly. No matter how I apply or how much I exfoliate and moisturize, if I put it on bare skin or layer it, it always pills. It’s really annoying but I try to pat it on in spots rather than rub it in, and I sleep with it like that. Other than that, I can’t really say whether this is helpful in decreasing my acne or not. At least it didn’t make it worse. Pills really badly
