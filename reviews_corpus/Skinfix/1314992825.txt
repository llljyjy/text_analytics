I was so excited to try the newest release from SkinFix of the Barrier + Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream. It feels lightweight on your skin and absorbs very quickly and nicely into your skin. I was looking for something to work on my combination skin for the warmer months and love this gel cream form for that and that it is lightweight. It hydrates my skin leaving it soft and smooth but not oily or feeling heavy. It has also helped Iâ€™ve noticed in the production of oil in my skin which is a huge plus. Overall this is a winner for me. Winner for combination skin
