Skinfix Barrier+ Triple Lipid Peptide cream gave me a radiant look. The ingredients include squalene, jojoba, shea butter, lily roots, red seaweed, and macadamia oils for replenishing dry skin and providing it with enough moisture. My face feels soft and nourished. The jar comes with a convenient opening and I can get the cream with just one push and the jar remains far away from contamination. I absolutely loved this cream for my face and neck for its rich texture. I use it morning and night after cleansing and serums. Love it
