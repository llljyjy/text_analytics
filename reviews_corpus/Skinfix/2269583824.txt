I was looking for a serum that didn’t disrupt my sensitive skin‘s moisture barrier. This product did not disappoint! I apply this product after cleansing my skin while my skin was still a little damp. It absorbs beautifully into my skin and leaves my face feeling radiant and soft. After application I follow up with my usual face oil. I love how this serum is gentle enough for everyday use in both morning and night. So far, I have really been enjoying skinfix! Perfect for everyday use and sensitive skin
