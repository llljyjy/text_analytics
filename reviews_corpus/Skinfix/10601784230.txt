my new holy grail moisturizer. i have super dry skin and this honestly solved all my dry skin problems, it slowly got rid of my dry patches, and lessened the redness on my skin. it feels so good on my skin, its like food for my skin. i had a damaged skin barrier and this saved it. i always look forward to putting this on during my skincare routines bc it feels so good. if u have dry skin trust me get this ! nan
