Hydrated and well nourished skin! It’s winter time and my skin is typically very dry around this time of year - even more so than usual. During this season, I look for products that are hydrating, but won’t hurt my sensitive skin. This product fulfilled all my wishes! The packaging is simple and user friendly. No weird scents. The texture is easy to apply and soaks into my skin. Absolutely love & would recommend. Hydrated and well nourished skin
