Love this cleanser! I experienced a horrible break out after trying tachaâ€™s dewy skin cream so i decided to give this a try since i usually love skinfix products. I had a bunch of tiny red blemishes that i did not know how to get rid of considering i normally only experience a few small blemishes during my cycle. Within a few weeks (using it morning and night) my skin was clearer than it was before my break out and all redness was gone. Will continue using this from now on as it is great for acne and texture. Love this
