I was gifted this by SkinFix. I have used and loved SkinFix ultra-hydrating moisturizer and was excited to use this product. As the title suggests, it is a barrier-restoring gel cream. So, I feel it is best used as a layering product as opposed to their moisturizer, which was super thick and could be used by itself even in winter. I have extremely dry skin and I use it over my hyaluronic serum, am & pm. Honestly, I think it doesn’t do much for my skin type. The texture is gel-based and liquidy. I think this would be best used by oily skin people as it doesn’t do much for dry skin people. Taking off one star since it isn’t for my skin type but definitely try if oily skinned. Not for dry skin
