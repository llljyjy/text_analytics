I used an entire jar of this so I feel comfortable reviewing it.  It has absolutely no fragrance, so if that’s what you’re looking for, this is definitely a good option.  However, it wasn’t moisturizing enough for my extremely dry cheeks and neck.  It also left a slightly sticky/tacky feeling.  I loved the dispenser.  Push down, and it comes out the hole in the top.  Very sanitary.  I would say 1-3 pumps is enough.  But I had to force myself to use it, so that was a sign that I shouldn’t repurchase it. Good no fragrance option
