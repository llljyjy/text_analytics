This is a great moisturizer. I have dry sensitive skin and use this as my night time moisturizer. It helps my skin stay hydrated in the harsh winter weather. It absorbs well, is non-irritating, and I like the pump dispenser rather than having to scoop some out with my fingers. For extra hydration I usually pair this with the SkinFix triple lipid hyaluronate serum. the hype is merited
