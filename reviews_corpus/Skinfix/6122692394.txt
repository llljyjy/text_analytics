I will give this a 3 star because I loved the texture and the feeling on the skin as well as the moisturizing properties (I have combination skin). However, I have sensitive skin and I reacted to niacinamide. I know that niacinamide can suit even sensitive skin but you should also beware that it can be a reactive ingredient for some people. It is important to know as this ingredient is becoming more and more popular and in a lot of products recently. I applied this under my foundation and loved it at first but when I took off my makeup my skin had a lot of redness and it did remember that something similar once happened with another product having niacinamide in the ingredient lists. Seemed good but I reacted to niacinamide
