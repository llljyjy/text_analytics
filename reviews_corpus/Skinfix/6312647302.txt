The first thing I have to say is that I love its packaging and the way of its applicator since I donâ€™t have to use a spatula or insert my fingers inside the cream, this seems very perfect to me. The cream feels great on the skin the skin feels hydrated and absorbs quickly it works perfectly before makeup. Absolutely gorgeous
