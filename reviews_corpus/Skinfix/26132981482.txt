there was times when my skin barrie was broke and has so many acne, after one night of using it, my redness reduced by a lot and of course its not cure for breakout but for my combo skin this cream feel very light and subtle and moisturize after few use. this was a much waited review as I am using it for last two years and I put my mother to it too. great for oily skin
