At first, I didn’t like the way this felt on my skin, but I realized that a little goes a long way and haven’t had any issues since. This is exactly what my skin craves during the dry winter months, and I’m really happy with the way my skin looks after a few months of consistent use twice a day. It’s also been very gentle on my sensitive skin.The refill works great for me as well. For those who have been having issues, make sure you’ve taken out the existing refillable components completely, including the translucent piece of plastic that pushes up the product (mine was originally stuck to the pump). I got a little worried when I saw the negative reviews on the refill, since I personally love it so much -- please don’t ever stop making the refills! nan
