I received this as a sample and it’s quickly become my new favorite moisturizer! I’ve been using Belof Aqua Bomb and Clinique Moisturize Surge and I’ve been relatively happy with those. But, this one is in a league of its own!!! It’s a common misconception that people with oily skin don’t need to moisturize. WRONG-O!!! The excess oil is our skins way of trying to pick up the slack from the lack of moisture. I live in an EXTREMELY humid & muggy part of the country and a good moisturizer is essential to me now! Oily skin folks, don’t be scared. Try it! I hope you love it as much as I do!!! OMG I LOVE IT!!!
