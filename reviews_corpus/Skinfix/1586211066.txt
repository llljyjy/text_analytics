Pretty good. I love that it does not have tons of silicones and actually absorbs into the skin. It was not 5 star item for me as I have found other moisturizers that absorb more and are much more nourishing. However I would repurchase. It was good and a high quality moisturizer that is good for the skin, with great ingredients. I think this is ideal for all skin types. This would be great for acne skin (most people w acne need tons of moisturizer after rough acne treatments, this would be a great one for that issue). This might be great in the summer or hot weather. However, for me this was not a 5/5 as I have found other more nourishing moisturizers that make the skin feel even better. A great quality moisturizer.
