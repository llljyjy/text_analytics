I had difficulty washing this cleanser off of my face and felt it left a film that reacted poorly with my other products. I used a tiny amount but unless I scrubbed a little bit I had trouble getting it rinsed properly. I have very sensitive skin and noticed significant irritation either from the leftover film or having to scrub too much. Overall I think itâ€™s a good cleanser, just not a great fit for me. Not a fit for me
