This is a good face cleanser, but it’s not an oil nor really foamy, but it doesn’t really matter for me.I like this product, it’s soft on the skin and it’s great for sensitive or dry skin. The smell is really light and clean.The skin feels soft and clean, so I recommend it! Great cleanser even for dry/senstive skin
