I am pretty biased when it comes to this brand. Every product that I have used has done wonders for my dry/mature skin. The texture was thicker than most serums but performed like a moisturizer. I loved the way it melted into my skin and provided instant hydration. I could visibly see plumper and bouncier-looking skin. The hydration was incredible and long-lasting. My skin felt nourished and felt protected throughout the day. I could reapply it with no problem, and it blended in well with my other skincare and makeup products. I highly recommend this. I have been applying this every day and my skin has been looking and feeling great!!! Long lasting hydration
