I have really enjoyed using the Triple Lipid + Collagen Activating Serum.  It is a creamy white serum that is thicker than other serums.  I love the blue pump packaging.  It absorbs well and quickly.  I love that it is fragrance free.  I use it morning and night.  It pairs well with other skincare and makeup.  My skin feels hydrated, moisturized and wonderful.  It looks plumper, glowy and healthy.  I really love this serum. nan
