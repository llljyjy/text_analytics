I don’t know if I’ve ever left a product review before but I could cry from the relief this cleanser has given me.My skin is historically dry with the occasional hormonal acne spot or two, but earlier this year I had a sudden onset of recurring intense acne concentrated around my jawline and chin and cheeks.I tried other BHA products, salicylic acid cleansers, retinol cream, oil cleanser (this made it worse), double cleansing, cleaning up my diet, not wearing makeup -- so many things that didn’t change anything. It was infuriating and hopeless.An angel at Sephora recommended this cleanser to me - it’s been about two weeks and my skin is almost completely clear for the first time in 6 months. Current routine: - Either Garner Micellar Water or Farmacy Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm to remove my makeup- Swirl around a dab of this, let it sit for a minute, and rinse- Moisturize with the SkinFix Barrier+ Face CreamI haven’t experienced any over-drying, no peeling -- just a clear, clean, bump-free face that is actually healing. Actually life-changing
