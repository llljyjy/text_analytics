I really wanted to love this product because itâ€™s quite expensive and I bought a mini version of it that I took on vacation with me which left my skin super moisturized and hydrated. But as I continued to use this, I noticed a ton of tiny bumps and pimples on my face, mainly on my cheeks and lower jawline. I have very acne prone skin caused by hormones and clogged pores. I was on medication for my hormonal acne but I still had a lot of tiny bumps and visibly clogged pores on my face. I even went to an aesthetician who told me how badly clogged my pores were. The only difference in my routine was this product so I deduced that this was just way too heavy for my skin. If you have acne prone skin that is prone to clogging, avoid this and save your money. Not good for acne prone skin - very pore clogging
