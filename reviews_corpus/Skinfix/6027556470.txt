Skinfix’s original barrier+ cream is my holy grail moisturizer and this one lives up to my expectations! I love that this a lightweight texture - great for summer imo. It sinks into the skin quickly and leaves my skin feeling super hydrated all day long. I really like using this when I don’t feel like doing any other skincare because it has so many hero ingredients packed into the formula. The packing on this is also A+ I never have to worry about the product getting gross or contaminated with germs. 10/10 recommend! nan
