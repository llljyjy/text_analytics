I received this for free from Skinfix in exchange for a review. But all thoughts and opinions are my own. At first I thought this wouldn’t hydrate my skin enough because of it being a gel cream but it’s great—especially for the day time. It didn’t cause any irritation on my sensitive skin and over all I’m enjoying it! nan
