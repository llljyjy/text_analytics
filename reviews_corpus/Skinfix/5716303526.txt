Honestly at this price go for something else, the REN moisturizer is by far 10x better than this and itâ€™s $10 more. I wanted to love it so bad because I have the cleanser from Skinfix and I absolutely adore it, so this review is with a heavy heart. I get super bad patches of dry skin in the winter and this honestly was as good as slapping water on my face. Returned. I do not understand the good reviews.
