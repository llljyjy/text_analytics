Lifesaver! I am in my 30s and my benzoyl peroxide based acne products have stopped making much difference when applied.  This spot treatment dries up my blemishes and keeps the inflammation down. It works well as a preventative in areas that I have been getting mask-ne.  It is not overly drying which was a concern I had.  I will buy more products from this brand based on the great outcome this product gives me. nan
