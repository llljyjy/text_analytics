The Skinfix Cleaner left my skin feeling incredibly soft and completely clean after using! I’ve struggled with breakouts whenever I travel, which is often. I’ve used 2% BHA before as a toner but never as a cleanser and I must say what a huge difference that’s made. Typically the toner irritates my skin but this cleaner has the perfect amount of BHA to help clean my skin without irritating it! Having a darker complexion I’ve also struggled with hyper pigmentation after breakouts and this cleanser has helped minimize the appearance of those dark scars on my face nan
