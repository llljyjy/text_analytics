Everything SkinFix is top notch. I love that this serum is a little bit thicker and creamy instead of thin, clear, runny. My face feels plump and hydrated and healthy and soft. You can always layer extra moisturizer on top of it, but I could see some people not needing it. I love that it is not at all greasy. No scent. Great ingredients. Honestly a fave brand of mine. Especially when my skin is acting up. Seems to be calming and really effective. So many of us do a good job of disrupting are barrier. This is definitely something to replenish and rehydrate. A must have for healthy, hydrated skin!
