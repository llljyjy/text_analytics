I really like this for my combination skin, which gets oily throughout the day. I like this gel cream because it feels lightweight yet hydrating. The ingredients are the reasons I like this gel cream. It has saccharide isomerate, niacinamide, anti-microbial heptapeptides and zinc. They help reduce the appearance of dry skin and flakiness as well as the appearance of pores, oiliness and shine. Love this new formula for oily, combination & acne-prone skin! New fav for oily, combination, acne-prone skin!
