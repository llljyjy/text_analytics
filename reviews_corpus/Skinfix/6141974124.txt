I often get pimples on my jawline, forehead, and chin. For the smaller pimples, this product cleared blemishes in about a week. Larger pimples were gone in about 2 weeks. There were a few times I felt a mild burning sensation a few minutes after I applied the product to my skin. Other than that, this is a thumbs up from me! nan
