Ok first off the packaging?! 10/10. Second the actual mister 10/10! Lol ok if you can’t tell I love this spray! Seriously the packaging is gorgeous and looks and feels so luxe. The spray comes out so soft it doesn’t mess up your makeup if you decide to use it over makeup. The formula is so good! I’ve used it 3 different ways before makeup, as a setting spray and as a mid day refresher. My favorite way is before makeup or as a mid day refresher. It gives my skin a beautiful lit from within glow and my skin looks and feels hydrated and refreshed after using. nan
