I’ve never used a hydrating mist before, so wasn’t sure what to expect. I love the smell as the roses smell is subtle and not overwhelming at all. I used after taking off my makeup and reapplying out for a different event and this was so great to make my skin feel fresh and like I was starting from just clean, hydrated skin. Great mist spray
