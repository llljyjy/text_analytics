I received this from Influenster in exchange for a review, and wow! I love refreshing sprays, hydrating sprays, setting sprays, etc. all the sprays! I tried this one on different days for different uses and it really is multi use!! Perfect addition to a skin care routine or a makeup routine. If you love sprays you will LOVE THIS. It felt amazing on my face, kept my makeup in line, and just overall amazing. The bottle is also insanely cute & luxurious. The spray is a very very light mist which I liked, cause I find some sprays can be a bit heavy. This one was truly a MIST and not a spray! I also didnâ€™t find the smell to be overwhelming at all, which was also nice. It was a subtle rose smell!! I used it as a priming and setting spray with my makeup & it lasted all day!! I also used it as a final step on my skincare routine one day & felt it gave one extra layer of added moisture. Overall I love this misting spray!! The bottle is nice glass & makes me feel like a princess using it! amazingly luxurious
