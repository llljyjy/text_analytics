This spray from Gucci certainly does what it promises to do! I was able to successfully use it as a primer, a setting spray and a makeup/skin refresher. It is a relatively soft spray and doesn’t disturb any makeup it’s sprayed on. I didn’t notice it increasing the longevity of my makeup no matter how I used it, but it also didn’t deviate decrease it. It has a fairly soft rose scent; while florals aren’t usually my favorite, this one is pretty faint and not sickeningly “fake rose“ scented, and it disappeared quickly. It leaves your skin glowy as promised! I will say that I didn’t absolutely love how glowy/dewy my skin was using it because I’m super duper oily, but I expected this given it’s description.Overall, def a recommend for those looking for a refreshing, glowy spray! nice spray - recommended!
