I received this product for free for my honest review. This product is fantastic! I absolutely love the bottle because it’s so pretty and it’s made of glass. It sprays in a very fine mist. I used it as a primer, setting spray, and refresher and I think it works really well in all those functions. It really helped my skin stay hydrated and never oily. I also really like that is has a very light floral scent. I would definitely purchase this product in the future. Fantastic!
