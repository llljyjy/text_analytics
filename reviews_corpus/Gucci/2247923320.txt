This is a really great versatile beauty mist. I used it to prep my skin for makeup and to refresh during the day. It has a nice fine mist and a very light rose scent. I was worried the scent would be too strong but it’s not overpowering at all. It didn’t sit heavy on my skin and left my skin feeling hydrated and refreshed! A wonderful luxury product. Light feel and fresh scent
