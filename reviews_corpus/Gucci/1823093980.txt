I have been testing the  Gucci Brume de Beauté Hydrating Mistfor a little bit over a month. Overall, it is a lovely and luxurious product.The Pros: -the packaging is stunning and luxe;-the floral scent is pleasant and not overwhelming. It goes away fairly quickly;-I enjoyed using this spray in between makeup steps and to freshen my makeup during the day when I powder myself. Overall, this spray works well to freshen up makeup and keep your skin looking hydrated instead of cakey; and-the spray nozzle emits the perfect amount of product.The cons:-the product did not work for me as a toner or a setting spray; and-I went through the product fairly quickly.I don’t think this product is a must have. It’s a luxury that, if you can afford it, is pleasant to use and does a lovely job of refreshing your makeup. I think it would make a great gift to spoil someone (or yourself), but I don’t think I will be running to repurchase this mist when I run out. nan
