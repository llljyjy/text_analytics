First off, this is a stunning work of art, the frosted pink glass to the lined gold lid and nozzle screams luxe. I keep working with this product and sometimes love and sometimes think itâ€™s just ok. I think you really need to give it a good shake to make sure the oil is evenly soperesed throughout the product. If not it can feel a little sticky and heavy on the face. I think this product does a nice job of making your skin feel more hydrated but not sure it is worth the major price tag. Beautiful but expensive.
