This Gucci facial spray is very luxurious. The bottle is a heavy glass and the nozzle sprays an incredibly fine mist. The nozzle is also one of those continuous sprays which is nice. I used this spray to set my makeup and it did make my face look plump and dewy. It took down any powdery look and left me with a nice natural-luminous finish. However, with this all being said, I took a star off due to the $76 price point. There are other facial sprays that give me a similar finish while being in the $30-$40 range. Fancy and Luxe
