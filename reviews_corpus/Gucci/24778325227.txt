I like it, it feels nice on the face but it isnâ€™t amazing like you would think. It just seems like any other facial spray. The packaging is very pretty, it makes me feel expensive when I carry it around in my purse. It does leave a nice glow, but again I feel like you can find the same quality in other cheaper brands. Eh
