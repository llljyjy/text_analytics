Wow! Gucci is a luxury brand and I had high expectations for this spray. I’m happy to report that they met them! The mister is extremely fine, you can barely even feel it spray. It passes the paper test even with a couple sprays! The finish, I would say it’s dewy natural; Oily skin could enjoy this too. The bottle, gorgeous. The glass it’s thick and it looks amazing on a vanity. Smell is faint kinda floral. I loved this. I will repurchase. amazing!
