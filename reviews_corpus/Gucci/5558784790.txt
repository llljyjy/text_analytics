Just taking the bottle out of the packaging is just such a luxe experience! The bottle itself is made of a heavy matte-surfaced glass, with an equally beautiful gold cap to match. Upon spritzing the mist on my face, I noticed that the scent was very lovely and a bit more complex than pure rose which was nice. It took a few spritzes to get my whole face and gave my skin such a nice glow! However depending on the skincare I use the mist will sometimes make my makeup and skincare separate and ball up, so I still have to play with the combinations of skincare that works! However, I like the glow enough that this mist gives to keep trying to see what combinations work. Moisturized glow but some skincare incompatible
