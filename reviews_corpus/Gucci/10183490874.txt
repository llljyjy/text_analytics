Let me start by saying this product is luxurious regardless of the application technique used. I tried it as a primer, setting spray and refresher. I live in Florida and the temps have been in the low 90’s. This performed so well in the heat. It kept my face dewy and the glow was phenomenal. Im also impressed at the fine mist from the actuator. Ive tried a lot of setting sprays that leave splatter droplets on your face. This doesn’t do that at all. The fragrance is light and dissipates quickly. It’s a rosy scent so if you’re sensitive to fragranced products, please be mindful. It’s hydrating and feels amazing when you use it as a refresher. I recommend this product. I truly believe you get what you pay for and this is worth every dime! Major WOW Factor!
