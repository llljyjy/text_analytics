This is a lovely, light, and refreshing mist and it feels smooth, not tacky, on the skin. For the price, I’m not sure how practical it is because it doesn’t do anything substantial. It’s not a primer and it’s not a setting spray. It’s just a revitalizing mist that makes you feel bougie when you put it on. Buy it for the luxe feeling you get from applying it, not for a practical purpose. Lovely and rather purposeless
