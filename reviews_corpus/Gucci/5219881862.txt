This was my first Gucci product and it did not disappoint. I primarily used this after I had applied makeup and it worked beautifully to hydrate after powder and as a refresh midday. The scent was light and very pleasant but also didn’t linger. It did not feel heavy or oily on my skin at all. The mister is definitely one the the best I’ve ever used! I didn’t notice a difference in how long it made my makeup last but it seemed to be comparable to other setting sprays I’ve used. Very Pleasant Mist
