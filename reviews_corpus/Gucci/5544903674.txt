I received this product for free, from Influenster and Gucci, for my honest review.This Gucci Brume De Beaut√© Glow Hydrating Mist, is my absolute new favorite! It is a high end, high quality product! The floral smell is amazingly light and subtle. Not overwhelming or overpowering. It feels great on my skin! My face has never felt more hydrated and soft. Even my twelve year old daughter loves to wear this now, every day! I love how my makeup lasts even longer as well. The bottle is very elegant and heavy. The packaging was exquisite and the product even more so. Very happy this was introduced into my now, daily, routine! We highly recommend it! New favorite!!
