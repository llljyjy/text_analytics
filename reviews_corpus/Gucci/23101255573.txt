I really like this as a base mist, it leaves your skin feeling very refreshed. It also does work very well as a setting spray. Some setting sprays I believe are too heavy on my skin but this one is perfect. The size you get for the price is well worth it, the quality speaks for itself. I have included this mist in my routine for a couple of weeks now and I am pleasantly surprised with how my skin feels while using it. nan
