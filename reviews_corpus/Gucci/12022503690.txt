I am overjoyed to say, I absolutely LOVED this spray! I am semi-sensitive to scents, especially florals, so I was IMPRESSED at how soft and light it was (while smelling refined, romantic and sophisticated!) I live in Florida, and this summer heat has been BRUTAL. Let me tell you this spray has been such a welcome refresh! It makes my skin feel nice in the morning, nice and refreshed in the afternoon, and soft and soothing at night! Just a few spritzes go a LONG way to rejuvenating your day! So fancy, with soft florals!
