Overall, I’m very grateful to be chosen to try this product. My first impression was that the packaging and container are both beautiful. They’re both very sleek and elegant. The mist itself has a very small spray diameter so the range of each spray is quite small. Because of that, I felt as if I couldn’t maintain an even spray over my face. As for the product itself, it is a very refreshing mist and had a light floral scent. I’m not sure that I have noticed much benefit in terms of hydration/glow, but it does set my makeup well. A gentle mist
