I use this as a hydrating primer and moisturizer. It doesn’t do too well at being a setting spray, but it definitely moisturizes my skin. It’s not tacky or too dewy. I wish the spritzer would make the liquid come out as a fine mist instead of a blotchy spray if that makes sense. I sprayed it on my face with more than enough space between the bottle and my face and some spots would still drip down. The light floral scent is pleasant and not too strong. I got used to it rather quickly. When I use it, I shake well and hold it away from my face, close my eyes and mouth and spray and then rub it in, but since the sprayer isn’t a fine mist, I usually place some on my clean finger tips and rub it onto my skin. I feel like I get a more even application this way. I love this product, but part of me wishes I would get something more out of it with the price point. Love it!
