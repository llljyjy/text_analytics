I received this free in exchange for my honest review. This product is super luxurious down to the packaging with the gold topped bottle and the fine mist it gives to keep you refreshed and set your makeup. It has such a fine floral scent but I really like it since it’s not irritating. I noticed it goes rather quickly so I haven’t been using it every single day. It is rather pricey too so not too sure I would purchase once I finish this bottle. It really is a good product though. Amazing
