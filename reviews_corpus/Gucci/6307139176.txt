On receiving this Gucci hydrating mist I used it as a skin refresher, primer, and setting spray. I would stick with other products for setting makeup, but I thought it worked great to hydrate and prep the skin! The spray nozzle produces a very fine mist (unlike a typical spray bottle) which was great to cover as much surface area as possible-- I felt I could mist my entire face in 2-3 spritzes. The rose smell is really pleasant and understated! Overall I really enjoyed this product but personally find it too expensive for its purpose. nan
