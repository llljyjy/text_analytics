I’ve used primers in the past but none as luxurious as Shiseido Future Solution LX Infinite Treatment Primer SPF 30. I was thrilled to be selected by Influenster to test out this primer. First off, the package is beautiful! Very luxe vibes. There is a subtle scent but after a while I could barely smell it. A little went a long way for me. I used it with a bit of setting spray so the texture was easy to spread. It kept my foundation on for a full day. Unlike most other primers, this one has a high spf which is great for going on trips…you don’t need to bring extra sunblock lotion for your face. Overall, amazing product with a high spf level! I’m loving it! Amazing Luxe Primer!
