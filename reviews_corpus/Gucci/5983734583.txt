This is a beautiful mist product! I generally use it for a midday hydration refresh when I’m wearing makeup and can’t apply traditional moisturizer. The quality of the mist is so lovely - super fine and applies easily. It’s lightly scented and feels fresh. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and haven’t noticed any adverse effects. nan
