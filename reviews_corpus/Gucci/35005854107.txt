I was sent this product in exchange for my honest review and I loved it! Iâ€™m not usually a big make up person but I have this a try just to see how it would work. I tend to break out from foundation. I used this as a setting spray and it was very light and help with foundation not getting cakey or clogging my pours. Big bonus it smells so good but not over powering! LOVE!
