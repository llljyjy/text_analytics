This is a big rave. It leaves a beautifully glowy finish. Not sticky or anything just healthy hydrated skin. Who doesn’t like higher end fancy products also. It is lightly scented - definitely no where near to where you smell it when you even open it though! It’s a very light clean smell that went away shortly after using. Very fine mist. I used it as a moisturizer and if I possibly need a little hydration on top of foundation (I like the dewy look) I personally feel the price is fair. It’s a Gucci product. It’s gorgeous overall. I’d definitely buy.Thank you for reading nan
