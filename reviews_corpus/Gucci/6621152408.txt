This is the first product from Gucci that I’ve ever tried (complimentary from Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes) and I must say I’m quite impressed! The packaging is so stunning. It has a heavy feeling that is luxe and the gold detailing is a nice touch. The mist is very fine and doesn’t leave my face feeling wet. I like to use it before I apply foundation as a primer and after my makeup is finished to help set and lock it in place. It makes all the powders look melted together and natural. I deducted a star because it’s very pricey and I there are other facial mists I own that accomplish the same thing for less money. Lovely multitasker mist
