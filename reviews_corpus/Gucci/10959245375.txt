I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. The first thing that I noticed was how luxurious the packaging feels. It’s glass and not plastic so that alone makes the experience wonderful. As for the product, the way it sprays is verynice and smooth. It doesn’t spray an excessive amount of product, it feels very nice, light, and airy. I usually spray it a couple of times- one on each side of my face. After sprayed, my face doesn’t feel sticky or anything. I’ve used it on my face as a skincare refresher, under my makeup and over my makeup as a setting spray. I like that it has a variety of uses. My favorite use for it is under my makeup and over my makeup. I did not notice hydration when using the spray as a refresher. It does have a strong fragrance as well so people with sensitive skin may want to stay away. Overall, I am impressed with the product and I would definitely recommend it. Luxurious
