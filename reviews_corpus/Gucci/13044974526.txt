Exquisite packaging. I love the glass bottle it comes in, and the spritz is perfectly refreshing. The product has a light pleasant scent, which I appreciate since I have sensitive skin. The mist gave an awesome glow when applied over top of my makeup. As for my skin, the product didnâ€™t do much aside from giving me that dewy look. Overall, I would definitely buy again. Love!
