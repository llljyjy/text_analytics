I received this as a complimentary sample, in exchange for my honest review. Wow! I didn’t want to love it , but I do! It sits well below and on top of my makeup. I passed it forward to my mom (wished I didn’t) and she’s too obsessed for me to take it away from her lol. If you have the budget, I’d splurge, but my only compliant is the added parfum/fragrance (like why) although it is not irritating at all! Hate to LOVE it !
