This spray has been so refreshing on the skin, especially during these past few summer months. I find that when I use it as the last step of my skincare, it provides a luminous glow to the skin, which is very pretty! When using this as the final step to my makeup, it also leaves my skin looking dewy, as well as making my makeup look less cakey and powdery. It melts everything into the skin nicely, without disturbing any of the products or ruining the makeup look. I don’t find it affects the wear of my makeup too much either. It does have a noticeable scent, which makes sense as “Black Rose Oil” is one of the highlighted ingredients. The packaging itself is heavier than most facial mists, and the mist itself is very fine and even. It overall feels very luxurious. Hydrating and Glowy
