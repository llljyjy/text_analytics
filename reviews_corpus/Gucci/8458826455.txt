First of all let me start with the packaging. The packaging is everything, I love the pink and gold vibes. It’s very sturdy and substantial which I like. Going to the product itself, it has a rose scent it but it’s very slight so it’s not overbearing. I started wearing it first without any makeup just directly on my skin and I didn’t notice anything super crazy as far as anything different to my skin. The only thing that I noticed was it was making my skin maybe a little bit softer, and a tad more hydrated. The sprayer was way too light and was not spraying directly out so it was hard to get it on my face completely. Otherwise I don’t think I would spend the money to purchase this product. I received this product free in exchange with my honest review. Hit and miss
