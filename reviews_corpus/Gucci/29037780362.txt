I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.The bottle has a nice look and feel to it. The rose coloring and thick frosted glass go well with the gold emblem and cap. It feels substantial in your hand and I like that. Itâ€™s a bit too wet for me as a setting spray but I LOVE it as a primer. It helps my make up really stick for all-day wear. The only complaint I have is it runs out very quickly. I thought with it being such a fine mist that it would last for a longer period of time. Other than that, another great product by Gucci. Love it!
