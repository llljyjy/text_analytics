I love my new glowing skin. This is one of the finest mists that I’ve tried. It leaves your skin moisturized with a glowing finish. The mister is amazing and doesn’t leave droplets on your face. I like to refresh my makeup with this mist. It leaves a subtle glow. I use it as a finishing spray after powder and midday to touch up. The bottle is really luxurious and glass. This has such a lovely scent but it is very light and nice; doesn’t linger. I would totally recommend this to a friend. I love my new glowing skin!!
