I enjoy this product when i feel like my makeup or bare skin needs a little hydration boost. The mister is super fine so you have to get it’s little close to your face. The scent is mild and the over all packaging/experience is very lux. Everything I’ve tried from Gucci beauty I’ve loved so far. I did receive this product for free from influenster, but i will be purchasing once I’m out. Solid facial mist
