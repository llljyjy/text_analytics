This Gucci Brume De Beauté is so luxurious! I waited about three days to give it this review, and I can already tell it will be something I reach for daily! I received it as a voxbox apart of a campaign! I have been using it to prep my face before makeup, and it made the makeup last all day! It feels lightweight on the skin! You can also use it to set your makeup and use it as a little refresher!! It smells so fresh and clean it has a hint of a floral scent! The smell is wonderful to me, it’s very light and not overpowering! The mist is a very fine mist and it just feels so luxurious! I would 110% repurchase this! And you 110% need this for your makeup skincare routine! It is also nice to just wear by itself before bedtime!! I think it gives the skin a nice natural glow as well I am in absolute love with it! Divine!!
