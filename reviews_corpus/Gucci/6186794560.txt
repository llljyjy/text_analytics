This hydration spray is an absolute luxury. The packaging has a frosted translucent color with gold accents. It will look so stunning on your vanity. I typically don’t like rose scented products, however this one isn’t as strong as most. It’s a very light subtle rose scent and it sprays a fine mist. I used this to freshen up my skin on a hot day, and it feels great! I will say this product is definitely a splurge, however the quality is fantastic! nan
