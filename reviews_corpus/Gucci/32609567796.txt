This beauty mist honestly exceeded my expectations. I expected it to work okay, but I assumed some of the “thrill” of the product was simply the brand. I was wrong.The packaging is sleek, pretty and indicative of the quality of the product. The product truly applies as a mist, not a spray, and that can be hard to come by. I’ve tried many other similar products, but most didn’t apply with a mist-like feel.I’ve used it as a primer, setting spray and a refresher. It works well for all options, but my preferred application is a setting spray or refresherIt is a scented product, but it’s not overpowering, and I can be finicky about scents. I love the glow this product gives my skin. The finish is dewy, not greasy. I would buy this and am pleasantly surprised by how much I love it! Beautiful, Glowing Finish
