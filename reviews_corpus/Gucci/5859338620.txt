I love this product, its extremely versatile, luxurious and it’s just an amazing product all around. I realize that there are a lot of other less pricey setting sprays out on the market but this might be worth the price tag. I usually avoid scented products but this did not irritate me at all and the scent of the spray was delightful. I apply make up on top of my sunscreen which leaves my face with a matte finish so I used this spray as a primer, which worked out really well. My foundation went on smoothly, as if I had just put something hydrating on my skin. It doesn’t end there, this spray also acts as a setting spray, which left my skin with a gentle glow without looking like I washed my face with oil at the end of the day. The packaging is gorgeous and gives a vintage feel, it’s made out of glass, adding to another level of luxury. I used the product thoroughly for a week and my makeup lasted me for 16 hours. Phenomenal
