honestly incredible. the finest mist i’ve ever seen from a setting spray, to the point where i don’t even feel it touching my face. this has a light, subtle, luxurious scent, and the nicest finish of a setting spray, as well as significantly increasing my makeup’s staying power. the packaging itself is nothing short of luxurious as well: a heavy, rose-tinted glass bottle with a beautiful gold lid. i did receive a bottle complimentary in order to test it, but i’ve already purchased a second bottle (at full price) so i don’t have to worry about running out, because that’s how much i love it. for reference, my previous HG setting spray was charlotte tilbury, but im 100% converted to this!
