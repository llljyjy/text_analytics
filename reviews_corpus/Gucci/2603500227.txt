This beauty mist has such a lovely fragrance! I get peony with a hint of rose, just enough to be noticeable without overpowering. I didnâ€™t notice any change in terms of how long my makeup lasted, but my skin definitely felt more hydrated and refreshed. I would recommend more as a step in your skincare routine rather than your makeup one. The bottle is so elegant too, it is pretty enough to display. Floral Elegance
