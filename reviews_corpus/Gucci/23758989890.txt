Can you go wrong with anything Gucci? Absolutely loved how this made my skin feel and how well it made my makeup look. I usually use a matte foundation so having more of a glowy setting spray adds back that natural glow. Lightweight and the scent is also light and not overwhelming. This would be something I would purchase for myself in the future. I used it also after I took my make up off as a refresh spray for some extra hydration. My skin feels hydrated, soft and glowy. 10 out of 10
