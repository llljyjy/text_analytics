I have oily skin just to let that be known. I don’t see what the fuss is all about on this one. The mist is way too fine, for me at least. I have to force myself to use this product. I do like the bottle it comes in. I can do without the scent too. But it’s Gucci so I doubt that would happen. If it wasn’t for Influenster I sure wouldn’t have tried this out. I could have passed.
