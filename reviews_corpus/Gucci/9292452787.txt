This smells beautiful and has a super fine mist I love. Using this before makeup makes my skin tacky but not in a bad or gross way, but allows my makeup to stick well. It also looks amazing on bare skin or to top off your base as it gives a nice dewy look. This product feels like luxury from the packaging, to the mist, to the scent and the glow. This is absolutely a splurge that I LOVE. LUXURYYYY BABYYYY
