This is a very nice, very expensive facial setting spray. First, the nozzle and spray mechanism work well - it dispensed an even amount of product in fine particles. Second, the product is fragranced; I did not find the sweet rose scent over powering however it may be irritating to those sensitive to fragrance. Third, because the most did apply so finely and evenly, I found it to set my makeup very well. The packaging is beautiful and lux. I have sensitive skin and did not experience any new irritation due to this product. nan
