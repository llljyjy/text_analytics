This product was sent incentivized to be reviewed, when isaw that i got so excited. Gucci products are always soamazing and smell divine. The application/mist is gentleand feels nice, but it doesn’t have any distinct smell. Goodbut light hydration. The pros: leaves skin feeling fresh and itdoesn’t make you oily! Recommended. nan
