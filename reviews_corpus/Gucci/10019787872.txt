I was honestly shocked by how much I liked this product! The mist was super fine which I loved. This product can be used to prime or to set and I love how it makes my makeup look. It gives a nice dewey glow-perfect for summer. I also surprisingly really liked the smell. Itâ€™s fresh and not overpowering. My favorite part of this product is the bottle. It looks and feel expensive and it made of glass. The top is a beautiful gold as well! Light nice mist!
