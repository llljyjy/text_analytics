I received Gucci Brume De Beauté. This mist is so amazing and it’s a absolute must. I added this right into my regular skin regime. I did take out my regular moisturizer on hot days and replaced it with just this mist. That was absolutely the best decision. My skin actually can breath with this mist while staying hydrated and glowing. This is very easy to apply just hold away from your fast a little bit aim at your face of course.then spritz it all over your face until you feel it is covered. Lightly scented rose I believe. Never the less this is amazing and I love love love it. Gucci definitely has not disappointed with this hydrating mist it sets my skin and allows my skin care products to absorb and do there job without interference. Hydrating and glowing
