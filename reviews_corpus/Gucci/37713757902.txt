I am absolutely in love with this hydrating setting & prep spray! It leaves your skin with the most beautiful subtle glow! My skin feels super refreshed! I use this before and after my make up application, as well as in between for touch ups! It has a really light pleasant scent to it as well! I havenâ€™t stopped raving about this to all of my friends and family and I will be there repurchasing this as soon as I am out! AMAZING!!
