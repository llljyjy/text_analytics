I got this for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion, but I’d happily spend my money on this because it’s AWESOME! It’s so light and refreshing. It works as advertised and helped my makeup stay in place on a hot day when using it as a primer and setter, and felt nice on my face to freshen up through the day. Highly recommend!!! nan
