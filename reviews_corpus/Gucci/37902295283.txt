I love the scent of this product, with rose there can often be a powdery undertone and this thankfully does not have that. It is a clean smelling rose scent and the Hyaluronic Acid has been assisting in combating my acne and facial oil build up. I noticed these changes about a week after using this product. It has become a staple in my daily routine! I would maybe change the solid rose fragrance to include other fragrance notes. Great Product!
