This beauty mist smells like roses and adds a nice refreshing feeling to your skin or makeup. It sprays a very soft, fine mist, so I feel myself pumping the bottle a lot. I don’t feel like it does much for me, and for the price it probably isn’t worth it. I think we’re mostly paying for the packaging, as it is a nice, heavy bottle. Luxurious But Not Worth It
