I have a lot of thoughts here. When i got this bottle, i was so excited. It feels so luxurious and the bottle is this beautiful thick matte glass. I used it as a prep and set spray for my makeup. my initial thoughts were, i like the spray bottle, but itâ€™s not concentrated enough and causes you spray too many times to get product all over your face. excess wastage for a hefty price tag. One use should not require that much product. I also thought the nozzle felt cheap and flimsy. For the product itself, i loved the initial spray. It was a nice hydration. Not sure it worked as a primer though. I then used this to set my makeup. Same issue with having to spray too much. But it left the most beautiful sheen on my face. I was in love. My matte makeup looked glowy. However, this did not set as i had hoped. Was not a long lasting set. Final thoughts: This is a luxury item that is nice to have and makes you feel glamorous but completely unnecessary for the price tag. I want to love it so much more
