This mist is soothing, as well as hydrating. I am fascinated with helping to shield skin from pollution.I used it On my face before wearing makeup as a primer and didnâ€™t impact my foundation. Also used as a setting mist after applying makeup. I also used it alone  to give my skin a glowing appeal. It is a non-greasy formula that feels Invisible. The Scent is mild floral scent mixed with citrus. Multi purpose primer and setting mist for makeup
