Absolutely love this mist! It locks my makeup in for beautiful all-day wear. The mist is so fine that you barely feel it going on and is also perfect for a refresh. Mists arenâ€™t my personal preference for a primer but it did work very well as a primer too. The packaging is gorgeous and the smell is beautiful. All around amazing product nan
