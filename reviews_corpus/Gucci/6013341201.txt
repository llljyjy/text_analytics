This Gucci facial spray is refreshing and lightweight. The packaging is lovely! Comes in a pretty and recyclable box and the product is held in a beautiful frosted pink glass cylindrical bottle with a classic gold Gucci cap and gold spray applicator. You can see the layers of liquid and fragrant oil inside the bottle, shake to combine before applying. I find the faint rose fragrance (provided by rose oil) both subtle and pleasant. This product boasts uses for priming, setting, and refreshing. I find it’s functional for mostly refreshing the skin and less functional as a prep or priming product and essentially useless as a setting product, unfortunately. It’s absolutely lovely but does not achieve all it claims to achieve. The spray applicator does apply with the softest, smoothest misting action of all my other facial sprays. It really does have  a great application! Loving that about this product! Refreshing and lightweight
