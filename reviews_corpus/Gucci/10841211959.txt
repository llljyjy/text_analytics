When I first opened this in my home, my son opened the box and then revealed the contents, as soon as he seen it was from Gucci (the logo was recognizable to him, I was impressed lol) he loudly exclaimed, “it’s from Gucci, it’s expensive!“ I of course laughed and told him that it is going to be a great product because it’s from Gucci. I was quite excited to try this setting spray! I first tried it after washing my face and allowing my face to dry before spritzing it on my face. I read the directions (I always like to read those, I want to know how to use a product properly or how to best apply, etc.), closed my eyes, and did 2 sprays to my face. Oh em gee! First, I love the natural rose scent! It isn’t overpowering and it smells heavenly, I love natural rose scented things. The mist felt so nice on my skin, it wasn’t irritating, it didn’t break out, it felt refreshing, cooling, such a light feeling on my face. No tight feeling at all. When I used it after applying my makeup, it made my makeup last for hours, even in the humidity here in NC, my foundation didn’t even settle in any lines, it didn’t ruin my makeup, no streaking, it made my face look even better. I absolutely love this refreshing setting spray!
