The fine mist of this setting spray is more comparable to a perfume than most setting sprays I’ve encountered. A luxury bottle and luxury experience to apply— very even application and lovely, light floral scent that dissipates. This isn’t going to lock down your makeup as much as Makeup Forever’s spray, is pricey, and people with  sever sensitivity to scent may be bothered.I have some sensitivity, but this didn’t bother me. I like to have two setting mists in my repertoire— the makeup forever for when I need my makeup to lock down because I’m going to be sweating or one like this or Onomie’s spray, which feel *almost* like skincare as a final step to increase dew level and coherence of powders. Gucci’s mist does this second job easily. A beautiful choice if you want to splurge. finest mist, finest bottle
