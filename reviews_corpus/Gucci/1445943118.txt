It is absolute perfection from the actual mist to the very beautiful luxe bottle. Most importantly the performance of the product matches the claims on the packaging. I have oily skin so I have to be very careful with anything that can be “glowy” but this is not your average face mist that leaves you with an oily greasy mess. This incredibly fine mist soaks right into the skin and I now have more moisture and less oil. It’s amazing. My bare skin is so soft and prepped for makeup and then it locks my makeup in and makes it last longer because it doesn’t sit on top of the skin. It actually soaks into the skin without leaving any residue. There is a scent but it’s so light and refreshing not synthetic smelling. Pro tip:Keep this in your refrigerator and talk about a cooling refreshing experience morning, noon, and night. It’s incredible and I will purchase this over and over again. hands down best mist...perfection in a bottle!
