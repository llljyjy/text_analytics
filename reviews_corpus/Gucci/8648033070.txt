I received this product for free for my honest review....first off wanna say how beautiful this packaging was its simple yet elegant in glass frosted bottle it just screams fancy lol I have tried ALOT OF FACE “MISTS“ OR “FINISHING SPRAY“ I can honestly say this one is a favorite of mine I have used it before makeup after I’ve used on my foundation brush and used it after and works basically always doesn’t clog my pores break me out if anything it helped my combination skin I’ve used this in TN summer humid heat and not gonna say it kept makeup on bc we have had record high heats but I do think helped with blotting papers of course I’ve used as a mid day refresher and it just is super refreshing the rose smell isn’t crazy atleast not for me! One my favorite things about it is the spray nozzle most sprays drown u or sprays to much this one is simply perfect it is a perfect mist and I love it a little goes long way! I was impressed with this product however the price I not my favorite thing that would be only thing in way of purchasing again... but it is a great product and we’ll it’s gucci so if u feeling fancy try it  below is a picture of makeup 12 hours plus still going strong in Tennessee heat Definitely a refreshing experience for your face
