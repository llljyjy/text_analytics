The Gucci Brume De Beautè Beauty Mist is utterly gorgeous.  The heavy frosted glass bottle with textured gold lid screams sophistication.  The spray is dispersed in a finely structured spray with wide coverage.  It does have a light sticky residue, hence the four star rating.  The residue makes it a great priming or setting spray, as it ‘grabs’ the makeup and holds it in place.  But does not work as a refreshing spray.  Would recommend for makeup purposes, but not as part of a skincare routine. So gorgeous
