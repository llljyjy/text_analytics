Lovely. So happy that Gucci has added a face mist to their beauty line! The smell is refreshing, light on the face, not tacky- overall a win win. I wouldn’t say that it was spectacular at setting my makeup, but as a refresher during the day, to start the morning or end the day, it was nice.  I’m still head over heels for the Caudalie Beauty Elixir, but this is nice addition to my arsenal of products. nan
