This is officially my new favorite setting spray. I own several Gucci cosmetic products and they have all been a hit! The packaging on this is extremely luxurious but the product really works! My makeup lasts longer and melts into the skin beautifully when I use this spray. The mist is very fine and easy to spray and there is barely a scent. This is also the only setting spray that doesnâ€™t makeup my skin burn from the alcohol. nan
