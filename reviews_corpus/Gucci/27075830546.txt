I received Gucci’s Brume De Beauté Glow Hydrating Mist for free from Influenster andGucci in exchange for my honest review. First impressions mean a lot and the packaging for this product is classy and elegant. The high quality glass bottle is light pink with a gold accent. It looks absolutely stunning on my vanity.When first applied to the skin the mist felt lightweight and absorbed nicely leaving no residue behind. The pump on the bottle distributes the product in a nice, soft, fine mist that covers the face evenly. I really love how the mist leaves my face feeling soft, smooth, refreshed and soothed. It also provides my face with lots of hydration and a gorgeous looking glow. It has a beautiful faint smell of roses which I love. I’ve used it to prime, set and freshen my face throughout the day. I love with how it has made my makeup look flawless and last longer than normal. I’m totally hooked on Gucci’s Brume De Beauté Glow Hydrating Mist. It has definitely earned a spot in my makeup routine. This product is slightly expensive at $76.00, but totally worth every penny. I will be purchasing this product again after mine runs out because that is how much I actually loved it. I would 100% recommend purchasing this luxurious facial mist! You will not be disappointed!
