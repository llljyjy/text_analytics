Love the super fine mist. The bottle is heavy and luxurious. My skin does look more hydrated when I use this before and after makeup. Its great for a refresh during the day.For the price, I dont feel like this does a lot. I prefer my other skincare for moisturized skin. Feels like youâ€™re paying more for the Gucci name and packaging than actual results. Lovely luxury - not much for results
