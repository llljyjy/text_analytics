I received Gucci Brume de Beaute Beauty Mist for free to try and my opinion is my own. Omg !!! First off .. the bottle is soooo luxurious! I used it as a primer and finishing spray with my normal daily makeup and WOW there was a huuuuge difference! My skin looked glowy all day and I got so many compliments on how great my skin looked. The spray itself has a light beautiful scent that doesn’t irritate your skin. My makeup looked beautiful all day long even in the humid Missouri heat. I cannot get enough of this stuff and I have to admit I’ve found my new favorite primer/setting spray and I intend to keep it in my daily wear. Cannot say enough good about it! Heaven sent!!!
