Lancome Absolue Revitalizing Eye Cream Is such a rich and luxurious eye cream. I’ve tried several eye creams and this one goes on like butter. It’s creamy and a little goes a long ways. I’ve used this for about a month and I really love how it makes my skin around my eyes more moisturized. It’s minimized my fine lines in just a month. The price point is not an issue since using a small amount will make this last a long time. Luxurious
