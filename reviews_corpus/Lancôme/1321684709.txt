I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this serum for nearly a month and I like the way my skin is reacting to it, but it is not my favorite. It feels like a medium weight serum to me and it takes a few extra moments to settle into my skin. However, it is not irritating or messy.  It works well with my toners and moisturizers, and helps my skin feel comfortable and look refreshed with a glow. The packaging is great. I initially had a problem getting one of the products to dispense, but now I store the bottle upside down and I havenâ€™t had a problem getting all three fluids to pump out equally. nan
