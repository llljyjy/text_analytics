This is such a lovely cream moisturizer. I love that it has a light scent, but nothing overpowering. I have combination skin and I love the way it feels upon my skin. It’s thick enough that you feel it really absorbing into your skin, but it doesn’t have a heavy or oily feeling. Some creams you put on overnight and wake up feeling like you immediately need to wash your face, but with this one you just wake up with a fresh feeling. I can’t say enough good things about this cream. Definitely worth the splurge! nan
