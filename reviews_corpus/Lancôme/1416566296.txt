In terms of the “look“ of my eye area after using this product, it seems to perform the same as any other eye cream. It moisturizes and hydrates somewhat but is nothing spectacular compared to others. I would not pay full price nor would I recommend this to others at this price. It’s not a bad product, it just doesn’t perform well enough to justify the price. nan
