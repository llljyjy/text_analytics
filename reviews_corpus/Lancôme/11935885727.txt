This is a 3 in one serum, with hyaloronic acid, c+ niacinamide, and ferulic acid, that works on fine lines and is great for hydration. The product has 3 separate containers inside that pump out together when you use it. The combination of separate stable ingredients, joined when you use it, is genius. For the price, the bottle could be a little sturdier. In using the product for the first time, I felt instant plumping and hydration. After a few weeks of use, I notice softer skin that is visibly more hydrated. I recommend this product for anyone with hydration issues or aging skin. Great for reviving skin
