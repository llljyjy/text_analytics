I’ve been really enjoying the texture of this serum and the way my skin looks when using it. It feel moisturizing and leaves a super dewy finish. I have sensitive skin and this caused no irritation at all. I haven’t seen a big difference in my dark spots so I can’t speak to its brightening effects. The packaging looks beautiful, the way the 3 serums mix looks very cool but the bottle feels very plasticky. I feel for the price I’d expect a more luxurious presentation but the formula is good. nan
