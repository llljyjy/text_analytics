After opening the Renergie HCF Triple Serum the first thing I noticed was the dispenser. It is very pretty. Definitely something I would not mind seeing on counter. I loved the idea of the three serums pumping out separately and you blending. Just make sure you wipe off the dispensing area. Some days I felt I was only getting two of the three serums. I like that it has a light scent, nothing over powering or medicinal. I have used for about 2 weeks and think I see results but they are not dramatic. But I understand this is not a miracle serum. Lanc√¥me states best results after 8-12 weeks. The serum goes on smooth and feels light. I do feel like my skin is glowing more and feels soft. I do plan to recommend the product to friends and family that can fit product in budget. I look forward to continuing to use and see more results. My only concern is the price for my budget. This is a new level for serums and I am glad I had opportunity to try it. Waiting on Results
