I was a little skeptical of this product when I first began using it. The price seemed extreme, and I doubted I would see real results. I was wrong! My skin feels so good after using this product for a few weeks. It is light and leaves my skin feeling refreshed, not greasy or layered with excess products. Lancome has done a fantastic job with this product, and the packaging is also very appealing sitting on the counter. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a way to care for their skin in the new year. nan
