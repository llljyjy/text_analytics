I used this product for over 2 weeks, 2 times a day to see how i liked it and what it did for my skin. I loved this serum, after 2 weeks my skin felt more supple and glowy. My skin was also super soft and moisturized which is a hard thing to pull off without a million products so that is a total win! I love how this applied layered with moisturizer and makeup with absolutely no pilling and easy to apply. A lot of products can have super strong scents and this was very non scented, which some scents can irritate and this worked beautifully with my skin.The only issue i had with this product was the application system. If stored upside down it dispenses all 3 products great but if stored upright i find it harder to dispense all 3. So my advice would be to store it upside down and you will have absolutely no issues.  My skin looks and feels great after trying this out and i will continue to use and recommend to others who want to take care of their skin Great product!
