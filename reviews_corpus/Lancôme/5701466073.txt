I loved this serum. My face instantly looked more supple and more luminous. In the pictures I’m only wearing the serum. It is extremely fast absorbent so you might need two pumps to cover your face and neck. I used it day and night for a little over two weeks and haven’t noticed a significant difference on my fine lines. I did notice my face more smooth and hydrated. One thing i didn’t like it’s the fact that when you start using it for the first time, it takes about 8 pumps to fully get the 3 products together into one pump. So for the first 8 times I used it I only got the hyaluronic acid. It has a nice scent. Not too perfumy or overpowering. My skin really does feel great when it apply or. Overall I recommend A nice plumping serum
