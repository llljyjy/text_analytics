This is a very hydrating cream! I found that it hydrated my pores and some of my fine lines were lessened with consistent use of this cream. It would probably take a little while for greater changes in my facial skin. Waking up in the morning, it definitely feels really soft! My only annoyance is that I wake up with a lot of whiteheads if I use more than a pea-sized amount. nan
