I am so buying Lancome Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream again once I’m complete with this jar. This is my new holy grail of night creams. My face looks so rejuvenated the next morning. I’ve even noticed a difference with the crows feet around my eyes and the pores on my face. I have been using this product for about a month. I love how it doesn’t clog my pores and my skin immediately absorbs the product. It works so well with my evening prep products and doesn’t make my face feel sticky. I absolutely love this product! My new holy grail of night creams!
