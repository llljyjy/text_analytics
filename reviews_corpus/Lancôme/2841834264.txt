Because this cream is so rich, a little goes a long way. I learned this lesson when I applied too much the first time and woke up with a pimple on my cheek. I quickly got used to how it thins as I work it in, used less, and It hasn’t broken me out since. I’ve been using it every day I don’t use vitamin C and every night except retinol nights. This cream has a tightening effect that I enjoy. My skin feels soft and just a little more taut where I’d previously been feeling a little jowly. While I do like the tightness, I wouldn’t describe my skin as feeling plumper. This cream does add some moisture and feels pretty terrific going on, but I don’t get any sort of extreme hydration boost. It feels more like a breathable occlusive layer, which is still useful and quite nice, but I feel I add the moisture in earlier steps, and this cream seals it in. It may be ideal for warmer weather, but for the cold, I need more hydration. Good now, hopefully great in warm weather…
