I’ve been using Absolue morning and night for almost two weeks. I love how soft it is and the non Greasy formula. I was a bit worried that it would have a robust fragrance especially with Rose extracts. Smells very soft and pleasant. I noticed the brightness the first time I put it on, which surprised me. I’ve gone a Few days without putting makeup on since my skin looked radiant without it. On the days I did wear makeup, the cream was a great base which made the makeup go on easily. I recently moved to Denver where the air is dryer and this cream is a welcome blessing to keep my skin hydrated. I’m in my late 50’s with normal to dry skin. I’ve used Clinique and Olay In the past. I would recommend this product. I’m giving it 4 stars only do to the cost. It is expensive. Revitalizing and Brightening….it does work
