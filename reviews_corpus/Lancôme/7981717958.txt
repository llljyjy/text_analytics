I really like this serum. I definitely see smoother skin, reduced redness around my face and supple. I do have normal skin and do use hydrating essence before I apply this serum. As for the scent on this, I absolutely do not like it. In the beginning I almost felt like puking. I have since gotten used to it but I am sensitive to scents so yeah. Other than that, I think this is pretty neat since itâ€™s basically a 3 in 1 product. Good serum: one stop shop
