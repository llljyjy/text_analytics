I’ve been using this serum for 2 weeks now and have noticed that my skin is looking more brighter and plump. One pump is enough to cover my whole face and neck. I love that with that pump you get the benefits of 3 different products in one which is great for my busy mornings for when I don’t have time to do a full skincare regimen. It’s a little bit oily on my face but I do have combination skin so I pair this with a matte sunblock and it works great together. Lancome Triple action serum
