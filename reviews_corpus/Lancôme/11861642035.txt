I was beyond surprised by this night cream. It somehow manages to be both deeply moisturizing and light-feeling, absorbing quickly. The advertisement says it melts into the skin and they weren’t lying. Unlike lots of other night creams, it doesn’t just sit on top of my skin waiting to be absorbed by my pillow. It makes my skin feel like velvet and keeps my skin hydrated for quite a while. Beautiful Moisturizer
