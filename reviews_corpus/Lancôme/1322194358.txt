This is one of the few products I have used that I can truly say that I have seen a difference within only 1 use.  The first time I applied this to my skin,  it immediately looked smoother, more hydrated and had a healthy glow.  My skin usually needs an adjustment period when starting new products so I began using this once a day in the evening,  although I quickly realized that unlike other products that would cause dryness and flaking upon initial use,  this product continued to provide hydration. I then began using it twice per day in the AM and PM. After 2 weeks of consistent use,  I saw a decrease in fine lines around my eyes and fading of sun spots on my cheeks. The combination of these 3 ingredients in this serum just works beautifully together. The scent is very light and not overwhelming either. Yes, the price point is a bit daunting, but this is definitely a product that will be worth the splurge. Recommend 100% Results almost immediately
