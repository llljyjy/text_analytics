I’ve used this product for about 3 weeks. Initially I was worried that the Vitamin C would cause the formula to be sticky and the Niacinamide wouldn’t be strong enough (needed to prevent my acne). I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn’t sticky and the Niacinamide prevented my breakouts! I applied this twice a day, in the morning and evening. The packaging is luxe, but I did initially have an issue with all three formulas coming out at once until about the third use. There is a slight rose scent but it didn’t bother me. My skin in nice and smooth and I do recommend this for anyone wanting a Vitamin C combo serum. Multi-tasker
