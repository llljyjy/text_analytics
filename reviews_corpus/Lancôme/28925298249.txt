For my skin, this was amazing. This was a part of a free trial and I did push my response to the very end of the tome I had to respond, which probably annoyed bzzagent, but I feel like it gave me a better opportunity to really use the product. As much as I would love to be completely consistent with my skincare routine, I’m not 100%. I over sleep, have late nights, feel sick, get busy, etc, just like most people.  This is not about my habits, but this product, which is, amazing.  It moisturized the dry spots, didn’t over saturate the oily spots,  my skin looked and felt more even, my foundation looked smoother. Would recommend to eomen my age, for sure. Why the 4 stars?  It’s not affordable. Probably the women who could most benefit from this product, also arent dropping $130 a jar on it..ijs. Should a premium product be available at a “price point“  well no, but also... 100% Recommend
