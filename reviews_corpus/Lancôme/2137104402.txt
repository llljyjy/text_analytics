So far I love this product. It came in such a beautiful container and the fragrance is so pleasant, however the smell is slightly stronger than I would like compared to my Shiseido products.  I have been using it every night for the past few weeks and have noticed that my eyes feel more hydrated and less wrinkled. I have yet to see changes in the bags under my eyes. The consistency is also light and absorbs well. I plan on continuing usage and hope to see further changes under my eyes. I would recommend this product to my family and friends! Great product!
