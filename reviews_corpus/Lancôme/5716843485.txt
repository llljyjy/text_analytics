This product was a big yikes for me! I was actually super excited to try it and unfortunately right off the bat it disappointed a little. It was scented and I found the sent to be unpleasant. But I continued on to use it. Long story short this product is not for sensitive skin, it cause breakouts all over my face and I know so, because as soon as I stopped using it no more breakouts. nan
