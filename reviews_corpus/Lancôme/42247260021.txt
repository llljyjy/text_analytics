Lancome Advanced GÃ©nifique Night Cream, the skin barrier is restored from the first wake up: +30% moisture retention and +44% moisture in duo with the Youth Activator Serum. About the formula I will only say that it contains hyaluronic acid, 7 probiotic and prebiotic fractions and a trio of ceramides, but what I really want to talk about is why I like it. To begin with, its creamy but light texture does not add any fat. When I wake up in the morning, my skin feels brighter and looks great. If you have the opportunity to try it, you will not be disappointed. Also, the formula is 94% natural and the cream is rated Excellent. My impressions: very pleasant application of this very silky cream, without sticky effect as I have already mentioned, and above all, the skin is smooth when waking up. Fine lines are less noticeable after several days. its very alimalist packaging easy to use. open and store your excellent quality material I recommend it to the fullest Really impressed
