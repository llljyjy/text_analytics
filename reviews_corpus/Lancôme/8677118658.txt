The title of the product says all you need to know. It truly is the absolute richest moisturizer I have come across. My skin is overly sensitive to dry weather so this past winter really did a number of the sensitive areas of my face. Some areas turning into dry spots I just couldn’t get rid of. Within days of using this Lancôme moisturizer my skin had done a complete turn around, it breathed the life right back into my face. It is so beautifully thick that I wasn’t able to use it in the morning if I wanted to apply makeup. I use it as a night moisturizer and it more than does the job! nan
