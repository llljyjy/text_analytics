I’ve tried a few different night creams over the years from different brands such as Estee Lauder, and Clinique, but I have to say that Lancome’s Advanced Genifique repairing night cream is by far the best one I’ve used. It has a really nice texture that sinks into the skin quickly and doesn’t leave any greasy residue behind.I’ve found that it really helps to hydrate and plump up my skin overnight, and in the morning my skin looks and feels much softer and smoother. It’s also helped to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and I’ve even noticed that my dark under eye circles have started to fade.Overall, I’ve been extremely impressed with the Lancome Advanced Genifique repairing night cream and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new night cream to try. A must-have in your skincare routine!
