I absolutely loved this serum that I received from influenster and lancome. The serum made my face feel amazing and has one of the best scents Iâ€™ve smelt in a skincare. I loved it. So one of the serums did take awhile for me to get it to come out. But I sat it upside down for about a hour and shook it a lot and it finally came out and works perfectly now. Highly recommend this product to others!! Give it a try for sure. A must product to my daily routine
