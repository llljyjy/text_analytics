I didn’t expect to love this product so much! I am an avid skincare consumer. I have dry skin that leans on the sensitive side and tend to wash my face at least 2x a day. This product is rather thick so I usually use a nickel-size amount because I like to feel extra moisturized. It goes with my toner and face wash perfectly. The scent is rose which I was worried about because the fragrance scent is strong in this product, but after a week of daily use/twice a day, my skin has not had any adverse reactions. I enjoy using it and my skin feels very supple. The product delivers on richness and moisture. I would absolutely recommend this product to my friends if they’re looking for something luxurious to add to their skincare routine. Personally, the product is out of my price range but I could see myself splurging on it once a year because it’s that moisturizing and my skin loves it. Wonderfully rich and moisturizing
