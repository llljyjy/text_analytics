At first, I didnâ€™t know that it was three different products that are supposed to come out together. So, when I first tried it, I was disappointed. It was oily and clear. After about six pumps in, a white product came out. I should have read the directions to ensure that all three serums were dispensing. After that, I fell in love with this product. It is scented after all. Itâ€™s nice and light. It smells fresh and oddly enough, it reminds me of my mother. ðŸ˜† My skin is more plump and I have really enjoyed it. The mirror effect on the bottle is pretty cool, too. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone. nan
