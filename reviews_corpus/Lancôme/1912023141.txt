I was lucky enough to receive the Lancôme absolue revitalizing eye cream for free in exchange for my honest review! I’m so happy I got to try it because I absolutely love it. I had read great things but I was worried about spending that much money on something I was unsure about. Now, I wish I would have bought it when I first heard about it because it’s completely worth the money. I started seeing results very quickly. My eyes look so much healthier and younger. I love the way it feels. Very moisturizing and smells good. One of the best eye creams I’ve ever used. I highly recommend trying it! Love it!!
