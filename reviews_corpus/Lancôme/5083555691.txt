I purchased this when it was on sale for half off, because I could not justify 230 usd for a face serum. I would not purchase this at full price. However, it makes my skin look so lovely, and I have no idea what kind of magic makes the results so. The ingredients are so average while reading through them, but my skin loves it. I use it with and CosRX’s snail mucin essence and La Roche Posay’s retinoid, followed by my FAB Ultra Repair cream at night, and smattering of other products in the morning. I’m not a fan of the smell, but the scent leaves quickly, and the dropper that measures out the correct amount every time is great, and just enough for both face and neck(though I do have a smaller than average face, so maybe that’s just me). Yes, it’s overpriced for sure, but if you have some expendable income laying around, it’s a great buy. Somehow magical??
