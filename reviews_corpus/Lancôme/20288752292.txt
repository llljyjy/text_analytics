After 3+ weeks, I have noticed a difference in my skin. I notice a lot less dark spots and wrinkles and have a sort of glow. I love the bottle and that I can see each product when it dispenses. The only thing I didn’t like was how it felt on my face. It felt more sticky after applied, which I didn’t love.  The sticky feeling was the only thing that I didn’t like about the product and why I gave it four stars. I was gifted this product for my honest review. nan
