I have been using Lanc√¥me Absolue Revitalizing Eye Cream for 2 1/2 weeks now and I am very impressed with the results that I have gotten. On the first day the delicate skin under my eyes was more hydrated and brighter. I could feel a difference after every use. The thinning skin was becoming stronger, thicker, healthier. The fine lines are slowly diminishing and less noticeable.  I have superb hydration and any puffiness under my eyes has gone away. It has also lessened my dark under eye circles. Which I thought would never go away.I highly recommend this if you have fine lines and notice that the skin under your eyes is getting thinner. Absolue can and will turn that all around for you. It worked for me. Hydrated, healthy under eye skin.
