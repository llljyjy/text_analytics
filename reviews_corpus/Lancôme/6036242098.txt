I wasnâ€™t expecting too much with this serum because I have tried MANY and they always fell short.  I am pleasantly surprised with the performance of this one!  Immediately I noticed how hydrated and plump my skin was.  After a few days of use I started to notice that my skin looked dramatically more smooth and even.  I was also concerned about the fragrance in this product but it actually is quite nice and it fades almost immediately with no irritation.  I even got my husband on board and he is hooked.  Definitely will purchase in the future and highly recommend! Smooth, hydrated skin!
