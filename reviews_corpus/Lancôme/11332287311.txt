I am currently pregnant and the hormones have been wreaking havoc on my skin - dryness, discoloration, breakouts - you name it. While I don’t typically love to break routine, I’m happy I took a chance on this product. Within a few weeks of consistent daily am/pm use, my skin was back to being balanced, hydrated, and smooth. The bottle is a little fussy but it’s worth it. Glowing!
