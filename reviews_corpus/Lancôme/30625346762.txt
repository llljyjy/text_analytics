I haven’t used a night cream in a long time because I’ve been so used to sleeping masks lately but now I’m thinking I need to bring this back into my routine. I saw really good results using the Lancome Repairing Night Cream. I noticed after a week or so that my face looked more hydrated and plump and I could see some of my fine lines and wrinkes had softened. nan
