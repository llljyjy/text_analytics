So I usually do my 10-step skincare (Korean skincare) routine, and I subbed this in for the serum. Let me tell you, I saw changes. My face felt more bouncy, hydrated (without being weirdly sweaty sticky - important since I have hyperhidrosis) and my face feels SMOOTH. as someone with aging skin being 32, this is definitely right up my alley. My only critique is you need to store this upside down or all 3 of the serums won’t come out together. The milky one is less viscous than the other two, and doesn’t want to come out sometimes. After storing on the cap, it works perfectly! Worth the price!!
