This product was sent to me by Influenster for my honest review. When I first started applying this serum, I was blown away! The three serums within it, combine to transform the skin into its most hydrated, plump, glowy version! I saw results within the first use! It was like using the blurring filter in real life! The fragrance is pretty good too. Kind of floral. The packaging feels luxe. At times, I struggled with getting all three serums to come out at once, but that stopped when I started placing the bottle upside down. I have sensitive skin and unfortunately, after using this for over a week, my skin started breaking out into tiny bumps. I wish my skin tolerated it better because I truly loved how it initially made it feel. If you do not have sensitive skin, I highly recommend trying this serum. Its pretty life changing! Great Serum, Not for Sensitive Skin
