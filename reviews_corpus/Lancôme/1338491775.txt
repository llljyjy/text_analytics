I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.  The product packaging is lovely and sleek, and it’s convenient to be able to apply all three active ingredients at once.  That said, while I notified an immediate improvement after my first application, repeated use seemed to irritate my skin and cause some acne and irritation issues.  Scent is a bit strong, though consistent with other Lancôme products.  All in all, I won’t keep using this over other products. Not my favorite
