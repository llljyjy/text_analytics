It’s got 3 serum in one tube. First benefit is to help with volume loss. I do feel my skin tighten after using it. Also the serum feels a bit sticky. Lancôme also recommend to go upward motion while applying it to help with the lift. Second benefit is to help with wrinkles. I also fine lines on my forehead which I think it helps a bit due to my skin tightening. Last benefit is to help with dark spots. I have moderate amount of acne scars on my cheek and it helps with fading, not totally gone though. I think I will have to use long term to help with the scars. Tighten and fade dark spots
