After using this product for four weeks I am obsessed. It has given me some much needed moisturizing I needed this summer, it has a light scent which I love, I struggled at first to get it all out at the same time but I finally read a few tricks and itâ€™s been easy to use ever since.. Simply sit it upside down for a minute before use. It had reduced the appearance of the fine lines on my forehead in a little over a month.. I will absolutely purchase this product when I run out. I love it. I received this product complementary from Influenster in exchange for my honest reviews. A must have staple in your skincare routine!
