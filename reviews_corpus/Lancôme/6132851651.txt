I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I love this triple serum by Lancome with Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Niacinamide and Ferulic Acid; it helps with dark spots, wrinkles, and brightens skin. All of which I need! After I was pregnant with my first child I developed a dark spot by my eye, I have wrinkles from the sun, and enlarged pores. After using this I have noticed an improved with all of these issues.
