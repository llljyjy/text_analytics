I’ve been using this serum for 1.5 months. This has been a lovely addition to my skincare routine. My skin is normally dry and dehydrated. Since using this 2x daily I’ve noticed huge improvements in my skins overall appearance. It seems more evenly toned, extremely hydrated, my fine lines are slowly disappearing.  The only downside is the packaging. Upon first usage, it took my boyfriend & I over 15 minutes of shaking for the 3rd ingredient to come out. I suggest storing the bottle upside down- for me, this has been the only way all the ingredients come out without issue. Once I run out I plan on purchasing this myself. I strongly recommend this if you can financially afford to do so. I still have 3/4 of product left after almost 2 months of usage. My new favorite
