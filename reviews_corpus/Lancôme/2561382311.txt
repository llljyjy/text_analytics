This is a triple-dose serum that helps improve volume loss. The serum contains three chambers, one with Hyaluronic Acid, one with vitamin C and Niacinamide, and one with Ferulic Acid. Having serums in different chambers helps preserve the efficacy of the serums. The HA helps with volume loss, the vitamin c and niacinamide helps with dark spots, and the ferulic acid helps provide antioxidants to the skin preventing the formation of free radicals. The serum comes in three textures, gel, cream, and emulsion which you blend together before putting in your skin. I have been using this serum for the past month and I love it. You can use the serum day and night and I’ve not had any irritation or adverse effects. On the other hand, my skin has been looking brighter and healthy. I’ve been really impressed with how my skin has responded to this serum. I really recommend this serum. Great serum
