As an employee I have tried almost every eye cream sold in our Sephora store. Unfortunately our smaller store no longer carries Lancome skincare. But when we did carry it, I was never able to try it because we were always out. I got it recently and I will now be buying it regularly. Iâ€™m 61 and this cream is amazing, and I mean AHMAZING. The skin under my eyes has become so much thinner and crepey and I was having a hard time find anything that rejuvenated my undereye skin. One use and the skin is firmer and stronger and no longer crepey and so soft. I use it every day now at least twice a day. I absolutely love this eye cream and I found it more effective than even La Mer eye cream for me. I cannot speak to dark circles as I do not suffer from that issue. Lancome Nailed It with this eye cream product!
