This serum gave my dehydrated 38 year old skin a noticeable result in plumpness and hydration. I didn’t really notice any brightening effects, but I always use products that help with this and smoothness, and have used ones with Niacimide in the past, so it may just be that I personally didn’t see a difference compared to other serums I’ve used. I would also note, that you MUST follow the instructions for priming the pump and do not be surprised if you don’t get an even amount of product out of all three chambers on the first use (I didn’t), but I had no issues with the chambers not dispensing properly after the first use. This means, I did waste a little product initially, but it was well worth it, in my opinion, in order to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of the ingredients by keeping them locked in separate chambers until pumped. As with a majority of innovative skincare pump systems, I just wish there were a window or indicator of when you are running low; this is one of those products that you might not know you’re running out of until it’s gone. Hydrated and supple skin!
