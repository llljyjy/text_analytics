Overall this is an OK night cream.   It is not greasy and the scent is pleasant, not overpowering. It makes my skin feel very moisturized when I wake up.  I have been using for a couple of weeks and havenâ€™t noticed any Improvements in the tone or repair of my skin.  For the price, I was expecting more. nan
