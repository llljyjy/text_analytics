I received this serum to test out but I will be purchasing with my own money once I run out. This serum is Bomb.com. I look forward to using this serum every morning and night after washing my face. My face instantly feels hydrated and has such a nice glow to it. This serum has given me the confidence to not wear makeup and have my skin breathe. The three holes is a great display of great products going into your skin. If I had to give it a con, it would be the lack of visibility of how much product is left. Overall run and buy! Your skin will thank you! Hydrated and Plump
