I am really enjoying this product! It has beautiful packaging that’s sturdy and planned well to keep the serums separate until it’s time to dispense. The serums go on smoothly with a quality feel that isn’t too heavy and not too sticky feeling either. I love how this serum along with my moisturizer make my skin feel so supple especially in the winter when my skin is extra dry. I am definitely seeing improvements I. The overall quality of my skin with reduced redness and more radiance. I’m eager to see how the result improve over several months! I’ll definitely be repurchasing! Beautiful skincare product!
