This was interesting packaging, which I always love (makes it feel fun to use!). However, it does take a few pumps to get all 3 products out, which made me nervous that I would be wasting too much. Once all came out, I loved the combination of products! What I noticed most was dark spots from my pregnancy-induced melasma fading fast! Which is great! I have been using it for 3 weeks and first started noticing a difference last week. Great once you get going!
