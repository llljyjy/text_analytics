I have been using this serum for over 2 weeks now and I can say it left my skin very smooth and moisturized/nourished.  I still have few of my dark spots which I think I need to keep trying this serum longer to see improvements but I can confidently say this serum leaves your skin texture so smooth and moisturized.  I felt a difference on my skin’s hydration levels and I feel that it did improve the look of my pores around my nose.  I am not sure if it helped with the fine wrinkles on my forehead or if the hydration plumped my skin but I do see improvement there too.  One downside is that I am never able to get the same amount of serums to pump out as I feel like I am using up one serum more than the other two so I am afraid I’ll be left with just two serums by the time I am almost done with the bottle. Made my skin smooth and nourished
