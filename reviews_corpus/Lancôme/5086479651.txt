Very luxe, treat yourself! This crème fondante is as luxurious as the name sounds. It’s thick, hydrating, soft, buttery and absorbs into your skin with no greasy after effect. It really feels amazing on your skin and super hydrating. It has a soft scent that seems to dissipate quickly. While this may seem pricey, if you are looking for something to hydrate, firm, give a glow, and plump your skin this is it! The packaging is very luxe too. I am completely pleased with this crème. I received this product from Bzzagent for an honest review and I feel this is honest. If you want a luxurious crème to treat yourself and splurge, a little goes a long way, get this! Luxurious, soft, plumping, hydrating, dream!
