I’ve been searching for the fountain of youth & was lucky to get this to sample. So I tried it for 14 days as instructed. It looks firm in the jar but goes on very smooth. Has a light scent. Maybe as I only did 14 days that I didn’t see much improvement, but will continue to use this as it’s a reputable brand! Four stars as I don’t know the long term effects. nan
