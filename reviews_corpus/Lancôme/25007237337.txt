I love it so far!  After the first use my face felt hydrated.  I’ve been using it for almost a month now and my skin tone looks more even and my skin is definitely smoother.  My skin looks brighter and younger than when I first started using it.  I love the feel of it on my skin.  It’s not greasy at all, but feels like liquid silk.  Overall, I’m extremely happy with the results.  Will continue to use in my morning & nighttime routine. Fabulous
