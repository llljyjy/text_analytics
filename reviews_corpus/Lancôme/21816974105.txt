I love this serum!! I would give this a 4.5 stars. I’ve been using this for over 3 weeks and every time I apply it I feel an immediate tightening and firming effect. When I traveled over the weekend I left it at home and saw a difference in my skin: it had less luster and looked blah. This product is super innovative, and I enjoy the application. The only feedback I have is that it is slightly over perfumed, over packaged (hence not bringing it with me over the weekend) and difficult to use in the beginning. Well done Lancôme! Amazing!
