I received this product for free from influenster and Lancôme in exchange for my review.  I have been using this product for over  two weeks.  Sometimes in the morning sometimes at night to mix it up. My First impression was that I was impressed with the packaging! It’s a very nice bottle.  Key ingredients are hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, niacinamide, and ferulic acid.  My favorite part of this product was the dispenser.  There are three little holes in it.  So with each pump, each ingredient is freshly dispensed and mixed together! Genius! The texture of the serum is very thick.  Definitely the thickest serum I have ever used.  But it went on my face very smooth and has made my face feel really hydrated and made it look less dull/more alive. :) I am very happy with the results.  I did not experience any breakouts despite the thick texture. I have been loving it and would highly recommend it to anyone!! Amazing triple serum!
