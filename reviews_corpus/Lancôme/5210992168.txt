I’ve been using the Génifique serum for a long time and I absolutely love it. It just sinks into my skin and feels so good so I was curious to see how the new night cream would be. The first night I used it by itself and it stung my face a bit but in the morning my skin looked good no issues at all. The next night I layered it over the serum and woke up to a really nice complexion. Will keep using and see how my wrinkles disappear. nan
