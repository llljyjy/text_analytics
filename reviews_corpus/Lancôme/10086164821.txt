This is my first time trying a skincare product from Lanc√¥me. I am happy to say it did not disappoint. I love how smoothly this cream applies. When I wake up in the morning, my skin looks refresh and plump!  I am also super happy that it is safe to for sensitive skin! You also do not need a lot of product as a little goes along way! I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and I can definitely see a difference. I am excited to have this permanently in my skincare routine. I totally would recommend this product. A MUST HAVE
