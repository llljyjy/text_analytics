This is now a staple in my routine. I have fair skin that’s sensitive to everything, including vitamin c. This is the only product that doesn’t make me break out. When I put it on for the first time after my toner, I couldn’t believe how silky it make my skin feel. I have already ordered another bottle. While it is expensive, it’s absolutely 100 percent worth it. I will be buying this for life.
