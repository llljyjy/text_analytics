I was pretty excited to try this Lancôme Absolue Cream. I love a good quality moisturizer. I’m always hesitant on trying certain ones though because I’m worried they will be too thick or greasy on my skin. This one here I will either wear during the day without makeup and the reason for that is because it feels a little heavier on my skin so I go light on the amount of product I use also. I do however enjoy using this more so during my skin care routine at night time for good hydration. My skin appearance overall looks more even toned, smoother, and sleeker. It feels softer too. A tip I would offer is to wear this at night if you tend to have oily skin because this kinda adds the shine and the product is super moisturizing that it lasts all night! It’s personal preference but I don’t want a glowy oily appearance throughout my day from a moisturizer. But I definitely love using it in my nighttime routine. The product ingredients and packaging is very high quality and I love I can get the refill for the jar itself when I run low! I will be repurchasing this! Will buy again
