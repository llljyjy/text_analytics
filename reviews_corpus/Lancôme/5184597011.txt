Great serum! I have been using the serum for the past three weeks during my AM and PM routine. I like how it leaves my skin. It has improved my skin tone and leaves it smooth. It doesn’t irritate the skin. The packaging is really nice. The bottle is plastic, which can be great for traveling. The product does have a moderate/strong smell, so I wouldn’t recommend if you have a sensitive nose. nan
