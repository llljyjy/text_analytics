The Lancome Absolue Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer is intensely hydrating to my mature and dry skin. It instantly plumps the skin and smooths the lines to make it a perfect canvas for my make up. I love the non greasy application and the light rose fragrance.This new night time application has immensely improved the texture of my skin and brightened my face with regular use over the last 2 weeks. I am very happy with this cream, if the price was a little more affordable....It would make me even more happier. Restore natural youth
