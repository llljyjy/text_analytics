I usually use Deciem/Ordinary serums with Lancôme products and I’m surprised at how easy this triple serum is to use. It lightened my dark spots. It’s helped increase the moisture level and my skin is smoother. It’s quick and simple and really helpful as I don’t have a lot of time, dealing with a rambunctious toddler. It smells like lychee and the smell quickly dissipate so that’s a nice bonus for me. It has a slightly tacky finish which is helpful for layering. I’ve been using it for a month. I’ve included my daily regiment picture and a before vs after. Awesome triple serum! Time saver!
