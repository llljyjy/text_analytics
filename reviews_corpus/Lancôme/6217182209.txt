As someone who has tried so many moisturizers, I must say that this one is AMAZING! I love the texture and how it feels on my skin. I have been using it for about two weeks now and can definitely say that I would repurchase this. It’s a rich formula that’s lightly scented (only for a few minutes), takes a little longer to absorb but  feels like you’re using a mask to go to bed as your face feels so soft in the morning :DIf you’re thinking about getting it, don’t hesitate, definitely worth every penny. nan
