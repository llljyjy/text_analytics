This cream has the perfect lightweight yet moisturizing feel. I’ve tried other night creams that claim to do the same things as this one, but they’ve always been too thick, greasy, or heavy and made me break out from being overly moisturizing. My skin has never looked better. Fine lines have been reduced and skin is brighter and more even toned. nan
