Overall I really love this night cream. It delivers instant hydration in a light absorbable cream. It really does melt into your skin and doesn’t feel heavy or thick like other night creams. After using a few weeks my skin looks healthier and more supple. It doesn’t take much of the product so it should last a long time so that’s a big bonus. I did notice the fragrance was a little strong but it’s worth it for the results. Leaves skin hydrated
