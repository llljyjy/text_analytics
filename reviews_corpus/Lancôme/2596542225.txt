This stuff has made a incredible difference to my skin.  It looks smoother and I look more refreshed.   I work a high stress job and I’ve started a 10 minute face routine at night and it has been a game changer.  I like the fact that it’s not strongly scented because I need my senses turned off at night.  I have used it at night at during the day and prefer using it at night.  If used during the day I immediately apply make up after which dumbs the products effectiveness down in my opinion.  I honestly didn’t read the directions maybe it is only supposed to be used at night.  Haha anyways if u have the money to blow try this stuff out.  I used it with their pricey moisturizer and felt like the two together were a game changer.  My skin hasn’t looked this great in a long time.   Hope this helps. Fair skin aka pale af with a few sun spots
