I love absolutely everything about this night cream. I’m 38 and I’ve only recently started using night creams, as it’s starting to get cold and dry where I live. I used this each night and especially noticed a difference around my eyes. I don’t have wrinkles around my eyes quite yet, but it’s definitely improved the tone and texture of my skin. It smells heavenly and leaves my skin feeling super moisturized. This cream sinks in so quickly and you only need a tiny bit for your whole face. You’ll wake up to soft, lovely, glowing skin after just a few days of consistent use! I’m so happy I found this to get me through the winter! Must have for the winter season!
