This serum actually works.  I wasn’t aware of the claims when I initially tried it, but After using it for a few weeks, I can say that my skin does appear to be plump, youthful, very well hydrated, and glowing.  I can’t say that I’ve seen any change in the discolorations in my skin, but I will definitely continue using it. I love it A must have for maintaining youthful looking skin
