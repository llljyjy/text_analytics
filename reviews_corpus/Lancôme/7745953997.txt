For reference I am in my mid 40s, have aging skin, hyperpigmentation, enlarged pores, wrinkles and fine lines (that’s what happens when you don’t use sunscreen on your younger years….) I liked this sunscreen but I didn’t consider it that wonderful for the high price tag, at least for what I look from a sunscreen.PROS:- Lightweight texture: it was easy to spread but it took a while to get absorbed by the skin.- It doesn’t leave too much of a greasy feeling (even applying the recommended amount), although it can feel very heavy on oily skin.- It worked well under my makeup but I needed to apply a powder to compensate the glowy finish from the sunscreen.- It has a lot of antioxidants as ingredients which are always very welcome.- SPF of 50+.- No white cast- It has a beautiful sophisticated scent that I love but if you are not into scented products, this is not for you. CONS:- High price: this sunscreen has a steep price of $40 for just 1 oz. - It has Oxybenzone as an ingredient, which is suspected to negatively after the endocrine system.- It has Alcohol Denat. quite high in the ingredient list.- I can’t apply it around my eyes because it irritates them.- It has perfume, which I personally like but it doesn’t dissipate over time. If you don’t like scented formulas, stay away from this one because it is quite intense.I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador This one is not for me
