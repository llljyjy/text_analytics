This is a higher priced product but its unique delivery system makes it so much more effective! It has three separate parts that are only mixed together when you pump it out so they stay fresh. It also makes incorporating different actives into your routine so much easier. Some of the actives irritate my skin when I use them separately, but the combination of the ingredients in this serum worked wonderfully for my skin. It dispenses equal amounts of serum each time and one pump goes a long way. The serum is thick enough that it doesn’t run down your skin. Sinks in pretty much instantly and doesn’t ball up under other products. It does leave a bit of residue as it dries, though it doesn’t feel heavy or sticky. I have combo skin with a lot of scarring from acne. I have been using it twice daily for three weeks and it has really lightened my dark spots and improved my skin barrier way better than other serums/creams I’ve tried. Very effective!
