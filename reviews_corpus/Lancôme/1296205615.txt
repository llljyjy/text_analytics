This is a pretty decent serum, but by no means favorite serum that contains HA. The consistency is kind of sticky and in this terrible NYC/NJ humidity, I find it really takes forever to dry down on my skin. It also has a moderately strong scent, which I’m not crazy about. The packaging is beautiful and once I wash my face after wearing it overnight, my skin does feel nice. I can’t say I’m completely wowed though and will probably go back to my original products and pass this along to a friend once I’m satisfied with my reviews. Overall, I feel like it’s pretty gimmicky, and for the price point, not worth it. I can think of better ways to spend $135.00 Ps: a word about the packaging. Store the bottle upside down on your countertop when not in use. This is pretty much the only way to guarantee all three serums will dispense with each pump. Just trust me. Kinda sticky
