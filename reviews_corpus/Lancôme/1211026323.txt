I started using this night repair cream to help with my dry, dull skin.  I noticed a difference within three weeks of using it! My skin was much brighter and my skin tone was improved.  The cream is light weight and contains hyaluronic acid which helps keeps moisture locked in.  Definitely worth getting for your night skincare routine.  I will definitely continue to use this cream since itâ€™s made a big change in my skin. Works wonders!
