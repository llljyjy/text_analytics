I saw immediate results after using Lancome Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream.  I used it as directed after cleansing my face.  I have some redness on the apples of my cheeks, and it was completely gone the next morning after just one use of this product!  My skin was moisturized and even. (I have dry combination skin.) It looked youthful and bright.  This is my new holy grail product!  I highly recommend this product! Bye Bye Redness!
