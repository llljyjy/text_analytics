I have been avoiding this cream for years only because of the price but finally I told myself to get it over with. I have huge eyes so when the tightness underneath my eyes weaken it brings the appearance of heavy bags. For me, after 2 days of use - morning and night with a clean face; I have noticed a significant difference. It is slowly erasing the line that created that baggy look to begin with. This cream has also softened and blurred my skins natural texture as well. This is definitely my go - to cream now. If you were scared to try it, this is your calling to just do it. I live for this stuff!
