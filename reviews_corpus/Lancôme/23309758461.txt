I love this serum so much! I have been using it for 3 weeks and I most certainly have seen an improvement in my combination skin particularly when comes to my dark spots. I love that the three different ingredients are stored separately until I pump it out, I believe that’s why it works so well. Now it’s pretty pricey but worth every penny to me. I would recommend to all! It definitely Works!
