I really loved this product! I did get this product for free for my honest review. I’ve been using this at night for 3 weeks now. It is a nice, thicker creme. I have very oily skin so to use during daytime was a bit to moisturizing. This was a perfect night creme as the last step in my skincare routine. There is a slight floral smell but nothing to aggressive and goes away pretty fast. Every morning when I woke up my face felt so soft and supple. My face definitely looked a bit brighter and more even. I can’t say 100% to just this, but worked into a skin care routine is a perfect fit. The only thing that I don’t like is the price tag. It was fantastic and I got results, but I’m not sure it’s worth the $130 price tag. I’m sure there are other products that work just as well for a cheaper price point. Soft and Supple Skin
