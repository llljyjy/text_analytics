I was really wanting to use and love it, but it made my skin break out unfortunately and after years of work to get my skin not only healthy but blemish free, that was just a huge no for me. I can say that my skin did feel super moisturized when using it though. It’s a lightweight cream with a nice light texture to it that doesn’t feel greasy. I wish I could have used it more to give results on whether or not it helps with anti-aging and uneven texture. It’s A No For Me
