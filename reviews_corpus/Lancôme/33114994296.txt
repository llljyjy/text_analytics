Two weeks ago I received my first free product from Buzz Agent for review on the new product from Lancome, Renergie H.C.F. Triple Serum. I was very excited to try this as Lancome is well known in today’s market. During my trial, I noticed my skin becoming increasingly softer and smother as it was tightening. The biggest change I noticed was that the dark spots on my face were steadily disappearing. This is the first product I have tried that has truly exceeded my expectations. I have referred it to my family and friends as well as made my first purchase on this product. This is a definite “go to“ in my daily routine for self care and I recommend anyone who reads this to invest. Thanks Lancome and Buzz Agent for introducing me to this product. A definite hit!
