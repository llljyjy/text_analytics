I received this a free sample and thought I’d give it a go. It does have an overwhelping rose smell when first applying. However this goes away quickily. I’ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and do not really notice much of a difference in terms of revitalizing and brightening, though my face does feel softer. While this product is not bad, I don’t think that I would buy another jar of this as I just do not see the results that this is aimed for on myself. nan
