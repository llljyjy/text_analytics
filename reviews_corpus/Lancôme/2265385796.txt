I had hopes for this but those were pretty quickly dashed.  First time I used the product, I saw no change in my skin’s appearance despite the package claiming “immediately, skin looks more healthy, luminous with a visibly smoother quality.“  Yeah, no.  It also says it should be good for all skin types, even those with sensitive skin but that wasn’t the case either; it was really uncomfortable having it on my face and I had to force myself to leave it on just to try and give it a fair chance.If you can get past that, it feels heavy on the skin and made it feel tacky which was just another layer of yuck.  I’ll take a hard pass on this one! Not for me
