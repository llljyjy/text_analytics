I’ve been using this serum for over 3 weeks now and overall I like it. I can say that I see the difference from before - my skin looks fresher and smoother, I’ll definitely keep using it further - I am a big fan of a Lancôme’s skincare products & have never been disappointed with the results! How to use it : Daily, in morning skincare routine and evening skincare routine. Holding the product horizontally over the palm of your hand or fingertips, press down on the pump until the 3 formulas appear. For one application, dispense 2 pumps into the hand. Mix together in your hand until the three formulas are blended into a single serum texture. Apply the serum on a clean face and neck using outward and upwards motions for a visibly-lifted effect and follow with your usual moisturizer and eye cream. I personally prefer this serum as an evening skincare routine and I don’t apply anything on the top, it’s very rich on its own for me, a bit too oily for the mornings. I usually keep all my serums in a fridge, I just love the feeling of a cold liquid on my skin, face instantly gets this glowing dewy look that I love. The smell is amazing as well! I am not really thrilled with the dispenser but maybe I just need to get used to it. Getting freshly mixed product with every pump is great. The best part is how well it works. I have a new favorite yet again from Lancôme. Triple greatness in a bottle
