Since starting to use this product two weeks ago, I’ve noticed a more even tone and glow with my skin! However, I did find the serum made my face a little oily at first and takes quite some time to soak in. At night this isn’t as much of an issue as in the morning. The serum goes on easily, and as long as you store the product upside down, all three parts comes out equally. Overall, I would recommend it and I’m looking forward to seeing how my skin changes overtime while I continue using this product. Glowing Skin!!
