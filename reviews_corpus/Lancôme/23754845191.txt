I was excited to try something new from Lancôme because they have such great products and this one was no different. I received Lancôme’s Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum: For Plumping & Anti-Aging as a free sample box in exchange for my honest review. The 3 separate chambers of hyaluronic acid, vitamin Cc and niacinamide, and ferulic acid are awesome because the ingredients stay more potent because they are separated until use. Everything I was promised with this serum was delivered. I am really happy with the results. My only issue was the scent, although not a strong scent my face did break out from it at first. I stuck with it though through the first 2 weeks and Im glad I did. nan
