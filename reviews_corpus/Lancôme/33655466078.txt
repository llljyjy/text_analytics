I absolutely love this night cream. I’ve only been using it for two weeks and I already can tell a difference. When I wake up in the morning my skin is so soft, smooth and not puffy. I normally have puffy eye bags and this cream has been a total lifesaver! The smell is also subtle unlike other night creams I’ve tried that they smell way too strong when I’m trying to relax and go to sleep. I would definitely recommend you give it a try. Although it’s a little expensive I plan to keep this in my bedtime routine. I absolutely love it!
