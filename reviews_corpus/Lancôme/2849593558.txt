Great first impression I really liked the packaging and the three serum in one until you pump it aspect. Applied it in the morning and at night and skin felt so hydrated after using for two weeks. I do feel like I notice a subtle difference in my skinâ€™s appearance. I tend to try products that contain hyaluronic acid, but pleasantly surprised with this product that uses 4 ingredients in one. I would definitely recommend purchasing this product! Hydrated skin
