I tried so many sunscreens, skinceuticals, Colorescience, goop, DRMTLGY , and on and on! This is by far my favorite. After my skincare routine I apply this and then do my eyes while it absorbs. I do use Lancôme primer after this even though it says primer land moisturizer, I use it for the 50 sunscreen . I love how it doesn’t change the look of my foundation and blush like the others I tried. I’ll use the others out by the pool and working in my garden so as not to waste them, but this is my go to when I want my foundation and blush to look like it’s supposed to. nan
