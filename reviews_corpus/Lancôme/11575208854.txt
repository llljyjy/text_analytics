After using this product for over two weeks I found that I really love the consistency of it but hate the amount of fragrance. The fragrance is very perfumey which I found to be irritating. It was irritating to the skin but it did give me a migraine. I would recommend this product to someone who doesnâ€™t mind fragrance especially a perfume scent. Too Much Fragrance
