I received this from BzzAgent for my honest review. I absolutely loved this Lancôme Advanced Gènique Repairing Night Cream. I used it every night for 3 weeks. There is no scent to it and it absorbs quickly leaving no greasy residue. A “dot covers a lot” so the 1.7oz will last awhile. I noticed a significant increase in my skin’s moisture almost immediately. Around week 3 the fine lines started decreasing slightly. I have no doubt they will continue to subside. I love waking up each morning with a youthful glow I had in my early 20’s. I live in a desert region so this cream will be perfect year round. The price point is average with other competing brands. I’d definitely recommend this repair cream to family and friends. A must have for 40+ dry, aging skin
