This is a very nice moisturizer that made my skin soft without heaviness.  That was a pleasant surprise, given how thick it is. My skin did not feel greasy or tacky at all, and did appear to be more supple after two weeks of use.  An added bonus was how it made my night time routine feel so luxurious, thanks to the opulent packaging and lovely smell and color of the cream. Rich moisturization without heavy greasiness
