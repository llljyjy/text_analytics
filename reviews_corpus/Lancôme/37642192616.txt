I really enjoyed using this cream as a part of my nightly skincare routine. When I woke up in the morning, my skin felt very moisturized and smooth. It is a pretty thick cream and feels amazing while it is being applied. Over the course of two weeks, I noticed that my skin was much less dry than usual and had a slight glow. The only thing I didnâ€™t like was the strong perfume/floral smell it has. After applying it, the smell stays for about 15-20 minutes. After that, it was great! nan
