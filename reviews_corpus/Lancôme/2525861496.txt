This is a nice product! I am a huge fan of hyaluronic acid and niacinamide! I use them both regularly in my skin care regime. The fact that this has both as well a ferulic acid in it too sounds like a skincare concoction from heaven. Each ingredient is in a separate compartments. When you pump out the product they combine. I noticed an overall difference in texture and pores. So it definitely works. However, a fragrance or something in Lancôme skincare always irritates my sensitive skin. Every Lancôme skincare product that I have tried has irritated my skin.L. Maybe keep that in mind if you try this. But overall, I recommend this product! Nice product!
