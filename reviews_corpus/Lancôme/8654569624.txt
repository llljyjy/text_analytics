This is an incentivized post. I received the Lancôme Rènergie H.C.F. Triple Serum complimentary from Lancôme and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. My experience and thoughts: I have been using this serum once in the morning and once at night, as the directions advise, for three weeks (8/17 - 9/6) Each time I apply it, I use one full pump, rub gently to mix, and then I apply to my face. Once applied, I spray my face with the Grace and Stella Spray all Day Hydrating Rose Water Spray to help give the hyaluronic acid some moisture to absorb into my skin. The directions say to use two full pumps, but I found that to be wasteful and too much product for my face and neck. It also made it difficult for my makeup. One pump doesn’t disturb my foundation, whereas the two pumps made my foundation slide around. Overall, my skin looks wonderful. Its so smooth, and I really like the results I am seeing on my forehead. I have been dealing with a deepening 1 in between my eyebrows, but this has improved it so much! I plan to continue using and repurchasing this serum. It’s completely worth the price tag! New Staple
