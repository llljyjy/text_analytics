I’ve been using this product for almost a month now. There are benefits and drawbacks to it for my skin. Proactive:I really do feel like it makes my skin look younger. It reminisces fine lines and seeming reduces the look of aging spots. It’s extremely moisturizing too. Cons: It’s perfumes make my skin breakout and not the usual bump or two but my skin has never been so blemished filled in my life. I am taken aback with all the red spot and blemishes it caused but my skin is very sensitive to perfumes. One other drawback is tho it is very moisturizing it made my skin feel very oily for the first few weeks. I’m 39 and certainly have aging skin but I think maybe this product is veered more toward people that have extremely aging skin. Not those who only having slightly aging skin. And maybe to those who are in the sun a lot. I will say the packing is awesome and the way the three different creams/serums are separated and come out of the bottle is very appealing and pleasant. I’m a sucker for good packaging and this item is high up there for packaging. Because I am so sensitive to fragrant face creams I wouldn’t purchase this however if you are not sensitive to perfumes and don’t think you’ll break out it’s a good choice and will help you look and feel younger Moisturizing but blemish inducing
