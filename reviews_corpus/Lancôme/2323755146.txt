Lancome Absolute Revitalizing Eye Cream is one product I love!! I’ve noticed the signs of aging around my eyes and felt helpless. I’ve been using this product every day twice a day. I’ve seen real results after such a short time. My crows feet appeared less apparent. The formula is thick but not overpowering. I love the beautiful packaging too! I’ve been a fan of Lancome for years and I would definitely recommend this line!! Lancome has done it again
