I have to admit I was surprised by this night cream. It makes my skin smoother, the tone is better, and the wrinkles less defined. I didn’t expect any miracles so maybe that helps. I like that it is without any perfumes that are going to irritate my skin. I even used it in the daytime. Working nights my sleep schedule is all over. Lol. A little pricey but it’s worth definitely it! Botox in a bottle
