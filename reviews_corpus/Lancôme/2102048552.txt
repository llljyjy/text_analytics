This serum is great for gently bringing some life back into your dull skin. It isnâ€™t a miracle worker by any means, but it does apply nicely, smell light, and help my dehydrated skin appear more youthful. It does not irritate my skin or cause any breakouts or sensitivities, and helps provide the extra hydration I need during the dry, colder winter months. nan
