I have been using Lancôme Renergie HCF Triple Serum for over three weeks.  I got this serum to see if it would improve some age/sun spots. I’ve noticed some fading but I’d have to use it longer to see real results. The serum has a good consistency and its not greasy at all. Absorbs pretty quickly so I can easily apply makeup right after. I haven’t had any breakouts with the product either.  I will continue to use this to see how much better my skin gets. nan
