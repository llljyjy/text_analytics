This serum did not work well for me. I used one pump twice a day for almost 2 weeks. The fragrance is strong and off putting and lingers when placed on your face. My sensitive skin seemed to be more reactive after using this serum so had to stop halfway thru the second week of application. The wrinkles on my forehead seemed more pronounced but I think it’s because my face is drier than it usually is. It has been a month and my still hasn’t returned back to it’s normal state and seems more parched than usual. Would not purchase. nan
