So far I have been enjoying using this serum. The fragrance is strong but makes the product feel high end and luxurious. It reminds me of roses and maybe a little bit of sandalwood. The serum reminds me of a mineral sunscreen of sorts, has a white cast that dissipates after a minute or so. It also has a light sunscreen feeling when applying. Not off putting just something I noticed. My skin does look healthier and a little glowy after 2 weeks of use both day and night. I would repurchase this again if it wasn’t so expensive. At the end of the day I don’t think the price justify the results. Luxurious but too pricy
