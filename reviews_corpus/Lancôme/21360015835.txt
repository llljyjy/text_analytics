After using this for just a week I could see a noticeable difference in my pesky 11’s between the eyebrows.  I massage it in a little extra between my brows. My skin absorbs it well and moisturizer lays well on top. Getting freshly mixed product with every pump is great. The best part is how well it works. I have a new favorite yet again from Lancôme. It works!
