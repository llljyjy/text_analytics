I have been using this triple serum for 2 weeks and these are my thoughts .Pros:1. Cuts down skincare routine by combining 3 serums to target wrinkles, volume loss and dark spots in one go. 2. Cute and unique packaging.3. After two weeks, my frown lines have softened and skin looks plump . 4. Leaves a beautiful glow on skin, and looks good under makeup too. Cons: 1. No matter how much I shake the product, it dispenses only 2 serums. Faulty packaging!2. I canâ€™t stand the perfume scent. I prefer unscented products. 3. For such a high price point , scent and faulty packaging are major flaws in my book . Works, but could be better
