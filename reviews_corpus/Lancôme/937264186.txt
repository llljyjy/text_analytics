I will say I did not have high hopes for this product. I have not had great results with Lancôme skincare in the past…. But I will say this product quickly changed my mind. It’s a triple texture serum that really absorbs into the skin. It goes on smooth and has made improvements in my concern areas. It has softened a dark spot I have on my cheek, and smoothed out texture around my eyes. I will be honest as I have oily/combination skin and did experience more oil through out the day as it concerns my makeup. I would do a touch up mid day and be fine. I deducted one star for this issue. But all in all this is a powerful  product that I will continue to purchase! Results!
