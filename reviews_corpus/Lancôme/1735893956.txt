This is really a great product with results that you can see quickly & get better each day. The product is unique in that one pump dispenses out 3 different serums at the same time. The first time I used I noticed my skin looked brighter & healthier. It was moisturized but not in a greasy or heavy way, but in a satin, silky way. I noticed my fine lines appeared less noticeable & my skin had a much smoother & even texture. I would say the biggest benefit I have gotten out of this serum so far is my skin is soooo much smoother which I feel makes it look younger. I also think my makeup just looks better going on with smoother, hydrated, silky skin. What I have not seen a noticeable difference in is on a few dark spots I have. I understand this may take more time or maybe this product is just not going to do much in that area. I am sensitive to adult acne with many skin care product & this has not made me breakout at all which is always a HUGE factor with me sticking with a product or not. Also, I just love the fragrance of this serum. It is so subtle & light but just reminds me of a clean fresh scent. Now the biggest Con I would say is the price. This stuff is not cheap. I can tell you that you only use a tiny bit & a little goes a long way. I really targeted my problem areas vs. lathering it all over myself to try & be somewhat frugal with it, but that is just me. All in all I really like product & am so glad I got the chance to try it out. My skin is smooth & younger looking!
