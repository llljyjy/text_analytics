This scent is so luxurious....for me.  Not everyone likes a rosy citrus scent.  Even the coordinating product, Hydra Zen Moisturizer, has this beautiful scent.  If you don’t like rose scents, then walk on by.  For me, I literally inhale the product.  Find it so relaxing.  Keep an old jar of the Hydra Zen by my desk and open just to sniff.  Using both products leaves my 70+ skin very moist.  Although it’s a bit pricey for a retired person, am an old girly girl and will purchase forever.  Very femme. Heavenly Citrus Rose Scent
