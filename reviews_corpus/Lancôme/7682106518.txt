I did like this serum though I do not know if I would pay this much for it, its not much different than other serums. I do love how thereâ€™s 3 in one and it does not leave my skin feeling oily which is one thing I struggle with when using products like this. It also has a plesent yet subtle fragrance. I love the packaging! Great branding! Great serum a little pricey
