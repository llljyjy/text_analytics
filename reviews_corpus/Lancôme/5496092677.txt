So I have really dry and sensitive skin that can be super finicky especially when the weather starts to change. This could not come at a better time. I use this every morning and every evening religiously and I find that I’m not experiencing any dry patches like I normally do around this time of year. It has a super subtle almost floral scent that is not overpowering or chemically. His three different serums that mix into one when you pump it out. They are slightly on the runnier aside and not silicone. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and didn’t interact negatively in any way with my regular skin care. Total win in an absolute must for winter skin. Winter skin be gone
