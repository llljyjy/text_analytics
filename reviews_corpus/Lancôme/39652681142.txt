After extending time between Botox appointments, I asked my brutally honest 15-year-old if she could tell the difference. Her answer? “Nah. You look the same. The only difference is that your face moves now.” Actually, the difference was Génifique Night Cream with Triple Ceramide Complex. The night cream smooths on nicely while smoothing out my fine lines. I often get greasy from night creams, but not with this one! I wake up with smooth, glowing, and fine line-free skin! A game changer! Bye-Bye, Botox!
