I’ve been a fan of Lancome skincare for many decades and this cream was no exception. The cream felt thick and heavy, like it’s sitting on my skin.  So I chose to use it before sleeping. A little goes a long way. As it spreads on your skin it feels lighter and then hydrating yours skin. It leaves my skiin soft and supple. I knew right away I was going to love it.  The scent of the cream is a light and pleasant. It did not disappoint, my skin felt great in the morning and it still felt adequately hydrated.  I don’t usually spend a lot of time looking at my wrinkles in the mirror and I still didn’t bother. I could feel the obvious difference from my usual night cream. Another superb skin care product from Lancome! Huge fan of Lancome... Still.
