My skin is sensitive, dehydrated, acne prone. I am very picky and choosy when it comes to trying on new skin care because my skin reacts so quickly. When I receive this product, I knew this would be something worth trying on because in the past, when I have tried Lancome’s genefique line of products, they’ve always suited and worked really well for my skin. At night I like to slather my skin with some kind of rich moisturizer or an oil type product to really lock in and seal the moisture since my skin tends to be very dehydrated, especially in the colder months. After giving this product a try for I would say about two weeks. I have noticed my skin really feel supple and soft in the morning. When I wake up, there’s no redness, no reactivity either. I love how this moisturizer absorbs into my skin at night and doesn’t sit on top of it and doesn’t transfer onto my pillowcase or my bedsheets. With all that being said, the ingredients are very nice, and I trust Lancome to deliver exceptionally well made product I do have ever worn that this product is extremely expensive so if it doesn’t fit your budget, make sure you think about what you’re buying and do your ingredient checklist before you purchase. However, I do recommend this for anybody and everybody because of my skin could handle this I’m sure most skins would love this. Expensive, but, worth the price
