Just because something is offered by a major brand at a higher price point does not mean it is a good product. This product is worth the hype. I used it consistently for three weeks and I saw an improvement in my skin’s texture and suppleness… so much so that I makeup free many of those days because I felt THAT confident on how my skin looked. Another thing I would like to note is the packaging is sleek and beautiful but not anxiety-inducing fragile. My recommendation is that you follow the directions on how to disperse the formula, and with that, you are golden. Enjoy! Worth the hype!
