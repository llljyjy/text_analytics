I used this serum twice daily with a moisturizer for three weeks. I love that it’s three products in one, and I appreciate that this has both niacinamide and vitamin C, as I know in some formulations they can conflict with each other. The packaging is alright—so much plastic—but I didn’t have the issues I’ve read others did with getting the product to dispense. (I stored it in a drawer upside down and held it horizontally when dispensing.) I like that getting it out doesn’t mean exposing the product to air, like with a dropper.This didn’t really help with hormonal breakouts, but I did notice an overall brightening effect, improved hydration, and smoothing of my skin texture, which was great and happened pretty quickly. I have some dark spots under my eye that seemed to lighten a bit as well. It does have a generic “makeup” fragrance, but didn’t irritate my sometimes-reactive skin. All in all, good stuff, and though pricey, a good value considering all the actives this has. nan
