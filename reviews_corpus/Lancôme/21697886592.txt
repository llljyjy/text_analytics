This face serum is a staple for me! I have gone through 7 bottles already and will need to restock again. It’s definitely worth the price!! This product makes my skin so soft and hydrated. It doesn’t break me out so this girl who struggles with hormonal acne is happy! If you haven't tried, you should!
