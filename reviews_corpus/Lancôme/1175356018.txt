I really like the consistency of this serum. It’s a little thicker than the serum I usually use but I’m not mad at it. It spreads nicely over the skin. Not too sticky. Has a nice scent as well. My skin is more moisturized, smoother and brighter since I’ve started using it! I will continue to using to really see the long term benefits. I like it!
