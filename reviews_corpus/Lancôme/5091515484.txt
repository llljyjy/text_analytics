This Lancome moisturizer is going to be a new addition to my skincare routine. I’m usually a user of Estée Lauder products, but this Absolue Rich Cream Moisturizer gives me the moisture I need in my combination skin while not being too oily. My skin is now softer and smoother after using for several weeks. The fragrance is a bit strong on the floral/rose side, but that is probably the only con. Otherwise, I love how it makes my skin feel and I am okay putting makeup on top of it. I love it! I love it!
