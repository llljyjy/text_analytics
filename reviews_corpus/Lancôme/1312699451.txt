This is a nice product, but was overall not a good fit for my sensitive, combination skin. I found the rose scent pretty, but not for a face product as it feels like wearing perfume on my nose. It is a unique texture which I liked for my winter dry patches, but would only use in the winter because t-zone gets too oily in the summer. I would like it more as a gel vs a crème.
