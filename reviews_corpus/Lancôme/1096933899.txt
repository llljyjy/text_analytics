At first glance, I thought this cream moisturizer would be too heavy in my skin. Following the instructions step by step, I didn’t need to use that much and once warmed up, it was an great consistency for application. This moisturizer is definitely luxurious and on par with others using like ingredients. It was a smooth application and left my face plump and firm without excess oil. In the morning, my skin was smooth and hydrated. My skin definitely drank it up. I’m giving a 4.5 stars with the only deduction for the price point. It is not an entry level product and is definitely for the advanced skincare maven. Advanced skincare with luxurious experience
