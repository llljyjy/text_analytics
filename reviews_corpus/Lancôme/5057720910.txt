Lovely serum all around. Truly helped my skin feel smoother and better overall. I have a nice glow and feel confident without foundation as it has helped with my pores as well. Initially there is a bit of sting when I apply but it subsides fairly quickly. I was using Clarins double serum, but this has become my new favorite. Well worth every penny. Smoother, healthier looking skin that glows!
