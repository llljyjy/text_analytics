Lancome Absolue Soft Cream Revitalizing & Brightening Moisturizer is super light but creamy and it hydrates my skin without feeling greasy. I wasnâ€™t sure that I would like the smell so I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it. I look forward to moisturizing my face every day. I recommend this face cream I you can afford it. nan
