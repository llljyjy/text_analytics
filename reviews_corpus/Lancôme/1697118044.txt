This product doesnâ€™t do much.  I regret the purchase (and now I have two of them).  I have dry-ish skin and wanted an effective toner, but this does nothing.  Instead, I bought the Clarins Hydrating Toning Lotion and I LOVE it.  It does have a scent to it, but I like it - others may not. Doesn't Do Much
