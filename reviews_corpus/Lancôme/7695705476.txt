The bottle for the Lanc√¥me Renergie H.C.F. Triple Serum is beautiful and smells great. The product is, sticky. I have used multiple Serums and so far have only found one that I truly liked and had positive results. I have not noticed a difference other than an increase is breakouts and larger pours. I do not have sensitive skin so can only say, this product is not for me. Indifferent
