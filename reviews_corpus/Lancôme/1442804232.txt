I’ve been using this serum for about a month now and let me just tell you how much I’m love this. I have acne prone skin, I have very sensitive skin, and turn red easily. Initial I was very scared to put it on my face because I was scared it would irritate me and I will flare up however the exact opposite happened. My skin became smooth, flawless and clear. The formula is very lightweight and non-sticky. It glides into my skin very smoothly and does not leave a weird residue or little cream bumps like some other creams. I’ve definitely noticed a huge difference it my skins appearance and lines on my face even in my early 30s. I will definitely be purchasing this over and over again. P.S: I’ve used this morning and night for a month and I still have a lot more. All you need is one pump. My skin loves this stuff
