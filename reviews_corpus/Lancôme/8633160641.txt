I gifted this to my mom as she loves this brand. She said it was great for nighttime use and keeping her skin moisturized through the night. She tried using it as a daytime moisturizer and said it was a little too heavy, I explained to her itâ€™s really only meant for nighttime use. But I think this product will be great for getting her into more skincare My mom loves it
