This moisturizer is amazing! Itâ€™s the perfect consistency for my combination skin and absorbs better than most high end moisturizers leaving you hydrated, plump and with a perfect glow! The only drawback is the heavy scent which may not work for everyone. The hydration lasts all day. I would definitely purchase and recommend to family and friends. nan
