I have been using the Lancome Absolue Revitalizing Eye Cream for about two weeks and have been pleasantly surprised. The biggest difference I noticed was the appearance directly underneath my eyes. The darkness and redness was reduced dramatically. I also noticed that my crows feet were less visible. I have sensitive eyes and this eye cream did not bother them. The consistency of the cream was just right, neither too thick nor too runny. While the price tank is high, you do not need to use much of the product at a time to get results. The Absolue Revitalizing Eye Cream is probably in the top three of the eye creams Iâ€™ve tried. Very good, but pricey
