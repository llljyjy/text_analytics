I’ve tried several of the luxury creams from Estee Lauder, Chanel, and La Mer.  I can honestly say this one has been my favorite.  Even before you dip into the product, you get the luxury experience from just handling this fancy jar.  The product itself is amazing. It’s definitely rich, but does not feel greasy like some of the others I used. The texture is very buttery and silky.  It glides on the skin so easily and you barely need any, which is a top benefit for this product.  It also absorbs into the skin well and does not sit on the surface.  You can pretty much go straight to makeup! Skin looks hydrated and soft, with a hint of a glowAnother benefit is wearing it overnight. I wake up in the morning and look refreshed and hydrated, instead of crepey and dried out. Skin still maintains the glow and lines appear softened and supple.This is a bit out of my budget, but I think this is something I could definitely treat myself to. I deserve it. I actually recommended to a few friends and family after my first use because it felt so nice. I let them try it and they loved the texture and hydration it offered. A Luxury Delight!
