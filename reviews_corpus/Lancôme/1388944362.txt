I received Lancome’s Renergie H.C.F Triple Serum: For Plumping & Anti-Aging as a promotional sample. I have combination skin that is moving towards being dry. I am starting to see fine lines and more imperfections so I was excited to try this product.This product comes out of the pump as three separate components- probably for stability and potency. I used this product for approximately one month. My skincare regimen is very important to me. I find my skincare routine to be very relaxing and rewarding. I started my skincare routine with indie lee’s brightening cleanser and toner. I let the toner absorb for approximately two minutes (while I brushed my teeth. I then mixed and applied Lancome’s Renergie H.C.F triple serum. I gently patted the serum on my face and neck. I then went about preparing for the day and applied 3Lab’s Perfect Cream to my face and neck.(the Lancome product was used in place of Sunday Riley’s Good Genes in the morning and Luna at night).Here’s the difference I noted:I could definitely tell the niacinamide was in the product; when I applied the serum there was a gentle warming. My skin felt more moisturized than usual after application (I forgot the moisturizer afterwards a few times) so I am pretty sure the hyaluronic acid was hard at work.I am new to ferulic acid- it seems like it is more of a preventative for sun and environmental pollution based skin damage.Overall I am very impressed by this product. My skin feels moisturized and firm. If I added this product to my skincare regimen I would likely purchase the moisturizer of the same brand. Based on the ingredients it looks like they would compliment each other well. nice combination
