To start, this product comes in such a unique bottle. I like that each of the 3 components, are in their own chamber and then when you push the button, they come together. It blends easy so that it goes on really smooth. I really like the way the Lancome, Rénergie H.C.F. Anti-Aging Triple Serum makes my skin feel. It doesn’t feel heavy or slimy on the skin which I am happy about. It also leaves my skin glowing and appears better than ever. I don’t know if it is helping with the skin discoloration but I personally feel that my dark spots are slightly less noticeable when I use this product. Overall, I am really happy with the Lancome Serum and plan to continue to keep in my skin care routine. Skin feels lovely
