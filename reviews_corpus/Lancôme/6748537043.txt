I received this serum complimentary from Bzzagent and Lancome in exchange for an honest review after 2 weeks of consistent use.I don’t believe in commercial skincare. It’s overpriced and full of fillers and additives. But I’m also not opposed to being proven wrong. So I used this morning and night, 2 pumps each as instructed. I did continue to use my DIY oils which I have used for years, as well as moisturizer and eye creams, which is normal for me (I’m using commercial products now because I’ve gotten them in subscription boxes and such and want to use them up, but normally I DIY those too).Pictured is what my skin looked like after 2 weeks of consistent use. I am 46 years old. I do have fairly regular posts on my IG (40rtyPluss) showing my bare skin, and you can see that there’s not that much difference. But this does nicely plump and brighten the skin. I’m rating it based on how those who like and use commercial skincare would evaluate it. The scent is fairly light and not unpleasant. The texture is light and comfortable. The packaging is excessively large for the fluid product weight.The price is absolutely excessive, but you’re paying for the placebo effect and experience and dream, so if that’s worth it to you, you might like this. A nice enough serum
