This serum is amazing! It is basically 3 products in one. It’s very hydrating and made my skin feel smooth and look “glowy“. I don’t normally purchase Lancôme skincare products but I will definitely be purchasing this one again. I used it with my Beautycounter regimen and the only thing I noticed off the bat was it made my skin a little warm and tingly but went away after a couple of minutes. I will say I DO have very sensitive skin and the tingling and warming sensation would not turn me away from buying and restocking this product in my bathroom. Overall, I would purchase again and I do like it! I like it
