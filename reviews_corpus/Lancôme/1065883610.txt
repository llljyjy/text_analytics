Unfortunately I couldn’t use this serum.. it had a thin consistency with a pleasant scent and felt nice on the skin.. Within a few days, broke me out pretty badly so I had to stop using it...it has butylene glycol high on the ingredient list which is an acne causing agent and it didn’t agree with my skin. Wouldn’t recommend for acne prone types. Not for acne prone skin
