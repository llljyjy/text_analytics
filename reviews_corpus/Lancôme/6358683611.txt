This cream is simply the best - from the luxurious packaging, through the buttery and super hydrating formula, to the results I see every morning! It glides on skin so easily, even when combined with different serums. Normally my skin needs a lot of hydration at night and I always find it on the dry side in the morning. This one is on another level!! My skin has never felt softer when I wake up!! I don’t use any other night cream anymore! I also noticed the fine lines on my forehead slowly started to fade away after 2 weeks of using it every night! Just get it!! It’s amazing The only night cream I use every night!!
