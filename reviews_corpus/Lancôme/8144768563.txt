I wasn’t terribly impressed with this night cream. It’s nice and hydrating and I woke up with soft skin, but after repeat use I never saw any drastic change in the appearance of my skin. The scent of this cream is absolutely atrocious. I hate having to put this on because the fragrance is just so overpowering. It’s also the epitome of “old lady” fragrance. I don’t usually have an aversion to scents in skincare, so this cream was particularly offensive. This night cream is just okay
