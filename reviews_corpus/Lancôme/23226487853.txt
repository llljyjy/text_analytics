I’ve been using this product for 3 weeks and it is amazing. I have some fine lines starting around my eyes but I noticed just after a couple of weeks they had basically disappeared. My face looks younger and firmer, and I haven’t had any problems with breakouts.I did find that this product is better stored upside down to keep it suspended. Also I love that the dispenser gives me the perfect amount every time. I will definitely be purchasing this serum when I run out. It has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine!I received this product complementary from Lancôme and  Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Seriously love this serum!
