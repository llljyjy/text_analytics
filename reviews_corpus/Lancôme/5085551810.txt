As a freelance makeup artist for over 10 years and a person who has been obsessing about skincare and makeup, I only use high quality with nutritious ingredients skincare products. I highly recommend Lancome Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream. As I have dry skin especially in winter, my skin is dry and tough. I have to put on very thick moisturiser but it’s very sticky and uncomfortable. But this face cream can do the job without heaviness or stickiness. First of all, the texture of this cream is silky and lightweight. A little goes a long way. This night cream helps fight the appearance of lines and wrinkles. And repair your skin at night while you are sleeping. It’s good for even sensitive skin as it doesn’t contain any harmful ingredients. It’s fast absorbing and won’t clog the pores. It keeps my skin hydrated for the whole night. I can feel my face so smooth after applying the cream. My skin is well hydrated and supple. A great night cream
