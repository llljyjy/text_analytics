It’s just ok.   Received for free from influenster in exchange for my honest review.    I like that there’s the 3 chambers it’s perfect for travel. Instead of taking 2-3 different serums it’s all in one. While I like the concept of the packaging as well as the 3 chambers are a different color so you know that they each pumped out. The look of the packaging is really pretty, it’s super lightweight.   My skin did not like using it everyday. I experienced a few breakouts with daily use. Although I did find 2-3x a week worked for me and saw benefits. For the price I just thought it was ok. I hate the scent. It’s just ok
