I have started using this product every day before bed. I love the rich texture - it helps me keep my face hydrated and it slowly covers my wrinkles. After 5 evenings of daily usage, I see a clear reduction in my fine lines. Also, the smell is pretty good, subtle, and clean, very similar to their eye cream (if you’ve tried it you know). At the moment is the only cream with the cleanest most possible ingredients I have found so far in the market. It’s my new favourite item!! A must-have in my night routine
