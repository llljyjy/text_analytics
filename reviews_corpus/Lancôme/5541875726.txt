I am in love with this cream. It has a light subtle scent that is very pleasant but dissipates quickly. The cream itself is medium weight - it’s more than a gel cream but not as thick as other “rich” creams. I think it lives up to the silky description.  It easily spreads on and absorbs quickly. The hydration  level is really nice. My skin felt well hydrated but not greasy or overwhelmed after. It plays well with other products - no pilling nan
