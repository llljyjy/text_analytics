So this is my first time using a night cream and I absolutely love it! My skin feels so smooth and soft in the morning, The product gives me no irritation and doesnâ€™t make me too oily. For comparison, I have combination skins so often time skin care products make me too dry or too oily. I use this product before I go to bed and after my normal skin care routine (Hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, moisturizer) I would definitely buy this product when I am finished. I received this product in return for my complete and honest review. nan
