I really like that this is an anti-aging super trio of ingredients. This product hydrates, helps with dark spots and skin texture. If you think about how much you’d spend on a serum with each ingredient, this is a good deal. It takes a few pumps to get all 3 ingredients to flow together. 1-2 pumps is all you need because a little goes a long way. I’m 56 and feel like it left my skin looking very healthy. 3 in 1 super hero product
