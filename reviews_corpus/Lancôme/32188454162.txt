At first I wasnâ€™t too sure about this because of the price, but after reading the reviews I broke down and bought some. Now I am a repeat buyer and this is one of my favorite serums. It makes my skin feel super soft and hydrated, and does not feel sticky like some serums. I use it every morning and night and it works really well under my makeup. nan
