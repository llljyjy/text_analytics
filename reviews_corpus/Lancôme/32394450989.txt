This Estee Lauder Absolue Rich Cream Moisturizer worked amazing on my skin!! I’m 40 and starting to lose firmness around the mouth area and noticing fine lines. I tried the product for 2weeks and my skin is so soft, moisturized and noticing more firmness around my mouth around the 2week mark but Inoticed the difference in my fine lines and dry skin almost the next day. It absorbs fast with no tacky feeling once it’s dry and also has a lovely light scent. I will definitely continue to purchase Lancome and all of their amazing products. I’m never disappointed. Worked amazing on my skin
