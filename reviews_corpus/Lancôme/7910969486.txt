After using this product for a few weeks I loved the results ! I noticed that my skin was more hydrated and my fine lines have visibly reduced. also it made my foundation makeup application smoother. keeps my face super moisturized throughout the day even after washing product off my face in which Iâ€™m not sure its what you are supposed to do. I do it because I like to start with a fresh face and even after my face was still hydrated. Must have night cream routine !
