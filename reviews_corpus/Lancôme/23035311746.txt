I have been using this cream for nearly few weeks and I love it, I have been getting a lot of compliments on my skins appearance and it’s all down to this night cream. I first found out about it by applying for a sample and I’m glad I did as its great. Easy and quick to apply, soaks in well and has a really nice feeling texture, It’s not overpowering with fragrance but it’s not chemical smelling either, it just smells fresh and clean. I urge everyone to try it for a few days and see and feel the difference yourself. Absolutely LOVE
