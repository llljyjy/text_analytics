I recently went to a tropical location for a vacation and my skin got really sunburnt, dry and flaky. I needed something to quickly heal and repair my skin and keep it moisturized and supple especially as the colder dry months are approaching. This is the MOST LUXXE night cream I’ve ever used. It’s so smooth and rich and really does wonders for my skin. I am adding this to my holy grail skin care. I’ve never experienced hydration and moisture like this before Does wonders for my skin
