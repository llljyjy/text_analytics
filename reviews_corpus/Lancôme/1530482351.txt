I absolutely love this serum! I have a combination skin and due to harsh summer this year my skin was feeling a bit dry and patchy. This is a savior! I use hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, or niacinamide, and freulic acid through 3 different products the fact that this product simplified my nightly long routine of schlepping different products is a game changer. The packing is luxurious and when you press down the pump and see 3 different serums coming out.. in my opinion thatâ€™s genius. My skin looks radiant and plump.. each day and night I look forward to putting this serum on my face as part of my skin care. Radiance in a bottle
