I received this product complementary from @Bzzagent and @Lancome in exchange for my honest review.  Lancome has knocked it out of the park with Absolue revitalizing brightening soft cream!  The packaging is exquisite and beautiful it instantly gives you a sense of luxury.  I’m so excited I was given the opportunity to try this product.  The cream is a light pink color that has an amazing scent, it’s a light rose fragrance that is absolutely perfect.  The cream is a thick rich consistency that is perfect for dry skin, it makes a lovely night cream.  Lancome’s Absolue is perfect for anytime use, it brightens and revitalizes your skin leaving you with a glowing youthful complexion.  I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin, my skin is more illuminating and brighter the texture of my skin has transformed into smooth soft and supple feel and appearance.  While this might be a bit pricey it’s definitely worth the price especially for dry, mature or damaged skin.  Lancome’s Absolue is also a wonderful option to use as it works amazing as a base for appling makeup.  I highly recommend this product! Lancome absolue revitalizing brightening cream
