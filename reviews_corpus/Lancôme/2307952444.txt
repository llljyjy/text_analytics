First, I love the packaging. It feels and looks luxurious. The cream itself goes on like butter but itâ€™s still a little thick. I did see some improvements with my skin after a week and a half of use. I stopped using all of the products I was using before and just used this and am still using it because it worked for me! Staying young!
