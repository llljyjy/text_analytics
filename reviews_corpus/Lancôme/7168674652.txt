Unfortunately this caused me to break out immediately. Used it for a month but within the first week from using it my skin had cystic acne from spots that I had been trying to heal. Took me a while to realize it was the sunscreen, I stopped using it and acne cleared up slowly. Not for me. 3 stars because the finish is nice not dewy or greasy for a sunscreen feels light weight. Price is okay too. Wish it would of worked for me not for me
