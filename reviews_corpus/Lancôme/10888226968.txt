This is a beautiful product. The packaging feels heavy and luxurious. I love that the product does not mix until youâ€™re ready to use it. It does have a decently heavy scent which I absolutely loved but it might be a turn off to some people. After a few weeks of using it I had quite a few dry spots around my chin area which was a bummer because I loved how the product wore under make up and any of my face creams. I would still recommend this product because I think it would be wonderful things for some people but maybe not for sensitive skin. beautiful package
