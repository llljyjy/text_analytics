Glue. That’s the best word to describe this stuff. I got the 7 days worth of sample packets to try. I tried the first sample, and when I mixed it in my palm the mixture got very warm in my hand which was a little weird but I went with it. Almost immediately after putting it on my face I couldn’t wait to take it off. It felt like thick sticky glue, it never sunk into my skin whatsoever. I can’t imagine how you could possibly wear makeup over this stuff. I stuck it out for a few hours but had to wash it off, only to find out it has left this weird film all over my face no matter how many time I wash it. I’ve used makeup remover balm, several different cleansers and my skin feels so weird now. The rest of the samples are going in the trash because despite the other great reviews I did not have a good experience with this product whatsoever. Glue.
