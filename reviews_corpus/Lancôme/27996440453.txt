So it’s always a gamble when trying new facial skin care products to my routine but Lancome never fails to amaze me. Used this for over 3 weeks in the morning and at night and not one blemish or breakout... Not even when my time of the month came... Which never happens... I never get lucky enough to have no skin purges so this stuff is great! No smell... No tacky feeling once it’s dried... I use two pumps and it covered my face and neck. My skin feels great. Definitely recommend it. Love it!
