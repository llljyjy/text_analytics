1) First impression - Packaging is typical of what you’d expect from a Lancôme product. The gold container looks a bit cheap, but the product itself reflects the pricing better.2) Pros -• VERY moisturizing• Mild, pleasant scent• Doesn’t irritate my extremely dry, sensitive skin3) Cons - • Takes a bit to apply and absorb• Not a formula where you can apply and go — I always have to wash my hands afterward• Not a fan of the open container design since I’m a huge germaphobe — would prefer a “single-serving“ pump design• Incredibly high-priced... Not something I’d be purchasing regularly4) Overall - This is for sure a “luxury“ product. With a couple of small tweaks, I would be more inclined to add this to my daily routine permanently. Very rich and moisturizing
