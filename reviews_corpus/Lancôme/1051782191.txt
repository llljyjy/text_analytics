I am absolutely elated to have tried this product! I have VERY sensitive skin and had made a skincare regimen out of about 7 things that do not irritate my skin. That is just it, they do not irritate my skin but they also did not seem to enhance/repair it. I gave my skin a break from the routine to try this and see what effects  Lanc√¥me Absolue Rich Cream Moisturizer would have in isolation. The results were unbelievable. I am dismayed to have learned that all I might have needed was  Lancome Absolue Rich Cream Moisturizer. My skin is GLOWING, taught and pore less. I will spend the same amount of money without having to expose my skin to several different products!!! I no longer have , dry or irritated patches. My skin looks like I put on makeup, it practically sparkles and there is not a pore ..or an open pore to be detected. The smallest amount COMPLETELY hydrates my face and neck for the ENTIRE day. I am using MUCH less makeup and need none of the other moisturizing products I have built a skincare routine around. My skin at all times while using this product looks like i have concealer foundationand highlighter on. This Absolue Rich Cream Moisturizer, willsave me so much money on products and treatments AND ABOVE ALL makes my skin look and feel IDEAL. I feel BEAUTIFUL!!! All in One
