Since my mid 20s, I’ve had a established skincare routine. Lancôme’s Renergie HCF Triple Serum allowed me to go from using multiple serum bottles for HA, vitamin c, + niacinamide to using just one bottle. I tested this lightweight serum for two weeks twice a day (day + night), and my skin was on its way to become jello skin - bouncy, smooth, glowy, + hydrated. I have oily skin with no acne or hyperpigmentation, a bit of texture + large pores on my cheeks, and this serum definitely helped with my texture on my forehead. I would recommend this product if you’re looking to reduce steps of your skincare serum routine + bottles. This is at a pretty expensive price point for serum, but a little goes a long way.I received this serum via Influenster + Lancôme in exchange for my honest review. nan
