Lancôme has always proven to be the best. The formula of this cream is suitable for all skin type. I use it every night. It has a creamy, silky and smooth consistency. It’s smell is calming and soothing not so strong. Every morning I wake up with soft and smooth face. It is great also on wintertimes when u need more hydration and something extra to overcome the dryness. It’s not sticky and heavy. I have seen a huge difference after it’s use and would strongly recommend for younger looking skin. LOVED IT
