I have had the pleasure of using this product for a few weeks now. Let me tell you, OH MY GOODNESS!  I am loving the way my skin looks and feels. I wake up with my skin so soft feeling, all through out the day. I have even noticed that my face looks brighter. I catch myself looking at myself a lot more. I think its a wonderful product, the price point is a little steep when looking at the whole. But, you only need a small amount. There is a slight scent to it, reminds me of baby lotion. I do recommend this night cream and will be adding this to my skin care routine. OH my, my look at my face!
