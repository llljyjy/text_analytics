I received LANCÔME Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum for free for my honest review. This serum is amazing! I was able to test it for over two weeks, which is definitely a plus so I can give honest feedback. There are three serum‘s that come together when you pump the bottle. The smell as I applied it was amazing. It was creamy, yet thin, and the application was so easy. The serum easily absorbed into my skin. It gave my skin a glow that, when make up free, left me with a dewy complexion. I give this product five stars and I suggest everyone to try it. Even though it is on the pricey side, a little bit goes a long way and this bottle will last a long time. The key to using this is to store it upside down so the serums stay together every time you pump them. 5 Stars All Around!
