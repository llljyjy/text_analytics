I was part of a focus group for this product (not through Sephora) and received the product for free in advance of that focus group. It’s an okay moisturizer, but I have very dry skin and this did not cut it for me. The fragrance was also problematic for me, as I’m very sensitive to fragrances. I used it for two weeks consistently, and I ended up giving it to my mom, and she hasn’t mentioned anything to me about it, positive or negative. Could be a good product for those seeking that luxury experience who have normal or oily skin, but it falls short for a “rich cream” in my opinion. nan
