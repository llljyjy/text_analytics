I’ve been using this Cream for the past 2 weeks and  I am loving the way it has left me feeling. I am a 32 year old and my skin is starting to change , but with my Lancome Advance Genifique Night Cream I do not have to worry about it getting worse. This has definitely helped me in so many ways besides my confidence,  it has left my skin feeling smooth and looking elastic even my kids say it feels softer lol so for me that’s more than enough proof . A game changer
