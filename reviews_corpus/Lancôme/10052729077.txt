After using this product for a few weeks, I have concluded I love it! I have to admit honestly I was very skeptical in the beginning, as I have not. found anything to provide my skin with intense hydration while using my prescribed Curology topical Tretinoin. I usually use Cereve or First Aid Beauty, but neither did anything for my skin barrier. I would wake up with dry flakes around my mouth and nose. This night cream took care of those issues after a few nights! I use this every other night, and the texture of my skin had improved dramatically. I no longer have breakouts on my jawline or flakey textured skin that messes up my makeup application. I am in love!! I do wish it was unscented though, the fragrance reminds me of that cheap conditioner you get in with boxed hair dye(lol!) A must-have in my evening routine!
