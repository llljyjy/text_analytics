I wanted to give the product adequate time to use it before I reviewed and I am thoroughly impressed! The inclusion of ferulic acid is a big selling point for me and seems to have done the trick with some of the pesky fine lines around my mouth and eyes. I see many of those lines dissipating and becoming more smoothed after about a month and a half of use. My overall complexion is more even, youthful, and radiant! The product absorbs well and works well with other products and makeup I use. I also love the unique packaging; itâ€™s sleek, air tight, and dispenses the different components separately but at the same time. Lancome knocked it out of the park with this product! Holy grail status
