This night cream works beautifully as expected. I wake up with my skin feeling very soft and smooth, my skin looks much brighter and my fine lines are less noticeable. It does have a light fragrance and the consistency is nice and thick. The promise to smooth and hydrate are definitely true! It does exactly what itâ€™s supposed to do and for that, I highly recommend. Perfect!
