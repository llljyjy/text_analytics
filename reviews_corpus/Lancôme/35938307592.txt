I received Lancôme Génifique Night Repair Cream for free from Bzzagent and Lancome in exchange for my honest review. It has a white and smooth texture which melts into the skin right away after applying. I’ve been using Génifique Night Repair Cream for two weeks and I’ve noticed a clear improvement in my skin. My skin looks stronger, healthier, moisturizing, and nourishing. This cream becomes my fav cream for the night routine. Once mine runs out, I’m definitely going to repurchase it. I highly recommend Lancôme Génifique Night Repair Cream for everyone, especially those who are looking for an effective night cream aMAZING
