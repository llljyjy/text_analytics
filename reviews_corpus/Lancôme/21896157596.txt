Iâ€™ve been using it twice a day for almost 4 months now and I have not noticed any improvement in my fine lines or dark circles. It moisturizes well and my eyes are a little less puffy. I like the formula. It melts into the skin and is not irritating my eyes or sensitive skin. I know eye creams are usually pretty pricey, but there are good cheaper options. Overall, not worth the price. Good but not worth the price
