I’ve been exclusively using this product with no other serums or moisturizers for a month maybe a little more and I am very impressed with it. I have not felt like I have been missing out on any of my other serums or moisturizers because this literally does it all. One pump is enough for my entire face. I don’t need to use moisturizer.  Even though this is a serum, the white cream is just like a moisturizer. I do have combination skin so somebody with dry skin may still need more, but for me, it’s been plenty. I thoroughly enjoy my skincare routine of layering serums, but I have been looking for a one and done serum/moisturizer and this is it. Perfect for people who don’t have time. Yes it’s pricey, but when you think about buying everything that’s in this separately, it’s the same price and actually probably a lot cheaper. But most importantly is that this stuff works! Its hard for me to see new results with skincare because I already take such good care of my skin, but I did notice that my skin felt softer, smoother, more plump. I have a wrinkle on my forehead that has been such a pain and I actually think it has diminished a little bit. My biggest con is that I can’t see how much is left so until I finish the bottle, I won’t know how long it will last. It’s also plastic so if it breaks then I’m not sure how the serum could be retrieved. Overall, it’s a great product. Would work well for any skin type and in my opinion is totally worth it. I hope that more brands begin to try this approach towards skincare in the future. I love it!!
