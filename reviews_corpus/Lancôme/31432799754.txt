I’ve had the opportunity to try this product for about a little less than a month and it is AMAZING. I never had a night cream in my face care regimen, but I decided to try it and boy am I glad I did. I wake up to an amazingly soft and radiant face every morning. Initially I was worried because it has a fragrance and it didn’t do the trick overnight. It took about a week for it to actually start working, but that’s normal and expected. The fragrance wasn’t too bad and it wasn’t sticky after use. I love it. Radiance in a Bottle
