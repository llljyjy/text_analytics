I love the idea of a triple serum as this product applies beautifully. It gives a subtle glow and leaves my face feeling soft and supple. I’ve used this for over a month and I don’t notice anything drastic changing about my face in terms of wrinkles but it has made my face softer, less texture. I will say the only two cons I dislike about this item is 1) it’s super PRICEY! I can’t justify paying that much for it, maybe if it was under $100? However since it is more on the luxurious side, I think it’s worth it. 2) To get three of the serum out, you have to flip the bottle upside down or else you won’t get all three serum. It also took a few days in the beginning for it to all come out at the same time too. Faulty product design. Please keep in mind it is heavily fragranced, I do like the smell, however if you have sensitive skin, it might not be for you. Beautiful and luxurious
