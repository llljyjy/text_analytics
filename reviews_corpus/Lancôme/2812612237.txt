I was incredibly skeptical of this product when I received it. I’ve not had good luck with nonskincare-specific brands. I have very sensitive, reactive skin, so I am very careful of what I put on it. It is very comparable to the La Mer soft cream in terms of feel and consistency — thick and melts into the skin. It smells heavily perfumed like rose, so if you are sensitive to fragrance I would stay away. My skin didn’t react to it, thankfully. I used it morning and night for 2 weeks and I felt like my skin definitely became smoother, softer and more even. I had less redness overall. It kept my face moisturized and comfortable even in winter weather and while being outside in the dryness for hours. I love this cream and I think it really works. The only con is the cost. It’s very expensive and you would get similar results with something cheaper. nan
