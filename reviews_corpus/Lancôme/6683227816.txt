Immediately I can report the beautiful glow that i have after applying this to the face. I have aging skin so my dark spots and un-even skin tone annoy me so much. I started using this to see if it would help, but i was afraid i would break out. I usually have bad breakouts when first using a product. This did not break me out. It did give me little red bumps which i included pics, but i believe that was to be expected after introducing something new to my skincare routine. So far I’m loving this product. I will continue using it because I’m noticing smoother skin and better application with makeup. Nice on aging skin.
