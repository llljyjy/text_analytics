I have tried the cream for about 2 weeks now.  First the texture feels creamy and absorbs quick with a lovely scent.  I feel like my skin is softer and the skin tone is evening out.  Overall the cream is very nice and I feel like it is helping with my complexion.  However I do think it is a little pricey.  At the same point, need to treat yourself.  And I feel skincare is important. Lanc√¥me absolue
