Amazing product!  I have tried a few serums in the past and this one is fantastic. It absorbs super fast, helps keep makeup on and overall I do see an improvement in my skin— namely clarity, texture and hydration. Most recently I tried Sunday Riley’s Good Genes and didn’t love the smell— it was pretty bad, but this smells fresh and the fragrance dissipates quickly. Can’t wait to see what the results after a few months will be! nan
