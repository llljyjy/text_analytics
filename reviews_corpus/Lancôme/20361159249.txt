I’ve been using this cream for a while, and I’m pleased with the results. I’m in the middle of Hay Fever and my skin gets extra dry now. The days I’m using Lancôme Absolue skin feels and looks way better. Also, it’s great makeup base cream because it’s eliminated little skin flakes.  The texture and scent also really pleasant. Only I wish it came with a little spatula. My skin loves it
