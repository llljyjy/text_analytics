I was offered Lanc√¥me absolute revitalizing eye cream in exchange for my honest opinion. I received the cream noticed it was thick and creamy, no over powering odor. The eye cream was easily rubbed into my skin and after a few days I noticed a big difference in my eyes and the look of my face. I was Mmmmmmmmm man very happy with the results and will continue to use this product from now on. Hands down it is a lot better then my previous eye cream. The price is fair bc it has a ton of product in the jar and only takes a little to make a big change and for you to fall in love with it. I have already given some to one of my friends for her 41st birthday and she is in love with the results also. My new favorite eye cream
