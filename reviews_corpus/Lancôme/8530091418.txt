I have been loving using this serum. It does have a pretty strong scent but it does smell good. It goes on smoothly and doesn’t leave my face feeling sticky. It definitely makes my face feel a lot softer and smooth but I haven’t noticed a huge difference which I was hoping to see due to the price. I received this product free for my honest feedback. I do love it!
