After using this for a month I would say it really does the job.It melts in your skin and makes your skin looks plump ,brighter and hydrated the next day! It’s light gel texture.I’m using it with my trusted genefique serum and yeux eye cream.I love these products of Lancôme. It’s now my favorite night cream
