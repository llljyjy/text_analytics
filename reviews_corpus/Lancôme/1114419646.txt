Let’s start with my age …46 with a bullet. :)  About the only fake thing about my skin is that I so use Botox for my frown and crows toes around my eyes. Other than that …the rest is all natural. I’m all about keeping healthy looking skin as long as I can. I was lucky enough to try this product and WOWsers!  In 2 weeks I have had this product I have seen a nice change. Softer, supple, radiant skin. It goes on fairly thick  (a little goes a long way) and as you blend it in, your skin absorbs it well. It’s VELVETY!! In the two weeks the fine lines around my eyes were reduced and my skin had an overall glow. I love that there is rose extract in the ingredients. I have been using rosehip oil for some time and the benefits are remarkable. The shea butter and coconut oil top things off and just give your skin 1000% hydration. I will add that I prefer to use the product at night following a shower so my skin gets the full benefits throughout the night. While you can layer it with makeup, I have combination skin and because it’s so rich and creamy, my skin just does better with the night application. I tried to add my video so you all can see the product on…but it wouldn’t upload :( Overall great addition for those like be trying to maintain healthy radiant skin. WOW WOW WOW
