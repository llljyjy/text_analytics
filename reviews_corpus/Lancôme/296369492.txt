I use this serum directly after washing my face am and pm. I love the idea of mixing three different components fresh. However, it was a little difficult to get all three serums going, and they’re almost always dispensed unequally. That means I’ll probably run out of one serum sooner. The product absorbs well and feels somewhat heavier than a regular serum but lighter than a moisturizer. Overall, I like it, my face does look better on it. Good product
