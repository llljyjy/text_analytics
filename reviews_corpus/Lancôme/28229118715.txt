Well I’m impressed.  I have actually been a Lancôme customer for a long time. I also go through a 15-20 min process on my face every evening before bed. I am very familiar with beauty product and ingredients that I put on my skin. I recently went to my dermatologist for a few breakouts I’ve been having after the holidays.  She recommended that I look for products with hyaluronic Acid to help with healing while still moisturizing my skin.  I started using the Renergie about 2 weeks ago and I not only have clear skin but i feel like it definitely healed everything right up.  I will be continuing with this product long term, so happy! nan
