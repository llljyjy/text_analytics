To start off with, I HATE creams that are greasy and just sit on my face. This is not one of those night creams. Not too thick with a pleasant scent. I have combination skin, and after using it for 2 + weeks now, I definitely feel like my face feels softer. I think that the cream has smoothed out the texture on my face. I often have the problem that if I use creams consistently I end up with a breakout, but not with this one. I definitely recommend! Luxurious Night Cream!
