I used this cream for several weeks and find it a solid night cream for use in Northeastern autumn weather.  It’s got a medium texture (not too heavy nor too light) which sinks in nicely upon application and doesn’t leave a lingering greasy feel.  I found the scent light and soothing, and felt my skin was softer and had a bit of a glow each morning. nan
