The moisturizer is a bit thick and i love it. I have very dry skin and I can put this on and still feel hydrated hours later. Usually I don’t like rose scents, but this scent soft and lovely. While the cream may be too heavy for the day some people, it’s perfect as a night cream. My only downside is the price, but if the product is as good as this one I say go ahead and splurge!
