Iâ€™m 41 and I have been using several facial creams and I loved this one.  It has a better texture and fragrance compared the ones I used. Only the hyaluronic acid on its composition made me give 5 stars because we really feel the diference on skin really fast. My skin is softer not dry anymore due to retinol products. I would buy this product but I think it is a little expensive for me. I really recommend this product for everyone, I already did to my besties and my mom. Make me love my night routine using this cream.
