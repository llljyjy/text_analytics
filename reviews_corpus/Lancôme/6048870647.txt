After using this night cream for about two weeks I noticed my skin texture was much more even but was also a bit dry. I like the consistency of this night cream much more than some of the others I’ve tried, it doesn’t go on too thick but also not too thin. The added fragrance also doesn’t seem to bother my skin so that’s a plus! nan
