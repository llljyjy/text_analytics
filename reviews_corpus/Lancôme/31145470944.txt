I really wanted to like this but unfortunately I had an allergic reaction. My eyes swelled up by the morning after (I used it the night before) and my face was bright red and burning. This reaction lasted over 24 hours. Nothing I did alleviated this or made it go away. There are ingredients in this product that shouldnâ€™t be used at the same time for those with sensitive skin. Be careful! Be careful if you have sensitive skin!!
