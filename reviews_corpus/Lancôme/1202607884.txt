Overall I liked this product but I did have some cons. I thought the idea of having 3 separate products in one was nice. I may have noticed a slight change in my skins appearance and I did notice a difference with my skin being softer. I didnâ€™t like how sticky it was though and I thought it was pricy for the benefits I got. nan
