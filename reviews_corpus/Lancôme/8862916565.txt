What this moisturizer claims to be and does for your skin; formulated with 10% Bifidus Prebiotic, Hyaluronic Acid and Triple Ceramide Complex to help repair the skins moisture barrier. As someone in their mid 40s I know that as we age, our skin starts to lose moisture and dehydrates, also slowing down our cell turnover. Using a moisturizer with the right ingredients is critical. I have been wanting to try this moisturizer for a while and was very excited to use it. Now what the moisturizer actually does; I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and I have been extremely pleased with the results. Itâ€™s very lightweight and does not feel heavy on the skin, smell is not overpowering either for those who prefer non-fragranced skincare. After the first couple of nights, my skin looked smooth and well rested, and after using it for a few week, my skin is a lot more hydrated, smooth and plumped. I would highly recommend this product. nan
