I have used the cream for over two weeks now and I am simply loving it. My skin feels instantly pampered and hydrated. When I wake up in the morning my skin looks so rested and good, so good that I donâ€™t want to wash my face. The only concern I have is that I am not a huge fan of the scent it has. nan
