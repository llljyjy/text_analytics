I love the packaging, the pink hue of the cream, the thickness of the cream and how it feels going on. A little bit goes a long way and it feels super moisturizing...can honestly feel my skin soaking it in. The only drawback is that it takes a long time to absorb so it can leave a greasy feel on your fingers and it has my neck stuck to my silk pillow case. Even after it absorbs it leaves a light tacky feel that doesnâ€™t go away, so for that I dropped a star. nan
