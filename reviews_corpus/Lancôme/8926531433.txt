This serum works great! It is easy to apply and it absorbs fast into the skin. After using it 3 weeks, twice a day, I see great improvement on my dark spots and the skin feels more plumped and moisturized throughout the day.  I love the look of the bottle and the concept of 3 different chambers pumping out different ingredients, but it took about 3-4 uses before the product started coming out as expected. Also, the fragrance is a bit too much for my taste. Great product!
