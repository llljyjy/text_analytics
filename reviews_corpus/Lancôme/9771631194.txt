A gorgeous, lux serum with hyaluronic acid, vitamin C+ niacinamide, and ferulic acid that leaves my skin feeling soft and looking supple and refreshed. Definitely recommend and will buy again! Use with hydrating facial spray or light moisturizer as the hyaluronic acid sucks moisture and will leave your face tacky and dry, especially for dry or dry combination folks. I spritzed a thermal water spray before every use which worked like a charm. Second tip is store the bottle upside down. This helps the product come out easier. You need all three components pumping out for full effectiveness. Bottle is beautiful on display as well! Gorgeous Serum!
