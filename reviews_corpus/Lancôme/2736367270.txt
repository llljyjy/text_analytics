I really like this Lancome Advanced Genifique Night Cream. It comes from a brand that I trust and that I have experience with. It’s very creamy and rich and it feels luxurious on my skin. I feel as if I’m pampering my skin every night that I use it because at least my skin supple and soft to the touch. I feel with continued use it should really shrink my pores. If those results occur, I would definitely purchase and recommend it. nan
