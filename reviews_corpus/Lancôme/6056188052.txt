Lanc√¥me never disappoints me with their skincare! This cream is light on the skin but really packs in the moisture. It makes my skin look and feel more hydrated, glowy, and radiant. It does a great job at repairing damaged moisture barriers and just hydrating your skin in general. I definitely recommend this product! nan
