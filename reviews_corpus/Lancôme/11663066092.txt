Love the product but was disappointed that i didn’t realize only 2 of the 3 spouts were working properly. By that time I’d gone halfway through the bottle! So disappointed but will be exchanging for a new one that works properly. Otherwise, i really did feel a difference in skin texture, not so much any dark spots though. Maybe that’s the pump that wasn’t working. Broken pump mechanism
