***I would give this 5 stars, if I had the option available on here!  It only let me put 4 stars!***Upon opening the package, I read the background information of Lancome Absolue.  Apparently, Lancome hired a special rose cultivator to cultivate & harvest a special one of a kind rose-- The Lancome Rose-- specifically just for their products!   When opening the beautiful gold jar, you can instantly smell the rose scent.  Iâ€™m typically not a fan of Rose smelling stuff, but this was different.  It felt more luxurious and authentic.  I dab bits of this on my eyes every morning and every night, after removing my makeup and washing my face.  The satin consistency really does a good job of moisturizing the eye area without making it feel greasy.  I notice puffiness going away immediately after using it.  The small jar will last me quite a while. I would buy this, or buy it for a loved one. A real treat for your crow's feet!
