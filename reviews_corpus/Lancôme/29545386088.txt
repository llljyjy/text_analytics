I was hesitant to try this product.  I dont believe claims that say they fade age spots,  so you can imagine my shock to find out this product actually works.  Now I just tried it for 2 weeks before I wrote the review, and I did notice a small amount of fading from one particular area above my eye. Not only does this product help minimize spots, but it made my skin feel so smooth.  In all honesty this is probably one of the best moisturizers I have ever tried. And this is only after 2 weeks of trying it. I may come back in about a month or 3 months to update my progress with the minimization of age spots.  I would definitely encourage people to purchase this product. It is absolutely amazing and it actually lives up to its claims. Lives up to claims
