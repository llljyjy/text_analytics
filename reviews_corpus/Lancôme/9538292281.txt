I really love the feel of this LANCÓME PARIS Advanced GÉNIFIQUE Night moisturizer, it’s thick, rich and feels luxurious. I can tell it gives me a beautiful glow when I use it at night. I’ve only had it for a week or two at most, though, so I can’t report any “significant“  changes. I can tell you the second I applied it, I instantly fell in love, my face felt calm and hydrated. It’s a night cream so you won’t even know it’s on because you’re sleeping.  When I awoke the next morning the product was fully absorbed and my face looked plump and radiant. Magic in a jar!
