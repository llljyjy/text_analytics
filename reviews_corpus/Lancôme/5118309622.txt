This serum (at first) seemed really gimmicky. It seemed like the skincare equivalent of a 3-in-1 conditioner product. From the first couple of uses, I was left unimpressed because only one of the serums came out! I was a little peeved, it seemed not only gimmicky but also a bit misleading. Perhaps they were all mixed in together? Anyway. I kept on. Mediocre at best, quite sticky and tacky. But then around the fourth or fifth use, the clouds parted. Rather, they came together, because all three streams/ serums finally came out and WOW! I was blown away. The feel of the serum plus the way it made my skin feel is definitely one of the more impressive compared to other new products I’ve tried. While I’m familiar with most of the ingredients listed, I am a newbie when it come to ferulic acid, so hard to tell the effects in the few weeks I’ve been using it, but I’ve been very happy with my complexion after using this. Overall evening out of my skin tone for sure.  In conclusion. Is it a little gimmicky? Absolutely. BUT. It is kind of worth the hype in my opinion. I’d seriously consider purchasing this. While it might come off as strong to some I really enjoyed the scent thought I’m sure it’s an artificial one. Either way, that is pretty much the only con. Can we also talk about how pretty it looks on the bathroom counter?! Wow, this might be worth the price tag.
