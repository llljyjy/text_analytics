I use eye cream religiously. Every day & night without fail. I have used them all too. From LeMer to drugstore. I really like this eye cream. It is not heavy but stays on all night. It doesn’t end up on my pillowcase instead of my face.In the morning it allows you to apply your foundation and concealer without getting smeary. I don’t find these characteristics in the same lotion. I have to mix and match. Save money by buying one cream!! Save money buy one cream!
