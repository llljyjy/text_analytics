I tried this product for a month. The first thing I noticed was that it smells great! It’s goes on super smooth and makes my skin feel soft. I think that it also made my skin brighter too. The only problem area I was hoping it would help to correct is a small dark spot on my cheek. Although it didn’t fix it I do believe it’s slightly lighter. Overall I really liked this product and would recommend it as part of a good skin care routine. Smells great! Brighter skin
