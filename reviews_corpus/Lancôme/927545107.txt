The consistency of the serum is nice when mixed up and I appreciate keeping the two mixes separate for freshness must be tricky! Soaks right in and my skin looks great. It was hard to get the pump started and may be impossible without wasting product - the clear side came out much more easily but very sticky on its own. Nice lotion for day or night
