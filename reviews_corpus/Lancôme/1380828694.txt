I’ve only been using this serum a couple of weeks, but so far so good!  My skin seems smoother and more plump, so I’m hopeful that as I continue to use the product the fine lines and dark spots will diminish.  My skin is sensitive so I usually use fragrance free products, so at first the scent was a little too strong for me, almost like perfume.  I’ve gotten used to it, though, and it’s not irritated my skin at all.  What’s nice is that it’s a 3-in-1 product and replaces two other products I was previously using.  One less step is a big deal when I’m tired or in a rush.   It’s easy to mix and absorbs easily into my skin.  I use it on my face and neck and can’t wait to see the results after a few months. nan
