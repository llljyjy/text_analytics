Holy grail for me! I almost never use sunscreen because it either blocks my pores, causes acne or feels heavy on my face. Lancome sunscreen makes my skin feel so lightweight and glowy. I can even skip the primer step & use this one as moisturizer + sunscreen + primer. Although I still use moisturizer under, it acts as perfect primer for my makeup. No irritation either, such great product! I love everything about Lancome, just wish the price be more affordable. nan
