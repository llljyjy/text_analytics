This night cream worked great for my skin. Been using it for a month now, and no irritation at all. I have very sensitive skin and I feel this product kept my skin very hydrated and comfortable. I use it only at night as it is a little too heavy for daytime use. Highly recommend. Hydrating. Good for sensitive skin.
