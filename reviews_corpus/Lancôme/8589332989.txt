As the name indicates, it is indeed a rich emulsion but somehow does not feel heavy on your skin. It settles down after some time. I would recommend this for dry and combination skin but definitely not for oily skin. Absolutely a great skin cream for winter.  It has a very mild and pleasant fragrance but goes away. I tried at night and loved how I felt in the morning. my skin felt dewy and soft. I also tried during day time beneath my makeup and all day my skin stayed hydrated. However, I like it better as a night cream. Overall I really love the product but I am yet to see if it will do justice to its price. I have only used for a couple of weeks now and already I do see my skin becoming healthier. I must also mention I love the rich and lush container. nan
