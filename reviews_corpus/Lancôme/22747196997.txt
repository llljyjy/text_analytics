This product has been lovely for my skin. Immediately after application it soaks in and my skin feels hydrated and soft. After 2 weeks I noticed the texture of my skin beginning to feel smoother and more even.  It does have a classic cosmetic fragrance but after it absorbs it seems to disappear. Happy skin!
