This product is rich and creamy and has a light, fresh scent. I have sensitive skin, so creams with heavy fragrance would irritate my skin and this doesn’t irritate my skin at all. It isn’t too thick and goes on very light. A little goes a long way. I wear this at night and my skin feels hydrated and firm the next morning. I will be using this every night as part of my daily skin routine! The perfect overnight cream!
