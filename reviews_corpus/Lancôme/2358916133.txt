I’ve applied this serum now for 2.5 weeks, AM as well as PM. Sequence - wash face, then apply serum both on face and neck, followed by moisturizer. The serum feels light on the skin yet slightly oily texture. It is not completely gel like. The skin feels noticeably soft and supple. Even under makeup, the product never felt heavyweight. I love Lancôme product’s fragrances, not at all overpowering. After using Lancôme HCF Triple serum for more than 2 weeks, my skin feels super hydrated and soft. I think it’s too early to comment about the dark spot correction capability. I will definitely continue to use the product. Feels great under day cream and night cream. Love love love!
