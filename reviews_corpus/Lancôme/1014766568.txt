I really wanted to love this serum. Lancome Renergie H.C.F.Triple Serum had so many promises, but my sensitive skin did not like it. I tried to wear this serum during the day and at night but it was so sticky and my makeup would literally never set. At night the serum was a good thick cream mixture that had promise , but was just too sticky, and eventhough I am in my 50’s, I broke out like a teenager. If you love a good thick serum the Lancome H.C.F. Triple Serum is for you, unfortunately it wasn’t for me. Lancome Renergie H.C.F. Triple Serum
