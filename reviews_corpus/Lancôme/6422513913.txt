This is a lovely night cream. I think the smell is amazing, but not too strong or overpowering. My skin has looked very even and bright in the two weeks since Iâ€™ve started using it, no breaking out at all. My reasoning for 4 instead of 5 stars is because I am on the drier side and sometimes felt like I needed to add another layer of moisture after this, as well as a slight irritation of the skin upon application-but I am very sensitive and found that it went away quickly. Nice cream
