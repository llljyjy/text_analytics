This couldn’t have come at a better time. I was starting to feel like I’ve damaged my skin barrier or irritated my skin just enough with my slightly new skincare regimen. Stopped everything besides cleansing, sunscreen and have been using this cream for almost 3 weeks now. My skin has calmed down alot, redness has gone, it feels nicely moisturized and it’s slowly healing. Smoothness is starting to come back, still need more time before its fully healed but this is definitely going in my skincare cabinet, has helped my skin alot towards healing. Price point is also very fair considering the results and effectiveness. I have tried other skin repair creams that did little, at higher price points. Quite pleased with lancome skincare, they’re definitely a competition for other skincare companies now. I will be purchasing another bottle of this. Its a must in my skincare cabinet, highly recommend, especially for those with sensitive skin. Lifesaver
