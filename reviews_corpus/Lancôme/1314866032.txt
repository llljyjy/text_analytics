I love Lancôme products. Especially the skincare. So luxurious and they work! When I had the opportunity to try the Renergie H.C.F. Triple Serum, I was very excited. They call it a triple serum because it contains hyaluronic acid,vitamin c+ Niacinimide and ferulic acid. I have always loved hyaluronic acid, but I had never tried ferulic acid. The literature says that upon the 1st application, you will notice that your skin looks more healthy and luminous and visibly smoother. I can’t say that I noticed I looked smoother, but I did notice that my skin looked so luminous! It’s the perfect word for how your skin looks. And I felt that the radiance did make my skin look younger and therefore healthier. I waited for 2 weeks until I gave this review because that was the next phase in which you really start seeing a difference. It says that you skin will feel resurfaced and plumped. This was true as well. I had some dry patches over my eyebrows (thanks Winter weather + rosacea!) and even my other serums weren’t really helping with the issues. Within 2 weeks of incorporating this serum into my routine, my skin was so much smoother and the dry patches were gone! My whole face was noticeably smoother, even when I would touch my skin randomly throughout the day. It is also supposed to shrink your pores and reduce redness. It’s hard for me to see a difference in these two areas because rosacea makes my skin both red and large pored where I have my redness. I will say that my skin looks smoother even with my enlarged pores, so maybe in a months time I will actually see some improvement in that area.All in all, I am so impressed with this product. I cannot wait to see what 1 month and 2 months change will bring. This isn’t cheap at $135, but I think if I continue to see a difference, I would be willing to purchase this when I run out, because I love the way my skin feels now. A triple serum product that brings on the glow!
