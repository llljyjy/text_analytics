I’ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I really do think it’s help hydrate my skin. During the winter months I suffer from severe dry skin and I have tried a variety of things to help. This cream is definitely thick and provides a layer of protection over the skin, which I think has really help my skin keep some moisture in. This is also very thick - the first time I used this I made the mistake of taking out a big scoop lol. You definitely don’t need that much - it goes a long way. The biggest downside for me is the fragrance- it is STRONG! It kinda reminds me of an old time perfume that my grandma wore when she was alive. The fragrance isn’t enough to stop me from wearing it but  if you are sensitive to smells or fragrance then this isn’t the stuff for you. Great moisturizer, strong scent
