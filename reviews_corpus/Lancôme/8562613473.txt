This product would get 5 stars from me if the component worked as I believe itâ€™s intended too. Unless I leave it upside down over night all only 2 out of the 3 serums are dispensed. Besides that I think this combo is great.  My skin is looking beautiful. It soaks in right away and the smell that is common with a lot of lancome products dissipates quickly. I think this one is worth the price tag. Inventive and fast acting product
