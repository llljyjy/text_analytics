I was very interested to try the Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream by Lancome!I trust the Lancome brand and know the quality is always high. I apply the Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream every night for the past 3 weeks and I can see the visible difference.My skin feels more firm and hydrated and fine lines are much less visible.I have a combination type skin and itâ€™s not an easy task to find the cream suitable for dry and oily skin at the same time, but the Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream successfully accomplish my mission.The texture is very light and pleasant, but powerful. I apply it on my clean face before going to bed and in the morning I have fresh and healthy look.I like it very much and would definitely recommend it to anybody who is looking for and effective night cream. My new favorite!
