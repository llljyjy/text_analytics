I received this serum for free from Influenster and Lancôme for my honest review.This serum is great ! What I love about it is the fact that it consists of 3 active ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, vitamin c, niacinamide and feluric acid, these ingredients does wonders to my skin. I saw brighter, plumper, clearer and hydrated skin. I will definitely purchase this serum and 1000% recommend it.Lancôme did a amazing job with this serum. nan
