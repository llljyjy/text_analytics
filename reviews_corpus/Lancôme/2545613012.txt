I love the fact that it is 3 products in one. The first time I applied it my face, it looked a lot more brighter and my skin felt really good. I love the formula, it applies easily and a little bit goes a long ways, it is not sticky yet and it has fresh scent to it. I tried it for 30 days and in those 30 days I have not had to wear my regular moisturizer over it. It did not get rid of my fine lines but did improve the appearance of them. The only part I did NOT like about it is that it makes my face look too shiny and greasy. I have naturally oily skin and usually look shiny throughout the day, but this made it worse. Itâ€™s okay
