I’ve also used the SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic, and at $30 cheaper and 0.7oz larger, the Lancome serum is the better buy. I saw a slight improvement in skin texture and hyperpigmentation in 6 weeks. Note that it’s not very moisturizing, especially in the winter, so you’ll want to layer your regular moisturizer on top. Just be careful about not mixing active ingredients. Comparable to SkinCeuticals
