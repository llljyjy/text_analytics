Was super excited to try this out because of the three serums in one. Super cute packaging and easy to apply. But as some other comments have mentioned, it does have a bit of a sting to it if you have sensitive skin. I do not have a sensitivity to hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, or niacinamide, so I can only assume it’s the ferulic acid or the other random added ingredients and fragrances. Almost worth knocking off a star. Love the scent of other Lancome products, but this has a kind of chemical smell to it that is offputting. I have been using for a few weeks now and from day one have noticed a brighter appearance and a smoother feel. And wow, does my face look younger. Amazing. Is it worth the steep price tag though? Possibly. We will see. It’s been a while since I found a product this worthwhile. Love it! Glowing skin
