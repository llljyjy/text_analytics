I really enjoyed this serum for several reasons. I felt like it was very innovative with how they mix the products, the bottle overall looks very nice and was made well for application, and the benefits it gave my skin were nothing short of amazing. The smell of the product is quite nice, a bit perfumey but I enjoyed the scent. The way you have to apply it was interesting but I got used to it quickly. Most of all though, it definitely helped my skin. Innovative Serum
