This product definitely smoothed out my skin.  It took about ten days for amazing results.  But I would buy it again.  It is nice to only have one night cream to use at night that takes care of my skin.  It sinks in fast and feels like there is a barrier protecting my skin while I sleep.  There is no smell to irritate my sinuses.  Also, the product didn’t sting, I have to say it felt like the safest cream I have used in a long time.  This product is very reliable and gets better with consistent use, definitely worth it.  It saves a lot of time if you are searching for something that works and doesn’t irritate.  The gel cream consistency is different but never sticky or greasy.  This is worth trying.  The price point is average but still high for my budget right now, but otherwise I would buy it all the time. Love the results!
