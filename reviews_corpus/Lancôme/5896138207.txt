I have been testing this Lancome Triple Active Serum with Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C + Niacinamide, and Ferulic Acid, for the past one month. I love the concept of this 3 in 1 actives in one product. This serum is designed to target wrinkles, dark spots and firmness of the skin. Having used this serum morning and night as part of my skincare routine, I can say that the serum absorbs really well into my skin, it doesn’t leave any residue or grease and works really well with other active products such as Retinol, Peptides and Ceramides. I can certainly say that it is working great on firmness of the skin and targeting the fine lines around my mouth and eye area. In respect of the dark spots, I believe that the serum will take longer to work. I haven’t seen any increase in dark spots, so that is perfect. I really am hoping that this serum works to reduce the dark spots and reduces the likelihood of future dark spots. This serum is definitely going to remain a staple in my skincare routine. It certainly is a bonus when you’ve got three products rolled into one. I would just say that the pump dispenser could be improved so that all three tubes dispense the same amount of product. Also, I noticed that the thicker cream type of serum came out a little clumpy, so consistency could be improved. Sent to me from influenster for my honest review. Works great against fine lines!
