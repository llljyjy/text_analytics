Beautiful packaging and presentation, exteriorly and the serum itself. The pump works great and never causes any leakage or residue that sticks to the sides of the bottle -- I’ve had that happen with other products. I use it in rotation with my other products. Definitely have to make sure to use a moisturizer with it or I will get peely skin. That’s true with any serum but it also means that it works! Beautiful inside and out
