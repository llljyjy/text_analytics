So surprised at just how well this hydrates without being greasy or oily feeling. It sinks into the skin and leaves a healthy, hydrated surface. With combo skin I usually need to be choosy about where I put hydrating products but with this, I can put it all over. A very small amount goes a long way, too. Most products with rose are over scented and this one is not. Rose is one of my least favorite scents and I donâ€™t mind this one at all. I can use it day or night but love using a good layer before bed to wake up to happy skin. Better than expected
