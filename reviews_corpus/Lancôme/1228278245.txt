First off I love the packaging! It comes in a sleek black glass jar.  The cream is light but moisturizing. It has a light scent that’s not overwhelming which is always nice. Keeps my skin well hydrated and the next day my skin has a nice glow to it. I like the consistency and feel of the cream. Doesn’t leave my skin greasey and I’ve been using this for about 3 weeks and no breakouts or skin iirritation. nan
