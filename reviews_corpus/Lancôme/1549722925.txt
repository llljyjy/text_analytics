I was offered to try Lancôme’s Advanced Génifique Repairing Night Cream at no cost in exchange for my honest review through #bzzagent. I use a couple of other Lancôme skin cream products as part of my daily beauty routine, which I really love. This product is no exception! I apply it every night after I wash my face and before I go to bed. I have used it for a few weeks now and my skin feels and appears to be moisturized and supple, and my skin just seems to be overall healthier. Youth in a Jar!
