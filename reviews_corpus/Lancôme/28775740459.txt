My favorite things about this cream is that 1.) it’s easy to distribute on my skin, 2.) no heavy fragrance, 3.) absorbs quickly, and 4.) doesn’t leave a residue on my skin. Even though this is a night cream, I think this would work great under makeup during the day due to the last two reasons mentioned. I often find many moisturizers too heavy/oily/greasy for daytime, which effects my makeup, whereas this cream seems to be the opposite & dries down very matte. For night time, I don’t find this cream particulary hydrating and needed to go over areas of my skin with another moisturizer to feel hydrated. I also seem to breakout more each time I use this, which I think might possibly be due to the bifidus ingredient, as I have this same issue with another skincare product that has this ingredient. I’m not a big fan of skincare in jars either, due to sanitary reasons. But the packaging looks nice and the product looks very classy out on the counter!
