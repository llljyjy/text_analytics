But I’m not in love with it. I’ve been using it consistently for about two weeks. I’ve noticed subtle improvements to my skin such as small scars seem lighter and my light laugh lines have diminished. It does provide an ample amount of hydration and absorbs well. The consistency isn’t heavy, or sticky. I will continue use to see more results. I like it…
