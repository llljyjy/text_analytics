I absolutely am obsessed with the bottle! I haven’t had a serum come in such a cool dispenser prior to this. The serum is good, it isn’t greasy at all, it doesn’t leave a weird greasy feeling after application as some serums do. It’s the closest thing to scent-less that I’ve ever had in a serum. Which matter of preference, some may appreciate that. I personally prefer scented serums. But all in all, a great product. Would recommend! Good stuff!
