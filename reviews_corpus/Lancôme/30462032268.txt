This is Serum from Lancôme that contains Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic Acid, Vitamin C and Niacinamide. These ingredients are great for maintaining hydration, combating wrinkles, reducing pore size and brightening the complexion. I love the sleek and colorful look of the bottle. It contains 50 mLs of product. It has an easy to use pump bottle. The product itself has a serum texture. It comes out clear on one side and white on the other. Then I rub my hands together and pat onto my face. It has a rather strong scent, but it dissipates quickly. I definitely noticed my face feeling tighter and my complexion was brighter. I’m pleased with the results I saw after two weeks of usage. Great serum, a little pricey
