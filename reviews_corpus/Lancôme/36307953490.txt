This is a fantastic cream. The rose scent is so dreamy, natural and not at all overpowering. I also really love the extra firm texture of the product in the jar.It spreads out and absorbs into my combination skin very well, as long as itâ€™s not applied too thickly. My skin truly stays moisturized from morning until evening, and I enjoy putting it on again at night! Lovely Rose Cream!
