This has great anti-aging and skin repairing ingredients including a bifidus prebiotic which can do wonders. The ceramides, lactic acid, and adenosine are nice for repairing and helping create a glow.  It does have fragrance which I would prefer it not to have as it can become sensitizing. Overall this is nice and can give you a nice moisturizer glow. nan
