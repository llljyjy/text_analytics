I got this product in exchange for my honest review from bzzagent. So I feel like this product was lightweight and nongreasy, so it was good for the summer nights for sure. However moving forward I feel that for the drier winter months my skin would need something a bit more richer. Overall I felt like it did a fair job at moisturizing when I applied it but by the morning I felt like it had worn off but I guess thatâ€™s fine since I would do my morning skincare routine then anyways. Definitely a bit more on the pricier end, I feel like there are similar products that get the job done as well without the high price point. nan
