I’ve been using this product for years as part of my skin care routine.  It’s very light weight, and great for my sensitive skin. I’ve briefly used other other serums, and prefer this one because of how gentle it is. Only four stars because I’ve never really gone without it, and can’t say that my great skin is solely due to using this serum. (But I have a feeling it deserves some of the credit, haha) nan
