I’m on the fence about how I feel about this moisturizer. My skin has been ridiculously dry this winter so it’s hard to fully judge. I can say compared to other products my face and neck stay moisturized longer. I’m going to give it a better try once the temperatures warm up and it doesn’t have such harsh elements to go against. Feels silky to the touch, I’m looking forward to seeing what it can do in the spring. nan
