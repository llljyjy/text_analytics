I received this product free for testing purposes. This serum has been leaving me with glowy skin. At first I didn’t think it was really doing anything- but it needed a good 2 weeks for me to see the results (drastic improvement in my skin texture). It has a very light, fresh smell.the packaging is heavy and looks pretty on my counter. It is dispensed in multiple consistencies and colors (white and translucent) and you mix it together in your hand before putting it on your face. I didn’t notice my face feeling slightly tight after application but this was remedied by using a heavier moisturizer than I was previously using on top of the serum. I did not experience any breakouts or burning. I would purchase this serum myself and recommend it to my friends and family. nan
