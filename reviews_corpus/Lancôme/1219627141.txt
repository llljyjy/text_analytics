This cream is very light and silky. Truly very very silky. My skin feels very smooth and moisturized. I’m not sure about brightening part. I do have a lot of hyper pigmentation and few sun spots, and can’t say that they change at all in the appearance. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks, so maybe I should just give it more time. Smooth and applicable
