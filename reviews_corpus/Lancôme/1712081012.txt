Gifted by Lancôme and influenster in exchange for my honest review. I am so happy that I tried the Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum: For Plumping & Anti-Aging skincare product. It is honestly one of the best hydrating serums I’ve tried.  The key ingredients are:- Hyaluronic acid: provides hydration, plumps and smooths skin- C+ Niacinamide: combination of vitamin c and niacinamide to help improve dark spots and brighten skin - Ferulic Acid: a powerful antioxidant to protect skin against free radicals The pump is unique in that there are 3 dispensing holes to dispense each serum separately. You can actually see the 3 different serums when it’s pumped out. The colors are beautiful to look at! One is clear, one is milky white and one is opaque white. Once you pump, the 3 serums intermix. This serum makes my face feel so hydrated! I also love how soft and smooth my face feels. After using for a few weeks, I noticed my skin looks more hydrated, healthier and softer. There is a slight pleasant scent- the scent is similar to other Lancôme skincare products. 3 in 1 serum
