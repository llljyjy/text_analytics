I received this product in exchange for my honest feedback. I really like the active ingredients in this formula. The hyaluronic acid, vitamin c and niacinamide are excellent ingredients that I value in skincare for keeping my skin looking plump, glowy and healthy. Unfortunately the fragrance was extremely strong and off-putting. As much as I avoided my eye area, my eyes would still sting a while after application. The packaging was easy for me to use, but I would prefer less plastic waste. I have been using this product for weeks and havenâ€™t seen any long term affects, but the product has felt nice on my skin and my skin has felt nice in the short term with use. Very strong fragrance
