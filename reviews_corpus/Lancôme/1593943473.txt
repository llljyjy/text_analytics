I purchased this on a whim to use as a serum when my regular go-to was out of stock. I have fairly dry combination skin so I typically use a hydrating toner, serum, and moisturizer. This did the trick in terms of being lightweight and hydrating, but I did need an additional moisturizer on top when using before bed. Those with less dry skin may enjoy this as a final moisturizer step, which it’s intended for. The only fault I found with this is it’s so heavily scented, and it’s not a scent I enjoy. If you’re sensitive to fragranced products I would definitely skip this one - otherwise, it’s a nice product. Nice moisturizer, but very strong scent
