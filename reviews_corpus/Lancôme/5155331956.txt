I decided to treat myself with this beauty at my 48th birthday. Money well spent.  I feel as if I’m in a spa every time I carefully layer a full serving of this cream. It’s creamy yet not greasy.  Smells great!  And it’s pretty absorbent it immediately adjust to skin filling in my pores giving my skin the healthy looking skin I crave  Will buy another set for my mother for mother day coming up. Smells very soothing
