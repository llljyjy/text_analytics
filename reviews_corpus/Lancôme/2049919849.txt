This works wonderfully as a moisturizer and sunscreen - my skin is soft and protected from the sun. However, the primer part isn’t what I’d hoped. It leaves my skin quite shiny, and I’ve found that I need to apply a second, dedicated primer on top of this. I don’t recommend it for anyone who wants to reduce shine. Great moisturizer and SPF, lacking as a primer
