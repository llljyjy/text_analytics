When you twist the lid open, you can see that the cream is a gorgeous light pink color and you immediately get a whiff of the scent is wonderful. The cream has a thick and luxurious texture and a little goes a long way. It glides on super smoothly and feels nourishing and hydrating on the skin without feeling heavy or greasy. The cream gives my skin an instant glow and makes it feel soooo smooth and soft. Very nourishing
