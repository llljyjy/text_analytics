Love that each ingredient in this formula is within its own tube which helps ensure efficacy. This feels like it would be similar to the Skinceuticals serum so many are obsessed with with the added bonus of a moisturizer. I’ve been using it on my face and neck for several weeks and see and feel a difference in moisture and texture. This will be a repurchase. I’ve always loved Lancome. New favorite!!
