I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Lancôme.  First let me explain the awesomeness of this product. It has 3 different serums combined into 1.  The serums are  hyaluronic acid, C+niacinamide and feurlic acid. 3 formulas all in one. It hydrates the skin, plumps the skin and improves discoloration. The first time I used it I pumped 2 pumps and you can tell there’s different serums so you have to combine them together by rubbing your hands together and then it’s activated.  It made my skin so soft and moisturized that I could skip my moisturizer. After using for just a week my skin appeared smoother, more supple and brighter.  The packaging is beautiful as well. I would definitely suggest Lancôme Renergie HCF triple serum. You may think it’s a little expensive but it will be a great investment for your skin. You might even get to skip a occasional facial with consistent use of this serum. It has greatly done wonderful to my face after only 3 weeks of use. Dark spots are fading. Fine lines are smoothing out. My skin stays hydrated. I’m definitely a fan and will purchase this. I can’t give enough kudos. It’s simply perfection for a serum. Miracle in a bottle
