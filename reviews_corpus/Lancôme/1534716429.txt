Pro: very moisturizing, light & whipped texture makes the application very smooth, brightening effectCons: cost is very high, 2oz jar will probably at most last 3 or 4 months with how whipped and light is the cream, the packaging is a bit lacking since the jar is made out of plasticOverall, if you have the money to splurge, this cream does everything it claims to do. I did see a brighter complexion and skin was glowing the following day. Scent is very light and pleasant. But compared to others such as Chanel or La Mer, this Lancome Absolue did not compare in terms of luxury. nan
