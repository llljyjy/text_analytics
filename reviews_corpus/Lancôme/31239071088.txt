First of all, I love the packaging. The bottle is super cute and looks amazing in the bathroom. The serum did wonders to my skin. After using it a couple of weeks,once a day during the evening only, I noticed my skin looked much more smooth and my pores looked smaller. I felt a bit of tingling the first few times using the product but I didn’t mind since this always makes me believe the product is doing its magic. I think the fact that it includes hyaluronic acid and ferulic acid is what makes this serum so powerful. It’s also important to note that it is not greasy and super lightweight. While it is pricey, it is definitely worth the investment. Lightweight and does wonders for your skin!
