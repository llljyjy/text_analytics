I was very excited to try this especially hearing that it does not make your teeth sensitive (I had my teeth zoomed in the dentist office and have never been in so much pain as after that treatment).  I also live in Canada so some reviewers said you can’t use this because the app doesn’t work here but I managed to use it no problem without the app.  At first I noticed it was a little dodgy turning on and off but just thought maybe I was clicking it too many times and soon got it working ok but then less than a week after using it it completely died.  Would not turn on at all even if it was plugged in so it is going back. Broke after 1 week
