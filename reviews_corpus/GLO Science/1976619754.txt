It does whiten, but it doesn’t hold a charge. And not much different than a lot of cheaper options. I thought the product was defective but I contacted the company and they offered no support or solutions. I basically have to leave it on the charger 24/7 until I’m about to use it. Photo is me trying to use it but it died after 30 seconds. nan
