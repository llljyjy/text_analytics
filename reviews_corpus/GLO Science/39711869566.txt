I received a free sample of this product from PinchMe. I did notice some improvement to my teeth - nothing drastic, but a slightly whiter smile. It fit awkward in my mouth and was a bit uncomfortable. I did like that it did not cause any tooth sensitivity like I have experienced with other whitening products. nan
