I was nervous to use the Glo Brilliant White Smile Set as whitening can cause teeth sensitivity or gum issues but I didn’t have any of that! I think because it is ‘heat’ activated I didn’t have a ton of chemical mixtures that usually come with whitening strips? I used a smaller amount of gel per application because of my anxiety with trying to product. There is definitely extra gel in the tubes and you can extend if to last for more treatments if you wanted to. I’ve really noticed a change to my teeth and they are considerably whiter than when I started, I wished I had taken before and after photos. The product is expensive, but all teeth whitening products are expensive when you factor in how many you need to buy to stay in a routine. Highly recommend buying this product. nan
