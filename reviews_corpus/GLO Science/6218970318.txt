I really like this whitening to go pen! It’s portable and I recently brought it on my trip and would use it 2x a day: once in the morning and once at night. I paired this with the teeth whitening GLO vials. So far, I’ve been using it for 5 days and I definitely notice that every day my teeth is whiter than the day before, which is great. I forsee myself using it every few weeks to touch up my teeth and whiten it before big events or in person meetups. But above all, what I like about this product is that it’s vegan and gluten free and is good for sensitive teeth (which I have because I drink hot liquids every morning!!). Love this to go pen!
