This would be a great sunscreen but I had to take off two stars for how bad it smells. It really bothers me. It smells like when you come in from outside but worse. It makes me a little nauseated. I love the consistency and the color. Also the color doesn’t run off into your face mask which was a concern of mine. Nice dewy finish. But just really struggling with the smell. I use a scented face mist to try to cover it up but it just doesn’t cover up enough. It ends up mixing with the scent of the face spray. smells terrible
