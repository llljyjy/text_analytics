This is exactly what I needed. I have been using glowscreen by supergoop for nearly 3 years now and I love it. However, it often pills and is a chemical sunscreen rather than mineral. When I heard of sunvisor I knew I had to try it despite being discouraged by reviews that claimed this product was far too oily. As someone with texture and combination skin, I knew this would be a risk. Immediately after putting this product on my skin, I was glad I had taken that risk. It glides on so easily and does not pill! It has minimal coverage, zero white cast, and is super hydrating! While my skin was shiny at first, it mellowed within minutes and my skin feels extremely moisturized. Very happy! for reference regarding white cast, I have medium tan/brown skin with warm undertones. in love
