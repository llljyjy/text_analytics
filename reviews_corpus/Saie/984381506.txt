Just tried this sunscreen and somehow I love it even more than the tinted moisturizer! Not only does it give color but it provides such a dewy luminous finish. Obsessed! I wear sunscreen daily so I love to have a tinted formula that I can wear under makeup. This is perfect. No pulling. Not greasy. Still radiant. awesome!
