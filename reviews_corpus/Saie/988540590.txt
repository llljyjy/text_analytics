This was a mediocre sunscreen. Upon application, it left my skin feeling rather sticky. I also feel this sunscreen does not blend into the skin completely. I was always left feeling like there was something heavy on my face and couldn’t wait to wash it off. I have dry to normal skin, this product always left me feeling oily. When I first purchased the product there wasn’t any strong scent to this product. However, after about six month of use, the product smelled awful. It had a rancid, oily smell that would linger. I ended up throwing it away because I assumed it probably went bad. Even though per the packaging, it had a few more months before the expiration date. The only positive in my book was it did not leave me with a white cast on my tanned, olive skin tone. Skip this product
