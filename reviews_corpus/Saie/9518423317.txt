I loved this SPF, the tint didn’t leave a white cast and it makes my skin look luminous and healthy without being shiny. It’s not super water resistant so I’d wear it if I’m indoors and it makes a fantastic primer. I don’t feel like I need foundation when I wear this, I use tinted moisturizer or concealer for additional coverage if needed. healthy looking skin
