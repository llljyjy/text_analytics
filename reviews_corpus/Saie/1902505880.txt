I really love this product. I think I’m on my fourth tube. I’ve struggled to find a mineral sunscreen that doesn’t dry out my skin, and this one is the answer. It’s soothing and moisturizing, providing a soft dewy finish. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is I would prefer a slightly thicker formula, but truly, it’s an excellent product.
