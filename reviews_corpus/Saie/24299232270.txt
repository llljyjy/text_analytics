I love this formula on my dry skin -- it feels hydrating and moisturizing and my skin is less tight & crinkly overall. Wonderful protection, wonderful ingredients. However, i read the reviews before purchasing so I knew there might be some separation due to the oils. When I received the sunscreen, I opened it up and sure enough -- there was separation. Also, the top didn’t want to dispense anything, even after lots of shaking. Luckily I had cotton swabs nearby to stir the product and apply. And that’s what I’ve been doing ever since! This would be fine except I can’t take it with me to apply on the go. What a shame.So fix the dispenser. Give it a little mixing bead or something. Improve the packaging so I can keep using this amazing stuff. Great sunscreen, bad packaging
