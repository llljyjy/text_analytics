BEST THING EVER!! i have super dry and sensitive skin and this goes on beautifully! Yes it has oils in it so it willseparate when it comes out of the bottle but it’s not like one can’t blend it in! I use my fingers and wow gives me the most beautiful “clean girl” glow. Been using it for a year now and I cannnot get enough of this stuff. (it does have a smell to it but it’s also a mineral sunscreen so it’s expected) 12/10 I WILL never stop buying it beyond obsessed BEST PRODUCT FOR DRY SENSITIVE SKIN
