I wanted to love this product so badly! After using for almost two weeks Iâ€™ve developed blackheads on my cheeks, chin and around my nose. As someone with dry skin, especially in the winter, I thought perhaps the greasier consistency would be beneficial.. unfortunately I was mistaken. This product may work great for some, but I wanted to ensure that firer purchasers were aware of the risk factors. Mixed emotions.
