I got this through Influenster, and I was beyond excited. I’ve tried and loved many products by Dr. Jart throughly out the last 10 years, and they never disappoint. This BB CreAm with SPF 40 is no different, and I. Fact came to me at a time I was looking for just such. It blends well, it matched my skin well, and it’s even worn well all day through work and face masks, traveling, etc. I’ve not noticed any cake face, and it holds up great to sweating. However, I can’t recommend it because this company tests on animals. At this day in age, it’s not necessary and my heart can’t situate it ethically to ever buy this again. I wish they would go cruelty free. Id wear it all the time! It looks so natural! So great, but I won’t buy it again
