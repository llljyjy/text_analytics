I was skeptical about this at first -- is it great as foundation? sun screen? is it soothing enough? But holy crap, this stuff is amazing. So my skin barrier is really thin -- I’ve used too many actives/ acne products and its really dried my skin out. I have little bumps everywhere and I’m repairing my skin by not exfoliating and using actives and different ingredients so much. I have foundations, concealers, and sun screen that I use normally when my skin is ’normal’ and not irritated. Even then, it does eventually settle into lines/ look dry depending on the day. This stuff however, is so so so good. Wow. Even on my damaged skin right now, its not settling into any dry areas or emphasizing any active acne or hyperpigmentation. It truly looks like a veil or color on your skin -- no texture, dryness, redness, darkness. I haven’t even powdered my face, and it looks so balanced - not too oily, or dry. Just super realistic skin, yet it looks flawless. I don’t understand this magic.It looks a bit pasty at first but you really need to let it warm up on your skin, so just wait 15 minutes. For reference, I have light-medium yellow-olive toned skin. I love the green hint in this product because it matches my olive tones perfectly. I am not buying any other foundation from now on.Oh! Also, it doesn’t crease under your eyes! The under-eye area looks completely smooth. And for a sunscreen, I’m so glad it doesn’t irritate my eyes or make me cry. 10 stars. Wow. So good for sensitive skin.
