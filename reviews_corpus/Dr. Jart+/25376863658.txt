I received this product from Influenster. So the good thing about this product is that it has SPF in it which is always good, but for me personally I didn’t  like how it felt and looked on my skin. It also made me break out a little bit. I mean everyone is different so I wouldn’t dismiss the good reviews it’s just my personal experience.. Eh..
