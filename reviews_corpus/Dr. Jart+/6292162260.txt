I was given this product to review and was very excited to do so as I’ve had great luck with Dr Jart+ products in the past! I found it easy to incorporate into my routine and combined with moisturizer and sunscreen it does help reduce pore size and gives a more even appearance without drying you out. However I do agree with other reviewers that I don’t love the pump and wish it was a bit different! nan
