I loved this product. I am going to buy a full-size. It took me a bit of getting used to. I wasn’t very good at blending it out before. But it completely evens out my skin. It doesn’t clear my redness but reduces it quite a lot. My skin also feels soo smooth. If it’s your first time buy a small jar to see if it will work for you. :) Love my skin
