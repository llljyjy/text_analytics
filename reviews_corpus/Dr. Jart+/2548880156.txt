I have tried multiple chemical sunscreens (supergoop play, supergoop unseen screen, supergoop glow stick, PTR moisturizer/sunscreen duo, Neutrogena dry touch, and more) and so far this has been my favorite. The consistency is quick drying, leaves no white cast (albeit I have fair skin), and has a good SPF. I also feel like I can apply a decent amount of product without making my skin feel greasy.  The only con is that it stings if it gets into your eyes, but thatâ€™s the case with most chemical sunscreens. nan
