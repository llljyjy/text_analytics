This set is great on all words for my skin which lately started to get redness and be more sensitive I used to have oily skin now my skin in normal in summer and dry and red in winter,the cica correcting treatment is thick but it blends very quickly and you just need a little bit goes a long way it has a much lighter feeling than you would expect the green color turns to beige then to translucent it takes all your redness away it feels very comfortable on the skin and it lasts all day long.The cica serum is amazing is shooting, calming, improves texture of the skin  does wonders with blemishes it also absorbs into your skin gas which I love.The gel cream is lightweight has a cooling effect it absorbs quickly without leaving the skin feeling greasy it keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day.I received this product for free from @Influenster and @Dr. Jart+ in exchange for my honest review. You wonâ€™t regret having this
