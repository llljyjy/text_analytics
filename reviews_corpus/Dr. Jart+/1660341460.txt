I use this and the camo drops to reduce the redness in my skin.  After cleansing and moisturizing, I dab some on my finger taps and rub it around before applying it to my overly rosy cheeks.  I love the camp drops as well but find I need the thickness of the color correcting treatment on my cheeks. It works like magic.  Top it off with a brush of translucent powder and I am good for the day. By By tinted moisturizers and redness
