I have to admit that I wasn’t sure about this product at first, but it blew me away! At first the color didn’t look like it would match my skin tone, but the moment I started blending it into my face it just melted into the perfect shade! The finish is so flawless I don’t even feel the need for concealer of powder over the top of it. This is my new every day go-to! I also really like the packaging- the tube it comes in feels and looks super high end, it isn’t flimsy or anything. I would and have recommended this product to anyone looking for a quick and easy everyday makeup routine! Surprised Me
