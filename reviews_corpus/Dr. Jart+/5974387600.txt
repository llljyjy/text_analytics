received this for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have uneven skin tone and redness from acne. I liked that this combination didn’t make my skin oily or feel like there was residue left. I can be very picky about how products feel on my skin since i have combination skin (oily and dry). In the short time that I used it I didn’t feel like it clog pores caused more acne which is a big plus for me nan
