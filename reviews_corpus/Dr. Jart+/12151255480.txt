Bought this sunscreen summer of 2021, as I was looking for a replacement after the Korean sunscreen drama. I actually tried the product years and years ago from a friend who bought it in china and it was only available in china, so I was very glad to see it in shops here in the United States. This has quickly become my tried & true facial sunscreen. Does not leave a white cast, product blends in seamlessly and without much effort, honestly it feels like your applying a light weight serum but without that crazy greasy feel. Usually I have a serum & moisturizer on under the sunscreen, and I have no issues with it feeling greasy at all. I also feel as though the pricing is amazing since you do get 3.38 oz in the bottle compared to other brands normal 1.7 oz. I highly recommend. Also if you are familiar with Krave beauty’s “Beet Shield” (P.S. an all time favorite before the Korean sunscreen drama) then you will love love love this one. Also I have facial hair, and have absolutely no problem with pilling, so it great for any genders! Highly Recommend
