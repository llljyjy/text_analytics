I have acne-prone skin and have tried using this a few times to cover up acne redness. My skin gets very oily throughout the day. One thing I liked about this correcting treatment is that it does indeed blend into your skin after dabbing and massaging it into your skin. However, I disliked how it does feel and looks slightly greasy on the skin. Not only that but it also clings to my dry patches like crazy and enhances my dry patches as well. Again, my skin is extremely oily but any dryness that I had was brought out by this correcting treatment. I really wanted to love this correcting treatment and desperately wanted it to be able to help tint my redness but I just canâ€™t stand the way it looks on my skin. I still think it would work well for others though just not me. Meant for some but not for me
