I have always wanted to try this so when it came to Sephora I was super excited. However, when I started to see all these negative reviews I became concerned. After reading the best way to use this product and when I received it in the mail, I tried it right away. It is a tricky product to use. Unlike other similar products the best way to use it is to warm it up on the fingers before spreading on the face. I find it definitely tones down the redness but doesn’t take it all the way away unless you apply lot’s of product. I would say that if you are fair skinned don’t  use a lot of product all at once cause then you get the instant orange. It’s best to layer thin layers if you want more coverage. Generally if you want a simple color corrector then this is not the product for you, but if you don’t mind the extra steps then it does the job. That is why I didn’t give this 5 stars. Good but a little work
