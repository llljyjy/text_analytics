I have been using this as my everyday sunscreen for over 6 months now. I have combination/oily skin and a darker skin tone. The sunscreen is pretty thick with a slight lemony scent - this disappears after the product has absorbed. When applying the sunscreen, it is easy to think it is too thick and will leave a major white cast. Keep working the product in, then let it absorb for ~5 minutes! No one has ever noticed a white cast on my face.Although I enjoy the product a lot, the price point is fairly high compared to other sunscreens. Would definitely recommend if youâ€™re looking for a mineral sunscreen! favorite mineral sunscreen
