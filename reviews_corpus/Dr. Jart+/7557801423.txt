I love this mask. I don’t usually enjoy sheet masks or anything of that sort because I feel like nothing is happening in 10 minutes and then it’s simply removed, but for some reason leaving this on for 40 minutes is so luxurious. Im going to say it’s not giving me life-altering results haha, but on a stressed day where I want a little self-care, this mask makes me feel like I have my life together. Throw it in the fridge for a couple hours before use and it makes your skin so smooth and plump afterwards. I really do love it and think all of us deserve a little pamper moment everyone once in a while. Love for self-care day
