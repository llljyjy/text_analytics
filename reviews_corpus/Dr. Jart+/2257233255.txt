i was hesitant about this at first but have come to see that this product works fabulously for my skin. i have a lot of redness and mild acne, and this plus a light dusting of powder foundation is a flawless velvet matte finish with as much coverage as i need. it layers well over other products, including sunscreen. it cut my daily makeup routine in half. a tiny bit goes a very long way, too. nan
