Not a huge fan. My skin did feel soft immediately after using, but that nice hydrated feeling doesn’t last long. The idea of needing to buy several masks a week to maintain that hydrated feeling doesn’t appeal to me, so I prefer masks that come in creams, so I can use some over time without worrying about needing to buy more right away or multiple at a time. On a positive note, I scared the crap out of my niece when she walked in on me chilling with the mask on :) Soft skin after use, but doesn’t last long
