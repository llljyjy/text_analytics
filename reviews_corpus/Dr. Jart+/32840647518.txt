First time trying this brand and I love it! This bb cream was light weight but still has coverage. I only wear bb creams as I hate the heavy feeling and this doesnâ€™t have that. It was a good shade match even with a bit of a summer tan. I wore this to a wedding and it wore down nicely as the night went on and the powder blush I had on blended nicely with it. I will purchase this in the future when I run out. Thanks Influenster for giving me this to try for my review. Love this product
