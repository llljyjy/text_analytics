It sinks in to my pores and exaggerates dry patches I didn’t know existed. If you wear a mask, 50% of this product will transfer to the mask and leave it orange. I recommend powering it. It feels like oily “makeup” on skin. If u scratch your face or wear glasses, it will leave streaks and marks and the skin will look patchy. The color is okay tho, it matches my East Asian skin tone and didn’t cause breakouts yet. nan
