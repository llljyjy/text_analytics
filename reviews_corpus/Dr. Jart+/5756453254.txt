I love kits like this, minis are my fav way to try new brands. I loved the cream which I want to buy full size, I felt like it helped my redness the most. The serum was nice too. The correcting SPF left an awful white case on my tan skin and I didnâ€™t like the texture. Great value, love this line (minus the SPF)
