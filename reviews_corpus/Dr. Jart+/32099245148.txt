So the redness relief works for me, I got this for when I get a little red here and there- my problem with it is how intensely thick and pasty it is. Rubbing it in takes a long time, getting it in your eyebrows or the roots of your hair isn’t easy to get out; and therefore I just don’t find it realistic to use as a dailt sunscreen. It also leaves a very primer-ey vibe on the skin which could be useful… but when not wearing makeup it just comes across as pasty and cakey. difficult to rub in
