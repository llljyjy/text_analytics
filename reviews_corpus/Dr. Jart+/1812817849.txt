One one hand, it does cancel out the redness that I have from my rosacea, and just being a very pale, pink faced person, and it does glide on smoothly which helps with the appearance of pores. But that’s where the positives end. It’s a very difficult product to work with. If I wear sunscreen underneath (which you should, this is NOT a standalone spf), the Cicapair CC Treatment either sits on top like a slick greasy mess or just flakes off. If you wear any makeup on top, since this reeeeealy makes your skin look one dimensional and lifeless, all of my makeup applies very patchy and pills. I’ve tried using the barest amount of this product, tried different makeup application methods like brush vs. fingers vs. BB sponge… nothing works. Tried different foundations, blushes, contours, and spfs- nothing works there either. On top of that, now I’m getting dry flaky patches on my chin and mouth area even though nothing else in my skin care regimen has changed and I’m still using a moisturizer. It looked good in the store, and I tried to make this work, but it’s going back Difficult to use
