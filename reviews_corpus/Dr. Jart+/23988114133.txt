I have been using this kit for about a week, during the day and at night. I noticed that I had some small spots on my face that are disappearing, slightly. The serum is excellent super absorbent, and the face cream has a fresh minty scent and leaves my skin feeling fresh and smooth. It absorbs well and does not leave greasy traces. For now it seems to me a fantastic product and I plan to use it also, on a burn scar to see if it works well Excellent redness kit
