This was everything I needed. Color Correction, SPF, and Moisture. However it is not that great. Despite being sold as a moisturizer it settles on top of the skin and made me very dry. I tend to have dry skin so all this wound up doing was make me look like a flakey ghost (which is crazy since I am very pale to begin with). I even doubled up my hydrators in the morning to maybe offset the dryness but nothing. May just use this as a spot corrector on days I donâ€™t do full face. Fell flat.
