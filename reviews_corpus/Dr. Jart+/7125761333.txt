This BB Tinted Moisturizer is a dream! It has medium coverage, just enough to cover up imperfections and you can easily build it up to cover up a blemish. It gives off a natural no-makeup makeup look. It stays well in place and plays well with any concealer. It does take a couple of minutes to set, but the results are worth the wait. It’s easy to blend out using a brush or a beauty sponge – I personally prefer a sponge because that’s what I am used to. Overall, I really love it! So good!
