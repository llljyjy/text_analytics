I am naturally extremely pale, like blend in with the walls pale, but I fake tan pretty often. On days where my tan is faded, and the redness in my skin shows through more, I tend to feel less confident, so I’ve been looking for a solution for ages. Generally in the summer I can achieve this with a tinted moisturizer but if/when it fades throughout the day and becomes patchy due to the pale skin showing through it kind of defeats the purpose. Since purchasing this I’ve experimented with it alone, under makeup, mixed with another moisturizer - and I always love it! On it’s own it cancels out just enough redness to be natural; under a light tint it allows my skin to look even and glowy. The best part is I barely use any! I bought the travel size a couple of weeks ago and have barely even put a dent in it. AMAZING
