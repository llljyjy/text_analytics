Loved the concept but hate the result. I am fair with neutral undertones, and this turned me kind of orange. It acted a lot like those ph lipsticks, developing into an orange/brown once applied. Uncertain how it might work for other skin tones, but hard pass for me. Shades of oompah loompah - hard pass
