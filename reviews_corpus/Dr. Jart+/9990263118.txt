This is easily one of the best makes Iâ€™ve used. The insane hydration was very noticeable and the mask felt really nice while wearing. The mask does move around but very minimally and I did not find it too bothersome. 10/10 would buy again and make this regular in my rotation. I did this at night and applied my moisturizer on too before bed and my skin felt so supple. Love it! nan
