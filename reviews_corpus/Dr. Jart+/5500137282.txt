Alrighty, W-O-W, I’m truly in awe of this new Dr. Jart Premium BB Cream with SPF 40. I never expected it to perform on ALL the levels, landing it at the top of my list of tinted SPF’s/moisturizers/foundations. When I pump the balm onto my hand I immediately feel how silky and velvety it is. I have been using my fingertips to apply to my face and it blends in beautifully and super evenly. My face is immediately soft as butter to touch!  The coverage is right around medium, but fairly decent for a BB cream. I don’t like the look of being “made-up” so it’s definitely adequate coverage for me. This Beauty Balm, a few swipes of mascara, and a touch of lip gloss will do the trick for me! One drawback for some could be the fewer color choices currently available. Luckily, this color happened to work for me, but there are neutralizing pigments within the balm that help the color adapt to your actual skin pigments. I really love the “finish” of this balm, as my skin has a satin-like feel after application vs. a quite oily feeling I have felt with other brands. I’m incredibly impressed with Dr. Jart’s SPF BB Balm. Since receiving it I haven’t been reaching for any other products I was using- it’s just Dr. Jart for the win! A Very Happy Surprise
