Upon opening it looks like it’s melting and the oils are separating. Does cover some redness but it’s not very moisturizing. Def wouldn’t put it all over my face or in place of a primer or moisturizer. ONLY for spot treating or maybe under eyes if you’re not already very dry… I wash expecting something more soothing, unfortunately too clumpy/dryish. Going to try it a second time and debate if I should keep or return. I feel like this would work great on light to medium skin tones that are very hydrated/oily. Too drying and product separates/messy
