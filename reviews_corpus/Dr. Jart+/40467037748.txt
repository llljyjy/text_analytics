I did receive this product for free for my honest review! The first thing that came to mind when I put this beauty balm on is how cooling it felt. This product is very light and I felt as if it started to hydrate as soon as I placed it on my face. The scent I felt was a tiny bit minty. The product did blend well. The color I received was perfect for my skin tone. My feel nice and soft and moisturized after applying this. I would buy this product again. Love! Refreshing
