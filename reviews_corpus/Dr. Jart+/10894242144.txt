This cream was amazing when I first started using it. It was great and evening out my skin tone (which is red prone) and gave me a nice glow. Sadly after a couple weeks of using it I opened it one day and it was completely separated. As in there was liquid in the jar and the remaining cream was much thicker and a weird consistency. I kept using it but the cream wasnâ€™t as easy to blend in and before and had a different finish. pretty good, doesn't last
