I like mud masks just fine and this definitely did the job of making my skin feel clean and fresh, but I did feel a little dry afterwards! I do live in a very dry climate but have normal skin, so this combo definitely affects how products work for me. Iâ€™d use it again but really be careful to moisturize heavily! nan
