I received this in exchange for my honest opinion. Not love at first use, but I would recommend it to anyone that wants a tinted moisturizer type product. If you want more coverage than light to medium, I’d look elsewhere. I have been a devoted Beautycounter Dew Skin user for three years so that’s the only product I have to compare this one to. This one is decently lightweight and provides light to medium coverage. I’d say it’s a thicker texture than dew skin, but still gives a nice glowy finish and lasts throughout the day (though you may need mattifying powder if your skin is oily or tends to get shiny throughout the day). It’s easy to blend with your fingers or brush. I also love that it has a high SPF for protection. I didn’t notice any white cast either. I’m giving it four stars because I really disliked the scent. The scent doesn’t last throughout the day, thankfully, but it is very apparent when applying. Also giving four stars because it isn’t as clean, ingredients wise, as I would like. Because of that, I’m not sure I would buy again. Pleasantly Surprised!
