A standout for rosacea. I have sensitive skin prone to redness of type 1 rosacea, snd I don’t like to cover it with foundation. I apply this over my daily sunscreen to even out my complexion. A little goes a long way, it’s important to warm this up and emulsify between your fingers and pat/dab it on rather than to smear and rub. I love it !! great product
