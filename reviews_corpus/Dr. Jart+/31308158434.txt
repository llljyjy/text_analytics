I personally love this product! It definitely lives up to the hype for me. It covers beautifully and blends nicely into my skin. I find it hard to find products that don’t make me look orange or extremely pale so I was super happy with this product. I can see how it wouldn’t be right for people with acne or very very pale skin however, as it isn’t full coverage and also has a very slight orange- ness to it. Works wonderfully for me though and makes it look as though I naturally have perfect skin (which I don’t) nan
