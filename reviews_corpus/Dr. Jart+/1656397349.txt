I love how luxurious the packaging feels. I’m also impressed with the coverage. It’s very light weight and you can definitely build it up as needed. One layer provides a sheer coverage. It has a slight sunscreen smell but I find it to have a menthol-like smell to it and I like it. It does have a dewy finish so I normally brush some setting powder over it because I have super oily skin. I wish there was a matte option! Lightweight
