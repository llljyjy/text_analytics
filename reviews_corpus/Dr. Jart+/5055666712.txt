Received a sample of this and decided to try it on my sensitive skin. Anytime I wear a mask for any length of time, my skin acts up: breakouts, redness, dry patches, etc. I tried the sample, making it last 4 days, and was so impressed. My cheeks cleared up and my skin looked amazing. I have since bought the full size and it’s awesome. I’ve seen reviews about the scent being too strong but I don’t even notice any scent at all. I’m a long time user of the Cicapair Cream so perhaps I’m just used to it? Anyway, this serum is now a permanent member of my daily skin care regime. Love it :)
