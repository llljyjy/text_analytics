Okay, so I’ve been using this product for about 3.5 weeks and I LOVE! I’ve been incorporating it as part of my skin cycle routine (s/o to Dr. Whitney Bowe) and it is targeting EVERYTHING HONEY!!! From the dullness, to the imperfections- it’s really been doing what it says. It’s a little spendy but this bottle will last a long time because a little product goes a long way!! I will definitely repurchase once I’m through. . Run, don’t walk
