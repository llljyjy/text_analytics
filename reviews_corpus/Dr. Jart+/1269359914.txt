This is my go-too for taming the mean-reds after years in the dry desert and exfoliating. I love this stuff as it blurs my stubborn age spots (grrrrr...) and fine lines while calming my redzones. It also does a terrific job as physical protection from the sun. I like to layer it over a moisturizing SPF. I find that it works best to let it warm a bit on my fingers and then press/blot it over my face. It took me a few tries to understand how much I like to use. So I suggest start sparingly and build up. Remember it has zinc in it which will alter your perceived skin tone so, again, try a few different layers.If I want a bit more color or highlight, I put a bit of Trish McEvoy’s “Smooth & Illuminate“ on my cheekbones or all over. But mostly, this magic stuff makes me look FABULOUS without foundation or tints. Goodbye to the red-meanies; Hello makeup free
