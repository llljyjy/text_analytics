Love this, but I get it’s not for everyone. In the photo the top pic is before, bottom is after. My rosacea had been acting up and this definitely toned it down. It’s thick, which may not be for everyone, but I loved how it was kinda like putty or spackle, filling in pores as I smeared it on. I can see how it would be chalky on a lot of people but it was great on my light to medium reddish skin. nan
