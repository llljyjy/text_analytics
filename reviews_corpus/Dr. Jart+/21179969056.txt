Love this product. Makes my skin look so smooth, plump and glowing. I am quite surprised how this turns orange on some people - I don’t get it because it’s a cream that blends right into the skin and adjusts to your skin tone - it doesn’t add colour.  Are you using the same product or is this something you purchased off amazon? It baffles me because it’s not supposed to pull orange. I recommend this. I got a sample and purchased the full size right away - it’s gorgeous! love this
