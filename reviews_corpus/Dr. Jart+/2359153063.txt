Absolutely excellent. I was using the sephora night cream before, but now that I use exfoliants I opted for this sleeping mask. It works so well after my retinol or glycolic acid treatments. I use it almost every night outside of that but just apply a little less so it isnâ€™t as thick. Leaves my skin super hydrated. Excellent
