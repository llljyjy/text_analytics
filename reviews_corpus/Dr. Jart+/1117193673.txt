I wanted to love this. The texture and finish are wonderful but it is too dark! Maybe Iâ€™m just ungodly pale but the color of this gives me flash backs of dream mousse middle school days. Dr jart v7 bb was the only bb cream from this brand that has matched my skin tone. Please bring it back :( Works great if it matches your skintone!
