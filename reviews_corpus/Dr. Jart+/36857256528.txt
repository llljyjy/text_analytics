My rosacea on my nose has flared up recently now that it’s summer and masks are not being worn as much at work...my redness is not severe but it’s reached a point where even foundation/powder doesn’t do much for it anymore....this color correcting treatment has been a lifesaver. Initially, I wasn’t a fan (likely because I applied it wrong) but after getting frustrated, I tried it again with really small amounts on my nose over the last two weeks and it’s been amazing at getting rid of the redness. I don’t even need any foundation afterwards. I still have to use oil blotting papers here and there since I have oily skin but it keeps my nose from being red for a good 6-7 hours. I’ve even started taking it to work and apply it an hour before I leave.Redness erasing aside, it smells good and feels good on your skin. I didn’t have any negative reaction to it and the fact that it is SPF 30 is another plus point. It’s a bit expensive but you can use it for a while. Remember, you just need a small amount, especially if you’re just targeting specific areas like the nose. I will definitely keep buying! Great for redness/uneven texture!
