The shade “range” doesn’t cut it but besides that the product sucks anyway. It’s to thick to use more than half a pump and it somehow has a white cast when I have the deepest shade. If this was a regular sunscreen but with a tint to prevent white cast that’s be amazing but it’s not that and it doesn’t do that. Also the fact that this is a revamped product and it’s this bad means it should’ve just been discontinued. nan
