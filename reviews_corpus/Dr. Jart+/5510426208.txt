This exfoliating serum could change up your skincare routine just as it did mine. I was firm believer that serums just aren’t for me. Personally when using them my skin would always be either too dry or too oily. Fortunately, when I use this exfoliating serum I don’t notice either of those two extremes. What I do notice is clear skin and shrunken pores! I’m super excited to keep this product as part of my skin care routine. My best advice is applying this product after cleansing using a cotton pad.This product was sent to me via Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Clear Skin Win
