I have a lot of redness, my skin’s super sensitive and on the dryer side of combination. I was very worried about how strong the scent was but was shocked how it didn’t irritate my skin or eyes at all. I find it makes my skin look really moisturized but kind of dries down after a couple of hours. I really love how it lessens my redness and makes my skin look more “normal“. my only issue with this is how much work it takes to rub in. i find putting it on immediately after moisturizer and patting it first, makes it a lot easier to spread and not pull at your skin too much. I’m not sure this would work so well for darker skin tones because it does have the white cast. No irritation and really lessens redness!
