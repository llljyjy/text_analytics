I have a very low maintenance makeup/skincare routine. I typically do not use any sort of foundation or tinted moisturizer however I have always been interested in finding one that works for me. I just really like the barely there makeup. I think i could use more practice with this one. It wasn’t bad but I could tell I was wearing something on my face when looking at myself. I’m going to continue trying different application methods to see what works best. nan
