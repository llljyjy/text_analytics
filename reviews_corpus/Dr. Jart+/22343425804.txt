As I’ve said before, Dr. Jart is a reputable brand and one that I have seen many recommend. This mask is not bad or damaging to the skin at all. However $9 for one onetime use mask is a bit much especially when you can’t see immediate results. I’d say if you’re looking for a mask that gives this effect look elsewhere unless you love the brand and have money to spare Good product
