I was pretty excited to receive this product to sample. As an adult, I’m suffering from adult acne due to stress per my doctor. I’ve used this product every other day as instructed for about three weeks. I was expecting to feel a stinging or burning sensation but the peel was super gentle. Honestly I didn’t see any difference but I think it’s because I needed more time with the product. I intend to finish off the bottle and I’m very hopeful that it will help weigh my skin tone. nan
