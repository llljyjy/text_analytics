Utter fail for me. I’m sensitive leaning without breaking out over the thought of a new product. I tried this 3-5 times and then got the most bizarre huge pimple on my nose by my eye. Idk that I have ever had a blemish there and the PIH was awful. It didn’t quite ruin my wedding day, but she sure tried. 0/10 not even an enjoyable texture, super fragrances. Save yourself the drama, please! really- no!!!!
