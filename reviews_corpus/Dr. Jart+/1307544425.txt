I’m sorry I jus don’t like this. I bought it once before and returned it. I thought maybe I’ll give it another try and picked it up today. I remember why I returned it the last time. It just sticks to any texture on my face. Dry skin, sebaceous filaments. I rather save my money and get a drugstore green primer it works much better. 2nd time not the charm
