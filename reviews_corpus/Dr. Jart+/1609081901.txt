I loved this for a few days when I wasn’t wearing make up over it. A few days later it broke me TF out. To cover enough you have to layer it and the places you layer it on stay quite oily and sticky. Those blacks ended up breaking out a lot for me. It also made me look oily everywhere which was odd because overall I’m very dry other than my forehead. Very difficult to layer anything over it because of the dry sienna texture nan
