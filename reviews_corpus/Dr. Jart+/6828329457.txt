I’ve been using this serum for a couple weeks now. I’ve noticed that while I don’t see a visual change in my skin, it does feel much softer after applying it with my regular products. I love that it has a slight minty smell to it but doesn’t seem overwhelming or artificial. The only issue I really have could just be a problem with my specific bottle, but the pump tends to spray the product out rather than give nice drops. I usually drop serums on my face directly so as not to waste any product, but with this, I have to pump it into my hands and with how thin it is, a good amount of it runs through my fingers before I’m able to apply it to my face. nan
