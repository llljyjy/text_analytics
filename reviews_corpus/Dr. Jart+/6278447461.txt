I thought I would really love this product to counter the redness in my skin, but found that it made me look sort of grey even when just applying a little bit, and felt VERY heavy and thick on the skin. Also didn’t work as well as an SPF as other products I’ve used. The  scent is really nice, but I ended up returning this after the product completely separated in the jar into an oily mess. Not the worst product, but I feel there are better options for the price. nan
