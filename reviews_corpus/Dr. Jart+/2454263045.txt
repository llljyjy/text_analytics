I have visible redness on my cheeks that’s turning into the bane of my existence. I’ve tried doing skincare breaks, laying off irritating ingredients, nothing has been effective yet. So I hoped that this would mask the redness, while I try to fix it. And honestly it just didn’t do anything for me. Immediately it was slightly color correcting but just an hour later it disappeared. I’m disappointed bc it seemed so promising. Glad this has worked for others. I am giving it three stars bc it’s not irritating and the texture and finish are both really pleasant. didn’t do anything for me
