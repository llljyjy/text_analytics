This BB cream has a very creamy texture, it is very easy to apply and blends very well with your skin color.  It has a bit of a shiny finish but thatâ€™s ok because then it disappears when you apply the contour and the blush.  And the best of all is that the skin feels hydrated and is protected from the sun, in addition, it is long lasting. nan
