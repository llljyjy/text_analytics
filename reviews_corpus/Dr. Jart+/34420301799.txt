Absolutely amazing! Truly has the most natural skin like but not too skin like that you can still see all my unevenness, amazing coverage and super glowy which I love in my SPF. Seemed a little dark at first but then blended out and actually made my face match to the rest of my body especially in the summer. Iâ€™ve been using every day for my daily SPF on top of mymoisturizer since I have dry skin. Has replaced my Elta and Revision and Alastin and other ones I loved previously. I really really like it and would totally buy again! I received this from Influenster complementary for my honest review. Absolutely love!!
