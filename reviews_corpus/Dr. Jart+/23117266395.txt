I normally hate sheet masks, but this one was very comfortable for me. I usually find sheet masks to be bothersome. This one was very flexible and I enjoyed the protective sheets on either side of the mask which are removed when placed on the face. My skin felt smooth and soft. I would use this again. Lovely
