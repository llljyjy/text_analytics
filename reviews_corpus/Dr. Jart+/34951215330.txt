This product has reduced the texture of my skin significantly. Since I started using it I have been able to have a smoother look when wearing makeup. The only issue I have is the applicator. It makes it hard to apply to the face. I am a big fan of the drop lit tubes. But other than the applicator the serum really does the job. I received this product free to review and I will be purchasing it once I run out! Serum is great. Applicator could be better.
