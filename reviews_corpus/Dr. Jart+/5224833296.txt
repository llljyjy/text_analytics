First review. I know this gets raves so my two cents is negligible but for what it’s worth, this made me break out horribly. I have a very regimented skincare routine and this is the only new addition (I don’t wear makeup day to day) I wanted to try for summer. It has caused painful cysts on my face. I’m not allergic to anything and maybe it is a fluke, but I’m really disappointed. nan
