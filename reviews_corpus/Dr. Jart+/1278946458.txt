I received this item for free from Influenster for my review. I used it twice a day every day for a month. I have combination skin, normal with an oily t-zone, and enlarged pores on my nose. While using the serum my nose pores appeared smaller, and my t-zone was no longer oily. It did dry out the rest of my face, so overall Iâ€™d recommend it for oily skin types and would suggest to start using it once a day instead of twice. nan
