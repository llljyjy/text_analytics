Over all really good product I had a really hard time dealing with the pores and black heads I’ve always had and I’ve been using it for about 3 days now and I’ve noticed my nose is less oily and my pores are smaller than they usually are. The only reason I don’t LOVE it is the smell it kinda has a minty smell to it. It’s really light and isn’t anything you should be concerned about but it’s not my favorite smell. Was a little weirded out by the oil mixed in but over all really good product. Good product, weird mint smell.
