This is my holy grail product. I’ve been using it for years - my sister would bring it for me from Thailand. Then, I started ordering it on a k-beauty website, but they stopped carrying it. I’m THRILLED that I can get it from Sephora now!I have sensitive, breakout-prone skin, and this has never ever caused any problems. I get compliments on my skin all of the time when I wear this, which is everyday. It gives an instant glow, and I use this instead of foundation. Holy grail product
