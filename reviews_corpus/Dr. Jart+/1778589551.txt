I’ve been using this mask as the last step in my routine, 2-3 times per week for about 3 months now and I absolutely love how much it makes my skin glow in the morning, and that it’s helped keep breakouts at bay. It’s also great for healing if I do end up w minimal breakouts. Overall this was a necessity for me during the winter months as I have pretty dry skin, but I’ll continue using throughout the year. A little goes a long way, 3 months in and Im barely halfway through the jar. Love this stuff and would absolutely repurchase! nan
