as someone with severely sensitive acne prone skin, finding a sunscreen that worked was an absolute chore. im SO glad i found this one…doesn’t break me out AT ALL which is such a rare find for me. of course there is a slight white cast but im pale as a ghost already so i don’t even notice. also looks incredible under makeup which was another thing that was important to me, in fact i find my makeup looks better with this than it does without. its definitely pricey but for me, so worth it. nan
