I recieved this as a product sample through Influenster. I have been using this pore remedy for a week and have not noticed a change in my skin.  I have large noticable pores on my nose that I struggle with getting to clear up. I do however like that it light and has a pleasant scent. No skin irritation or reactions. I will continure to use this and see if it hekps long term. Giving it a chance
