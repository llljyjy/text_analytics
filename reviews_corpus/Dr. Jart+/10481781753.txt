i almost never buy high end makeup or skincare unless it’s necessary, but this is worth your money. as someone with acne scars and redness and pigmentation, sometimes i don’t want to wear makeup but still want to feel confident. this is the PERFECT solution. it goes on green and matches your skin tone while covering up redness. it basically turns beige, without looking like a foundation. it’s smooth, and dewy an leaves your skin looking so good. not to mention the spf in it! really such an amazing product and i will be buying it in the full size soon! YES. YES. YES.
