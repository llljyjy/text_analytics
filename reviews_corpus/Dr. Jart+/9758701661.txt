I don’t really have redness to correct, but I do have light medium skin with olive undertones, and I’ve been on a long-term quest to find a one-and-done sunscreen /skincare product that offers light coverage to replace foundation and suits my undertones (every tinted sunscreen on earth pulls orange or pink on me, every SPF tinted moisturizer type thing is way too much coverage to use the full 3 finger ammt as my only SPF.) This is a real contender! It evened my skin tone wonderfully, and while it feels heavy going on, it doesn’t look or feel too heavy even after applying the full amount. I deducted a star because I’m not a fan of the jar packaging, and a perfect world it would self-set and I wouldn’t need to powder over it to get it to stop feeling tacky. But I’m really excited to have this in my rotation! Great one and done for light Olive skin
