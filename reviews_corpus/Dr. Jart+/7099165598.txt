I really wanted to love this product based on what I heard from tiktok. Unfortunately, my product was purchased online and it almost appeared as it was previously used??. The smell is too overwhelming. I tried it once and The consistency on my face was so uncomfortable, thick and heavy. The colour did blend nice with my skin tone but I couldnâ€™t get over the smell and how gross it felt against my skin. Will not be purchasing again :( Disappointed
