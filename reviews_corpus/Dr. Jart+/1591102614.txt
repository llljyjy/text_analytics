I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I absolutely love this bb cream! I recommend it to anyone I can. It feels so smooth on your skin and blends super easily. Perfect for days when you want coverage, but don’t want it to feel super heavy. It’s moisturizing yet still conceals blemishes, all while providing SPF which is the most important part of skin care. I will absolutely be adding this to my makeup routine. Absolutely love this!
