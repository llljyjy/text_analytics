If redness is your main skin concern you will love this product. Not only do I have redness across my face but I turn red/flush when I feel any emotion and it’s very embarrassing. So far I’ve been wearing foundation to cover it up as tinted moisturizers don’t do the trick. I got this and omg it looks weird for the first minute but after my skin settled from the rubbing, my face had almost no redness at all! Most importantly I sell to customers on zoom and this has saved me from embarrassing myself on camera. Even at the gym and doing other activities where I turn red, the redness is gone. It really makes a difference.This is not a moisturizer or makeup substitute. I do not layer this with foundation. It dries a bit tacky so I powder it when needed.Only con is if you have acne it clings a bit to your breakouts and raised pores.See my before/after applying the product in the same lighting. If you turn red easily this is a HG
