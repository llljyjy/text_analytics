I love this so much than the jar version. I’m about to buy this for the second time so that’s saying something. Since the pandemic, I just don’t wear foundation anymore but this is perfect for “no makeup” makeup with just a bit of color correction. One star off because the packaging is terrible and messy. I’d love this with a pump instead. I’ll probably try to repackage it myself. nan
