I wanted to love these products so bad. I struggle with redness and wanted to find consistent products to treat these issues. I find the color corrector to have a super strange texture and make my skin issues look worse. The serum is nice but itâ€™s such a small amount that I used it for a month and am already out. No crazy differences either. The cream is decent but not crazy about putting essential oils on my skin. Good value set but subpar products. Just ok.
