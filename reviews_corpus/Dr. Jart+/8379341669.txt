To those with red skin, rosacea, or just too much pink in their face for their liking: this is your holy grail. I canâ€™t even tell you how many times I have repurchased this product. Not only does it blend beautifully into my skin and give me an all over glow, it has SPF in it! I recommend patting it gently on your face and letting it sit for a few minutes. And remember, a little goes a long way! nan
