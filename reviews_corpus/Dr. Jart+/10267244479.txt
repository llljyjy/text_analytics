I use RX tretinoin cream so my skin is super dry in the winter. This year I started using dr jart ceramidin cream and it just wasn’t cutting it. I read on an online forum to try this serum, I’m not a huge fan of serums but I am loving this. I was with a friend and was asked I went on vacation because I was tan. Took me a minute to realize it was because it was really helping the redness as well as moisturize. actually works!
