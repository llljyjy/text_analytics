Dr. Jart Camo Drops remind me of a “lighter, better, serum” version of the Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment cream from the Cicapair line.  I prefer this though and texture of this is much more lightweight like a serum, while the cream was thicker but provided a lot more coverage. Both help cover redness, has SPF, and adjusts to your skin. The Camo Drops is much more suited for everyday wear, weightless, breathable, buildable, blendable, and easy to touch up!! Works great for my normal to dry, sensitive skin. nan
