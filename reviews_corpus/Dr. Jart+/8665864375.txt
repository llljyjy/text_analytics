#Influenster #Voxbox for the win on this win! I got the #cicipair #rednessreducingkit 109% free. In return I give my honest review. That’s a no brainer. Especially for products like this. Steps to apply the three products in this kit are as simple as they come. Pat serum in, massage cream in, and in the am follow with the cc cream. I am absolutely obsessed with this product!! It leave my skin feeling like a goddess. Not oily or tacky after. Which has been my issue when trying new face moisturizers. Refreshes my and genuinely reduces any redness and irritation going on. Having PCCOS facial hair facial is an unfortunate battle of mine. And with that battle moisturizing is a MUST if you don’t want to deal with ingrown hair. These products combined is a dream worker for Mt particular routine and situations. It keeps my skin balanced not over oily or dry. In return if an ingrown hair does happen the serum quickly soothes, the cream moisturizes the area to keep inflan down. Then the magic of the last cream blows my mind. You apply an icky cream color cream to your face. Not only does make your skin feel super hydrated but as you massage it in the green turns to a beige neutralizing any reduce and correcting the color. I’m not sure the color range in which it will blend, but it blends flawlessly to my face. To too that magic the cream is the perfect color corrector AND primer!! No more spending extra money on fancy primers. Why would you when this is literally skincare/primer!! Seriously considering delving more into this particular brandin Must Have
