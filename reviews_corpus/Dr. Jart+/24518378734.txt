I got this from Influenster to give my honest review. I need to say I am beyond impressed. I have dry and sensitive skin, which makes it hard for me to find an acid peel that doesn’t make me feel like my skin is burning so bad that I won’t have a face anymore. I was skeptical about this product and thought it would destroy my skin. One day I was brave enough to try it and, for my surprise, it not only didn’t burn my skin or gave me any redness but it made my skin feel smooth and glowy even with only one use. I couldn’t believe that I had found a multi-acid that would work so well. I like how the instructions were written too, they are easy and simple to follow. It was easy to add this product to my routine and I would definitely buy this product. Worth trying it
