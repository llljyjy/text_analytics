For my fair-skinned people, this is a no go. It doesnâ€™t blend past a lightish beige tone which was still a shades darker than my skin. I was definitely a bit disappointed. I ended up giving this away to someone whose skin tone is more suitable for this product, and they appear to like it (hence the 3 stars). Fair-skinned people - avoid this!
