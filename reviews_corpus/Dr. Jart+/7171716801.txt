Incredible product! Helps blend redness so well. Only a very small amount is needed so the container goes a long way. I start with the tiniest drop and then layer if needed. Perfect for applying before foundation to help cover redness. I got one as a sample years ago and then could never find it in Canada again so I was so happy to see it back!! Incredible for covering redness!
