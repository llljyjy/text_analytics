LOVE this product!! I’ve actually gone through two already. This balances out my skin tone perfectly - gets rid of any redness and gives the coverage of a medium/sheer foundation without the heaviness (which I love bc I have a lot of acne and feeling like theres a layer of something on my face drives me crazyyyy). Some days I use this underneath my usual foundation, it gives me that flawless base to work with and none of the usual imperfections peak through (bonus points for spf!). But this can definitely work as a stand-alone foundation. While it definitely wouldn’t be considered “full coverage”, with a little powder I get TONS of compliments on my skin when Im wearing this as my ‘foundation’. If you’re still not sure, go with the mini one! I bought the mini one first to be careful and went through the whole thing. nan
