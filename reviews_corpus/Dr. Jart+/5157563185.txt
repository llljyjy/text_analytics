I love this beauty balm!! The coverage is amazing, I would argue it’s just as good as my full coverage foundation. I like the feeling of double protection with my regular SPF on my bare face, and this on top. It looks great even at the end of the day. I have sweated, cried, etc in this and still looks good and doesn’t come off (or in any spots that it does, it’s not obvious). I fully intend on buying this and keeping it in my go-to product stash once I run out. Amazing!
