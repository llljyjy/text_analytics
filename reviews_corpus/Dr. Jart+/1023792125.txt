This product is okay, but I definitely don’t think it lives up to the hype. It does correct redness pretty nicely, but it’s super greasy and never feels like it absorbs into my skin. My foundation doesn’t sit well on top of it, so I mainly use it for when I just need a little cover-up without makeup. I won’t repurchase. Doesn't live up to the hype
