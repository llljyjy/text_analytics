My makeup artist used this on my wedding day and I was so blown away with the coverage of my redness. I ordered a jar for myself shortly after and it’s quickly become a holy grail in my skincare/makeup routine. I don’t even need to use green concealer if I put this on under my makeup. The SPF is an added bonus! Holy grail for redness!
