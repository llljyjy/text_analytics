I received this for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have uneven skin tone and redness. I liked that this combination didnâ€™t make my skin oily or feel like there was residue left. My favorite part of the pack was definitely the CC cream. I love how it evened out my skin tone. It made it so that I could wear less concealer/foundation on problem areas of my skin Loved the CC cream!
