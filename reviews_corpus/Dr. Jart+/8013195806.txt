I received this free for testing purposes. I’m a little new to the bb cream world so when I got this I noticed it was a bb balm which was interesting to me because I did not knew this was out there. Packaging is so cute with spf 40. I’d say if you just wanted to have a nice natural look without all the foundation coverage then this is perfect. Kind of reminds me of the the Selena Gomez tinted moisturizer but with a little more coverage. It has great benefits for the face like niacinamide. The claims are hydrates, conceals, and protects and definitely agree with them. Very hydrating which is best for my skin bc it’s a bit dry. It does say it’s buildable but I don’t see a difference in the coverage from building or up. This will come in handy for those I’m going to let my face take a makeup break days. Definitely recommend this. Hydrating
