I was extremely excited to try this product after looking and reading amazing reviews on Google and especially after I saw their TikTokâ€™s promotions. After purchasing the sample size at home I was quickly disappointed and frustrated as a women of color. You see- I grabbed less then a dot m to put this is perspective it was about less that a penny size and rubbed it between my fingers to get it ready for my face. After PATTING not ribbing- I could most defiantly see a white cast on my face. I have olive/ tan skin- so I was truly hoping this procure would work since I also have red undertones. To my disappointed this product only works on FAIR or WHITE skin. Truly disappointing I shall be returning this item back! DOES NOT WORK IF YOU DONT HAVE FAIR SKIN
