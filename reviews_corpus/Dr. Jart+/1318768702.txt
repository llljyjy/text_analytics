Worst of the worstâ€¦ even after 3 serums and excellent moisturizer this peeled my dry skin terribly. My Huz noticed it at a social gathering and after I tried unsuccessfully  to wash it off, we had to go home so I could do a full court press to get it off. Worst sunscreen ever. definitely not for dry skin
