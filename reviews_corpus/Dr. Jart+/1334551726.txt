I will say, for a watery type of serum I wish this didn’t have a pump because you do have to use a light hand. Absorbs into my skin easily though without pilling, AND this is the ONLY product that I’ve ever tried, including my HG Paula’s Choice toner and Dr. Gross peel pads that continuously purges my pesky sebaceous filaments. I hate hate hate them as I have large pores just in general, and literally this serum is the only thing I’ve ever used that’s kept my skin clear of blackheads and sebaceous clogs simultaneously. I don’t have acne, but if you want fine texture care this stuff is fantastic. CLEARS SEBACEOUS FILAMENTS
