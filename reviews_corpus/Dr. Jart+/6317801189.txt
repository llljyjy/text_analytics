I received this product complimentary to try and give my honest review. After using this product for a couple of weeks I can honestly say it makes my skin feel really soft and smooth. I have pretty sensitive skin and this did not irritate or break me out. My pores feel and look smaller and my skin feels a bit more hydrated. While it did seem to fill my pores I am not sure it really did any exfoliating, but overall I do recommend. made my skin very smooth
