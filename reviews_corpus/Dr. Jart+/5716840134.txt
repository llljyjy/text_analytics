I have been using natura bisse’s sheer cream for YEARS!! With over $200 a jar this stuff is BETTER! The natural finish is amazing, a little goes a long ways! It’s light weight with medium coverage. I have super sensitive skin and this stuff is magic! I got a sample and I have been hooked ever since! My new SPF + Tinted moisturizer plus, with it being the transitional color you can use it all year long and never worry about throwing away a shade! BEST BEST BESR
