One of my favorite eye creams. The texture is super soft and almost feels velvety. It deeply moisturizes all around my eyes without looking oily or going on thick. Many complain about the scent in reviews but I actually find it pleasing. I also have sensitive skin that likes to break out with whiteheads and this has not caused any of that. In the end, Iâ€™ve tried some other eye creams but I always end up coming back to this one. My Eyes Love This Cream
