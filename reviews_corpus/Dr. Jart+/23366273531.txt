The past few years I’ve developed the most sensitive skin of anyone I’ve met and this has been a game changer! When I tell you I’ve tried so many brands that are supposed to be for sensitive skin and even then,  I still had issues. I tried Tatcha, glow recipe, drunk elephant, Dermalogica, Rodan & fields, etc and all caused increased redness, stinging or burning. This is the FIRST product I’ve tried that has calmed my rosacea redness down and it’s noticeable even just after a few nights in a row! Like some other reviews said, a little goes a long way. I haven’t experienced any pilling but it is a bit tacky which is fine since I only use it when I  sleep. I use this after using the rest of the Cicapair line (enzyme foam cleanser, calming mist, tiger grass serum, then this). In the morning, I’ve been using Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E and my skin has never looked better! Can’t wait to see how much more improved it will be after longer use. Game changer for redness/rosacea!
