I use this daily. There is some neutral tint to it after it dries down, but definitely not foundation-level or even bb/cc level coverage, but it’s a high quality color corrector and replaces primer for me. It works for me on its own as well on days where I don’t want foundation. I do use serum and moisturizer before applying this product, but only because it’s my routine skincare. I don’t find it drying. Great color corrector and no white cast SPF
