It did a good job at covering up the redness. However, it was grainy on my skin. Maybe it will be different for others. I think it’s worth trying. There is a smell which is almost like a lemon scent. It wasn’t bad but I prefer no fragrance. I also don’t like SPF in other products. I like to have my SPF separate. I will be returning this unfortunately. nan
