After finishing 2 rounds of Accutane, my skin has become SO sensitive and turns red easily. I splurged on this product to try to combat the redness and it did not disappoint. It hides my redness well and is fun to apply. Just make sure you learn how to put it on correctly! Eliminates redness like a charm!!!!
