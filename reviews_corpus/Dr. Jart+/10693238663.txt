I received this product for review purposes. It is a mud mask in a sheet mask format. I cna see how it can be a littel wasteful since you have the packaging and the plastic covers on each side of the mask but I did like that is was almost mess free. It did leave a bit of residue that i had to rinse off but compared to other mud masks it was hastle free. I didnâ€™t notice much of a difference but i also used it once. I would be willing to purchase again and try it again nan
