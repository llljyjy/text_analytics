I think this is a beautiful calming and hydrating spray! I have acne prone sensitive skin and use this over foundation or bare skin for a little extra hydration and glow. They spray bottle is a little bit annoying it does spray a very fine mist but it could be more of a delicate wider area spritz . I tried other mists (Mario badescu and avene) and this is my fave so far Hydrating and calming Indeed
