The packaging is nice and the pump dispenses the perfect amount of product. I found it easy to apply to my face and the color matched my complexion well. My skin felt hydrated and looked smooth. I took off a star because I noticed it gave me a white cast on my face, most likely due to the titanium oxide. nan
