I have tried many other BB Creams/foundations but this has got to be my favorite. It has a Dewey finish and definitely would recommend for anyone with dry skin. A little bit goes a long way. It is unscented which is nice because I don’t like scented makeup. Plus it’s nice that it has 40 spf. I would 100% recommend. I would buy again and again
