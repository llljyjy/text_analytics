If you have dry skin, this is not for you. I was so excited to find and try this as I have very redness prone skin and heard this worked for a lot of people...it ain’t for me. It’s very very thick and hard to apply and spread, and remember that you also need a ’generous’ amount for full spf protection. I could barely spread just a tiny dot of this on my cheeks without it flaking. It does color correct redness so it lives up to its name, but definitely not what I expected. Wish it was more lotion-like instead of a thick cream, but that’s just me! NOT for dry skin
