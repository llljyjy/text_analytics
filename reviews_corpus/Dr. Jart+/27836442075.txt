I was super skeptical about this product when I first got it. I didn’t think I would see any major results from on it. I’ve been using a customized curology for around a year now and didn’t think anything else would compare! I was so wrong though! I used this in conjunction with my curology using the skin cycling method and saw dramatic results! It not only cleared up the random breakouts I still occasionally get, but it majorly improved the texture of my skin. For the first time I feel like I actually have glowy looking skin. I did forget to use the pore remedy for a few days and could see a big difference after using it consistently for 2 weeks and then not using it but still continuing with the rest of my normal routine. I also was slightly worried it would be too strong but I feel like it’s been the perfect level to make changes to my skin without being overly harsh. Overall, I love this product and will be purchasing once I run out! A new must-have in my routine!
