I really enjoyed this formula. It gave me perfect coverage, felt very lightweight and very hydrating. My only problem was the color I received complimentary from Influenster didnt match me very well so I didn’t get to truly wear it out and about. I can’t wait to find my shade and give it a real chance!! Loved it just need the right shade!
