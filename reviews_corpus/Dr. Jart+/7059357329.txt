Okay so I had 2 samples of this and really liked it! Bought the full size and for some reason the product is totally separated?? My samples did not look like this so I know something is wrong. This picture is after I majorly shook it up to try to get it to blend but itâ€™s still separating and surrounded my clear/oily liquid..maybe I got a bad batch? The smaller container is the sample size I gave where you can see the clear difference in consistency. Gonna be returning this sadly! Consistency issues?
