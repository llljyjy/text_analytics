omg! I really loved how this mask felt on my face!! The ampoule felt very nice while I was lathering it all over - I love how I can actually feel it on my face rather than just sinking into my skin. The rubber mask was cool at temperature which made me feel so relaxed and soothing I had to try it right after work! Iâ€™ve been getting Laser Treatments done for my acne scarring and thought this would be nice to help brighten and refresh my skin. Excited to see how my skin looks and feels tomorrow morning. LOVE IT!
