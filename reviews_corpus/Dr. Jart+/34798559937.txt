I was worried about how this would work with my skin tone and with dry patches but it works great. It doesnâ€™t provide as much coverage as I thought it would on bright red acne spots but it does even out my skin tone for the most part. I use this after moisturizing and priming my face to stop it from clinging to dry patches. If I need more coverage I use a concealer to spot correct areas. It is a pricey but a little product goes a long way. nan
