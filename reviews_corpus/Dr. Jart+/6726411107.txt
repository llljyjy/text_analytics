This really is so amazing! Iâ€™ve never tried a product like this before so I was skeptical if it would work. When I put it on, instantly my redness went away and my skin tone evened out and was not red at all. The only thing I would say, if you have dry skin this may not be something you love since it does leave a matte finish (for me). Maybe putting a hydrating moisturizer would help. I used the tatcha dewy skin before applying this and I was still matte but I will continue to use it! really good!!!
