So I have been reading some of the reviews for these masks and I see a lot of people saying how they slip on and off and I feel like it might be something y’all are doing wrong because I have used these masks consistently over 5 times and have never had that problem, even for the full duration for 40 minutes. Anywayyy, if you’re contemplating about getting these masks get them, cause they’re worth the moneyyy. I have tried the hydration one and the soothing one and I keep buying them over. In my opinion they have elevated my skincare and have giving me great results after every use so I’m probably never going to stop buying them lol. The next one I’m going to try is the firming one. nan
