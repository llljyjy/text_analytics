would not recommend for anyone with sensitive skin or anyone heavily exposed to direct sun. despite the non-greasy feel, no-white cast, and overall glow it provides, this sunscreen was very irritating on my skin. i am only able to tolerate it under makeup. the strong lavender fragrance definitely makes this sunscreen more harsh on the skin than any other chemical sunscreen iâ€™ve tried. irritating + stinging sensation
