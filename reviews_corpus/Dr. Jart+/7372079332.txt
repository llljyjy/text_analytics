used this for the first time yesterday & I can honestly say I love it. By the end of the day, my face is normally oily, slick and tired looking. after hrs of being out my face still looked fresh and clean without the shine it usually has. I did also use Rare Beauty primer under it (also for the first time) and a pressed powder (same kind I always use) on top. It seems that Iâ€™ve finally found a combination that works for me. very highly recommend! New to this product/product line and I'm loving it
