This product is really not for me. It is exceptionally thick and hard to spread. It feel very greasy and dense on the skin- like a thick full coverage foundation. The colour is absolutely awful. I’m sure it’s good for some skin tones, but it you have light skin this looks awful. It looks more cakey than foundation, and I was not able to blend it in fully without it looking streaky and poorly blended. The green tone is also way too strong for my skin tone. I look sickly when I have this on my face. For reference, I’ve added a picture of how it looks fully blended on my wrist. Additionally, this mini size is literally as big as an eye cream. Beware how tiny it is before you buy! nan
