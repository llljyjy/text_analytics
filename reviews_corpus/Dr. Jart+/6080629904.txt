I am: -south Asian with medium-deep skin tone-extremely sensitive skin-oily skin in summer/combo skin in winterI usually put one thing on my face after my shower. In the winter it’s Fresh Antioxidant Serum. In the spring/summer it’s a sunscreen. I prefer my sunscreen to be as runny as possible because I will breakout if it’s too thick. And I prefer matte finish or I will look oily and oily skin also makes me breakout. My ideal sunscreen keeps my face as dry as possible to not get breakouts because those scars last like 3+ years. It’s also mineral because my face is very sensitive.I really loveeee this sunscreen! It smells sooo good, like oranges! When I tested it at Sephora, my face tingled a bit because I have sensitive skin. But I didn’t care, I love the smell so much I bought it thinking maybe my face will get used to it. I wore it the next day and my skin didn’t burn. Yayyy! So I’ll be keeping this.My skin is combo in the winter, extremely oily in the summer because I sweat quickly. I put it on in the morning and a few hours later, some areas of my skin like my forehead has dry patches. However I don’t care about that because later on when it gets hot, I’m so sweaty, and the dry patches go away.  So this sunscreen is perfect for oily skin! I’ve seen matte finish sunscreens but they usually have a tint, and that tint will rub off on my clothes, so I steer away from it. Also some tinted sunscreen cause breakouts for me. I am brown skinned and this sunscreen does not leave a white cast!!!!!!! I chose this sunscreen at the end but some runner ups were: (mineral for medium toned oily skin)-Supergoop Mineral Sheer Screen: no tingle, good for sensitive skin-Supergoop Mineral Matte Screen (tinted): no tingle, good for sensitive skin-Tatcha Silk Sunscreen Mineral: some tingleI highly recommend for oily skinned people looking for a dry finish! I have sensitive skin, but sensitive skinned people should test this out first. I rate this item 10/10! ONLY FOR OILY SKINNED PEOPLE! NO WHITE CAST!
