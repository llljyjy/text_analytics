This is the first time I’ve used Dr. Jart’s Beauty Balm, and I’m truly impressed! I have been using BB creams for over a decade, and I’ve had my tried and true for almost that long. But this one has surpassed it by SO much! It took me a few tries to get the application I liked down, but once I did *chefs kiss.* It goes on so smoothly and evenly, my skin glows and feels so soft, and stays perfectly all day. I love that it’s so natural and I don’t feel a need for foundation. It has such a light, clean, almost lemony-citrusy smell. I’ll be loyal for sure. Love!
