I can see how this works for some people but it felt too thick and looked yellow on my skin. I over applied at first try so then applied lighter which was better but still not great. Also by applying such a thin layer, I’m pretty sure it wasn’t enough for the spf 30 to work. Not great for my combo/aging skin. Plus rubbed off on everything! Wouldn’t repurchase and won’t force myself to use it all up, at least I bought the small size. Didn’t work for me
