As the description says, very much suited for sensitive skin. The exfoliant is watery, lightweight — comfortable enough to use everyday (I suggest at night since it is still a chemical exfoliant) and layered underneath your other skincare steps. I think this is a good introductory step for those hesitant to try AHA or BHA at a stronger level. One con is the pump packaging — sometimes it leaks and the cap isn’t very secure.Everyday-use did balance my oiliness a bit, but I think I will stick to my AHA 2x a week for more targeted pore-concern and added strength — and because I like to use other serums geared towards hydration and elasticity. nan
