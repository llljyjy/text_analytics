the product was submitted for a candid review by influencer and DR. Jart+.   I really loved the product, its coverage is light, but it leaves the skin very beautiful, it does not feel very heavy, nor did it leave my face with an oily sensation,Since having mixed skin there are formulas with sunscreen that leave me with that feeling, and I donâ€™t leave this one.I think that the only bad point that I find is that there are very few shades available, and although it suits me well, I feel that many people it is a problem that will prevent them from trying the product. nan
