Firstly I want admit bad color range. I have very light skin tone with warm yellow undertone (MAC NC15, Estee Lauder 1W1) and this BB cream is not adapting to my skintone. It has more neutral cool tone. Next shade Light to medium is more on the Medium side than on Light.Otherwise it great for my dry skin. Bad shade range
