I tried the Cicapair green balm, and it didn’t work for me. However this Cicapair Tiger Grass Cream is a staple and I cannot go without it. If you struggle with facial redness, have very sensitive skin or rosacea, I highly recommend this based on personal experience. My face is super sensitive to sun, heat, hot water, food, etc. this cream feels amazing on my skin, soothes my sensitive redness, and gives my skin relief while hydrating it. It feels like a moisturizing barrier. I literally can’t go a day without it. My Go-To For Redness Relief
