I was sent this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I had never actually heard of it before, so I’m even happier that I got it because now I love it! I use it almost daily. I don’t like wearing much face makeup, but this goes on so light that it’s just enough coverage for a nice finish without looking like I painted my entire face. I also love that it has SPF to not only make my skin look healthy but to actually keep it healthy too! nan
