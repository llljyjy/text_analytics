I do like this product. But I really really wish it was unscented as it is quit fragrant for no reason. My other issue with it is that you do waste product, as the stuff in the tip of the pump dries out quickly and you have to pump more product out than you want to in order to remove the dried lump.Other wise it is a nice product! If it was fragrance free it would truly be revolutionary. Good! But not perfect.
