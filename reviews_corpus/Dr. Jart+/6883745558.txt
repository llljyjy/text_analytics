I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. Since I became mom everything is about how to be efficient. BB and CC creams are my staples now. This has a decent coverage and it looks good on my skin. I wish it did not have the chemical sunscreen but only mineral. Overall I have nothing bad to say about this product but unfortunately It Cosmetics CC cream does it better for me. nan
