I received this mask and the serum from Dr. Jart for my honest review.  The mask was maybe a bit too drying for me since my skin isnâ€™t as oily as it used to be and it is winter where I live and everything is so dry right now. I think it would be great for summer time or if you have extra oily skin. My skin is on the sensitive side but it did not irritate it or make me break out. I would consider purchasing in warmer months for a nice refresh! Nice mask for oily skin
