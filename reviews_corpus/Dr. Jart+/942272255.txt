I love trying new products, but this is one that I return to again and again. While many BBs I have tried offer more moisture and less coverage, this one manages both. The coverage is truly impressive; I have rosacea on my chin and cheeks, and this neutralizes it completely. It’s also buildable, though one layer is enough for me. The consistency is smooth, not tacky or too liquid. A reviewer below referred to it as “buttery,“ and I think that’s a perfect descriptor for this. Love it! Remarkable Moisturizer, Remarkable Coverage
