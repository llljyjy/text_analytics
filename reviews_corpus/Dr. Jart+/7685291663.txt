I love this all in one for my fall/winter daily routine! It goes on like a moisturizer and the best way I can describe it is itâ€™s like a filter for your face. In other words, it evens tone and provides light coverage. The color blends in flawlessly with my fair to light complexion. On days I feel my skin is a tad oily I use Mineral Veil (Bare Minerals) to set it and it looks great. I highly recommend! My fall/winter must have!!
