I’m not a big fan of sheet masks to begin with, this one was a bit hard to keep on my face for some reason. No matter what I did, it wanted to fall off in places which was annoying. After washing off my face I didn’t really notice a big difference in my skin. But it was clean so that’s a plus. It’s alright
