I gave myself three weeks to love it. I have oily skin, but itâ€™s also very dehydrated. I thought this would help. I started getting little milia bumps all over my face.I also really like the clean dewy look when heading to bed, it would only stay dewy for about 4 minutes.I recommend the plump plump cream by glow recipe instead for the oily skinned gals that want night time hydration but also get clogged pores really easily. I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE THIS.
