I don’t know if I’d recommend this product tbh. It seems like such a great product when reading the claims, but when I actually put it to use, I didn’t notice any calming of my sensitization or remediation of any redness at all. It’s unfortunate because if this product actually lived up to all its claims, it could really be great! But unfortunately, I found it was pretty basic and nothing really more than a simple hydrating serum, which I definitely think you can find for a better value than this. Just a basic hydrating serum; does nothing else
