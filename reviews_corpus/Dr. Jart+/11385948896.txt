I received this product complimentary from Influenster for my honest thoughts and opinions. I have been using this bb cream for a few weeks and I have enjoyed it. I was worried that the color was a little too dark/pink but I followed the directions and after it dries down it was a very nice match. The container has a nice pump attached and feels very heavy and luxurious. I also couldn’t really smell any type of scent so there is no over powering smells. It also gives a nice glow. My only 2 issues with it is number 1 it can feel a little heavy on my skin for a bb cream so I apply with a beauty blender which helps and number 2 it doesn’t exactly set. I live in FL so it can be very humid so I ended up sweating it off on days I was outside a lot. I also have combination oily skin and sweat more than most so I took my own skin issues into account. I will definitely use this during the fall and winter months when it is not as hot out and my skin is dry from the weather. Premium BB Cream
