I love that the serum glides onto my skin with ease and feels so light weight. Unlike other serums, it leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated without a sticky feeling lingering. I struggle with patchy skin. Some area will have bumps where others are normal. The serum has helped develop consistency in my skin. My pores have minimized and I’m noticing less blackhead around my nose area. I’m very satisfied with the product. Light weight and effective
