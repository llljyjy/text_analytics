I want to give it 3.5 stars but … whatever Sephora. This stuff is watery, yes, and if you can get a handle on that fact and get it onto your face, it seems to work. Are my pores smaller ? I don’t know. Does my skin look better ? Yup, it kinda does. Do you need to use this twice a day as instructed ? Gawd no … once a day / or every other day works fine for me. And if you don’t like the pump bottle, get a dropper & bottle and transfer the product so you can quit complaining about it here. Nice Addition to Dr. Jart Line
