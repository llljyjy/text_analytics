This worked exactly how I had hoped. I wear a mask all day at work and struggle with blackheads around my nose and chin. Since using this for a few weeks, I don’t feel oily at the end of the day and definitely see improvement in pore size and blackheads. My only complaint — I don’t like how the dispenser is made, it makes it somewhat difficult to apply. A dropper would have been much better in my opinion. nan
