I received these products for free from Influenster and Dr. Jart+  in exchange for my honest review.I really love this! The color is perfect for me and there are no lines. It looks natural while covering dark spots and smoothing out my faceWOW! Just WOW!  The color was a perfect match. It does come out darker and when first applied I thought it looked too light but the way it blends; it’s a new staple for me!!  I used this when I didn’t feel like doing a full face of makeup or if I was going to a bbq/ pool party. It looks natural. No cakey look and has spf. This take a natural look to a whole new lever.  Covers dark spots well and a nice smooth look.  I would highly recommend this product to others.  *****/5 on quality and value nan
