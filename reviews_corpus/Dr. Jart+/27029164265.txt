INSANE THIS IS INSAAAAAANE I have fairly acne-prone skin and lots of hyperpigmentation and redness, and when I tell you this diminishes it, it DOES. Skin was givinggggg when I put it on! I’ve been using it for around 4 days and my skin feels so soft. Plus the fact that it has SPF is incredible. Don’t love the smell but that’s just me being picky. I totally recommend!!!
