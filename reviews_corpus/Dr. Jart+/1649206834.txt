Great at correcting redness. I use this as my SPF on days where I don’t wear makeup.It evens out my skin tone nicely, and covers up redness on my skin. It’s a great way to cover up reddish skin after you worked out. How I use it: Don’t put too much product initially, otherwise, you might look like Fiona in Shrek. Activate the product by warming it up with your fingers and applying it in circling motions. Great at correcting redness
