Skin Type: Fair-Light, normal/dry skinI have been eyeing this since I saw it on tik tok and had to try it. I love it! It helps with redness and just evens out my skintone all around. there is little to no transfer like you would see with a foundation as this is truly like a moisturizer that melts in your skin. I also find you need very little as it goes a long way. My mom is hooked on it too! New Staple!
