This product is easy to apply, absorbs well, light and hydrating. I’m usually a bit hesitant to try new eye creams because I get milia easily from eye creams that are too heavy. This product didn’t cause any milia under my eyes and it also moisturizes my eye area well! I took a star off of it because of how fast this product ran out for me!! I started using it in late October and I’m already out of it at the beginning of January. Yes, I’m aware that this is only 15ml, but from the past, 28ml of other eye creams can last me almost a year (I use it twice a day). I blame the design of this pump because I’m sure there’s still a lot of product on the side, it’s just that the pump can’t reach them. It’s truly a waste of the product… while this was really a nice eye cream (I really liked it), i won’t buy again because I can’t justify spending $50 on an eye cream that would only last me 2 months… hopefully they would redesign the dispenser/container to either those ones where you squeeze the product out or a jar. great eye cream, but only last 2 months…
