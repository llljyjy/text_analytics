I got this mist because I had heard that the cream in the cicapair line was amazing and great for your face but was nervous to spend that much money and so instead got this mist and boy am I happy! It feels so nice in my skin and I have noticed my rosacea in my face go down after a couple of days of using it each morning. Do note that it has been a slow process for me and not an instant effect like some people have experienced. It is also a bit tricky to feel as if the product is only going on the face and not the air (but thatâ€™s probably my inexperience with face mists). Overall tho I can tell the difference it has made in my face.I will for sure purchase this again when I run out and will definitely check out the rest of the cicapair line! Genuinely Surprised
