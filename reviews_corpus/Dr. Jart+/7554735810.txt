It’s my new favorite sunscreen for a good reason. I’m always on the hunt for non-greasy sunscreens and this has been the best one i’ve ever tried. It does not leave my face oily at all not even at the end of the day!! I will say the formula feels a bit different it doesn’t feel as smooth/moisturizing on the skin but that’s probably because like i mentioned it’s not oily like other sunscreens it feels more like a paste but i promise not in a bad way you also have to put in a little more work when applying it and blending onto your skin. It’s totally worth every penny for it being non-oily and with good spf coverage! Best sunscreen ever!!
