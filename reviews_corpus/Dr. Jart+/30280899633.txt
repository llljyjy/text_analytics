I’M IN LOVEEEE!!! Never in my teens years I had acne and now that I’m on my 20s my skin started to have hormonal acne. My skin care was normal and now I’m combination with my T-zone being super oily and some dry patches on my skin, also have sensitive skin and redness on my cheeks and forehead. This is the most refreshing thing I have ever put on my face. Just bought my second one. WILL NOT REGRET IT! super hydrating and soothing, the cooling effect feels awesome on your skin. LOVE IT! BOUGHT MY SECOND ONE!!
