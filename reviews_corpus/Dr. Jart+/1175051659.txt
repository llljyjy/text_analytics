I didn’t expect much…but this is actually working to reduce pore size! I have decent skin but the last free years I’ve notice larger pores on my cheeks and the centre of my forehead. I haven’t found any pore filling primers that I’ve really enjoyed. So I saw this and figured I’d give it a try. I’ve been using morning and night, only for a week so far. I double cleanse followed by this and then a vitamin c serum and moisturizer. Tonight while washing my face I could see a huge difference! I’d say the pores on my cheeks look at least 50% smaller! I also noticed my nose looked clearer and less textured. I did notice that it can be a bit drying if you have combo skin so I’ve only been applying where I have larger pores. Only mild complaint is the serum is very watery and with the pump you end up wasting some product in your palm, not a huge issue though. Would 100% recommend!! I’m very excited to see what the next few weeks brings and I’m kicking myself for not taking before and after!! shocked…it’s working for me!!
