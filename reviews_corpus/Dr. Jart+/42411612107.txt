Niacinamide is one of my favorite skincare ingredients so I was excited to see it being featured in the CD so I can put it into my makeup routine as well I have basically incorporated this into my daily routine and it works well. on the staying power could be better but itâ€™s buildable so you can re-apply it throughout the day. Light coverage and a dewy finish you do definitely need to double cleanse to get this off just water will not do. Solid BBcreme
