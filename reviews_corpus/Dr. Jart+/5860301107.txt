First of all I want to say I received this product free from influenster to try out. I have never instantly loved a product more. Off the bat it really matched my skin tone almost like it adapted to my skin because I’ve never had something match my skin tone so perfectly before. I normally experience clinging on my nose and I’ve just accepted it but not with this. My skin looks flawless and skin like. It doesn’t look like I’m wearing makeup but my skin tone has been evened out. Also let’s talk about coverage because OMG. I am very red so I like a bit more coverage and this completely evened everything out with the slightest bit. It also feels very light weight I don’t even notice it on my skin. The packaging is really nice to, durable and cute. I haven’t decided if I want to do my own makeup for my wedding or not but if I do I this would absolutely be one of the products I use. In love!!
