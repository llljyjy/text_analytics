As a regular user of many Dr Jart+ products, who especially loves the sheet masks, I was excited to finally try the rubber masks, assuming the higher cost meant they’d be superior to Jart’s  regular sheet masks. They aren’t. I don’t know why anyone thought the two-piece mask was a good idea. I’ve tried the rubber masks twice now, and the bottom half failed to adhere the recommended length of time both times. These masks aren’t as hydrating as any of the sheet ones, despite the ampoule. The box claims the results are comparable to a sleep mask. Well, the Cicapair sleep mask results are significantly better in my opinion, and a bedtime cream is much less a hassle than a mask anyway, so what’s the point? stick with the sheets
