I received this product free from Influenster and Dr. Jart. I tested it out and Iâ€™m very pleased with this product. The texture feels nice and smooth. I love the scent. Not strong, just light and pleasant. The balm blends very well. It matches my skin tone perfectly. My skin feels light and hydrated after applying this balm. I would buy this product! Love it!
