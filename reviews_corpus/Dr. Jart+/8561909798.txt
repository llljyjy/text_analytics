i didn’t like this at first but i really do now- it does tone down your redness soooo much! i find because it is a thick product, i need to press it into the skin, rather then rubbing it in across my face. I am very pale so this product works for me but i do not think it is POC friendly!! Would be nice to see them create one that is of course. On my tanner days this summer, i definitely notice my face is paler then my body when using this. good product if you’re fair skinned
