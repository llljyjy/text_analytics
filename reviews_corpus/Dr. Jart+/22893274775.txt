I had stubborn textures and bumpy skin all over my face that just wouldn’t go away no matter what I did, but this mask actually helped clear up a lot of it! After one use, I noticed a visible change in the smoothness of my skin that I never got from any other mask or skincare product before this. Obviously it didn’t magically erase every single bump and hyperpigmentation, but for only after a one-time use, this mask really made a difference. My skin also had this glow that wasn’t oily or greasy at all after I used this mask, so that’s definitely a plus. To top it off, my sensitive skin did not have any negative reactions to this product! Absolutely recommended for anyone trying to get rid of stubborn bumps and acne. Works so well!
