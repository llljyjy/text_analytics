Seriously obsessed with this. The best colour corrector ever - I’ve been using this instead of makeup and it wears great throughout the day. Only thing is I wish it came with a small applicator so I wouldn’t have to dig with my nail. Otherwise I absolutely recommend to anyone with any redness in their skin. nan
