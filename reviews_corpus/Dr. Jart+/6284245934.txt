I was genuinely excited to try the product after seeing all the hype on TikTok but once I applied onto my skin it didn’t look right. It was way too pale and didn’t sit right on my face and also settled into any texture/dry spots on my skin. It also transferred everywhere my face happened to touch. I had to return it sadly, was really hoping it would work out. it’s gonna be a no for me
