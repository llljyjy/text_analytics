I rated 5 stars because I do like this brand and this line of serums/ moisturizer. BUT I really have no idea what the benefit of using this product has been. I’m a little clueless / uninformed with bedtime masks. I have used caudalie overnight mask (the pink face mask that can be put on for 15 minutes or left on overnight. And no matter how long I have. On - I end up with white bumps/clogged pores the following 1-3 days after it. So I have been happy about dr Jart mask having ZERO negative effects like that. But again I just don’t know if or how it’s been helping? I tend to use it if I am really dry in the winter or windburn. I layer on all my rich creams and gentle products. And layer this thinly and I are up feeling better / no pain from dry cracking nose or lips. It’s possible it’s neutral and/or positive outcomes. But I know it’s not negative. Skincare is self care to me, so I enjoy this as a last step when I am doing a very hydrating bedtime routine. But I’ll be honest, I’m not sure if I’m using it correctly. I haven’t had any bad reactions to the product, and it’s lasted me SO long. And a little goes a long way. The product is gel-like but never “fully absorbs” into the skin. But overnight it does dry/absorb. When you rinse your face with water in the morning, it gets gel-like again and almost feels like a film to remove (not in a bad way). I m struggled with bad acne all my life, so describing a product like this is not some thing I would imagine I would be using without any negative results. It hasn’t caused any acne or clogged pores.  Despite being neutral on it, I would purchase again, because the product has lasted a long time, so it feels economical. And it’s a fun last step in the skin care. Whether it’s actually doing anything, I have no idea nan
