Pros: amazing coverage for a BB cream! Dewy/natural finish. Lasted on my skin ALL day and looked flawless. It’s almost non detectable. Love that it has SPF and other good for your skin ingredients. Comparably priced to similar products and you get more than 1oz.Cons: The shades are a little off (I have shade light medium-medium and it’s slightly dark and a little orangey. Also the shade range is terrible. Great product!!
