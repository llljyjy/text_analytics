I almost cried when I tried this for the first time…I have rosacea and I have tried everything from calming mists to green colour correctors to laser facials and nothing ever helped me not look like I just ran 10k in the hot sun. This instantly neutralized my redness in a way I have only ever dreamed about. For the first time in my life, I don’t feel the need to wear foundation. I just put this on top of my moisturizer and I finally see how my skin is truly meant to look, without the rosacea making me look like a tomato. Will repurchase again and again and again Best for rosacea
