I received this product free and as a surprise from Influenster just in time for my third trimester! Being with that said, I donâ€™t have the patience or energy to always do a full face of makeup. This beauty balm has been my go to ever since I tried it! The texture is very light weight and smoothly blends into your skin adjusting to the color of your skin. This product has a clean scent to it and provides SPF 40 protection for your skin and stays on all day! This buildable coverage beauty balm has even replaced one of my favorite foundations because I enjoy how it makes my skin feel while not making my face breakout. Great for everyday beauty
