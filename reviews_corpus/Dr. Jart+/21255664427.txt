I got to try Dr.Jart+’s Pore-Remedy PHA Exfoliating Serum in exchange for my honest review, and had such high hopes, and had mixed reviews. I liked that it didn’t really have a scent. To me this is always a plus for face care products. I used the recommended amount, it didn’t seem to cover my entire face, and maybe that was a good thing because it dried my face out almost instantly! I was left with an extremely soft face after and smaller pores, but I didn’t really care for that. This could be due to my skin type, I’m not sure. Will try it again, my skin may take time to adjust to it. Not for me
