I was looking for a cross between a tinted moisturizer (like a BB cream) and foundation, this is it! It provided an even skin tone, but you can still see my freckles, it just smoothed everything out. It goes on green, but changes to your skin tone. It does feel a little thick going on, but then it lightens up. I do this with some blush, highlighter, and translucent powder and run out the door. This is not a permanent corrector though, just evens skin tone when you apply it. LOVE YOU DR. JART
