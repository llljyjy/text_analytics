I tried this sunscreen because I have been looking for a mineral sunscreen for a while and I’ve heard great things about the Dr Jart brand. I’m very happy that I tried this sunscreen! It is so blendable and it just melts into the skin so easily. Other sun screens Ive tried like supergoop, are very nice but they always took so long to massage into the skin. This sunscreen is blended in so fast, within like 20 seconds. There is no noticeable fragrance which I appreciate. The price is a bit much but its a pretty big size and I use it every day, I think it will last me at least 6 months. There is no white cast for me, and my skin is tan-ish. So far using this I’ve experienced no irritation or breakouts. A lot of sunscreens cause my eyes to get red and itchy but this did none of that! I also love the packaging as well. Very nice mineral sunscreen
