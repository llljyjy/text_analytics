This is perfect for a non-makeup look. I love that it has spf in it, and a little goes a long way. I got the smaller one to try it out, abs it has lasted quite some time. My face gets red due to some meds that I am on, and it covers the red but I find that’s it’s a little greasy, and doesn’t last very long on my face. Great for “no-makeup” days. nan
