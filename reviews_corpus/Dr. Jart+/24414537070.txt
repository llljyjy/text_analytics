I had such high hopes for this but it’s really mediocre:( I feel like this would work best for someone with not really any redness as I bought it to help cover up my fading acne scars as texture isn’t an issue for me so much as the hyperpigmentation and scarring and it hardly did anything. This product doesn’t absorb into the skin at all, as it sits on top to color correct, and as a result using more product won’t help, it just becomes an oily mess. I have dry skin and never have a huge problem with oils but this product makes my T zone SO oily. It does look good when you first put it on but by the end of the day it for sure gets patchy, and in my experience using powder and setting spray won’t keep this from happening. I don’t know if that is because this isn’t a makeup product it’s technically just skincare. I’m glad I bought the smaller size because while I will use it up because I need to take a break from makeup which I’m pretty sure was giving me acne, I won’t be buying it agin sadly:( And like I said before, if you struggle with mild hyperpigmentation or redness, this would be good for you but make sure you start with the smaller size instead of spending $52 on the full size. Also, I haven’t had the problem yet of the product separating like some other reviews have said. I purchased my jar in October 2022. Don't think I'll be buying this again :/
