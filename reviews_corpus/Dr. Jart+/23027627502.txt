I absolutely love this Premium Beauty Balm SPF 40 by Dr. Jart+! The shade matches my skin perfectly and goes on smoothly. Love the scent from the SPF and the fact it doesn’t start to smell like I’ve been sitting in a tanning bed like some others I’ve tried from other brands. I have sensitive skin and this doesn’t bother it at all! Definitely recommend this if you’re looking for a new BB! Love it!
