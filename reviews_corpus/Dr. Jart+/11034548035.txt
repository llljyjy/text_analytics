I really wanted to love this product after seeing it go viral on Tiktok, but it’s not my favorite thing. It definitely color corrects certain areas of hyperpigmentation on my face, but it dries other parts of my skin and it starts pilling. Especially with the masks, the bottom half of my face tends to dry out with this product. It does make the corners of my nose a little bit itchy (mildly sensitive skin) but nothing too grave. I definitely would recommend the smaller size of the product if you’re wanting to try it because it’s still a pretty cool product!! Pretty mid product if I'm being honest...
