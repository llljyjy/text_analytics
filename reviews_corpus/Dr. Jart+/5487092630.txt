I have overly dry and sensitive skin with rosacea. I’ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and it’s made a huge difference. This evens out my skin tone and covers the red without needing to use multiple products. It is perfect for “no makeup” days, but I do follow it up with the It Cosmetics setting spray to add some extra staying power and hydration. It also works wonderfully under my foundation. The cream itself has a fresh herbal scent that is pleasant without being medicinal. A little goes a long way as the product is quite thick. I’ve found the best way to apply it is pat it into the skin with my fingertips. I tried using a brush and a sponge, but both left the coverage too heavy and even patchy in spots so it looked discolored. It definitely took me several days to get the hang of applying the right amount correctly to get a natural look. Must have for rosacea
