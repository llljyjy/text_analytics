I received this for my honest opinion. First it is not greasy like other redness repair serums. It smells great though others may not like the smell. I use this both day and night and I am definitely going to buy this I love it!!! It really helps with my redness highly recommend this. MUST HAVE IF YOU HAVE REDNESS LIKE ME!!!
