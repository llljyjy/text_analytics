I received this product for free from influenster and dr. jart in exchange for my honest review! I absolutely LOVE this 3 piece set. It works wonders for my skin, that is naturally red mostly due to acne. The serum has an almost medicinal smell to it that personally I enjoy and it does leave the skin feeling tacky or anything like that. My favorite part is the sunscreen that turns from green to skin toned! I use it as my foundation under powder on days Iâ€™m not really doing much. 100% recommend New stable in my routine!
