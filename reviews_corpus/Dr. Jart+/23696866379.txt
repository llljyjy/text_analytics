I love this product. I used it during my trip to the Dominican Republic where it’s very hot and humid but this BB cream stayed put throughout the whole day! The size is very practical as well. I was able to put it in my purse and bring everywhere I was for small re-touches. The consistency is soft yet creamy— it hydrated your face and gives it a glow. The best part is that you don’t have to put so much because the coverage is amazing. As someone who has very dry skin, I always struggle to find a product that protects my face and hydrates it but this one right here did the job!! It would be nice if they had more shades as well. I think this shade suit me well since I was tanned but now it looks a little bit dark on me. Other than that I definitely recommend this product. A must have
