I’m fair skinned with a te dency towards redness without having full on rosacea and this cream is a game changer. It soothes my sensitive skin, hydrates (although I also use a moisturizer underneath) and evens out my skin. I’ve stopped wearing foundation most of the time thanks to this baby! Couldn’t live without it anymore! redness game changer
