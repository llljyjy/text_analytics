I really kept my fingers crossed that this product would work for me, but all the negative reviews ended up being true for me. The product left a white/grey cast on my skin (olive undertones, light-medium tan), and left me with a half dozen new blemishes after one wear (about a 14-hour day).  Will not be keeping this one. nan
