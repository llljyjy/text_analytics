This serum felt like magic the first time I put it on and I feel the same every time I apply it. I was a bit worried at first because I’ve been experiencing dry skin problems for a very long time but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the serum felt great! My skin feels smooth, my pores look smaller (especially after applying it), and I almost feel like my skin looks filtered in a way! There’s a bit of a smell (nothing unpleasant) but it doesn’t remain at all. I’ve been using it once every day since I’ve only been at home but I’m sure my skin would look so great if I used twice as recommended!This feels like a great serum for those looking to smoothen their skin and make their pores look smaller. Apply before moisturizer and after a cleanser. I highly recommend it, it’s definitely worth a try! nan
