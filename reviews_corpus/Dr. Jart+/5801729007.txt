I can’t live without this. This neutralizes my red cheeks and calms my face down better then any other product I have tried. The fact that it has a sunscreen is a bonus. I have rosacea and this does not aggravate it at all. Just remember to warm it up in your hands first then push the product into your face. That tends to work the best for me. ☺️ nan
