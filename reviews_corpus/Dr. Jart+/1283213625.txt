I love the Dr. Jart Beauty Balm that I received to review through Influenster. The texture is light and creamy. One pump is enough to blend all over my face with a beauty sponge. I love that the coverage is buildable for those wonderful mornings of undereye circles or the zit appearance. The coverage lasts all day and keeps the shine away! Great coverage!
