I actually used these products several times already in different sets. And I will tell you, it never disappoints! Formula is so good and and your skin is gonna be glowing! It helps with redness and I use the cream instead of foundation in regular days, it gives light coverage and it will look green when you will apply it but then takes the color of your skin. I would say it works great with light shades of skin, but not sure about darker shades. It will remove redness and will add glow to your skin :) I saw in reviews people complain about separation of texture in a jar and it happened with my bug jar but I kept using it with no problem. Finished the whole big jar. And this set is small sized products, so its perfect for people who haven’t tried it yet, so you can try it out. I think Korean skincare products are best, and Dr. Jart is one of the top brands out there! This set won’t disappoint you!
