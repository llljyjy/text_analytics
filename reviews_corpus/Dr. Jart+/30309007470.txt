Is it worth the price? Probably not. Does it do what it’s supposed to? Kinda...It eliminates some redness but didn’t get rid of all the redness on my cheeks no matter how much I applied. Absolutely do not put it over the areas you don’t have redness. I was experimenting and applied the product all over my face in a small amount and I turned yellow. So don’t go beyond your red areas.I tried it multiple times to see how I could make it work and it works a lot better with a thick moisturizer under.Also wash your hands thoroughly after using it and don’t let anything touch your face or else it will stain yellow. It’s difficult to wash off because it’s oily so the remaining traces of product on your hands will leave yellow marks on things. Another reason it’s important to cleanse off thoroughly is that the product on your face pills, so make sure to double cleanse well.All in all, it’s effective I guess. It did eliminate redness but I’m not sure if I would repurchase, especially given the price tag. Thankfully mine didn’t come separated which was a concern of mine after seeing the reviews, but I just got it yesterday so we’ll see how long it lasts till the oil separate. (I’m on the fence between would or would not recommend but there’s no in the middle option) Honest review
