This stuff is amazing. Yes, it can be messy if you haphazardly pump it everywhere, but it’s really not that hard to keep at bay. To avoid a mess, cup your hand instead of making a flat palm, squirt 3 pumps in, rub palms together without tipping your hand at all, then apply by patting the face gently. I never spill a drop applying it this way! I have been using twice daily for two weeks and already see a difference in my pore visibility, especially on my cheeks. It brightens and hydrates as well, which is a huge plus in the winter time. Love this serum, it’s definitely become a staple in my routine and I highly recommend it for resurfacing and hydration. magic water!!!
