I like the concept of this product. It’s a light coverage product to even out your skin tone that you can throw on before you run an errand. However, I take issue with how it wears. It never dries down even with a small amount used. If you were to apply as much as you should to use this for sun protection, it would look like you rolled your face in mud. Every time I use it I end up having to do the exact opposite of the product’s intention (apply full face makeup) to get it to look as I would like. Do yourself a favor and buy the Fenty Beauty skin tint and a nice k beauty sunscreen and you’ll get a better wear and achieve that effortlessly chic and glowy vibe you’re looking for. Sometimes two is better than one
