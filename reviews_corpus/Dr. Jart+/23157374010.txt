Avoid if you are not fair and have oily skin. I think its an ok product, i do reach for it when i dont feel putting makeup on but it leave a white cast and is pretty heavy on the skin. i have dry skin and i feel greasy after a couple hours. my skin is fair and still my husband called me casper the ghost when he saw me with it the first time even after rubbing it for a couple minutes. Great product but avoid if you are not fair
