I just went through a two-week chemo treatment (fluorouracil) on my face, and the result was something from a horror movie.  I went to a local Sephora for assistance (having exceeded the capabilities of ELF cosmetics).  This product, in conjunction with NARS soft matte complete concealer, were recommended.  The result is quite amazing, and it got me through a social engagement.  Of course follow the healing regimen suggested by your dermatologist.  Most care procedures I found allow for makeup usage during and after treatment, but again check with your own professional for peace of mind.  The Cicapair has some touted healing properties, so I may continue to use this through the healing process and afterwards. Amazing results
