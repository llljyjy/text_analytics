This sheer coverage tinted moisturizer was pretty mind blowing in the coverage it offered. I have uber dry skin and it gives such a glowy look while evening out my color. Also shocking that my sensitive skin didn’t react to the SPF. No breakouts or reaction at all. I’d say for me, perfect to throw on if I’m not wanting full glam but need a little something, something with little effort. My concerns would be for individuals with oily skin. I have never felt this dewy before. So maybe oily peeps, steer clear. Or just know you’re gonna need to set it. Also, odd to me there are only 4 shades. The light medium worked best for me. And while it claims the color adapts to your true skin tone— I’m skeptical. Great for Low Maintenance Coverage
