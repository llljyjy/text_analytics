Of course I didn’t have a chance to use this before my 30 day return day window closed and boy am I annoyed I saved it. I just opened this up, prepared to treat myself this Sunday while prepare for a shoot this week, and low and behold - this face mask is Covered in mold!! I’ll attach pictures. It’s not like this was sitting in my drawer for months or years- it’s just been in my possession just over 30 days. This is disgusting and completely unacceptable. Covered in MOLD!!
