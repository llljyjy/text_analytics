I generally don’t go for BB creams, but when I received this one for reviewing purposes I was excited to try it! Overall it feels really nice on the skin and gives a really good amount of coverage. It didn’t feel heavy or greasy on my skin. My only dislike is the packaging. The bottle itself is such a hard plastic. A good BB cream!
