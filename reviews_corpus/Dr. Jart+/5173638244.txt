This mask made my skin look and feel amazing. The instructions were clear and the mask stuck to my face much better than other sheet masks Iâ€™ve used in the past have. I definitely recommend trying it out. However, the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5, is because the mask was hard to separate from the paper and plastic layer without ripping it. Great product with minor flaw.
