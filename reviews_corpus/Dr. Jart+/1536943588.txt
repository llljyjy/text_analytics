I bought this product two years before it was available in Canada and I went to great lengths to have it sent to me. It was horrible on my combination skin and it stuck to all my dry patches and emphasized my pores. My skin is very oily and so I set it with several different types of powders. Within 20 minutes, my face was a sticky over the top Dewey. I was blotting like crazy and for the price I paid, it just did not work for me. I also found it made my skin break out and clogged pores. I use mini products for evening out skin tone, but this one just did not work for me and was a hot mess on my face. I wish I could’ve returned! I also didn’t care for the smell. I’m in my 40s, have combination skin leaning toward very oily and dry and this was just not a good product for me. It clung to all the texture on my face and I had high hopes it would work for me, but I found something similar and much better from MAC. nan
