So I’m a very honest person and that doesn’t change just because I received a complimentary item! First and foremost I’d like to preface by saying that I am not normally a fan of sheet masks because I feel like they’re messy and just don’t work well with my super sensitive skin. So with that being said I was surprised at how well this mask worked for me. Since it is a mud mask it’s not messy at all and instructions are fairly simple. My favorite thing about this mask is probably how cooling and comfortable it felt on my face (which is rare with mud masks - they usually dry/harden). And of course the results were a huge plus as it didn’t leave my skin red or irritated like most masks do. My skin felt refreshed and cleansed. I definitely will be repurchasing. Definitely a way to treat yourself after a long week of work! LOVE!!
