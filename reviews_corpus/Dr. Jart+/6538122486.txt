Okay, I am over the moon happy with this product! It is truly a game changer and has become a staple within ny beauty products! This product does everything that you would want it to do and works wonderfully! I use this on the days where I don’t want to wear a full face of makeup. It’s always on my face when I’m at the pool and provides a natural look while covering imperfections and protecting my face from the sun with SPF 40. On top of all that, it also has great skincare ingredients! My pores look smaller and I have not broken out using this product. Typically, facial products with spf do make me break out. I use the shade in fair/light and was originally worried that it may be too light for me, but it’s perfect! I highly recommend that you try this product! Amazing facial care in a bottle!
