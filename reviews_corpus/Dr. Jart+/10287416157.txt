I loved this mask!! It came in two parts (one for the top of your face, one for the bottom) which made it easier to get the right fit. I left it on for 15-20 minutes; it felt very cooling to the skin and smelled amazing. After removing, my skin looked very smooth! Will definitely be using this again! nan
