I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really like this product, it’s similar to It Cosmetics BB product. It blurs imperfections, makes your skin look flawless, and it even has spf in it as well. This product is pretty much knocking down time during your makeup routine and I love it. I haven’t had any problems with it making my face dry out either. It really makes your face look natural and you can hardly notice that you’re wearing anything on your face and it doesn’t make your face look like caked on makeup either. I highly recommend trying this product out. However I do believe they should make the shade range bigger not for myself but for other people, there’s not really much to choose from. nan
