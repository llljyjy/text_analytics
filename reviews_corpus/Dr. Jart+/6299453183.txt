Initially, I thought it was pretty great - but now that I am extremely fair during winter months, I realize how orange this can be. It is very lightweight but doesn’t really provide any coverage so it is strictly pigment. While it does cancel out redness, this does not replace a tinted moisturizer. Perhaps I was hoping that it would be a like a daily moisturizer that also cancelled out redness, however, it feels like you are rubbing “green to orange” concealer all over your face and it just sits on top of the skin.It did not meet my expectations but since it just claims to be a color correcting treatment, I give it 3 stars for that purpose and ease of use. probably won’t buy again
