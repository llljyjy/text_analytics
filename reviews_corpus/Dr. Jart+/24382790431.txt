Truth be told, I have yet to find a Dr. Jart product that really, really excites me. I keep getting them in boxes and things, and I just haven’t found one that really excites me. That being said, I purchased this because of all the hype on social media. I liked the idea that I could use it to tone down redness and get that “no makeup“ look without makeup - which is how it is advertised. Unfortunately, I wasn’t wowed. At all. I don’t LOVE the smell. It isn’t what turned me away from this product, but it is worth noting for others who might be sensitive to that kind of thing. I do have some redness, but not a lot. When you apply it, it becomes more beige... and it wasn’t a great look. I found that it was hard to spread, like I really had to work to move the product on my face, but adding more felt like overkill. It felt thick and heavy on my face. The best way to describe it would be like those unfortunate moments in life when you need makeup on short notice, so you dig through your car and find an old, barely moist, cream to powder foundation and try to make it work. You grind it into your face. And it feels like you’re wearing a mask for the rest of the day. It didn’t really match my skin. It looked heavy and kind of powdery. It settled into every line on my face. Not love. Over-hyped.
