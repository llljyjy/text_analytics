I am prone to redness that is hard to cover with normal toned concealers so I thought this product would be a good idea under makeup. Let me be honest it’s not amazing. Granted it is NOT full coverage but I can still see redness peeking thru. It’s also very greasy and sits really weird on my skin and pores after some time. As for the smell, if u are sensitive to scents, I would not recommend this product. For me, I find it quite pleasant, it’s like an earthy, clay like, minty smell. I guess it was nice to try but i will definitely not be repurchasing. meh
