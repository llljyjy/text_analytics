I usually am skeptical when it comes to BB creams and giving me coverage but still feeling and looking natural. This one delivered and checked off all the boxes. First off, the color perfectly corrected to match my skin tone. The Dewey finish made my skin glow and look so healthy. It provided just the right amount of coverage to cover little blemishes and imperfections. And best of all, it was so natural looking amd looked like I had no makeup on. It truly made my skin look flawless. It also wore nicely throughout the day and came off easily once I needed to remove it at night. 100% recommend
