I enjoyed this rescue kit. Not only did it leave my face feeling cleansed and plump, but it took away the redness for the time being ( I have rosacea). The scent of the products is fair and light. I like the ingredients and marketing, as well as I think this would be such a great Christmas or birthday present. This is a good, simple, fun routine and I will be repurchasing for friends & myself. nan
