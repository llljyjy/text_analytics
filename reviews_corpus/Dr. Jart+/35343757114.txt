This mask was like a pore strip for my entire face. It hardly has any scent, it’s not messy, and it’s really simple to use. Application was straightforward and it sticks well. Peeling the mask off is painless but still effective. My skin was so soft afterwards! I will definitely buy these again in the future. Great product!
