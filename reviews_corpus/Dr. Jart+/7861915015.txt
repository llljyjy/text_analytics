I love this product so far. I notice my skin is softer after using it. It’s not too strong where my face feels burnt or irritated. I use it once a week after washing my face before doing the rest of my skincare moisturizing routine. It’s been working well for me as a part of my skin cycling regimen where I exfoliate at night with this product. The next day I use a retinol product. And the next few days I let my skin rest and just focus on moisturizers. Then start the cycle again. This way I’m not using to many actives at the same time and don’t wreck my moisture barrier. So far my skin has been looking smoother and brighter. Became part of my skin cycling routine!
