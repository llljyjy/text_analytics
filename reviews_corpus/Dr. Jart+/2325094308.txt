I had seen some promo videos and photos, so, on a whim, I picked this up. I should have looked it up because I wasn’t looking for matte and this did highlight my dry spots. The redness elimination is great and the spf is an awesome plus. It does take a while to set, but I didn’t feel like it transferred too much. In the end, I took it back. not for dry skin
