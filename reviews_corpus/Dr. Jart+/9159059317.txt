I got this product complimentary from Influenster. The shade was a little dark for me but it blended in nicely. It absorbed into the skin well and didn’t feel like it was sitting on top. It didn’t transfer easily either which is a nice bonus! It blends into the skin well but once it’s there it is hard to move it around. I tried to blend it more into my neck and it stayed right where it was! The only down side is that it is not cruelty free and I cannot support that Good product but not cruelty free
