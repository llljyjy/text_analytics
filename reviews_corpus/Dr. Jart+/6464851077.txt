I got this in exchange for a review from Influenster, but I actually really really like it! It doesn’t look like have any makeup on, it just look like my skin, but blurred. I have a few acne spots, but not a ton, for reference. I do have large pores, fine lines, and a few spots left from previous acne though and this makes me feel more confident because it blurs those things a little. It’s definitely not full coverage but for days that you’ll be out in the sun and maybe even a little sweaty, it’s perfect because you don’t want to cake on a full on foundation- but you also want to look cute in the pictures. I think it’s great! It moisturizes, doesn’t crack or separate on me- and I have pretty oily skin. Honestly, better than what I expected
