I really like this product.  I have tried to find a concealer for a few years now going through brands and not having much success.  This color correcting treatment is the best.  It covers my red patches then turns into a nearly translucent beige but still covers the redness.  I found the best way to use it is to use a small amount and dot it on, then smooth in downward and outward strokes.  A plus is that there is a SPF of 30.  My face does not feel greasy as I softly apply powder afterwards. Great!
