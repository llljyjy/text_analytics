I really wanted to like this but it wasn’t all that great. It took a lot to get rid of the green/white cast, it didn’t really settle into the skin and when I wore it under make up, it took away from the longevity of my make up. But I guess it did get rid of some of my redness, which is what it was supposed to do. nan
