I’ve been using this product for a little over a week now & I have yet to notice a significant difference in my pores (which is one of my insecurities so I’ve tried A LOT of products to help reduce texture). I also found myself confused on the best way to apply the product. I used both my hands & a cotton ball. The product is very runny so it’s difficult to use your hands but a cotton ball soaks it up. I did like the look of the packaging which is clean & aesthetically pleasing. Overall, I do not believe this product is worth the $. Not worth the $
