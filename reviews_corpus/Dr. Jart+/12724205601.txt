Doesn’t feel super strong or sting in anyway which is good but the formula is very watery and hard to call it a serum. I had a hard time transferring the product from my hand to my face. Also seems excessive to use a chemical exfoliant day and night and also every day as suggested? Haven’t tried it long enough to say I see or don’t see a difference. Not too sure about this
