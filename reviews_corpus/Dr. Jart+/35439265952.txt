There’s some real goodies in this serum: Niacinamide, Cocoa extract, Arnica etc and I think it’s the ingredients that really drew me to this product, more than the redness around my nose which I was curious to see how it would work on. The pro’s: it goes on light and is totally non-tacky. No breakouts, no itchiness, nothing negative to report on, and that’s despite having reactive skin. I could apply my moisturizer and CC cream during the day without piling, or night serum before bed, right after this. More importantly, the redness around my nose did calm down somewhat which was great, I’d say a 50% reduction at least (I usually cover with my MAC Studio Finish Concealer but didn’t need to use as much as normal). Better still, the redness is still reduced even though it’s been over 1 week since I stopped using this.
