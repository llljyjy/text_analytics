I’m 58 w normal skin, some light wrinkles mostly around mouth. I’ve been wearing makeup for over 40 years, originally to help cover my acne. I can say with 100% certainty and sincerity that I’ve NEVER used a better product for minimizing redness and giving a smooth appearance to my skin. This stuff is brilliant. I’ll be trying the serum version as we move into warmer weather and I get a bit of sun. I highly recommend this cream. nan
