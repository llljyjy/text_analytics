Had a great experience with this mask. It was truly a mess-free mud mask and was so fun to try! My skin had been so broken out so I was so excited to have had this mask to try. It didn’t do anything immediate to help with the breakout (I didn’t expect it to!) but my skin cleared up a lot quicker than it usually does when I have bad breakouts. nan
