Ugh, LOVE this mask! it’s so cooling and stays that way compared to the biocellulose masks. My   skin definitely looked brighter and more glowy after. I think Vit C can be irritating for some (?) but I didn’t get that all and I have fairly sensitive skin. the only thing I wish it had was loops to around your ears so you can move around and get stuff done and don’t have to worry about it falling off. So good
