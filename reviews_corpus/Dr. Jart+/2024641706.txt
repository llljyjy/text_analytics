Was hoping this product would work for me as I have rosacea. It does leave a yellowish tint on your skin that you have to try to blend into your skin, so that you don’t have a different tint on your skin. It didn’t last long (maybe about an hour or two). Honestly disappointed. Not worth it. Leaves yellow tint on Skin
