I am blown away by how much I fell in love with this! It’s lightweight enough to feel like your own skin but also does such a good job of evening out the tone of your skin. I also have noticed how much more my skin is liking this compared to other foundations! The niacinamide does it’s job well. I blend it with my fingers after I’ve washed my hand and then use a beauty blender that I spray with setting spray to press it in and it lasts all day with a dewy finish. I got this from Influenster complimentary in order to write an honest review. nan
