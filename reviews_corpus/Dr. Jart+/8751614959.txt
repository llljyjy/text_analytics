So I’m no a BB cream girl so I wasn’t thrilled to try this out but boy was I missing out. I start with my moisturizer then I use my fingers to apply the BB cream. Just with the fingers it already covers my dark spots and give me a good clean, dewy look. I then take a damp beauty blender and go over my face and build the coverage to my liking for the day. This product is great. I will say it rubbed off pretty easily as I have been sick and had to blow my nose a lot but I just keep it in my bag and touch up as needed. Was very surprised
