I enjoy this compared to the thicker version that comes in the jar. I do notice, however, the coverage of redness is slightly more sheer with this serum one compared to the cream one. But this works better for my dry skin since it’s more liquidy and thinner.  I know people complain about the packaging, but I haven’t had any issues with the product leaking around the outside of the rim and then becoming dirtier with every time they screw the dripped close, but that’s because I usually am careful with not dripping any product outside of the hole. I use this as a touchup during the day when I don’t want to use my normal foundation for touchups. It blends well even when I have already powdered my face and have no pilling issues or patchy issues. Will be buying every time i run out! Nice for touchups! or “no makeup”makeup
