Iâ€™ve never used a mud mask before bc I have dry skin, so i thought that mud masks will only dry out my skin even more. However i was pleasantly surprised with this product. My skin felt clean and soft but not tight or dry! I am a still a bit apprehensive about the price but i would def use it as prep before any important day or occasion! not drying, would use only for special occasion
