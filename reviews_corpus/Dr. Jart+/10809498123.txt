I received this free in a voxbox. I really like this for days that I donâ€™t feel like putting on foundation. It is super quick and feels nice. Went I remove it at the end of the day my face does feel softer. I love this stuff but I gave it only 4 stars because the spf does create a grey cast. For my redness prone pale skin it looks good but I know a lot of people with different tones and undertones will have issue with the greatness. Not for all skin types
