I ordered this as soon as it was available in Canada, after seeing a US influencer hyper it up. Now I won’t say this isn’t some kind of miracle cream, but it did help.I have some pretty pale skin... I’m talking porcelain shades are often not the right match. I have cool undertones and struggle with hormonal acne -- needless to say, my face is often more pink than my neck and shoulders, so I was looking for an easier way to even our my tone *without* using makeup. The SPF was a bigtime bonus, especially since I use topical tretinoin (retinoid).My guess (when it comes to the reviews saying not to use this on pale skin) is that they simply were using too much product?? I can only speak from my own experience, but I used this cream sparingly (a dab on each cheek, my chin & forehand - then rubbing it all in) and I didn’t have the same issue with my face turning a few shades too dark. It definitely colour-shifts -- for example, I have a couple of dry patches where pimples are healing and the product settled into those patches a little, and it looks like a tinted moisturizer or light foundation -- I also noticed the product under my nails after scratching my forehead and it looked like I had scraped foundation off my face -- but I didn’t use any kind of setting powder, and I feel like that would help a lot. The finish is very dewy and my skin is combination/oily so a setting powder would do the trick for me, I think, to mattify and keep everything in place -- easy enough fix.Overall, at this stage I’d give this treatment a 3.5/5 -- I’m not sure how it’ll layer under makeup, but on it’s own, it’s not bad, not bad. Not bad, not bad
