This was a different way to apply a sheet mask. Comes in 2 pieces top half and bottom half. Didnâ€™t quite get it to lay flat in some areas. However it was nice to apply it and finish up after shower things (like lotion and hair) and then remove and finish up skincare. Made my face smooth. Smooth but complicated
