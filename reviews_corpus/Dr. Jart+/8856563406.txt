I’ve been using this product for about a week, and I can definitely feel that my skin feels smoother due to the exfoliation. I can’t really tell if my pores have gotten smaller or not, but I definitely think it’s been helping my skin texture. I don’t love how it is packaged. It appears that there are two layers to the serum and must be shaken before use. The oil layer on top leaked before I received the product so my bottle was covered. I also don’t love the pump function. Personally, I’m not sure if I would purchase on my own in the future because I can find more affordable options with similar functionality. Good but not perfect
