I love this product! Itâ€™s not heavy, but it does have good coverage. It also helps moisturize. I have to be careful with products that moisturize because they can break my skin out or make my face feel oily. I did not have an issue with that with this product. It has definitely been added to my regular makeup product lineup. New Favorite!
