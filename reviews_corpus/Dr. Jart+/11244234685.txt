I’ve been using this SPF for two weeks and I adore it for several reasons: it cancels redness, it creates a smooth base, and it is great for continued skincare integration of makeup. I have neutral, pale skin that gets pretty red after the shower, and typically I never leave the house without concealing or powder foundation. Ever since I’ve been using this SPF I feel confident leaving the house with no powder, no further correcting of redness because this does all the work. Although, regardless of what I wear I always put on loose powder to cancel any dewiness as my skin will naturally create dew by the end of the day. How I apply it is taking the utensil it comes with and scooping a finger tip amount, rubbing between my fingers and dabbing all over my face, patting all over my skin before smoothening the product out. If you use too much you will turn green momentarily, I will wipe my hands off and continue to blend until my redness is evenly corrected and my skin looks like skin. Overall, despite not knowing which of the products I use contributes to more even skin tone even without makeup, I have seen a difference in the spotty redness on my face, and will continue to use this product every morning!
