I like it so far, I have oily acne prone skin. Sunscreen is very light weight. No white cast. Doesn’t make me oily or extra oily. No breakouts. Not greasy. Has a sunscreen smell that fades after a couple minutes. When first applied it will give a glow BUT goes away after 5 minutes once it fully sinks it to a natural/matte finish I’m impressed
