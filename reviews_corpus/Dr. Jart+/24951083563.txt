I received this product for free from influenster and Dr. Jart in exchange for my honest review. This was perfect for someone like me who likes light makeup day. It is very light and creamy. I can see myself purchasing this again. Please be mindful that you may want to set this product with setting powder because it does transfer. A new staple in my collection
