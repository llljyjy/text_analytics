I purchased these originally because I love Dr. Jart products, and I found the blemish patches to work great for me - but only on specific types of acne. When I have large hormonal blemishes that you can feel under the skin along my jawline, I put one of these on it as it starts to show above the skin, and the next morning you either can’t feel the acne at all, or it’s almost completely gone when it normally would have been in full force. These are expensive, but I only have to use one per blemish for one night ... I also have regularly found them for $8 at M / TJ. Worth the money compared to other patches!
