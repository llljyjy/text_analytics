This stuff broke me out right away, pretty badly. I know itâ€™s this because I have never had an issue with acne on my cheeks or forehead (just hormonal spots on my chin), but upon rotating this in I immediately noticed whiteheads cropping up. So sad because I really wanted to like this product! The coverage is good, and it really does even out skin tone. Something in here dislikes my skin though. This broke me out immediately :(
