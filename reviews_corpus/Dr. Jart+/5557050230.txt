So, never felt compelled to write a review before, on Sephora. But, this stuff is amazing! Hereditary red nose extending out to my cheeks. I have tried multiple products that really didn’t work. This stuff did! I also live in a very high humidity, but I can use some setting powder and I’m good to go. I have dry skin, and it was not drying. my first Sephora review
