Love it for my oily/sensitive skin. Its a thin gel-lotion hybrid. I use it alongside a moisturizing toner. This moisturizer works best when it is not a stand alone product. Def add a cream or oil over this if you have dry skin.One of the only lotions that helps my oily skin during the daytime. Great
