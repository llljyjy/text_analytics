I received this product complementary and wow! This literally feels like your own skin but flawless! It leaves the face hydrated. It lightly conceals any imperfection and also has spf 40 so it protects your skin! Could a foundation get any better? The shade blended perfectly into my skin. I was tanner earlier in the summer and it matched and now I am slowly lightening and it still blends very well! It is buildable. Skin in a bottle
