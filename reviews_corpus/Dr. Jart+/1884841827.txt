I’ve purchased this product before but for some reason this time it had a large amount of oil that had separated from the product.  I tried to drain the oil off the top but it was so slippery a good amount of the product slipped into the sink.  Then I tried to stir it to blend the oil back into the product but that didn’t work.  Not sure if it’s because I had it shipped rather than buying the store?  Anyway, I loved this before but this jar is going back for a refund! Oily mess
