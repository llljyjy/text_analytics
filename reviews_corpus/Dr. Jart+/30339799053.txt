This works very well on my skin. It does a good job of neutralizing the redness on my face down to a manageable level and actually plays very well with my very fair slightly olive undertone skin. My skin tends towards dryness (or used to) but is under control now, so I havenâ€™t found it to be drying or clingy. I only use a basic moisturizer underneath and not even immediately beforehand. I can wear this on its own but sometimes find it best to add a drop or two of bronzing fluid to warm it up. nan
