This has replaced my Clinique BB Cream as my lazy-day go-to face product. It really evens out my skin tone, has moderate coverage, and once it warms up, it looks fairly natural, like a second skin. That being said, you need to give it a minute. When I first apply it (I take a little bit out with a plastic applicator and then apply it with fingers), I look grey, but then it blends in to match my skin tone (light-med warm-leaning neutral). I don’t know how it would perform on someone with a darker complexion, but for me, it’s perfect. Replaced my BB Cream
