Used the day after a chemical peel that left my skin very red. Once I applied it greatly reduced the appearance of redness! Highly recommend for those who are trying to tone down any redness on their face. 4 stars because if my skin isn’t red there’s a distinct greenish tint to it Great for toning down redness
