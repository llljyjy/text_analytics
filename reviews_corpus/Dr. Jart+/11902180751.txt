This product was a staple in my beauty routine. My skin tends to have a pinkish tint and this product corrected that. I used it instead of foundation. Unfortunately, I recently bought a new jar and the product was completely separated, not stable, with a ton of oil floating at the top. I previously worked as a cosmetic chemist, and my suspicion is that they change an ingredient and never did stability testing to ensure that the oil and water components donâ€™t come apart. This is a total fail give the price, and the product is not usable at all. Please correct the issue Bring back the old formula!
