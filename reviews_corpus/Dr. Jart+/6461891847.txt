Overall, I do quite like it as a colour correcting and I enjoy that there is SPF in it. It is quite thick but doesnâ€™t take a lot to blend into the skin. For my dry and sensitive skin, it does leave a bit of a texture but I like how easy it is to have some sun coverage and tinted moisturizer look in one step for busy mornings. Not too shabby
