Only reason I’m giving it a 4 star rating is because it says it’s supposed to have a matte finish and I’ve tried it several times waiting for it to set but it stays sticky/tacky and does transfer but other than having to put a little setting powder I freaking absolutely love this product and when I before I run I’ll be buying another. Takes away most of my redness and it’s great for those no makeup, makeup days and most importantly it has an spf 30 in it. Love love love this product. CicapairLover
