Was excited to try this as teatree-based cleansers have been good for my acne and clogged pores in the past. This did a decent job of reducing the redness and size of large pimples and breakouts but didn’t do much for oil control. I’d also recommend only using this to moisturize areas that have breakouts and using/layering a slightly thicker moisturizer for the rest of the face as even for my oily skin this often didn’t seem to provide enough moisture. Overall it’s a good product but I think there is probably a cheaper alternative that would perform just as well. Good for acne-prone areas but not for whole face
