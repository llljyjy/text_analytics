I’m a medium skin toned person with dry-combination type skin. I get redness around my nose mainly and some redness on my chin as well. This product made my skin look way too light and it clung onto my dry patches. The product got a little better once I let it settle into my skin a bit, but you could see the dryness once you got closer to my face. Not worth the money, imo. I got the travel sized one to try out and I’m glad I didn’t purchase the big jar. Will be returning. Not for dry or darker skin tones
