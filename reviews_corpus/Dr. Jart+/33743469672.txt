I love this stuff! I received this as a free sample and am so excited to have found it! I don’t have particularly sensitive skin, but for some reason, all sunscreen burns my face. Especially around my eyes. This is the only one I’ve found that doesn’t burn me! It also doesn’t pill up like a lot of other sunscreens I’ve tried. It balances out my skin tone nicely. Love it!
