I picked up both the Fair-Light and the Light-Medium shades and am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador based on my experience with this product. The Fair-Light is too light for me now but will work in the late fall / winter months. It has that greige cast in the photo that can be typical in Korean BB creams but even with having a little tan now, the product blended well and without that greige cast. The Light-Medium is a slightly more tan than my complexion now, but the formula is on the sheer side and when blended out looks fine.WHAT I LIKE:* silky, creamy consistency* applies smoothly, blends easily* wears comfortably, feels light on the skin* skin feels hydrated* evens tone, brightens complexion* satiny finish with a dewy (non greasy) glow* better shade range than previous BB creams from the brand (but see more comments below)* high SPF but I’d still recommend wearing a separate sunblock underneathAREA(S) FOR IMPROVEMENT:* while there’s a lot more shades to choose from than in Dr Jart’s other BB cream lines, there’s room for more shadesFYI / OTHER THOUGHT:* light coverage, buildable to medium coverage* not transfer-proof (but also not expected to be); it can last 8+ hours if set with powder* did not pill with my sunblock* good for every day or “no makeup” makeup days* For reference, my other foundation shade matches include: Tower 28 Sunny Days Melrose; Chanel No. 20; Dior 1.5N or 2N; MAC NC 15 or NC20. With most Korean beauty cushions, I fall between No. 21 and No. 23 depending on the time of year. Evens tone, hydrates skin, & brightens complexion
