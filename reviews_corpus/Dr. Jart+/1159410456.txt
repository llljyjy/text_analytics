I am very pleasantly surprised by how much I really love this sunscreen! I generally prefer tinted mineral ones, but, this leaves no white cast, isn’t greasy, doesn’t pill, and has barely any odor! I have been applying a small amount of tinted mineral spf over it to ensure I have iron oxides to protect against blue light - this works beautifully underneath and now I don’t feel like I have to put a ton of tinted spf on (which can be greasy & obvious, I don’t like matte/silicone options) to have protection since I know the Dr. Jart is there too.  Really glad I tried this!! Really Happy I Tried This Sunscreen!!
