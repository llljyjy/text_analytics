iâ€™ve only used this once but so far, i love it! feels really lightweight on the skin and with just a touch of color. time will tell if i keep this one around, but based on first wear, i was pretty impressed. i blended some glossier blush in and it looked seamless. like my skin but better. this is definitely my idea of the perfect foundation for a no makeup makeup day. nan
