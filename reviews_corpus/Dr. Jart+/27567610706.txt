I’m so glad I got this as a free sample and didn’t pay for it because I hate it. I was really excited to try it because I get red patches on my face sometimes, but it was super disappointing. I’m not even sure what it is supposed to be used for besides color correction? I applied it over moisturizer as it directs, and then tried to apply make up over it, but nothing stays. The cream comes up and blotches, make up won’t blend, and it turns orange! nan
