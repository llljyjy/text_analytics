I was really excited to try this product as I had several people recommend it. Going on, it has a nice, natural scent and felt soothing. The texture is pretty thick. I tried this 2 days using different amounts. However, at the end of the day, it was separated and sinking in pores and dry patches I didn’t know I had. I don’t know if this will help reduce redness over a long term use, but I’m not willing to try with my experience. nan
