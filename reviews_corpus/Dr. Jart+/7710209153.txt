After trying many different toners over many years, I was still struggling with hormonal acne around my period. I’m talking mean, angry acne that destroyed my chin, and was only made worse after two years of mask use. I had scars from old acne as well. This toner, after three weeks of constant use (part of evening skin care and a small dab on chin in morning) removed acne break outs completely. The smell is nice, it’s not heavy, and it doesn’t dry out my t zone. My nose used to flake so badly I could peel strips off my nose. No longer. If you have dry skin with hormonal acne, I recommend giving this a try. Hormonal Acne Banished
