I got this on a whim when I found that the Dr. Jart BB cream was seemingly to dark for my fair skin. I did no research, no skimming reviews. I just bought it. This is the most amazing color corrector. I don’t have much acne or anything but with extremely dry skin and a tendency get red and flakey this is incredible! It goes on very thick, for a moment I thought it was a face mask. If you’re patient  and keep blending it will settle in beautifully. I look like I’m not wearing any makeup yet my skin is even and smooth. I love this stuff! I think you have to be a specific type of person to appreciate this though. In my opinion, the people who would like this have dry skin, like the feeling of thick moisturizer and deal with uneven skin and maybe those with maybe a little bit of acne. Someone who would like this would like the no makeup look or just want something to even their skin for more effortless days. Love at first use!
