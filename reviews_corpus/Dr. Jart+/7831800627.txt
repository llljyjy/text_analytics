Another great product from Dr. Jart+! I enjoyed the minty aroma and the freshness after applying this serum. I have been using it for a couple of weeks and have noticed that it does help my skin look healthier and rejuvenated. The serum has a very thin and watery consistency and so I feel that it is beneficial for my pores and helps it breathe! Overall, I am impressed with this product and would purchase it again. Helps my skin feel rejuvenated!
