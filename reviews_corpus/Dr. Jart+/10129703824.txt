This is an ok sheet mask, usually I’m not the sheet mask type! It is quite cooling and does help with congestion, but it’s a tad drying. Used it the same night as my retinal to see if it really was gentle, no irritation occurred. Overall it may be better for hotter days here in FL occasionally. Decent Mask
