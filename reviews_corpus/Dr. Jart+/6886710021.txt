Absolutely amazing, i have very pale translucent skin with the tendency to go red at nothing and this is amazing! Corrected my skin tone without the cakey look that makes you feel like you have to do a full face, 100% natural finish that did not look greasy on my oily skin! I hope this works like the rest the cicapair line and also repairs skin sensitivity that causes redness! Do bot use a lot, I have the smaller version and it will last! This is the first colour correcting product that has worked for me! Redness relief on no make up days confirmed!
