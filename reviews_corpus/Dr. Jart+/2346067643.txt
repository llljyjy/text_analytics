there are few things you need to realize about this product,  this is a tinted moisturizer first , than a redness corrector and spf. If you moisturize your skin first and than apply it for all the promised benefits than it is an A+ product.  without moisturizing   it will cling to dry spots .this is not like laura mercier tinted moisturizer that works on its own (for me at least )i am loving the redness correcting action so far . A little goes a long way . also please warm it between your fingers before application.  it is a very simple and effective product if use correctly, it is not a magic . I do not see why it will not work for anyone unless allergic to an ingredient.  the spf is a bonus for me as i love to have sun protection in all of my makeup or skin care.  overall i am very happy with this and will repurchase if ever runout . another tip, donâ€™t use a brush,  or palms ,use fingers only and work slow to allow it to set on your skin. a great tinted moisturizer that works redness
