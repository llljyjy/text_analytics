This product didn’t work out for me. I’ve tried applying it with my fingers, a beauty blender, brush etc. and it goes on thick and feels heavy on my skin. I also have to rub it in for a while for it to change from green to nude color (like a minute). For reference I have oily/combo skin and this was just not it. It DOES work to relieve redness in my cheeks and nose, but the finish is not great and it feels heavy. Also, if you’re wearing it and sweat at all it gets super gross. Since it has SPF I’ll use it if I have to run errands or something but I won’t re-purchase. nan
