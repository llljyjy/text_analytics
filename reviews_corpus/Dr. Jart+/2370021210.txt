This mask is expensive, but it is worth the money. It looked and felt like I had just gotten a facial. I have very dry skin in the winter so this felt really nice on my skin. I watched a show while I had the mask on which is maybe why I personally did not have any issues with the mask moving. Whatâ€™s also nice is the result is not transient, you can see it the next morning. 10/10 recommend. Feels like a facial
