I bought this about a year ago and found that this product holds up in two, extremely different climates. I have tested this in southern Louisiana heat and humidity and at an elevation of 6000ft+ in a very dry climate. Can not recommend this enough, the quality of the product also meets its price point and will last you a very long time considering how small a quantity you need to use every time. No Makeup Makeup
