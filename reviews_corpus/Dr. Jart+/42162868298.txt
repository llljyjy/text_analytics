I have Rosacea, Sjogren’s syndrome & tanning damage.  After one month of using this rescue kit, I’ve learned that staying faithful to this skincare regimen does help to heal the redness.  I’m unsure if the tiger grass serum or the tiger grass cream heals the red issues (likely it’s both, as I use both).  I only use the tiger grass color-correcting treatment SPF 30 when I plan on being in public.  It acts as a smooth concealing foundation. I use it sparingly on the actual red areas & it does cut the red nicely.  I keep my skincare products in the fridge, so there is no product breakdown. I use a small skincare spatula that I sterilize after use, so there is no worry of contaminating the color-correcting treatment.  When all else fails, think outside of the box.  Tip:  I don’t think the color-correcting treatment will work for those with darker skin tones.  I am medium.  Good luck, ain’t aging fun. It helps!
