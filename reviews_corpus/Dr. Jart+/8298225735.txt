I have always been a bit hesitant on BB creams since I never seem to find shades that match me well but I definitely wasn’t disappointed with this product. It complimented my skin nicely and gave me a natural looking finish as if I didn’t have anything on. It felt comfortable on my face and stayed in place. I overall enjoyed this product and will be adding it to my collection of products I continuously use. Love
