This is my holy grail product!! Makes my skin so even and dewy but not oily looking and I love that it has a decently high spf. I know some people in the reviews say this is caky, but I think only a small amount is needed and blends in well by using fingers, so I don’t find it caky at all when I use the appropriate amount. A lot of days I just wear this and some liquid blush on my skin and that’s all you need. Makes all my redness disappear immediately holy grail
