Hands down FAVORITE BB cream/foundation ever. I am a diehard makeup fan (and probably spend too much on makeup) and have tried everything from Nars to Dior. This by far is the perfect product to give you a skin like look without looking cakey. I get the most compliments when I am wearing this BB cream as it leaves my face looking FLAWLESS. Its light to medium coverage so as long as you do not have really bad breakouts, this is the product for you.I am on my 2nd bottle of this updated formula, but my 6th bottle overall after 2 years and I just love it.
