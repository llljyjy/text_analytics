I’ve used this peel for a couple weeks now and I am satisfied with the results so far. My skin was a little sensitive after the first time I used it but not so much that I didn’t want to keep trying. Since that first sensitive time it’s worked great and makes me feel like it’s doing it’s job. It is a good texture that doesn’t run too much and doesn’t leave any weird residue on my skin. I received a free sample through Influenster of this product. Great to add to your routine
