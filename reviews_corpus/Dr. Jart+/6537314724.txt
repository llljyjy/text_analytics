Note- Unlike every review currently posted, I actually paid for this product. I’ve liked other dr. Jart masks and consider then very high quality so was excited about this one because I get very congested pores on the sides of my nose and this mask said it was specially shaped to cover the sides of the nose and I assumed the clay would pull out/dry up all the congestion I have. I put this on after I got out of a hot shower so my pores were steamed open. I could easily run my finger nail along my nose pores and tons of white oily stuff/sebum was coming easily and profusely out, so I had high hopes for the mask pulling all that out without my usual squeezing and scraping. Unfortunately after using this mask, there was no difference in the amount of sebum/white stuff in my nose pores. I could still run my finger nail along the pores and stuff was still coming out as if I hadn’t done the mask at all. This mask literally did nothing. And it was FULLY covering the problem areas. Very disappointed in this product. so disappointed-didn’t get any sebum out at all
