Amazing. I got the tiger grass cream through rewards and am a huge fan. I have yellow skin, but my skin flushes and turns my makeup orange. Because of this, I can’t wear makeup without some kind of green color corrector. Decided to try this when I ran out of the cream. This is a thinner version of the cream, less moisturizing though, I usually apply after a lightweight lotion or sunscreen. (I don’t rely on the product’s SPF as a complete protection… the Florida sun still penetrates through the product and gives me dark spots.) great for neutralizing redness
