Here we go again. People saying there’s no white cast on a mineral sunscreen. A mineral sunscreen whose primary actives are Zinc Oxide & Titanium Dioxide, which are both the color WHITE. You can NOT, NOT prevent the white cast  from mineral sunscreens. The people saying there’s no white cast and clearly not using the recommended amount by dermatologists (three whole fingers full of product). There’s no white cast if you use small dots around your face, but that’s not enough to make the sunscreen work. This makes me look really dry, creates a film over my face & leaves me looking like a ghost. I had high hopes for this product. But the cast is worse than the other mineral sunscreens I own. THERE IS A WHITE CAST!
