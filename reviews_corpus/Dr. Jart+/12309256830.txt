I have oily, acne prone skin with large pores and I honestly didn’t notice too much of a difference after using this mask. I’ve never used a mask that was packaged like this and I will say that I liked it a lot! I can’t recommend this product because I saw no difference in my skin. Didn’t notice a difference!
