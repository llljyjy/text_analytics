So, like all the other positive reviews, I love this stuff for a no makeup sun protection moment. I work from home so this stuff is great as it gives me the spf I need to go grab a quick coffee, and then evens out my skin tone and dries down nicely for my zoom calls.  The reason it’s not 5/5 stars is because this will only work if you’re very fair.  I’m a cool light in almost every foundation, but in the summer I tan quickly.  I don’t bump down to medium, maybe light-medium in the last months of August, but still a little warmth to my light skin. The second that transition starts, these drops look weird.  Not only is the inclusivity a serious issue, but for the like, 3 skin tones it works for, it only works for 1/2 the year.  I feel like just grabbing the tower beauty spf and putting it on lightly would give the same effect but more skin tones are served. would be five stars but…
