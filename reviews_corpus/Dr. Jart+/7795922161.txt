This is my first Dr. Jart+ product. I’ve heard good things about this brand and been wanting to try it. I honestly really like it. My skin didn’t react negatively, and I really like the product packaging as well. Obviously a product for facial concern isn’t going to work right away or with just one try. My skin did feel smoother and cleaner, and even though it didn’t work 100% (as one can imagine) I would recommend this product. nan
