I am very picky about the products I use in my face and try to stick to medical grade only and I have been using Alastin hydratint for the past 4 years and haven’t been able to find anything better until now.  This spf is amazing. It goes on smoothly, provides a light coverage but makes your face glow. I’m obsessed. It also feels very hydrating and lasts all day. Will definitely be making this a staple product. Plus the packaging is super cute as well. Obsessed
