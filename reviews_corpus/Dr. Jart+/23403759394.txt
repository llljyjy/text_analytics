One of the few Dr.Jart+ that works for me with minimum essential oils (why I otherwise avoid this brand). I save the excess liquid and store it in the fridge to use it as a serum. This brand needs to make this into a serum because I would buy and use it! Itâ€™s calming and hydrating. Lastly, Dr.Jart+, please reduce the use of essential oils and I would try more products! Hydrating + Soothing
