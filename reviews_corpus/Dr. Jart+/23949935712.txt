I’m more of a mask as a treat kind of person, and this mask was great for a self care night in. Dr. Jart does a great job of creating masks that actually form to the face. I have normal type skin and left the mask on for the time specified in the instructions. My skin loves this mask and it definitely prepped my skin to receive a more rich moisturizer (it’s full blown winter where I live right). For the price, this product is more of a splurge. If it is in the budget, I would say go for it. nan
