I love this product! My cheeks are rosy but kinda patchy with the color. This product helps even out the tones. My only complaint is that it does kinda wear off throughout the day, but this product never claims to be long-lasting and it’s basically a tinted SPF so it’d be unfair for me to expect it to last so long. Overall this is the product I’ve been looking for!I think it’s good to know that I do not wear foundation, so I don’t know how this is under foundation. But I can say that my concealer sits fine on top of this. love!
