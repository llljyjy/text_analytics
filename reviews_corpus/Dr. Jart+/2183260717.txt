This is amazing! It is thick and offers excellent coverage, but blends beautifully and feels very light. The tone they sent is a bit too dark for my skin tone, sadly, but itâ€™s a great product. It lasts all day and offers SPF 40. The packaging is super sleek. It looks like a soft tube, but it is actually hard plastic with a pump, not something you squeeze. Definitely recommend! nan
