Had really high hopes for this.. I saw on some reviews that people loved this as a foundation and thought I’d give it a try! Unfortunately this makes me look pale (I am medium skin tone) and this is that I only used a small amount on my face. It also feels like it peels when I’m rubbing it in. I’ve tried it with my skin care and without it and I still feel that same peeling. Up close in the mirror it looks like caked up foundation which I don’t like. This will be a definite no for me. Big let down
