I have seen this product online so many times and was so excited when I saw it became available in Canada. However, as soon as I put a test patch on my face it turned orange and did not blend to match my skin like other reviews. I’ve seen people on TikTok with the same skin tone as me using this and it never turned orange for them? I’m super disappointed and curious if I got a faulty one? nan
