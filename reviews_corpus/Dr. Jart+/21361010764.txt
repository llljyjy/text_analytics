A life saver if you’re prone to redness like me. I’m very pale so my face is often pink/red, which can be frustrating. This stuff looks green in the bottle but once it’s on your face, it just somehow... turns in to a natural skin color. It’s hard to believe until you see it, maybe watch some youtube videos if you don’t believe me. Anyways, I find that it’s best applied with your fingers because the heat of your skin is what helps it turn into a natural color, so when I used my sponge it looked a little strange. It lasts for about 7 hours but you need to set it with a water-based primer and powder to make it last longer. It’s prone to “melting“ off your face if you’re too hydrated or sweating. Other than that I love this product and will continue buying it. Great find for those prone to redness
