I’ve been looking for a good BB cream for when I don’t want to wear foundation, and this one is amazing! I received the Light Medium-Medium and could technically use a slightly lighter color, but it blends beautifully into the skin and I can lighten it with a bit of concealer. It gives a really pretty and glowy light coverage that gives you a “your skin but better“ look and I love it for no-makeup makeup days. I’m an SPF everyday kind of person and this product puts all the steps into one. I highly recommend this product. No Makeup Makeup
