Okay idk what’s going on with this stuff. I bought this knowing it was very pasty and thick, you have to warm it up etc. Well mine is the consistency of thin sunblock. And clear stuff is separating from it, the picture is after I manually stirred it, there’s still liquid surrounding the product. And when I purchased this last week it had 2k reviews, now it has less than 100…. They may have reformulated. Well anyways, it is like a very light foundation. But It makes dry skin look worse. I’m using a new topical treatment that is drying so this would be better if your skin is already in decent condition. I have to take it down my whole neck, there’s a slight orange tinge by my jaw. I’m going to try to use this up since I don’t hate it and lost the box. I doubt I will ever repurchase it and 50$ for this is ridiculous. weird consistency
