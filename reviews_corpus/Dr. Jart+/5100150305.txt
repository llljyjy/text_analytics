I really enjoyed this mask. What makes it stand out is the fact it is a mud mask in sheet mask form, making it so easy to apply without a massive mess. I saw a slight difference in my skin after, it felt less oily and tighter. I did my makeup right after rinsing and the rest of my skincare and I felt that it was a smoother application! nan
