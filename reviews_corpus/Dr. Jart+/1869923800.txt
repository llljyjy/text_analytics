I have been using Dr Jart cica products for years now, as they are the only product I can use on my ultra-sensitive skin with rosacea. My complexion has always been good, just redness and sensitivity, so I’ve avoided exfoliating products for years. Recently I’d noticed my pores are getting pretty visible, so I decided to give this a try since it claims to be safe for sensitive skin. I have noticed that it is working, in two weeks my pores are becoming less visible and my skin has a nice glow to it that I haven’t had in awhile. However, since it’s been so long since I’ve used exfoliator, I have noticed that my skin is purging. I know this is a sign it’s working, so I’m going to stick with it for the next four weeks until the 6-week purge period is up — hopefully it ends sooner. However, despite the purging, which is expected, it doesn’t dry out my skin or make it burn or hurt. This is a huge deal for me, as my skin truly is extremely sensitive, especially in the winter time. I’m giving this pricing 4 stars because I can see the difference in my pores, and it doesn’t even hurt my sensitive skin. The watery texture is surprising, I will say. I recommend putting product into cotton pad to apply. It says you could use with fingers but it’s way too watery for that. Otherwise, I’m pleased with it, just hoping the purging ends soon, but I don’t blame the product for that, that’s just my skin getting used to new ingredients. Works even on my sensitive skin
