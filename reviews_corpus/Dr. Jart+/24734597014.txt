After using this product for a week I have definitely noticed some improvements with my skin. I can’t really notice any physical changes, especially since I forgot to take a before photo, but after using it I noticed that my skin appears to be smoother. I have also noticed that when applying moisturizer my skin feels more smooth. I’m not sure if I would buy this again as I’m not one to use many skin care products, but if you are considering built it I would say it’s worth it. nan
