I am already using a product similar to this in my everyday routine but trying out this product was nice! The coverage is light but buildable, perfect for me. The texture and consistency isn’t too drying or oily, perfect for my combination skin! Love that it’s hydrating and UV protecting!! Only down side was that it’s a little too dark for my natural skin tone but that just means I need to try a new shade! 10/10 wonderful product Honestly a nice product
