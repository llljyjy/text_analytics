This is the strangest mask I’ve ever put on my face. I received it for free, and I can’t imagine paying $9 for a one time use mask. It is not that easy to put on and feels very claylike while on. No part of the process was enjoyable. Perhaps will really oily skin or something this could be nice, but I would not recommend at all. nan
