Hey babes ! Cakefacetaye hereeee, I did receive this *** free in exchange for my review*** here’s my HONEST OPINION: this is super watery! It squirts out like water, the alcoholy smell fades quickly.. it does minimize my pores and preps my skin nicely under makeup ** BUT** my pores do not stay minimized all day. I’ve been using it 2 going on 3 weeks so I will keep you all updated if it has long term effects. My Instagram is @CAKEFACETAYE if you want to stay updated on this product + much more I’ve been trying out. Have a beautiful day! *** absorbs quickly ****** a little goes a longgg way***Worth the price ???? We shall see. Jart vs. Cakefacetaye
