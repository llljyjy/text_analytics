i really like this! i struggled with severe hormonal cystic acne that left tons of scars on my face once i got rid of it, but this stuff covers it all so well! it feels so lightweight and i absolutely love that it has spf in it. i only deducted a star from my rating because it does wash me out quite a bit and makes me look suuuper pale- however after throwing on some bronzer and blush it looks alright. overall though i love this and will be recommending it to my friends! covers acne scars beautifully
