I got a sample of this I’m one of the monthly sample bags they sometimes give out at sephora and this cream was too good, I had to get it even though I still have lots of my usual moisturizer. I use the barrier + from skin fix right now. This tiger grass cream is thicker and soothes my dry/sensitive skin. It is a small amount but you really don’t need much. nan
