My natural skin is so red and sensitive naturally no matter what I have done for my whole life. I have also had a lot of issues with my foundation barely rubbing off and exposing my bright red skin underneath- I didn’t realize that a neutralizing cream like this existed! This is now a staple under my foundation because it instantly removes my redness. I also love this stuff because I have crazy sensitive acne prone skin and this serum does not bother it at all. I will also just wear this on its own and it looks like a high coverage CC cream. I cant explain how much this stuff has helped my redness and I’m so happy to have found it. loooove and totally neutralizes my redness
