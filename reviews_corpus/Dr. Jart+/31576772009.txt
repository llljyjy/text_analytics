I’m a huge fan of all things Dr.Jart+, so I was excited to try this. I usually wear cicapair during my daily routine and I just ran out. I decided to try this before I purchased my next little jar of cicapair. This balm goes on like a dream. It comes out like a cream, but glides on your skin and blurs imperfections like a mousse. It is silky, but completely oil free. I swear it melts into my skin. This stuff is magic, y’all, I swear. I even like it better than my cicapair staple for the summer months. My cicapair can feel a little heavy in the hot, humid summer  months, so I think I’ll stick to it in the winter, when my skin needs more moisture.Also, this is spf 40, which is great, but I’m here to also say it goes on beautifully over my biore face SPF, too! It's magic!!!
