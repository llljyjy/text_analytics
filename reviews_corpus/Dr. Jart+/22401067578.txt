This SPF is not a treatment. If you are trying to get because you think it will correct or treat anything on your skin, don’t waste your money. It’s rather a green paste that turns into a bronze cream once it interacts with your skin and gets warm. It has no coverage at all and might or might not slightly cover a pink blemish. It wont treat any acne scars, spots or redness. 3 stars because it’s building and just a good, hydrating SPF protection. Not a treatment
