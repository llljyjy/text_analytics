I got a mini size of this product in the 2022 Sun Safety Kit and was really excited to try it out. When I put it on, it was super thick—almost like a clay mask—and obviously green. I waited for it to change color for 5-10 while continuing to try to rub it in, but no matter what I did it just sat on top of my skin. When it finally changed color, it turned from green to… a different shade of green/beige. The color was sickly and it still looked like I was wearing a clay mask! Absolutely would not recommend. nan
