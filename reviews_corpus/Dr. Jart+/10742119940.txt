It’s milky-smooth and leaves a pleasant feeling of hydration. I’m using this product in conjunction with tretinoin and it did not cause irritation. I was surprised to see that citric acid is the highest concentration AHA used but it seemed effective. The amount you get and how much you’re directed to use is the part I don’t like. I was sent the 150 mL/5.07 fl. oz bottle. To saturate a facial cotton pad, I used like 1 tablespoon. If you’re repeating treatment 3 times a week as it suggests, you’ll go through this bottle in about a month. I don’t mind paying for results but it would be annoying to have to remember to purchase this that often to not run out so that lost a star. Gentle, Soothing, and Effective
