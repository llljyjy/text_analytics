So I applied this product in a few ways. First; I applied it like how I apply my sunscreen, I just rubbed it in with my hands. Then I also tried using brushes and beauty blenders to apply the product. Each way I tried it, it did not look good on my skin. It dried my skin up super fast so the product looked cakey and cracked. I like the idea of the product, the color looked amazing when it was first applied but it did not work for long periods. Very drying
