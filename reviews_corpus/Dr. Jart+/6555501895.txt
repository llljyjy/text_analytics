Over 10 years, I still come back to this product. I don’t know why I try to venture out and try other serum or BB creams, I always come back to Dr. Jart. It covers well while providing a natural finish. I don’t want to look like I’m wearing a foundation mask; but I want color correction. It’s a tried and true product of which I intend to stay faithful! My Forever Faithful
