I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. I have been using it every other day for about 3 weeks and I’ve noticed that my pores actually do look smaller and cleaner, and my skin is more bright than before. It’s easy to use and didn’t make my skin feel sensitive. I used a thicker night cream or face oil after each application. Overall, I’m impressed with this product and will continue to use. nan
