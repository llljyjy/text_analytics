Unfortunately I will never be able to buy this again. I have purchased a few times and it has been okay. Pretty good at evening skintone while it is on but not lasting change. Just good enough coverage. This was a weird batch. It keeps separating. It’s gross. Does not feel good on the skin. Sephora says they can’t help because I bought it more than 60 days ago. I just haven’t had time to deal with it. It’s 2/3rds full and I keep having to throw globs of it away due to the separation. It’s honestly so so gross. Will not buy again. Such a bummer. nan
