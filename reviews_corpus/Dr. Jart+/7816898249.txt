This product blends seamlessly into the skin and builds up to a medium coverage. I have combo skin(dry w/ oily t-zone) and this lasts all through my 8 hour work day and then some. The one big downside is the shade range. Yes this is a light coverage product but the shades need to be expanded for the darker and fair skin tones. The under stones are way off as well. For reference I have fair skin with yellow/golden undertones and got the shade fair-light. It was a shade too dark and literally looked gray at first. Once blended in it did neutralized a little bit but was still off. Great product, terrible shade range.
