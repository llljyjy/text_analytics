First time using a Dr.Jart product and I am really impressed with this one. I use it after I wash my face. I’ve noticed my skin feeling a lot more smoother. My pours aren’t too noticeable. The packaging is cute I just wish it came with a dropper instead of a pump because the product is so liquidity it’s hard to use with out it spilling or splashing everywhere. nan
