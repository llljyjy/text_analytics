Instantly fell in love with how buildable the coverage is and the way it seemed to melt into my skin. It’s also quick to use when I want to go for a casual makeup look without layering too many products. My only complaint would be the niacinamide, I’m unsure of how much is in the product but I’ve come to realize that too much niacinamide can be the cause of breakouts instead of reducing them. Unfortunately that’s what happens to my skin every time I apply this, but they’re small pimples that I can slap a patch on to heal. I’ll use up my bottle for now since it was expensive, but I’d repurchase if the formula excluded niacinamide. -1 Star for Niacinamide
