I have sensitive combination skin (oily t-zone especially in the summer). I’ve tried multiple sunscreens but they make me look extra oily and they clog my pores. This is the first sunscreen I’ve used that isn’t oily on me and didn’t break me out. It leaves my skin soft, and it works! I wore it to a water park and it lasted hours (because I forgot to reapply). It’s worth every penny. Best sunscreen I’ve ever used
