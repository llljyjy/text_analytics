Overall great product! I like just being able to use this instead of moisturizer, spf, and foundation. You only need a little bit to conceal, and the product blends pretty well. I found that even with my oily skin, my skin never looked greasy. I did find the light-medium to be just slightly too dark, but not so dark I canâ€™t use the product. nan
