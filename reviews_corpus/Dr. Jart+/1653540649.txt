I have fair skin with redness in my cheeks.  I can use this in place of tinted moisturizer bc I find the coverage is pretty decent and it really cuts down on my redness.  It’s super thick and hard to spread so I always use a moisturizer first.  After initial application it’s very tacky but after about 10 mins it’s smooth. Reduces redness
