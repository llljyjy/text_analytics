I’ve been searching for the best ‘no makeup makeup’ and hands down this is the best!  Per the instructions, you only need 3 drops. A previous reviewer said the product is expensive for the size. ( she also was using 2 full dropper fulls) at once. Love the SPF. Leaves a healthy and expensive looking glow in all the right places. nan
