1. My skin looked very soft before using this peel, and amazing as for someone like me who has never owned a Dr.Jart Poor Remedy/Radiance Peel Product.   My skin felt so different knowing I got to try something different that I have never tried before especially after using this peel. The changes that I noticed after using this peel is how smooth/soft this peel left my skin looking. It made my own skin feel very refreshed. No, I did not experience any redness or irritation after using the peel. How the peel felt on my skin it is made it look very smooth and soft, it also felt very moisturizing. The texture felt very smooth and not as hard to put on/apply. Yes, this is important to me that this peel is dermatologist tested because I know that I can trust a dermatologist’s opinion on this product, it’s better to know how safe this product is safe to use before putting it on. Yes, I would recommend this peel to others, I would also go into detail as to why I really recommend this product. Yes, I would buy this product in the future.
