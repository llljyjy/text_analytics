This sunscreen is so far the best sunscreen I have tried and I have tried a fair amount of them, from high end to low end, from brands like Murad, Tatcha, Supergoop, Biossance and so on. This sunscreen is great if you have combination to oily skin, no white cast, matte finish and stays all day long without greasiness or peeling. I love it and will continue to repurchase. It feels so good to know that my search for the perfect physical sunscreen is finally over. Thank you Dr Jart. best sunscreen ever!!!
