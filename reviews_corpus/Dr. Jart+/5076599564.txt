This is such a great product. I was so excited to try this and it did not disappoint. It is my new go to staple. My only complaint is the packaging, the pump does seem to get some air in it and requires additional pumping but nothing I canâ€™t overlook. The product is smooth, silky, and goes on beautifully.  I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a lightweight coverage for an everyday look! My new favorite BB cream!
