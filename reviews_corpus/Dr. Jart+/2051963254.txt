I have rosacea and was hoping this would help cover my redness. Instead, it made it worse. This smells like old school 1980s noxzema, which we know is awful for skin. I took only little amounts at a time, warmed it up between my fingers and only applied it to the red areas. Still looked awful. Very cakey and makeup-y. Forget applying foundation over it either. Looked even worse. I think this made my rosacea even worse. I returned it. Smells like noxzema
