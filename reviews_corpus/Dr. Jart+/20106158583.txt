I rave about this product to others who have difficulty with redness. Personally, this product over time has corrected the redness I’ve had since High School; however, this didn’t magically do it all, alone. I changed my skin care routine first, to washing my face once a week, using a skin texture correcting solution, and moisturizing twice a day (dry skin). I had to use this product on a moisturized face first, or else it would look chalky on my skin. Additionally, I only used it during the day when I was going to outside and immediately took it off with micellar water when I was done with the day. All-in-all, give it time, stay moisturized (if you need it), eventually you’ll be using this in replacement of foundation. My (casual) Foundation Replacement, In Time.
