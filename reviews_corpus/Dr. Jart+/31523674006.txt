I received this foundation from Influenster and Dr. Jart for my honest review. I’m Absolutely inlove with this!! It’s the perfect shade for my skin tone! Definitely adding this to my skin regimen. It feels a little greasy when applying but immediately mattifies. I wear it on its own on days I don’t feel like putting on a full face but I also wear it underneath my foundation on days I do wear a lot of makeup. It’s perfect. I love the way it looks. It doesn’t have a smell which is a plus, that & that it also feels super moisturizing almost. I have really sensitive skin and it’s a dream for me. I highly recommend this product! In all honesty! Love love love!
