I think this is an incredibly effective product that does exactly what it says it will. It is great for days when I am not interested in wearing foundation, and I really love how fresh, even- toned and natural it makes my skin look. I usually wear it with blush.I bought this in the smaller size, and I feel like I would rather keep buying the smaller size than to buy the full size. The treatment tends to oxidize in the jar and the product can be used sparingly, so a large jar seems illogical to me.If I use too much product, it has a sort of white cast to it, so I am careful when applying. I plan on buying this product again. Great for taking a break from foundation!
