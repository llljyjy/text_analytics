When I first tried this product, I was disappointed. Most days, I just pat a little bb cream on with my fingers and use a little mascara. When I tried this bb cream just with my fingers, it wasnâ€™t any better than my $5 drugstore one. I decided to try it out on the weekend, when I actually do my makeup. I used primer and applied the bb cream with a foundation brush. Omg it looked great! So light and natural but with pretty good coverage. I always have a hard time with foundation since I have dry and patchy skin and this looked amazing. I also love that it has skincare ingredients. Will continue to use this in replacement of my normal foundation. Great foundation replacement
