If you look at the old formulation of this BB cream, you will see negative review after review about the horrible pump that clogs and never works. When I saw they reformulated this, I was excited. I thought they would fix the product packaging when they improved the product since the feedback was overwhelming. Nope. The new formula is nice— no white cast, less greasy and very buildable. The pump and bottle however are the same. I’ve used the new bottle for less than two weeks and the pump no longer works. Nothing comes out and the bottle is very full. Same exact problem as before. The cream is just too thick for this kind of pump. I guess I’m now back to looking for a new tinted sunscreen/BB cream. pump still broken after reformulation
