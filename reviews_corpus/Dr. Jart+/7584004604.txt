this mask works for me! I generally love most dr. jart products I have tried (tiger grass line is a must!) but this mask does what it is supposed to do for me. I always wake up with reduced inflammation and blemishes and it feels hydrating. there a lot of masks on the market that really donâ€™t work for me, especially vanity masks with heavy fragrance but I love this one. a holy grail mask for me
