I got received this for free as a tester. I like it so far, I’ve only been using for ab 2 weeks. The only complaint I have it the application. I feel like 2-3 pumps isn’t enough for my face especially if I use a cotton pad. If I just apply with my hands I feel like I don’t get good coverage and I can rub it in because it dries so fast. nan
