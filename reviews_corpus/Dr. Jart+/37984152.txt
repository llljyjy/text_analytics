I really wanted to love this.  Before I purchased it I hadn’t realized it was actually tinted and thought it was just a treatment that color corrected.  I hadn’t realized it would be changing from green and depositing “skin” color. At first I put it on and it smells soooo good. It went on easily, and almost instantly I saw the redness disappear. Then I washed my hands and noticed a skin color makeup wash off my finger tips. I left color smudges on the jar too. I was still happy with the results but then noticed that I would break out from it all over my face.  Little red pimples. Also up close I saw in the mirror how it settled in my hair line which didn’t seem to blend well. I ultimately returned this and am trying the Cicapair tiger grass serum. not for me
