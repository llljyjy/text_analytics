The serum is very watery so I would recommend using a cotton pad to apply. After incorporating this into my routine, I have noticed my skin looking more dewy. My pores haven’t changed drastically but I think they’re a little less noticeable. Because this is acting as an exfoliant, I like to use a good essence and moisturizer with it! nan
