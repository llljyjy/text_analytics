This is a great, light, tinted moisturizer for the summer months. It is very thin on the skin and blends very nicely. I love how it contains SPF, however, it does have a strong sunscreen smell. This doesnâ€™t bother me, but the smell might bother others. Great product overall though, would definitely recommend! Great, lightweight summer moisturizer!
