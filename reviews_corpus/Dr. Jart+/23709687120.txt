I have tried dozens of SPF’s for the past two+ years. What I look for in an SPF is that it doesn’t pill and separate off my skin, making my makeup look horrrrid and my skin look scaly. This spf is literally one of my absolute favorites out of all the ones I’ve tried. It melts seamlessly into skin, it’s hydrating, not irritating, and my makeup looks flawless like it should. It even pairs well with some Marula oil underneath. nan
