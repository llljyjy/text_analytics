I don’t get the rave reviews! I have dry sensitive skin and rosacea. First it has a very gritty texture. Second the product is VERY thick. I tried warming in my hands before applying but it didn’t do much. Because it’s so thick it doesn’t spread easily over your skin, so I had to wipe and dab repeatedly in order to apply it. Because of that my already sensitive skin became even more irritated and red. If you have any dry patches anywhere- it’s going to accentuate them. A lot. I like the concept of this product, I don’t like the execution of it. Aggravated my skin
