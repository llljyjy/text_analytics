I received this from Influenster for my honest review in the medium-tan shade. I am impressed with how dark the shade is as I’ve always looked for BB creams that were way too pink and light. This shade was actually slightly dark for me, but it wore well and didn’t cause any breakouts. I would definitely try a lighter shade and hope it matches. nan
