I didn’t like this product at all. It was too thick and didn’t do anything for my rosacea, other than some slight camouflaging of the red areas.I’m surprised at how many people like this product as it’s too thick for oily skin, not easy to spread, and not moisturing enough for those with dry skin. Heavy product with minor results
