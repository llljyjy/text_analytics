This is great. I have fair skin with some redness as I have rosacea. I always have trouble with normal foundations/skin tints looking too orange/warm on my skin so it’s been tricky finding products that match me. I wanted something that would color correct and still be “light” on the skin, so i chose this serum over the cream and this ended up working wonderfully. It literally just looks like I have perfect, even toned skin. It has a menthol kinda smell that dissipates after dry-down. I wouldn’t think twice about applying this along with the rest of my makeup for most days- I wouldn’t even add additional foundation on top because my skin already looks perfect with this product. If you’re into the minimalist makeup look, go for this. It worked well when added on top of my usual supergoop unseen sunscreen (you’ll wanna add more SPF since this is only SPF 35 and you’re barely getting the entire amount if you’re using this sparingly to cover up redness here and there.)Note: If you have very red skin and are looking for something that covers dark redness, this may not be heavy-duty enough. If you have light redness and it’s not working too well, make sure you shake it well before each use. ❤️❤️
