I got a sample of this from an employee trying to help me find something to even out my redness. I think this might be worth trying! It feels similar to a moisturizer but changes colors into a beige shade like a tinted moisturizer. In my photo, the left side of my face has 3 drops of the Fenty Eaze Drops in shade 2 neutral, and the right side has just a couple fingertip dabs of the Dr. Jart Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting treatment. I concentrated both products on the reddest parts of my face- the cheeks, chin, nose, and center of the forehead. I blended just outside these target areas to blend them in with my natural face color, but otherwise used the least amount of each product to achieve the minimal results I was looking for. I think the Cicapair corrector ended up looking more natural, and actually canceled out more redness than the Fenty Eaze Drop side! In my little side by side test of these two products, Dr. Jart wins! Cicapair outperformed Fenty Eaze Drops
