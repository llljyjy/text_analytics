I finished the whole tube! Love the fact its 50+ spf, the smell is ok, it is hard to take off, if I dont take off it breaks me out. Dr Jart products are all do what they claim no doubt, but its until u stop using than u see the difference in your skin, sometimes its good sometimes it not. And TBH this is one of those I am undecided about. I love the fact its hard to take off because that means it will work longer. Dont like the white cast but I powder it with powder foundation, and it works great for everyday “your skin but better” and spf protected look. Its one of the expensive ones, but it works. So as you can see it has its pros and cons hence the reason 3 stars. you can make it work!
