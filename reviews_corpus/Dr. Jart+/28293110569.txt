I have sensitive, acne prone skin, and often redness. This product is quite thick, and not easy application (more like a liquid clay mask than a lotion). It is difficult to spread evenly, which leaves your skin looking a bit patchy anyway. It feels pretty heavy on the skin, heavier than foundation does. It doesn’t really absorb into the skin at all, just sits on top.My biggest issue, however, is the colour. I followed the application instructions every time I have tried it, but the tint is very warm/yellow. I am sure that would look natural on someone with warm skin, but it looked like I used orange foundation on my face.Love the fact that it has SPF, and it didn’t break me out, but I don’t feel like this was money well spent. not for someone with cool undertones
