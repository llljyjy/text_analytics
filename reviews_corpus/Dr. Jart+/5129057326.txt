This would be my holy grail produce:  perfect consistency, lighter weight than IT CC and melts into my skin. But, I can only use it for a day or two in a row before it irritates my skin- niacinamide might be a great ingredient, but if you are sensitive to it- then you know. It dries out my skin like nothing else. If you donâ€™t have a problem with niacinamide, then give this a try! I purchased the medium. It is a bit darker than expected. nan
