I was so excited to get this & I have never used a BB cream before. I have combo/oily acne prone skin & I usually shy away from BB creams because they tend to feel heavy on my skin. This felt heavy & the shade was too dark. Also my face was so shiny & I got oily throughout the day. I noticed after I started using this I broke out with painful pustule acne on my chin. I haven’t gotten a breakout like that since my teen years. I stopped using this and my acne went away. If you have dry skin & you are not prone to acne I can see this working for you. Unfortunately for me; this is a major no. Made me breakout….
