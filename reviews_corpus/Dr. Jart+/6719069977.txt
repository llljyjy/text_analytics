I got this as a sample, hoping that it help with my dry, red, sensitive skin... I Apply it even tho it was very fragrant... Well I felt a burning sensation imidiatly... Tried it a second time and burn as well... Found out there is essential oil in it... I am very sad because I can tell that my skin was plump... If you have no problem with EO, itâ€™s very hydrating and rich. Burning sensation not for sensitive skin
