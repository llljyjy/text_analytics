I already used this toner for about a month. And it really works great. As a person who tried too many toners from different brands, i can say that this one is already in my top 3 list. It doesnâ€™t left oily feeling after appliying which i was searching for. And yes, it has an effect on acne. I also purchased a moisturizer and a cleanser from the same serie so i hope i will get the best result In my top 3
