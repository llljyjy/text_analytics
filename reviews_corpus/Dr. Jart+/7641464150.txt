Again after receiving the sample of this with an order it was a must. I have dry skin with combination areas of black & white head areas plus large pore’s. I’ve been able to keep my pores cleaned out but leaving me with open holes on my nose and chin area. After using this 2 nights the holes closed! So finally after putting on making they don’t stand out. No primer has solved this issue for me. I wish I had a before and after pic but I didn’t know what it would do nan
