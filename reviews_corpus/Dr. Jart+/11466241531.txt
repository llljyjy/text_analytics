I’m the lightest shade most of the time in any foundation. Porcelain pink undertone. This is an INSANE sticky mess even after letting it dry for 20 mins. You need to pack in a translucent powder which sucks. But the coverage is weirdly great and lasts all day without being cakey. the two sunscreen ingredients arent toxic either they’re actually the only two that are safe to use! 2 stars less for stickiness. Bare minerals tinted moisturizer is 5 stars for me not needing to powder it Weird sticky magic
