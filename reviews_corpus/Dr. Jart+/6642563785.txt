loved this mask!! I feel like I never use up my clay masks because it’s such a hassle to apply and wash off and then clean my sink but this is a cool concept to make it clay masks more convenient to use! It’s also much less drying than a usual wash off mask (as long as you don’t leave it on too long)! I used this the morning after sleeping in my makeup and I didn’t break out at all the week afterwards. Would definitely repurchase this! Easier than wash off masks!
