I have been looking for a new product that was lightweight and had spf protection so I am so happy that I was sent this product. The Tan color for me was perfect however I will say the shade range is very limited. I hope that they expand the range because I think more people should try the product. It’s lightweight, natural finish, and blends beautifully. The one downside for me is it has the quintessential beauty balm scent but thankfully it’s not as strong as other brands. It works well with all of the products I have tried with it so it will be a new staple in my routine. New Staple
