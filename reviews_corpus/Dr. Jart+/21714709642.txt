This product has a very strong smell and is quite thick to the point it’s not very spreadable, making it hard to actually blend into the skin, it looks and feels like it just sits on top rather than getting absorbed into the skin,It doesn’t irritate the skin which I am honestly surprised by as it looks and smells like something that should not be good to put on the skin, but I can’t tell if anything good is happening either. I just end up a pasty, shy looking and patchy mess, and would not feel comfortable wearing this as a base for other skincare and/ or makeup. I don’t think this is a practical SPF either, so would only work as a spot color corrector, which defeats the point of this being expensive for having a high SPF rating.This happens to be the 2nd product I have got as a sample from Sephora by this brand (the other being a moisturizer), and both have been extremely disappointing especially with the high price point and constant promotion of this brand. Cosmetically unwearable
