I honestly didn’t expect this to work as well as it does in the videos I was seeing in the fb ads for this product but I was pleasantly surprised. I had a lot of skin problems as a teen so now I struggle with uneven skin tone and redness but this really helps improve that. I usually either wear this by itself with a bit of translucent powder or I wear it as a base underneath my makeup. My only problem with this is that I wouldn’t say it has a “natural“ finish as it makes my face look really shiny but if I top it off with some translucent powder then it’s perfect. Pleasantly surprised
