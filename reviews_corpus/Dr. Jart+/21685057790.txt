I received this product for free from Influenster and Cicapair in exchange for my honest review and opinion. I want to start by saying I just love how fun & cute the packaging is! I love these 3 products they work so well. I was hesitant about it at first. As I have used different products in the past that didn’t do wjat they were supposed to & left my skin dry and in worse condition. I usually use this at night and I the morning the redness has either disappeared or is almost gone. I can’t believe how well it works! It doesn’t dry out my skin. It’s great for people with sensitive skin and struggling with redness. I’m definitely going to get this when I run out. Definitely recommend! Great product
