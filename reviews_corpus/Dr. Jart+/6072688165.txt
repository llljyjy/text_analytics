I really like this product. It gives nice, dewy coverage while also feeling weightless on your skin. I love that it has SPF too. It blends so easily and doesn’t look cakey at all. It is long wearing. The packaging is a little annoying because it doesn’t like to come out but otherwise I really like this. I received it complimentary in exchange for my review. I would recommend to everyone. nan
