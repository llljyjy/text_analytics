Dr jart bb cream is amazing! The texture is silky smooth when applying and it doesn’t particularly have a smell so that is nice . When it dries it leaves your skin smooth and hydrated. Didn’t have to reapply unless I was outside so atleast once . One thing I didn’t like at times it made my skin feel dry Amazing!
