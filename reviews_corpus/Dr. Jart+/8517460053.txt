I bought this on a whim before my beach vacation. I’m so, so happy I did! Usually my face burns terribly in Mexico, but I haven’t been burned once since using this. You can see, however, towards my hairline where I didn’t put any product, totally did! That redness could have been my whole face. I have not noticed any white cast, nor has it broken me out (which happened with the last facial sunscreen I had). I use it in the mornings as a moisturizer replacement and then sometimes again after swimming in the ocean. 10/10. No sunburn, no breakouts
