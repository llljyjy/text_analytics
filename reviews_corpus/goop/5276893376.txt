I like that this is a pretty gentle exfoliate but even then I would only use it 1-2 times per week. The cleansing part was not the greatest for me. I just might prefer these 2 things separate but if you like to do both at once this is for you. Smells nice, very light citrus. Love the design and the way the bottle opens just half way to squeeze the amount you want out. My fave does feel very smooth and soft after using. Nice to use 1-2 times a week
