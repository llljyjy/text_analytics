I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I have used this product for just under three weeks now and I have noticed only a small difference in my dark spots. I am curious if continued use will improve these results. The things that I am not thrilled with is the texture of this. I almost felt like it had a sticky feel to it, that wasn’t my favorite. The packaging is ok, it is functional and I would say has a modern minimalist design. It is easy to use and otherwise seems to be pretty good. I have seen some results but I was hoping to see a bit more at this point. I would recommend this to others who don’t mind the texture aspect. Works Well, a bit odd texture
