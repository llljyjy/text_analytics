I have been using this product for almost two months. 3 - 4 days weekly. I havenâ€™t seen much change. It has a strange smell as well. If I used daily for a longer time. I might see a change in the dark spots on my face. But for the price, I cannot purchase. Pic on left today, pic on right 9/28. Might Work in Time?
