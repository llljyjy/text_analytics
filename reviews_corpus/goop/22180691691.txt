This is a great addition to my skincare routine. I have combination skin that can get both very oily and very dry at the same time. This cleanser helps balance everything out. It dissolves the oils and exfoliates the dry skin while also leaving my face feeling soft, hydrated and moisturized. I absolutely love the way my skin feels after using this cleanser. Highly recommend!! Love It!!!
