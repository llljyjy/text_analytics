I like this cleanser. The exfoliation is gentle, and I did not have any problems using this daily. Also, I felt that my skin did look a little brighter after using. I received this product in exchange for a review, and while I do like using it, I don’t feel that it’s gone above and beyond other cleansers or gentle exfoliants I’ve used before (although it’s nice to have everything in one step!). nan
