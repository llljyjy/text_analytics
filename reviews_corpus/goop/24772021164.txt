I am so in love with my Goop Jelly cleanser! I use this every morning and every night it does not strip my skin. The little beads feel so good and it exfoliate so well but also being very gentle! I have not broke out using this and I recommend this to anyone who are looking for a good exfoliator that is also gentle! Gentle but gets the job done!
