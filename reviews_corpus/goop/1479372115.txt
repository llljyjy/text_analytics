I’m feeling pretty mixed about this cleanser. It does not lather, which kind of defeats the purpose of a cleanser for me. I had to mix it with a gel cleanser to feel like I got a good clean. I also prefer to use chemical exfoliators because I feel like physical ones, like this one, can be a little harsh on the skin. However, I think this cleanser is still a lot gentler than like a St. Ives Apricot scrub situation, but still not really for me. The upside of this product is that it is best used on the neck and other parts of the body where the skin isn’t so delicate. But, there are other better, less expensive products for a larger size that would be best suited for that. I had higher hopes for this cleanser, but this was not really a win for me! nan
