I generally exfoliate my face about once a week, my generally preferred product is Dr. Brandt Skincare Microdermabrasion Skin Exfoliant, which I’ll be returning to using.The goop cleanser has a very sharply fruity smell to it, not unpleasant.  The gel part of the formula felt great, and did leave my oily skin feeling quite soft and hydrated after washing every day this week, but I hated the scrub part!  It felt like large crystals of course sugar and after I washed my face and rinsed quite thoroughly I still kept finding large grains of sugar stuck to my face.  The scrub’s texture was more St Ive’s apricot scrub, and I’m just not a fan of that on my face.  I’ll probably be using the rest of this bottle on my legs before shaving because I did think it left my skin feeling nice, but it was just not quite right for my face. Okay Cleanser
