I received this product as part of a promotion and I will definitely buy it after now using it. I am over 40, and my daughter is 16. We both have different skin issues (aging vs hormonal acne) but both have sensitive skin. This product is gentle for both of our needs yet does the job to exfoliate dead skin cells. Many exfoliator are rough and cause more issues but this one is gentle enough to use daily. It has a light fresh slightly citrus/herbal scent. It feels like I’m putting something healthy on my face when using it. I found it rinses off well too and wasn’t drying after either. Highly recommend. Scrub for All Generations!
