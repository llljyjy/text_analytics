This is best body butter I’ve used. My skin feels amazingly soft when I use this product. I’m taking off a star for price and smell though. I go through this too fast for the price point. I also don’t love the smell. It’s musky and reminiscent of patchouli which can read as as body odor. It’s not an overwhelming smell and I don’t find it lingers. That said, it would be great if they could change the scent. I still buy it and continue to use it because it makes my skin feel and look that good. So deeply hydrating. Keep taking my money GP.
