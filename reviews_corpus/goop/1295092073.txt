So insanely over priced BUT it made my sun spots DISAPPEAR. its my Sunday night to use this and after a few months I actually have to look for where they used to be. Also amazing exfoliant for pre-self tan as well. If it werenâ€™t for the brightening effect it had on my sun damage I wouldnt bother but its worth it. Fades sun damage! but for $$$$$$$$$$
