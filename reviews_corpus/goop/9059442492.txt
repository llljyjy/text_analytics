I have been using this product for a good 40 nights, hoping to see some lightening of my sunspots. I have honestly not seen a lot of change. I can definitely feel a little bit of tingling when I  apply the product on my skin. I know that it takes a really long time to see any change, so I will continue to apply this product for several months. Iâ€™m hoping to see at least a little bit of change, but so far nothing significant. Tingling at first but no lightening yet
