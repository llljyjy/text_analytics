I like the colors; a nice sheer wash giving a ’your lips, but better’ tint, and they’re very moisturizing, but the taste is very off-putting. It’s very sweet, which is fine if you’re not eating anything while you’re wearing any of the shades, but if you are, it rather ruins anything savory. I’ll eventually use these up, but now that I know it has such a sweet taste, they won’t be the first product I reach for. I won’t re-purchase. Tastes sweet and not in a good way
