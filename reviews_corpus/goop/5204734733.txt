I received this from Influenster complimentary for testing purposes. I followed the instructions of using the product twice a week then building up the days. It is moisturizing, and doesn’t have a strong scent. It does tingle just a bit but goes away quité quickly. I don’t have sensitive skin I can typically use any products. I do wish that the results were quick that is my only issue. Pretty Good
