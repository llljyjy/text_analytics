I received the Goop Jelly Cleanser to try it out and received this product for free from Influenster.First of all, I am very grateful for this opportunity to try this product.My experience with goop Jelly cleanser is excellent, my skin is normal to dry, it works very well, I love how it leaves the texture of my skin, it helped me remove traces of old acne that I had on my face, giving it a smoother appearance appearance, I use it every other day at night before my night routine, I also shared it with my husband, his skin is normal to oily, and it leaves an incredible shine and freshness.The non-foaming formula is convenient because it leaves the skin more hydrated, plus the smell is delicious, it’s citrusy and relaxing, when I finish my goop jelly cleanser I’m sure I’ll buy another one just like it, I loved it!
