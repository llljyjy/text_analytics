I received this product complementary from influencer. I feel this cleanser does an OK job at exfoliation. It has a light citrus smell and it does turn into a whitish soapy type facial cleanser once mixed with water. I did leave my skin feeling a little bit dry once I was done cleansing. I myself would not spend the $30 on this cleanser as a personal product for myself. nan
