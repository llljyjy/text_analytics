I love all Goop products. I have tried several and with all of them I feel satisfied and happy, my skin is mixed and requires a lot of hydration and this serum leaves it super soft and smooth, the container with a dispenser is ideal, the only thing that I do not like is its aroma, but how it is to use at night I do not care so much. I recommend her and would not hesitate to continue investing in her products. Suave y tersa
