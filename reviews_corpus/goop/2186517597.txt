After using this product, I can say that this product is exfoliating and moisturizing at the same time. I love that I can put on the serum and go to bed and the next day I can see visible difference from the night before. I like that it feels light weight and smells clean (no fragrance). I will continue to use to see if l my hyperpigmentation starts to fade away. nan
