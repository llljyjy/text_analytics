I have combination skin, not particularly sensitive, a little acne-prone-ish in the T zone and currently use a face exfoliant 2x a week .. with trying goopglow exfoliating jelly, it is a great exfoliant for more times a week as it the little beads weren’t as rough on my skin. That being said, if you want/need something more aggressive to exfoliate, this isn’t it - at least for my skin. I love the scent, it isn’t overpowering and doesn’t linger on my skin. I don’t think I noticed much change directly after using in my skin after using within my face routine for a few weeks, but it does seem a bit smoother overall. And what I didn’t notice was any acne, so goopglow isn’t causing irritation or reaction and keeping my face clean. I will continue to rotate this into my face routine and recommend for those who need more frequent/lighter exfoliating needs. Nice daily exfoliant
