I received this complimentary from influenster and goop, and so far it’s been great, it came just in time for my start on skin cycling and I really like it for exfoliating night, I wake up to soft and glowy skin, the only thing I don’t love is the scent, but I can totally get past that for a great product, I’ll have to update on long term results Great for skin cycling
