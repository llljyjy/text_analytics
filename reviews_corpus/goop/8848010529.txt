I lie exfoliating cleansers, and appreciate more gentle textures. This one is a little rougher than I’d like. I have normal skin that has occasional breakouts. This cleanser isn’t irritating, but the exfoliating beads bothered me a bit. My skin felt clean afterward, but not smooth and fresh, just normal. I also found the scent unappealing. nan
