This is an extremely gentle exfoliating cleaner. It left my skin feeling soft and didn’t leave it feeling overly dry or stripped. I did not use it to remove makeup so I can’t speak to its effectiveness for that use bit it was great to use just to provide gentle exfoliation through the week! Very gentle exfoliation
