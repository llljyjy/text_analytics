I received this free from Influenster to review.I have sensitive, combination skin, a dedicated morning and nightly skincare routine, and after pregnancy a few dark spots that I was hoping to lighten on my forehead. The serum is lightweight and not sticky after drying.My skin appeared brighter, and the spots seemed to have lightened, but I also had a facial while using this product so it could have been a combo effect. I would use this again, but the price is HIGH. For the same result, I would rather do a monthly facial or add products to my regimen that are lower cost and achieve the same results. Nice but the price is high!
