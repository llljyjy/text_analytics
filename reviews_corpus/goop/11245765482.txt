*contains Potato Pulp Extract, Apple Fruit Extract, Bitter Orange Peel Powder, Squalane and various citrus oils such as Lime, Mandarin Orange Peel and Lemon Peel oil.This is a nice non-foaming, physical exfoliating cleanser but its not my favorite. The texture is unique and slightly jelly-like with gritty granules. This cleanser has a pleasant citrus scent that lingers after being rinsed off. I find this cleanser leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean but it does feel a bit stripping/ drying. I do have combination skin type that has been leaning a little towards the drier side lately though. This may be a good option for those with more oilier skin types. Overall this cleanser does leave my skin feeling smoother and I will continue to use it maybe 1 or 2x a week as a little polishing pick-me-up for my skin nan
