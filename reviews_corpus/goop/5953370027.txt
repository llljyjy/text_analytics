I loved the texture of this cleanser, it might be a little rough for anyone with really sensitive skin but overall I think most would enjoy. The scent wasnâ€™t my favorite but it did an amazing job making my skin feel clean and soft. I should have removed make up completely before using this. Trying goop for the first time
