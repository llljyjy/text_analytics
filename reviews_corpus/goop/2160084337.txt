I tested the GOOPGLOW Exfoliating Dark Spot Sleep Serum for about six weeks. There is a slight tingling sensation after applying the serum to my face but not uncomfortable. I noticed my skin looked a bit brighter over time. I was only able to use it once a week because when I used it multiple days throughout the week I experienced breakouts. I didn’t see an extreme difference in the appearance of my skin so for that I can’t say that I would recommend this product. Just Okay
