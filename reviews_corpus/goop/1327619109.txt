This exfoliating cleanser performs well for what it is, but it doesn’t wow me. Goop recommends that you use it everyday, but I personally find that overkill given the gritty texture. I’d recommend a few times a week so as not to irritate your skin. I have combo skin, but I think any skin type could use it with little issues. Major points for the packaging: it’s a squeezy tube with a flip bottom that prevents too much from coming out and keeps it clean. I also appreciate that you can get every last bit out of it and the cap is stable, perfect for keeping on your shower wall and not worrying about it falling. The smell is not pleasant. In a blindfolded smell test, I would easily confuse this scrub with my shower cleaner. Not a fan of that. I’ll use this up but won’t repurchase. Average cleanser that smells like shower cleaner
