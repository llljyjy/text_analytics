I recently purchased the GOOPGLOW Microderm Instant Glow Exfoliator from Sephora & I know something changed in the ingredients or the way it’s manufactured. I’ve purchased it before directly from Goop online & it was completely different. This one from Sephora has a chemical smell & has a totally different texture & look. Goop either changed it or Sephora recieved a bad batch! Very disappointed especially considering the price. Bad batch
