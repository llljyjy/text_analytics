Since being back in the office I have been wearing more SPF during the day and reapplying (because I sit right next to a window). I could tell my skin was looking a little dull and congested so I was excited to try this exfoliant. Some exfoliants leave my skin red and irritated, but I’m happy to say this does not. I do think it’s a bit drying (when used daily) so some days I skip it. I also hate that I have to prewash my face when I have other makeup on prior to washing. Pretty happy!
