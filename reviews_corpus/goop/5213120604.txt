First, I received this free from Influenster to review in a voxbox campaign that was incentivized. I am on the cusp of turning 35 with combination skin, a dedicated morning and nightly skincare routine, and I have few dark spots despite all my teenage years worshiping the sun and few fine lines on my forehead. I found this serum to be very lightweight and milky when applied without being overly tacky when drying down which is always nice. I liked that the serum contains lactic and glycolic acid to help with even skin tone and shed dead skin cells, hyaluronic acid which helps draw moisture to the skin, as well as squalane to help with skins own natural moisture barrier. My skin skin definitely appeared brighter and more youthful after continual use as well as evening of my skin tone with continual use over a months time period.BUT that’s price tag, $98 for a 1 ounce serum that feels nice on the skin but doesn’t stand out and warrent such an extravagant price tag, and as someone who doesn’t hesitate to drop serious cash in products that work this is a hard pass for me on this milky serum from Goop. I feel as though I’ve achieved the same results at a fraction of the cost from brands such as The Ordinary or The Inky List, if I’m being completely honest. Yes these other two companies (just to name a few) don’t feel quite as silky and nice upon application, but the results are nearly identical. I would say, if you’re looking for a splurge serum that definitely shows results with continual use that feels beautiful on the skin, this is there serum for you. Yet, the price point is the hard pass for me as other companies offer the same results at a fraction of the price. Delivers results, but hard pass due to price point
