Since we’re going for honesty here, I have to say, right out the door, I was not a fan.  I love my serums, but this was just not doing it for me. I noticed the next morning that my face still felt tacky… and I really did not like that. My skin has been going through some changes and being a little bit more on the oilier side, I really hated waking up to my face feeling tacky!  I can’t really explain it. But I noticed the night before when I applied the serum that it did it feel a little sticky, like it wasn’t fully soaking into my skin. I didn’t think much of it because I figured it would do it’s thang. But waking up and still feeling my face with that kind of sticky feeling was just not what I wanted from a serum. And $100? If I don’t like the consistency of the product then I’m not inclined to paying the luxe price... Hard No.
