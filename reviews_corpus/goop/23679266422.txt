As one that has combination skin, it is important to exfoliate my skin at least 3 times a week to keep it looking rejuvenated. The two key ingredients that caught my eye were Cloudberry and Squalane as they help bring lots of nourishment and hydration while getting rid of all the dirt and impurities in my skin. It makes a great combination. Also, like that the soft, jelly texture is not irritating to my skin as I am prone to blemishes and sensitivity. The texture of the product is so gentle that it didnâ€™t feel like rubbing sandpaper as opposed to other exfoliants I have tried before. The scent is amazing, reminds me of a freshly, peeled orange.However, I like to incorporate this exfoliant into my nighttime routine along with my toner, Vitamin C elixir (safe to use with this product), Gua Sha stone (or microneedle derma roller), night cream, and eye cream. I like to scrub away all the dead cells at night as that is when the skin cells renew. So, when I woke up, I noticed a silky-smoother, fresh, radiant glow. Also, helps with a smoother makeup application, too!Yes, I would recommend this product for an easy, soft way to provide a lovely glow to the skin. This product will help the skin get that longed-for glow, improve skin tone, and conditions, such as acne or blackheads. Gentle, Safe Exfoliant.
