I’ve only been using this for a short time but I can tell my dark spots are fading. It’s so hard to find something that works!  This has a milky consistency and doesn’t irritate my skin like some chemical exfoliators can. I didn’t experience any stinging or burning. It’s comfortable on the skin, and in the morning my skin is so soft!  I would recommend this to anyone trying to fade dark spots. New staple in my routine!
