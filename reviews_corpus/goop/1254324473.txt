This is a really good cleanser because the oatmeal gently exfoliates the skin and the grapefruit purifies the skin. My face felt clean, tight, soft, and hydrated after washing. I did not notice any difference in brightening. It smells like grapefruit and chemicals to me. Mostly, I deducted a star because my mascara did not wash off easily. It left a coating on my lashes and the parts that did was off adhered to my skin after washing. I had to use mascara remover on my eyes and witch hazel on my face to remove the mascara completely. I wanted to upload pictures to show you but the app isnâ€™t allowing me to. Wash your mascara off separately.
