I received this face wash as a product to review from Influenster I really loved how smooth it made my face feel. It really is a good exfoliating face wash. However I only used it a few times because of the smell. I thought that I could get past it and maybe get used to it because it really did work. Nope I couldn’t take it. If they could fix the smell a bit it would be a product I would buy. But because there are products out there that work just as good and don’t have such a horrible smell unfortunately it is a no from me. Which again is sad because it really did work. what is that smell…
