Honestly, I really didn’t think that I was going to like this, being that it came from Goop. But I wanted to give it a shot anyway - and I don’t regret it. I love this cleanser. I can see why some people would hate the scent, but I think it’s lovely. Its a pretty strong citrus smell, but it is refreshing. My normally dry and rough skin feels instantly smoother and softer after using this. It didn’t break me out at all, or cause any irritation or redness, and it wasn’t too harsh on my skin. As much as I didn’t want to like a goop product this much, I think I may be rebiying this one. nan
