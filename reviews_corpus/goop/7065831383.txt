This brush is incredibly dry and left a whole bunch of scratches on my skin and itâ€™s been hurting for an hour. I even tried with lotion and touching super super lightly and it is incredibly painful. Honestly feels like something I would clean my bathroom with. There are also super long bristles sticking out .
