I’ve been trying out everything to see what I like best and this is really honestly one of my new favorite overnight skin routine items now.  I wake up with fresh soft skin.. My skin was tired and dehydrated and starting to show age... I’m trying to reverse this.  At 51 I don’t have much time to reverse but this sure helps a lot.  I’m a new fan. Worth adding this to my routine.  YOU DON’T feel oily or gross.. it really feeds my skin.  My results are not immediate but they are there!! I’m liking my skin better each day! My New addition I love waking up after using!
