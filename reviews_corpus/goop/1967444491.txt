Has a great handle and curve to reach body parts.  The price is steep $25.00. I have to admit I only purchased it after hearing Gwyneth Paltrow rave about it.  It did help my legs relax.  After a shower I used it before bed it helped relax my legs. great feeling. I found other body brushes for $5.00 at Target, but no handle. NOT FOR THE PRICE
