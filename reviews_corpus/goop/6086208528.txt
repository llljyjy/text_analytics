I have been using this product for a month now and have been pretty pleased with it. I haven’t noticed any huge changes in my skin, but I do see some changes. The redness on my skin has toned down and a few of my acne scars have faded a bit. Something I don’t like is it leaves a sticky feeling on my skin after application. Knocked a star off because of the cost, not worthy of the $98 price tag. Nice product, not worth the luxury price
