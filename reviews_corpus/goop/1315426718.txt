Gwyneth knows all, but … this was my first Sephora return in years. The product itself was too soft (it fell to the side right away) and the tube would be empty in a flash. The highlight is how chic the packaging is, but that wasn’t enough this time. Still love you though, GP. Xx Chic packaging, underwhelming otherwise
