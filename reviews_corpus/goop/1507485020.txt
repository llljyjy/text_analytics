Overall, I like this cleanser. It gently exfoliates, doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, and works well to remove makeup at the end of the day without causing redness.  I like that the exfoliators don’t feel like they’re cutting into my skin, it feels nice without stripping the skin too much.  However, I’m not too fond of the scent. There’s something a little off with it and although it isn’t too strong, there’s something off putting about the smell. It dissipates rather quickly after use and it’s usually gone by the time I use toner so it isn’t too big of a deal.  I liked the consistency of the cleanser, something between a jelly and a scrub. I would definitely recommend this if you have sensitive skin. Solid exfoliating cleanser for sensitive skin
