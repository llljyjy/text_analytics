I love how scrubby this facial wash is. It’s has a lot of exfoliating beads in it and it really gets in the your pores. My skin feels like a baby’s bottom. My ONLY complaint and why I knocked off one star is the smell! I used it several times and couldn’t put my finger on it. I went on to clean my bathroom and that’s what the face wash reminded me of, CLOROX BLEACH! Idk if I would buy this again now that I can’t get over the smell of me putting Clorox bleach on my face. Idk how everyone on here says it smells great, it smells like cleaning products! nan
