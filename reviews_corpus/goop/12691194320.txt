I received this item as a free sample and thought it was a great cleanser. The bottle is a good size, smells citrusy like oranges so your face feels fresh and clean when you wash your face. I do have sensitive skin so i was gentle with the pressure I used to rub the product on my face since it does contain little beads (more like a scrub). Face felt refreshed after my wash! Will probably only use 2x a week since it is an exfoliator despite the instructions on the bottle. I was nervous to to try this after reading reviews since i have sensitive skin but i am very pleased with this goop cleanser. Feels expensive. Worth the price! Worth it!
