I’m was diagnosed allergic to propyleneglycol and fragrance six years ago. So many products without these ingredients are formulated to avoid agitating skin at all costs and don’t actually exfoliate. Even though it’s on the pricey side, this product is a dream. It’s propylene-glycol free and no fragrance is added. Physical exfoliants can be dialed up or down depending on how long/hard you scrub and glycolic acid goes to work if you choose to leave it on after cleansing. No irritation whatsoever, and yet, my face is soft and glowing! Highly recommend. Effective and Nonirritating
