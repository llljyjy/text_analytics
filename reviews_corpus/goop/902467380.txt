I received this from Infuenster in wxchange for my honest review.  I was excited to try a Goop product, as their line was new to me.  I didnt love the texture or smell, so after a week or two. With minimal results, i stopped using it on my face  Seeing other reviewers using it on spots off their faces makes me want to try it on spots on my arms and legs, so I will try that next.  I didnt feel it did much for my pores and my face was a litle flaky after using it. nan
