I received this product fairly recently and I must say I love it! Obviously I haven’t used it long but so far so good, it has a very nice scent that it’s mild, nothing too overpowering. I use it at night and I see and improvement with my dryness. I also must say that I have a very sensitive skin with a lot of allergies and this does well for my skin. It hasn’t made me break out and it doesn’t feel abrasive like some other exfoliating products do. I will definitely replace the bottle when it runs out. Wonderful jelly
