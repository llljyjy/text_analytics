I am used to using exfoliants where the grains are smaller in size. But this was very good. A little goes a long way. I use it in the shower, and it leaves my skin nice and soft and smooth. I have a sensitivity to strong smells, and this product does not have an overwhelming scent. Bonus, I used this exfoliant elsewhere besides my face in between waxes. Good stuff!
