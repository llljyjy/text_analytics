I received this product free from influenster for my honest review. I  love a good exfoliating scrub and I honestly LOVED the way it felt on my skin as I was applying it. I noticed when I started using this product that it dried out my skin. I already have dry skin so this made it a tad worse. I actually started using it on my arms and legs since it didnâ€™t work out for my face. I like this for my arms and legs because it leaves them nice and soft! I would recommend to a friend as a body scrub or to someone who has more oil to their face. That is just my personal take. Love the texture but dried out my skin
