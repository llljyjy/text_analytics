I was pretty skeptical about using this product, as I have had spots on my skin from the sun for years. I didnâ€™t notice much of a difference initially, but keeping up with it, and using it every evening, after about 2 to 3 weeks I did notice that my spots were getting lighter! It definitely also brightens the skin. It does tingle a little bit at first, and I think the skin just needs to get used to it. Would definitely recommend it ! Good add to the nighttime routine!
