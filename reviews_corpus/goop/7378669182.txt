I’m kinda bummed with how not magnificent this product is. I read the reviews and knew I was going to be paying a lot of money for a very (very) little so I won’t say more about that.I expected to see results for the $$ and it just hasn’t happened, maybe after the first use but 3 weeks in to regular use and my skin is not “renewed” or healthier looking in any way. The positive: it definitely exfoliates. Natural ingredients.As always, be mindful that everyone’s skin is different and others might have better results than I’m having? Wish I had better news :(
