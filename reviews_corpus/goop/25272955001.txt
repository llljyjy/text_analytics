I got this product for free in for my honest review.  This serum is not thick or sticky which I love!  My skin is super sensitive and this product didnâ€™t break me out or anything. It left my skin smooth, glowy, soft, and I now have less visible pores. My dark spots are starting to become lighter which is amazing! Overall great product but the price is $98.00 which is a little steep; but this product does work.  I would reccomend this product! Dark spot serum
