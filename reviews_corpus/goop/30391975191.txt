I’m usually not into these types of cleansers that have exfoliant but this one smells good, makes my skin feel nice and the little grit in it is small. It does not really get foamy but it still feels like my skin is getting cleaned. It says to use morning and night but I have only been using it at night because my skin is sensitive and also dry in the winter. After using this and washing off with a washcloth, I put on moisturizer. If you’re looking to integrate something like this into your skin regimen, I would recommend this product.I got this product for free from Influenster for my honest review Pretty good product
