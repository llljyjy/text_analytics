This product is pretty great! Saw visible results the next day and better after 7 days of usage. Day one I did experience tingling and was worried but actually had zero reaction or irritation. Used the recommended 2 pumps and layered it with a moisturizer. (Washed face, moisturizer, GoopGlow then more moisturizer on top) I used it daily for 4 days straight and looked brighter and more even toned around my chin area.  I use Retinaldhyde/Retinol daily so I stopped using it before using this product. Very important.Iâ€™d definitely recommend. Really good even-tone brightening product!
