The GoopGlow Cloudberry Exfoliating Jelly Cleanser is an interesting product. I’ve used both exfoliating products and cleansers before, so this one is definitely comparable to the others I have used (mostly big box store brands). The key question is: do I think that Goop provides a better experience than cheaper alternatives? I’m not sure. I found it to be about the same. The scent isn’t too bad, and my skin did feel exfoliated afterwards. I’m guessing beyond the brand name, the higher price is due to the higher quality of ingredients. Overall, I think it can be a fun indulgence, but as a daily cleanser, I think I need to find something more budget-friendly. Worth it? Maybe...
