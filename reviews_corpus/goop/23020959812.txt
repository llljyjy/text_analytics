I received it from Influenster for review purposes. I love this cleanser. It has a very refreshing mild smell and a very light scrub. You need to remove tour make-up and then use this cleanser. I have a very sensitive skin and i did not have any skin issues after using it. I will definitely buy it and will recommend it to everyone who wants to try it. Love it
