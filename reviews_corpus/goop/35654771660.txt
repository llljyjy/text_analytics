I have to say I’ve only does this product for three days. But I seem to love the way it makes my face feel. My face feels smooth and soft. I also love the way it doesn’t dry out my skin too much. The one thing I have to say is I’m not sure that I like the way that it smells. It kind of has a cleansing smell to it like a house cleaner of sorts. I’m going to continue to use this product and I would recommend it for you to try. So far so great
