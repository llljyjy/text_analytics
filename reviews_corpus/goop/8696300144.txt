Background on myself: I have combination skin, since it’s winter time it’s in the dryer side. My skin tone is uneven in spots & I a little bit of texture issues. But nothing serious like acne scars, it’s more of hyperpigmentation from being a person of color. I’m 38 years old.Okay on to the review. I’ve been using this for approximately 10 weeks. I took pictures day one and tonight. Without looking at the pics, I’ve noticed my skin looks brighter & has a glow to it. Once I looked at the pictures though, other than the glow I don’t notice a difference in my texture or the spots that were noticeably discolored. But I will continue using to see if get more results in the future.I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. Goopglow
