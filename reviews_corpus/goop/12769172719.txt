I’ve been using this exfoliating serum for a few weeks now. I was a bit hesitant to try because I have sensitive skin but I was pleasantly surprised. It exfoliates without over drying my skin. Overall it’s an okay product I’m not fully convinced because I didn’t see much of a difference especially considering the high price point. ..
