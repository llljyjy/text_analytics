I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! I have drier skin in the winter months and was excited to use a product that exfoliates the face. This product certainly delivered on its promise; my skin felt new, refreshed, and I was even glowing! I wouldn’t recommend using this product more than 1x/wk, as it is rather abrasive (but that’s what it is supposed to be, right?) and your skin will definitely appreciate some rejuvenating time between uses. Some products I’ve tried will have my skin getting oily midday, but this product kept the oils at bay until I was getting ready for bed! Exfoliates Perfectly
