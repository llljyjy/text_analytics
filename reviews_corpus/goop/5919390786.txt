After using it for a few weeks, I have not seen much difference in my skin, for the price. it feels a little more hydrated but dark spots seem the same. My skin has become more sensitive and this did not irritate it. I’ll continue to use it and see if there’s a difference then. I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. nan
