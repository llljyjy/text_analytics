It’s an ok cleanser. I have an acne prone skin type, and it is gentle for me. I wish it was a little more foamy. I use this cleanser as second face wash, as I feel I need a deeper cleanse before using this gel. I am ok with the scent. It is just a cleanser, so it’s really ok. I love that it doesn’t irritate my skin. it’s ok!
