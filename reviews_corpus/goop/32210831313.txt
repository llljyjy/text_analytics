I was sent this by Influenster for review. I would definitely repurchase this. I have rosacea and sensitive skin and this did not irritate it or make it dry. I also appreciated that it did not leave that dry, cracked sensation when all the oil is stripped. This was excellent for removing makeup and just left my skin feeling clean. Really good cleanser
