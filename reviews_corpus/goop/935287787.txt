This is a really nice light exfoliating face wash. It has a light scent but absolutely no lather. The packaging boasts great ingredients like vitamin c, squalene and a natural exfoliant from orange peel. I like that this jelly exfoliant is gentle enough to use every day but I think I’ll probably go back to using origins ginseng daily scrub because I love it. This jelly cleanser is a close second (but tbh I don’t love the no lather). Also, the beads often stick to my eyelids (for some reason) and because they’re small I don’t always notice it right away which can be annoying when I go to apply make up. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. It’s a good product and I’d recommend (unless you’re like me and prefer a little lather in you’re morning scrub:)). nan
