The first thing I noticed when I used it was the scent. It smelled like a cleaning product, like Lysol. Hehe. I thought that the cleanser would produce some bubbles but it did not. To me, it was more like a face scrub. I love the packaging and the ingredients seemed clean so I give stars for that. I didnâ€™t feel like it left my skin supple and soft like the cleansers I have used before. nan
