This product has a Pleasant sent, it feels really nice on my skin. I used it in the shower a few times now and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. It seems to work well on my combination skin. It helps slough off some of the dry skin I have on certain parts of my face while also not irritating more sensitive parts of my face. I will continue to use it. nan
