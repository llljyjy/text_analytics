Thank you to Goop and Influenster for sending me the Dark Spot Exfoliating Sleep Milk Serum for free in exchange for my honest review. Goop is such a high-end brand that I was thrilled to receive the serum. As a 45-year-old with highly sensitive and reactive skin, I was excited to try for discoloration but scared at the same time!  So many brands that claim to exfoliate or brighten leave my skin red and raw. Not with this product! I tested the product first on my hand and didn’t even feel a tingle so I tried it on my face after my nightly cleansing routine making sure not to use any products that could possibly react with this product. I used the recommended amount (a little went a long way) and followed with my night oil to buffer my skin in case the product was too strong. This was also recommended in the directions if you were unsure of the product.  I woke the next day to zero reaction and my skin felt smooth and looked bright. I never felt any tingle or burn. I didn’t want to risk over exposure so I skipped a night and then used it again but this time without the oil as a buffer and again I had no negative reaction. I’ve been using this every other day since receiving and my skin has still had no adverse effects. My skin is smooth and bright after using and I do believe that my red blemish marks from old blemishes have faded. I do not have any “dark spots“ really to test this product on but it has my face looking brighter and smoother without the burn! Surprisingly safe for sensitive skin!
