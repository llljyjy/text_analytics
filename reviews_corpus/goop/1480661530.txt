Even though it’s listed as something that can be used every day, I would not recommend it for anyone with sensitive or dry skin. I’ve used it twice and found my skin to be dry and taut (not in a good way). I was hoping for it to be a gentle Kelly cleanser but the texture and feel is of a scrub. A no go for me. Not for sensitive or dry skin.
