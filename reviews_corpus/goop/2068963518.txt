Out of this trio, love the clear lip balm the best. It does have the perfect texture and “slip“ as described. I love that they don’t have a significant taste or smell. I’ve got chronically dry, flakey lips, so the tinted balms didn’t work for me because of the way the formula settled into the dry parts of my lips & didn’t look or feel right. I’ll still use them at home until they’re gone because I hate to waste product. I found Quench tinted balm by Tarte works better for me. I love a good deal, so I would purchase a trio of the Goop clear lip balm; one for the purse, one for the office and one for my travel kit. Love the clear balm...the tinted, not for me.
