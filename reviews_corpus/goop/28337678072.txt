I received this for free in exchange for review. I have been using this for close to a month and while I do not see a reduction in dark spots, I do feel my skin is a little bit smoother and shinier. The serum goes on well and while it is a little sticky, itâ€™s not too overwhelming. The smell is decent and does not bother me as well as not leaving. Any redness or soreness on my skin. Goes on smooth
