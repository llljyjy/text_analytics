I got this product for free to test from Influenster. When you open it up you’re hit with a strong citrus scent which at first I wasn’t sure about, but I got used to and ended up enjoying it during each use. It’s a simple face scrub, not as harsh as many I’ve tried in the past, I thought it was a much lighter scrub which I think is nice if your face can’t handle the harsher scrubs. I just didn’t think it did anything special or different than scrubs that are less than half the price. I can’t see buying this in the future for $28 when I feel I can get a better and stronger scrub that I prefer at a much better price point and value. nan
