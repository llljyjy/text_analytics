One bottle lasted me almost six months because a little goes a long way. I get very very dry skin in the early fall here in Northern CA, when the climate makes a sudden shift to incredibly arid (16% humidity!). Other products would leave me feeling like I needed to reapply a few hours later, but this keeps on working. It has never ever pilled on me as some reviewers have experienced and works great under sunblock and foundation (even without a primer, there I said it). I find the light scent pleasant. It dissipates pretty quickly, which isn’t a bad thing, and it doesn’t trigger my migraines. The packaging as a nice weight to it AND since it is a pump you don’t risk contaminating your stash every time you apply like jars do. If you have some issues with Gwen, ok...but that chip on your shoulder is gonna have you missing out on better skin. Heaven with a pump
