I really like this cleanser! The citrus smell is nice and not overwhelming. The exfoliating beads aren’t too harsh on my skin and it left my face feeling soft and not dried out. I have pretty sensitive skin and this didn’t cause a reaction which was a plus! Overall, I think it’s a good gentle exfoliating cleanser! nan
