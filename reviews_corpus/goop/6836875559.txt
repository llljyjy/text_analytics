I really enjoyed this product. For an exfoliating cleanser, this product did the job and left my skin feeling soft and new. There was no tightness following using the face wash. There was a bit of a scent with the face wash but it was not overpowering by any means. I received this product complementary and I have very much enjoyed using this product. (Ps I donâ€™t have sensitive skin) Great physical exfoliating face wash.
