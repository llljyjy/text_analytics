I received this product for free in an Influenster Vox Box to give my honest opinion.  I love the packaging.  Easy to use. Itâ€™s very gentle to the skin.  Not abrasive. It cleaned my skin fully. My skin was soft after each use. Only reason why I give it a 4 star is because it made my skin a bit dryer. If you have dry skin like me, make sure you moisturize afterwards and you will be fine. I would recommend this product overall. Overall will buy again!
