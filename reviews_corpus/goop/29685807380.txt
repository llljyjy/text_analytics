I received this complimentary from Influenster for my honest review. It’s a good cleanser. Though I did have to use a makeup remover cloth to make sure all my makeup was cleaned off. It reminds me of something I’d receive in my Ipsy Glam Bag. It’s got a pleasant, fruity scent. Not overpowering. It leaves the skin feeling soft and refreshed. I don’t feel it’s too harsh for sensitive skin. It retails for around $30. Would I pay that? Probably not. But, I would recommend picking it for a fraction of that in one of the beauty boxes. A nice cleanser.
