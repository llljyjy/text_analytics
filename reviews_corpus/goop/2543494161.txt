Let’s start off by stating I have very sensitive skin, that’s combination and I also have a tendency to break out. I have been using the Goop Glow for almost 2 months now and I have seen some awesome results. My hyperpigmentation has improved immensely. My skin is glowing. The only negative thing is when it is 1st applied, it burns but it goes away within a few minutes. So if your skin is sensitive, I’d be cautious. Other than that I would recommend it. I received this product complimentary to test and to give my honest opinion. Glowy but Stings
