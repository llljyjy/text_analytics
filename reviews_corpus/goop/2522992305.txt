I really like this serum. The texture is very plush and smooth, almost like if you mixed a moisturizer with a serum. This is very unique for a chemical exfoliant, as they tend to have very thin textures. There are great ingredients in this, including beta glucan, oat and watermelon seed oil. Itâ€™s the absolute perfect exfoliant for the wintertime or for people using a retinol who also want to implement an AHA into their routines. After the first use, I woke up with smooth, plump skin. I noticed an immediate improvement in texture. I have been using this milk for three weeks and Loving this so far. My morning moisturizing routine also seems to be working more effectively after the overnight treatment . I am planing to keep it as part of my nightly ritual. New routine
