This cleanser is ok, I use it when I don’t have much makeup to wash off or as a second cleanser. I don’t feel that the jelly exfoliating beads do much. I have fairly sensitive skin and it doesn’t bother me, I use it maybe 2-3x a week. I will use up the bottle for sure, but would not repurchase. I prefer the goop malachite and fruit acid face wash. good but nothing special
