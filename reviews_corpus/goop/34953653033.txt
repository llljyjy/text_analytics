received a sample, thank god i did because this lotion feels and smells cheap. theres tons of citrus in this, but it smells more like musk and pine-sol. the most annoying thing about this lotion is not absorbing AT ALL, it pilled up into gray little balls all over my skin - anything that didnâ€™t ball up left a chalky film over my skin which then made it itchy. annoying and a waste of money for anyone with dry or sensitive skin. pills up, cheap smell, and itchy.
