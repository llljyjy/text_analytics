This was a decent exfoliating cleanser but I didn’t like the strong scent. I also don’t think it’s a product you could use every day. It wasn’t bad and it wasn’t the best I have used either. It’s a product you could definitely alternate into your existing routine, if you need or want an exfoliating product. Decent exfoliant, strong scent
