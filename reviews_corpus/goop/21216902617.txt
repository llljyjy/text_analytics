I loooove this toner! I have sensitive skin so I don’t use too much because it can make my face turn red. But if I use a small amount it works really great and my skin looks so clean and fresh after use. I have seborriheic dermatitis and it helps tremendously with that and removes all flakes. I don’t even have to use those steroid prescriptions anymore. Works great for my dry sensitive skin!
