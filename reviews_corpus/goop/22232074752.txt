A really good exfoliating cleanser! It smells like citrus that isnâ€™t overpowering. It made my skin really soft and smooth. I have sensitive skin and I had no reactions to it. However, I only used it once every few days and not twice a day as it says to. The exfoliating beads would be too rough on the face if the cleaner was used everyday. Other than that, I do really like it and will continue to use it in my skin regime. nan
