Love the smell and the feel of this cleanser! I received this product from Influenster and started using it after removing my makeup at night. It smells so fresh and a little citrusy, and leave my skin feeling so soft. I haven’t used it consistently and have noticed a few breakouts, but I think it’s more diet related than product related. However, if you have sensitive skin, you might want to use caution since it looks like other folks have experienced some sensitivity with this cleanser. nan
