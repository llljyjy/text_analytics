I have been an ultra devoted user of another brand’s cleanser for over two decades and swear by it, so I was not expecting much of goop’s cleanser when it was sent to me for review.  First, I’ll say I have combination skin with my forehead and nose being very oily and the other areas normal with bits of dryness.  I live in a sunny, humid climate so it makes it worse.  My skin is also sensitive.  This cleanser actually wowed me, which is why some of the other reviews surprised me.  But, it goes to show what works for some may not work for others.  For me, it drastically softened my skin and was not overly abrasive at all.  I think, for me, it’s a perfect addition to my skincare routine for my nighttime face wash.  I am not a big fan of citrus, but it’s scent was not overwhelmingly citrus that it turned me off.  It was pleasant and awakening for me.  I have been using it for over two weeks now and love it!  It really was a game-changer for me and the texture of my skin. wHAtT?!
