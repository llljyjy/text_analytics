Another unexpected surprise voxbox from Influenster! Always glad to receive useful good quality products. I’ve used this cleanser 2-3 times and I’d like to update my review after using it a few more times. So far no negative issues. Smells really good. I always prefer citrusy-bright scents in hair & skincare. I like the dispenser / lid design. Makes it easy to use. The cleanser does dry out quickly (see pic) so it’s important to shut the lid after use. The exfoliating micro particles feel too big on my facial skin. I prefer finer ones. But I haven’t seen any harsh effects on my skin. Smells good!
