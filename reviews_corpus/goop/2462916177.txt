I love adding this as a step in my skincare routine because it really feels like the product works. The exfoliants are super small like sand, so you can get a good scrub over the entire face. I definitely notice a difference in the glow and texture of my skin the day after I use this. Price tag is high, but a little goes a long way. You only need a small dime size so the jar lasts a while. Great addition to a skincare routine
