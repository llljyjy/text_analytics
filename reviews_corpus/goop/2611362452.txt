After Receiving my complementary Goop face wash to try out from Influenster I decided to use it on night one to remove my make up. Well that wasnâ€™t necessarily the best decision as it just made my make up all smudged I decided to reuse it once I clean the makeup off and let me tell you it did not disappoint it has a nice texture that made me feel like my face was getting extra clean my skin feels clean and light I have to use and I will probably be implementing this into my every day skin care routine Oh My Goop
