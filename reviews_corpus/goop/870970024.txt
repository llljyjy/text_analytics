I’m surprised by the negative reviews! I am pleasantly surprised by this product! I have seen significant improvement in dark spots and freckles after more sun exposure this summer.  I didn’t have high hopes, but thought I would give it a try since I love other goop products.  Areas that were really dark have lifted so much! No product is going to work overnight, and you see the most difference after a couple weeks of use.  A little goes a long way! I use one pump to cover face and neck, it’s not greasy or sticky and my skin glows and is super soft! I have sensitive skin and had no irritation with this product.  Give it time! It’s worth the money in my opinion and I will continue to use! Love it! Impressed!!!!
