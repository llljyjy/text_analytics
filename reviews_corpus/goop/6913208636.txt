This product definitely works but I made the mistake of using it way too often AND with retinol products. Luckily, it only caused some mild irritation as well as sensitivity issues but Iâ€™ve cut back to once or twice a week and my results are amazing! My skin feels smooth and the hyperpigmentation has been improved tremendously! nan
