This product has a great citrus scent that I really enjoy, and it won’t dry out or irritate your skin from daily use. I do find myself having to use a grittier exfoliator once or twice a week because this one does leave behind a little bit of dead skin that I can see on my face when I apply foundation. It’s a good product but not my absolute favorite. My skin is very oily and I have large pores, so I think it would work better for someone without any of those issues. Good daily exfoliator
