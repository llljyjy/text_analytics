I’ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now and it definitely serves its purpose. It’s a great acid for exfoliating and resurfacing, I can tell a big difference after one use. I would caution to not use too frequently so that you don’t destroy your skins natural barrier. I tried to use it every other day after slowly acclimating to it and it became too harsh for frequent use. Right now I use it every 4 days with retinol and hyaluronic acid nights in between to stay balanced. I’m not sure it’s worth the price point, but I do think the product works the way it intended and advertised. Overall I would recommend if you are willing to spend and be cautious. A product that does what it claims.
