I like the scent for the most part. I usually prefer face wash that’s not so scented for my daily use.  I don’t normally care for face washes that have the beads in them because they tend to irritate my face but this one wasn’t to bad. My skin felt clean, was no sticky residue feeling afterwards. My skin was soft and didn’t feel dry after using it. Over all it’s a decent face wash and I would recommend it. Great face wash
