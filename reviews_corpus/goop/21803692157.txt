Has a light citrus scent due to the fruit enzymes & bitter orange peel. I am incredibly surprised I like it as much as I do. Im picky when it comes to exfoliating cleansers because they tend to make my skin feel stripped of moisture and super dry.  But this did the opposite. My skin feels very soft and clean and hydrated. After my first use I noticed it made my skin glow. I’d definitely recommend. Also the price isn’t bad either. In love
