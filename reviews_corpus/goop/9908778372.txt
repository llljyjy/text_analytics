I have pretty dry skin so I’m careful with any so called ’exfoliating’ cleansers. This one fared pretty well though! It helped gently exfoliate my skin but did not dry it out at all. I love papaya enzyme in products for exfoliation so I’m glad they have that. The price point is a little high so I doubt I would repurchase but if you can afford it then go for it! It’s not bad at all Not too bad for dry skin
