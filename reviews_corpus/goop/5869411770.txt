The best thing about this product is how little you need to use to clean your face. I almost always feel like I squeezed a bit more than I actually wanted to use. I have “normal“ skin that didn’t have any adverse reaction after use. I found that the exfoliating pieces were a bit large and definitely prefer a finer physical exfoliant. I wouldn’t use this everyday given the texture. The scent is mild and lightly citrus-y. I don’t notice any significant change in my skin texture post-wash but I did appreciate that it didn’t leave by face with that uncomfortable squeaky clean feel. I’m not bothered by the lack of foam but I can see how that may bother others. I’m actually just surprised by the cost though; feels like a decent value at 4oz for $28. It's okay
