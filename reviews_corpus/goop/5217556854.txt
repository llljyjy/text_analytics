Got a sample of this and wow, game changer for my dry, thirsty skin! The winter brings out the worst in my skin, dry patches and irritation. A small amount of this and my skin looked amazing and felt amazing! My primer and makeup went on top nicely and my skin looked beautiful and glowy the whole day. I love my FAB lotion but this may replace it during the winter months. Just purchased a full size and canâ€™t wait to receive. Not sure how this may work for my oily skinned gals as it is a lot of moisture at once but did the trick for me. Perfect for dry winter skin
