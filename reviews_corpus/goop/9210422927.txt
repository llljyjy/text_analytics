This is an impressive product! It definitely exfoliates and is not harsh. My skin felt so clean and tingly  after using it and definitely softer. It has a pleasant smell,  sort of like grapefruit to me, nothing over powering just a subtle nice smell. I will definitely purchase in the future. Left my skin refreshed
