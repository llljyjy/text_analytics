I received this product for free from Goop and Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I LOVE skincare and was very excited when I found out that this product was heading my way! Generally, when trying a new product, it takes a full 28 days to see if it is having the effect you are hoping for. I tried this for a week and had to stop using it. It caused me to break out extremely bad. That may be a skin purging type of thing that is normal, like retinol, but I am not positive. Literally 2 days after I stopped it, the break out had cleared up. I’m sure it is amazing for people who have the skin type for it but it wasn’t for me. I would definitely still recommend people to try it out for themselves and not just go by 1 review. NOT MY FAVORITE
