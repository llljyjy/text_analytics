While I find this to be a great morning wash it’s definitely not my favorite. It’s a bit rough and abrasive in my opinion. However the citrus smell is great. I did find that I broke out a bit from it so perhaps it’s just not for my skin type which tends to be on the dryer side. I received this product as a free sample Decent morning wash
