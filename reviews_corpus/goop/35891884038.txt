I received this in exchange for my feedback. This goop is okay it’s gritty and does help smooth out the face. It can be a little ruff so don’t rub too hard. The smell isn’t the best and it does kinda dry out my skin. I personally wouldn’t buy or recommend but everyone skin is different so maybe it will work for you. Eh
