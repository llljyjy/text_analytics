I figured this face cleanser was going to be bad because of the things I have heard about the company so I was very surprised. This cleanser exfoliates gently & doesnâ€™t leave your skin raw. The smell is so yummy..I like you can use it everyday and am going to make it a part of my skin care routine from now on Face cleanser
