I’ve been using this for a couple days and started to notice a difference with the texture on my face. I also feel like it has erased some of my light sun spots I was starting to see on my cheeks. It does tingle a little when you use it but nothing painful and it didn’t irritate my skin. Great for dark spots and texture
