First of all I love the it stands out. If I saw this product on the shelf I will go over to it just because the name. I love the scent it smells like oranges. I love the way it feels on my skin. It leaves my skin feeling soft. When I go to wash it off all the product doesn’t come off so double check to make sure they aren’t any  beads on your face. My face stay soft all day. I definitely would recommend this and look for this product in stores. Just Goop
