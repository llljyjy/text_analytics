For starters, the packaging is very clean looking and the pump works great. No issues getting the product out of the bottle and the pump dispenses enough product on the first pump. When using this serum, I do not really notice any scent to it aside from the scent of the actual ingredients. Any scent this does have disappears after the product dries down, which I love. Using the serum is very pleasant when I used this correctly. It has a nice velvet satin feel to it, rubs in nicely, and did not feel sticky at all. I do use other chemical exfoliants in my routine as well as retinol. I made the mistake of using this product one night after using a BHA exfoliant in the am. Instant redness and I could feel the irritation. I immediately washed it off and tried again a few nights later. After it had been a few days since I used any type of exfoliant, I got to see the real benefits of this product. I love that this is now a staple in my routine and I use it 2 times a week. My skin was clear, smooth, and supple. 4 stars because it is not immediately user friendly and might take a few tries to get it right for your skin type and sensitivity. Great once I got it right
