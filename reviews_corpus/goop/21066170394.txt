I received this free to try out on influenster! I didn’t have super high expectations and I have used many exfoliating scrubs for the face I expected pretty basic exfoliation but I’m giving this product five stars because it smells great has a wonderful smell but the performance of the product itself was excellent I love the texture and it was stronger than normal weak exfoliation without feeling like I was damaging my skin so I’d say it’s a premium product quite different honestly. Only downside I can think of is it takes a while to make sure you have it all off your face cuz it tends to stick and it can leave your face dry so moisturize after but these are not deal breakers. Powerful and sweet
