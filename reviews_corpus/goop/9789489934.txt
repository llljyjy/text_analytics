I have normal skin with some sun spots and dullness. Ive used this for a couple weeks now at night after washing my face/ showers. Packaging is fine and easy to use. The formula is smooth and goes on like silk, absorbs quickly. My skin felt really moisturized in the morning.. I haven’t noticed any significant change in my sun spots at this time BUT it did make me feel refreshed and more vibrant. At this price point I do have high expectations, as well though things take time so I won’t discredit the item yet (per dark spot relief). I do love All my other Goop products. Another success from Goop
