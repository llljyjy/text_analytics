I way lucky enough to receive this item from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I have combination skin and used the cleanser for about a week. Overall I liked how it gently exfoliated and didn’t leave any residue on my skin. It also has a refreshing citrus scent-great aromatherapy. In the short time I used it, daily, didn’t have any irritation or breakouts and I felt like it left my face looking bright and clean. Refreshing exfoliate and cleanser
