I’ve noticed some changes on my face including so me dark spots that didn’t used to be there. I used the GOOPGLOW Dark Spot Exfoliating Sleep Milk (Serum) continuously for two weeks. The first night I could feel it as I put it on. It wasn’t a huge change the next morning but I was cautious and waited another day to use it again. I still felt it but it wasn’t as intense this time. So I started every other day usage for the next 12 days. It did make my skin look brighter and more even. I would recommend using this because I definitely saw a visible difference in my skin. Adding to my nightly routine
