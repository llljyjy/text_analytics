I like this brush. It is a bit gentler than others I have used in the past. I timed myself for 3 mins as recommended on the box which was more than enough time for me. I felt rejuvenated in the shower after using it (almost felt like I had a mini spa treatment) and my skin was soft afterward. Hoping longterm that itâ€™ll help a bit with the KP on my arms. I also like the handle as it makes it easier to reach the middle of the back. So far so good
