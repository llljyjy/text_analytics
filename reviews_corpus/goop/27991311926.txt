I received this free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I don’t think I could use this on my face everyday. It was a little rough on my face and I don’t not have sensitive skin. It seems to be a decent exfoliate cleanser but I could only use it once a week rather than the recommended daily usage. it was okay, not great.
