Like everyone else who has the problem with the scent, as so I. It smells fine until it’s lingering on your clothes ( for me it’s my pjs) that it’s somewhat nauseating. It’s a strange smell of black pepper? and who knows what else. Besides the scent, it’s an amazing lotion. So far I’ve only used it a few times on my legs and arms and I really like how it feels. Will probably not buy again though :/ nan
