I have uneven skin tone, some acne scarring and dark spots due to being a former sun worshipper.   I have noticed that my once youthful skin has started losing that glow and looking lack luster over time. I also have fine lines and some texture issues. I typically wear foundation and concealer to hide some of these imperfections, mainly my dark spots. I have started a skin care regimen in the past few years and was thrilled to add this to the my nightly routine. I am a huge fan of serums, as it’s usually the most concentrated and can penetrate the skin. This serum is a powerhouse full of wonderful ingredients that when combined, really delivers. The serum itself is thin yet melts into your skin effortlessly. There is no dreaded sticky afterfeel nor does it ball up after applying. Your skin feels so soft and silky. With these stronger ingredients, this does really seem to exfoliate well while being gentle on your skin. I love that added as a nightly routine, this works in your sleep without any effort on my end. Truly is getting your “beauty sleep” with results you can actually see. It took about 2 weeks for me to see noticeble changes. I started seeing that my skin tone had overall improved, my dark spots were significantly lightened and my dull/ rough texture in some areas were smoother. I started noticing that I didn’t need to wear foundation and concealer as often, as I felt more confident going fresh and bare faced.  I really felt that my face had really gotten that healthy glow back. If you’re looking for a serum that works while you sleep, exfoliates, resurfaces, targets and lightens… this is truly an amazing serum. A must have nightly skincare staple
