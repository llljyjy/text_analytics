I honestly don’t love this product. I’m not a huge fan of exfoliating cleansers in general, I’ll admit. The name is misleading because when I hear jelly, I think something soft and jelly-like. This is not like that at all. It’s rough on your skin due to being an exfoliator. It did make my face feel clean but I would never spend $28 on this. I don’t have a strong sense of smell but I did not notice a scent. I do like that it’s vegan and cruelty free but this product is not for me. I received this product complimentary. Not a fan
