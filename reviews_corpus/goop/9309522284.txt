This Goop Jelly Cleanser was really great! I have very dry, sensitive, oily skin and this helped tame all of my issues. I personally love the citrus scent! The exfoliating component is not too rough. I used this in the shower, and my skin felt very moisturized after. I highly recommend giving this a try! I will definitely be repurchasing myself! Great cleanser for dry skin!
