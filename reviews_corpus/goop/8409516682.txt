I absolutely LOVE this product! At first, I was hesitant to try it because it is foamless (I usually like a good lather) and Iâ€™ve never heard of the brand. But I am glad I gave it a try. It has a citrus/orange scent that is not too strong. The jelly cleanser has tiny exfoliating beads that do not dissolve right away like other cleansers, so it actually does a good job exfoliating and massaging my skin. However, it is not too harsh for daily use. It leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and clean. I have been using it day and night, and it has become my new favorite daily cleanser. Definitely will buy it again and I highly recommend it. My new favorite cleanser
