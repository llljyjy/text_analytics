The packaging was really nice. The size of the product was actually really good. It does have a slight smell but I really enjoyed it. The packaging says you can use it daily but I would only use it once or twice a week. It’s a really great exfoliator I just feel like it wouldn’t be good for everyday. My skin felt extremely soft after I used it. I put a moisturizer on after and in the morning my skin felt like new. I absolutely love this cleanser and definitely recommend this. Really good exfoliator
