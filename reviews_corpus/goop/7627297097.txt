Light, tightening, brightening!I’m an esthetician so I’m often pretty picky about skin products that make claims- this one pleasantly surprised me! From the first use, I’m impressed by the immediate tingle (glycolic) and it’s a quick exfoliator that can be used like a mini masque to peel off before showering. There is no strong scent and one or two pumps is plenty, so it will last a while. As far as faded hyperpigmentation spots? Well I have lots of them and haven’t noticed an immediate difference but that may happen over time. I’m super careful to use spf daily and plan to keep using it and an easy step to reduce fine lines and keep my skin looking good! Light, tightening, brightening!
