I rarely write reviews, but feel compelled to write one for this humidifier! I have been struggling with dry skin this winter, which is new for me, and I feel like this humidifier has helped. A lot of that has to do with how easy it is to refill and clean compared to other humidifiers I have owned. It means that I actually use it and it does what it says. The essential oil that comes with smells really good, too, which is a bonus. I purchased my Canopy humidifier directly from the brand, since Sephora didnâ€™t carry it at the time, so am happy to see it on here now in case I want to gift in the future. Favorite humidifier!
