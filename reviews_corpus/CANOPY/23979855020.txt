I’m really loving this humidifier! I have chronic chapped lips, and I have definitely noticed a difference in my lips and skin texture since I started using this at night. It’s the perfect size, not too big, but enough water capacity to stay on all night and then some. The scent option is also really lovely and subtle, and you can easily control the strength and use your own essential oils. Highly recommend to anyone -- I think my plants love it too! nan
