I absolutely love my canopy humidifier. I’ve seen such an improvement from my skin after a few months of using it. Total life saver during the winter when indoor heating completely dries out my skin. Warning: it’s not silent. I was a bit surprised at the noise at first but if you sleep with a noise machine or a fan, you won’t notice it at all. I use it on the second setting and find that I don’t have to refill until the following night so that’s what? 24 hrs of continuous use, amazing! absolutely love!
