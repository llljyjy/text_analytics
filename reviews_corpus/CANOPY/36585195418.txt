I love this humidifier! It is the first one Iâ€™ve used and now I want one for every room. I like the different fan settings and that it auto changes at night. I noticed a difference in my sinuses when I had the humidifier going all night vs nights I did not. I usually have it turned on all day in my office and can feel a difference in the air. The unwind essential smells lovely and is subtle. nan
