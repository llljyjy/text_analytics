Idk why the top part is scratched. Something minor but bothersome because it’s a new product. I’d like it to be entirely new. The first time I ordered one, the purifier was scratched up. So I went to the mall and returned/ordered a new one…. This one came scratched also….. what’s going on? Besides that I think it’s good I have eczema and when I tried the first one my face cleared a bit. comes scratched or used?
