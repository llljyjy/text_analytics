I’m totally obsessed with my Canopy humidifier! I did not purchase mine through Sephora but I’m so excited to see they are on here now, all my friends have been dying to get their hands on one! I’ve been waking up to glowing + hydrated skin ever since I started using it, and love that it’s ant-mold and dishwasher safe! I’ve been using it nightly since November and love the white noise it makes. Can’t recommend this product enough, especially if your moisturizer hasn’t been effective due to winter weather. Super hydrating, dishwasher safe, and anti-mold!!!
