LOVE the smell of the included oil and the relaxing sound this humidifier puts off! It’s also so easy to clean which is really nice. This is the only humidifier I’ve used that doesn’t leak when filling it up with water. I am definitely sleeping better and more relaxed at night. The main problem I have is that it will not stay turned off without being unplugged - will randomly come back on at any point (however, maybe this is user error? LOL). Overall, nice humidifier and very cute too! I recommend it for anyone who needs a better night’s sleep. Nice & Relaxing
