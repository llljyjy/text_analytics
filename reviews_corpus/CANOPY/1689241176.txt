I’ve been looking for the perfect humidifier and I’m soooo happy with my Canopy! Other humidifiers I’ve owned eventually gave off that damp smell no matter how clean I kept it. I love that Canopy has a filter to prevent this! It’s pretty large (like a Brita filter) but this is actually a good thing because the water lasts throughout the night! Other humidifiers would run out after just 3 hours nan
