I’ve thoroughly enjoyed this skincare treatment from Mount Lai! The formula itself is an intensive moisturizing & nourishing balm texture that transforms into a serum from the heat of your fingers during application. I immediately experienced hydrated and supple skin that produced a beautiful glow as well as making it look all the more healthy. I’ve applied it a couple of different ways over the last few weeks. I used a jade roller to apply it at times and it spread across the skin seamlessly while providing a soothing & calming effect. In addition, I also warmed the balm to a serum formula between my fingers and then gently pressed and patted into the skin. Either way, it left my skin feeling revived, softer, smoother, and my fine lines were showing signs of diminishment over the course of using. As recommended, I use this treatment in the place of my usual serum and I’m loving the results thus far. Keep in mind that with the rich texture of this balm to serum formula, a little goes a long way. There is a very subtle scent that reminds me of organic, clean herbs. Given the fact that the makeup of this formula is largely derived from plant roots along with Squalane & Green Tea Extract, that would make sense. Nonetheless, this skincare is packed with ’good for your skin’ ingredients and none of the bad stuff such as parabens, synthetic fragrances or dyes to name a few! Furthermore, they don’t test it on our furry friends! I believe this is innovative skincare at its best that provide many benefits to the skin. It’s perfect for when your skin is needing some extra attention, in addition to leaving a healthy vibrancy to the face! Intensive Moisture & Nourishment for the Skin
