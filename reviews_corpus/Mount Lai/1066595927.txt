I really like this Mount Lai Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Anti-Aging Balm. It leaves my face feeling so soft and smooth. I was a little hesitant to use it at first, because balms tend to break me out, but I didn’t have that problem with this one. I was also worried that it would be greasy, but it wasn’t. It melts beautifully into the skin, and I’m left looking luminous. I only received a sample size, but a little goes a long way, so this will last me a long time. It does have a slight medicinal smell to it, but it’s nothing too obnoxious. nan
