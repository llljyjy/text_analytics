Better to use at night as it is very oily. I have very dry skin and this was still too oily for me to wear under my makeup. I loved it for night time though. It also had better results when it was able to soak into my skin without any makeup over it. If you have problems with oily skin already or acne I would not recommend this product for you. Everyone else will probably do well with it. Very oily
