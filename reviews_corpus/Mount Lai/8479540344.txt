I was super excited to try a balm! Unfortunately, it did not come with the spoon. I used a min spatula from one of my other products and used the pea-sized amount. The first few days I experienced mild breakouts along my cheek area, which happens to me sometimes. After that smooth sailing:). I loved the texture and was not crazy about the smell. nan
