I received a sample of this Mount Lai Calming Herbal Repair Overnight Recovery Balm complimentary from Mount Lai and PinchMe in exchange for my honest review. This balm has a super silky balm-to-oil texture. It absorbs well and does not leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky. I enjoy the scent and the silky texture on my skin. This is a great last step to my overnight skincare routine. It also works incredibly well for my dry hands. I would recommend this balm. nan
