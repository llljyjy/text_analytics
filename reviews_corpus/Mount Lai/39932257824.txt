Overall, I did like this product. It left my skin feeling soft and smooth immediately after use and for a good while after. I wasn’t fully confident on where to fit it in to my normal skincare routine, but that’s okay. I made it work without knowing for certain.My biggest complaint was the smell. I don’t have any sensitivities to fragrances and I know its a “calming“ serum, but the scent was (to be quite frank), overpowering. With some products, the fragrance will fade over the course of a few minutes---this scent lingered for at least an hour after use. Because of the smell, I just can’t give it 5 stars, and I likely won’t be purchasing it for that reason as well. Despite it seeming like a great product overall.I received a free sample of the Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Anti-Aging Balm in exchange for an honest review. Nice product if you can tolerate the smell
