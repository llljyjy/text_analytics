This Mount Lai Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Anti Aging Balm smells wonderful and herbal, it’s thick so a little goes a long way. Once applied to the skin and gently massaging it starts melting into the skin. Similar to warming wax it gets soft and disappears but does feel thick and leaving a slight oily residue on the skin for a while. This is why I use it at night before bedtime so it has more time to absorb. I do love how well it calms my skin and evens the skin tone, leaving my skin feeling soft, refreshed and hydrated. I would recommend this product It’s an easy to incorporate step into any skincare routine and has great benefits thanks to the natural ingredients! Great addition to my skincare regimen!
