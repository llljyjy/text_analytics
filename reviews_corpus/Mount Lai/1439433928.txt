This is my first product from Mount Lai. I love skincare and wanted something hydrating to put on at night on a clean face before I go to bed after my retinol. This is a thick balm yet not oily and very hydrating. I love how my face feels plumped and moisturized when I wake up.  A little goes a long way and it didnâ€™t make me break out. nan
