While I really like the ingredients and I love the consistency of the products, I have to say I didn’t really notice any difference to my skin.  It definitely absorbed quickly but to me my skin didn’t feel any more moisturized than before I put it on, I even tried putting it on a couple times within the span of a couple hours..... nan
