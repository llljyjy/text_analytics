Pros: mild to no scent, absorbs well.  Doesn’t leave skin greasy.Cons:  Melts in warm temperatures.  By its very design, my instinct is to use it as a lip balm.  And I do.  Works fine.I received a ’deluxe sized’ sample of this product, so it did not come with the little spoon.  Just as well, probably wouldn’t have used it - or lost it - anyway. nan
