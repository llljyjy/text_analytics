I recently received a sample of this serum balm from PINCHme. I’ve never used a serum balm before and was interested to see how it would work for me. It was easy to apply and wasn’t messy or greasy. The serum melted right into my skin leaving it moisturized and healthy looking. It made my fine lines look less visible which was great. This serum has a light scent and a nice texture. I’m pleasantly surprised with the results so far. Great Serum Balm
