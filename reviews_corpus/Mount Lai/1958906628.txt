I received a sample of Mount Lei Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Anti-Aging Balm and was pleasantly surprised. The balm made my skin feel so soft and smooth. A little goes a long way it lasted for about a week and a half. My only gripe would be the scent (herbal scent) but it fades away after a couple of minutes. My skin felt so good and looked radiant after a week. Highly recommend! Mount Lei serum balm
