I used this product for about 3-4 weeks, mostly in the morning. I have dry, maturing skin.  I feel like it made a noticeable difference in how my skin felt.  It has a nice, light herbal smell that went away after absorbing into the skin.  It absorbs quickly and doesnâ€™t leave a sticky feel behind.  It almost moisturizes like a thick cream but without the heavy-ness. Amazing For Dry Skin
