absolutely incredible. i wish i could give this more than 5 stars! within the first two days of using i felt this pain and facial tension ease away and after a week- my dark circles lightened!! my eyes naturally have darker pigmentation under them and i’ve had dark circles since i was 8, nothing as ever eased them, no cream or treatment and i’ve tried several- but a gua sha did! i look significantly less exhausted! and then today, this is what prompted me to write a review- i had a swollen lymph node from a lil cold and after massaging over it with a gua sha the swelling decreased! really this product does wonders with facial pain and swelling. i’m far less puffy and my skin has a vibrancy i could not imagine. i ordered from the original website, mount lai, and they were incredibly fast and the product came in excellent condition, i ordered it monday and it arrived friday. i couldn’t find a place to review on their website so i decided to review through here.  i swear this product literally feels like it improves my health i love it so much and i’m super grateful for it excellent job i recommend it to everyone!!! incredible product… 5 stars?? no! 100000 stars!
