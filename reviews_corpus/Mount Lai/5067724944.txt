The Mount Lai herbal repair serum balm has a herbal natural scent. This purple balm turns into a serum. I used a pea sized amount. A little goes a long way. I at first thought it might be too oily or heavy for my skin but it absorbed so well and gave me a glow.  It claims to repair skin and reduce signs of aging. I liked the feeling of this balm and will continue to use to see how it works on aging. Definitely worth a try. nan
