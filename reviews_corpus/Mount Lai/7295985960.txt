This is a great balm for those with dry skin! I’ve been applying this before I use my gua sha and it’s really helping it glide easily. I have a hard time using serum because my skin absorbs them immediately, but this is very long lasting. It would probably be too greasy for someone with oily skin, but works well for me. nan
