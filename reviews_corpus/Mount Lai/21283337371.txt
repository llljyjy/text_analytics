I received a free sample from PINCHME. It didn’t include the spoon so I had to use either my fingers or a qtip. My skin really enjoyed the moisturizer in this product. I didn’t break out after using as sometimes with moisturizers I do.  I could use as much ir little as I felt my skin would enjoy. I used for about a month and didn’t really see any signs that a few of my  laugh lines were diminished. It did make my skin feel great. Skin felt refreshed.
