This balm is a really nice moisturizer. It is easy to apply, and sinks into your skin quickly. It isnâ€™t sticky or too heavy. The scent is a pleasant and herbal, but I found it to be slightly too fragrant and would have preferred the scent to be less intense. Nice moisturizer with a strong herbal scent.
