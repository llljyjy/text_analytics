This is EXACTLY what my skincare regimen was missing and I didn’t even know it!!! I love using my gua sha tool and used a facial oil while massaging.  Although this worked great, this serum takes it to the next level.  I do not need to keep reapplying oil during my massage. This balm remains on my skin throughout without absorbing quickly.  Once I’m finished with my massage, I blend it in and it leaves my skin supple and super moisturized before bed.  When I wake up in the morning, my skin is luminous and hydrated like I just got a professional facial.  I’m obsessed with the Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Anti-Aging Balm and will be using it for many, many years to come!!!! Game changer!
