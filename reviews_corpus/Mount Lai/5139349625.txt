I would say that the Mount Lai Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Anti-Aging Balm is simply okay. The smell is nice but a bit overpowering. I like the feel of the balm initially but then it just ends up leaving an oily residue on my skin that ends up giving me anxiety about triggering a breakout. A little bit goes a long way, thatâ€™s for sure. An okay product.
