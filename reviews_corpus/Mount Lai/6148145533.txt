I was very happy to receive a deluxe sample of this product Mount Lai Calming Herbal Repair Concentrate Ant-Aging Balm in exchange for my review. I was very pleased that it is an all natural and cruelty free product. It is a pretty lilac/purple color and is super easy to apply. A small amount goes a long way and it feels very nice and soothing on the skin. It absorbs really well and I noticed that my skin was calmer, soothed, less uneven and felt smooth and soft. I would recommend giving this product a try especially if you are a little older in your 50s like me and need a little tender loving care for your skin. Very Soothing and All Natural !!
