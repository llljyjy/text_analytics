Sadly, it gave me extremely bad breakout around my jaw area after a week of using it. It took me a while to realise what was causing it because I had finally found a good skin routine a while back that didnâ€™t make me breakout. To those with acne prone skin, you know how hard it is to find your holy grail! Since that was the only newly added product to my routine, turns out it was the Gua Sha creating this mess. So I do not recommend this product to those whose skin is easily prone to acne. Stick to what works for you despite how fun all these newly skin trends are. Not good for Acne Prone Skin
