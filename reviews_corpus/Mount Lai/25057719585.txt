I like this Mount Lao Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Anti-Aging Balm. It has a light, herbal fragrance. It melts when you start massaging it on your face. I use it at night after cleansing and toning. My skin definitely looks and feels more moisturized. It works great at calming my hormonal break-outs. It absorbs well without feeling greasy. nan
