I recently tried out Moutn Laiâ€™s Calming herbal repair serum concentrate Anti-Aging balm.I really liked how soft this made my skin feel. It went on really smooth and absorbed nicely. It didnt leave my skin feeling greasy either. I usually used this at night instead of day and night. It was very nice and had a nice scent too. i would recommend if you are looking for an nice repairing balm. Great repairing balm
