I use this balm in the evenings, paired with my gua sha tool. You only have to use a very small amount, so the jar will last quite some time. It helps if you warm it in your hands first and then apply to your skin. This balm gives your skin a dewy look and absorbs quickly. When I wake up in the morning, my skin looks fresh and hydrated without feeling greasy. Some reviews mention that it can feel greasy, which is why I choose to use it at night. The herbal scent is very soothing and reminds me of going to the spa. I love that it comes with a tiny spoon so you always know the perfect amount to use. After a month of daily use, my skin is smoother, without any dry spots and almost looks like I have a natural glow without any make up. I absolutely love this product!
