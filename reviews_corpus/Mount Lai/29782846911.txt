This is a very nice concentrated balm.  I like how I only need a pea sized amount to cover my face and neck.  It applies easily and absorbs without leaving any oily/greasy feel.  I’m not a fan of the scent, but it does dissipate.  My skin feels soft, hydrated and looks luminous.  I love that it’s clean and cruelty-free as well. Soothes And Softens Skin
