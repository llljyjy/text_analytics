Like any skincare tool, you need to use consistently to get results. I’ve had this for close to a year and been using it off and on. When I use regularly I definitely notice a difference in my skin, it’s somehow brighter and definitely more supple looking. It has a decent weight to it and feels like a luxury part of my skincare routine. When I use with my regular serum it doesn’t glide well, so something like argan or bio oil works much better. If you can commit to regularly using, would definitely suggest if you’re looking to enhance your routine. I’m not sure the cracking issue that others have mentioned, I do try and be conscious of not placing it down hard on a counter or anything but otherwise I really haven’t had any issues with it being too delicate. nan
