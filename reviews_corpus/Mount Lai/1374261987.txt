I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I really like how it turns into a serum and helps my skin not pull during my gua sha routine. The smell is interesting, not unpleasant, not my favorite. It does help calm down my skin when it gets red and irritated from the sun as well. I wish it had more product, but I hope it lasts a while. Works great with gua sha
