I read the reviews before buying this and genuinely believed that unlike everyone else I would not break my gua sha. I loved this tool for approximately 3 days before it slipped out of my hand and fell on the floor, breaking one corner off rendering it totally useless. I will be buying a new gua sha tool but will likely go for a different option. Donâ€™t kid yourself - you will break this
