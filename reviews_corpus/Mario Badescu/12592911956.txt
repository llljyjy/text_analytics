I’m sorry I just don’t get the hype with this one, it is so incredibly sticky both on the bare face and on top of makeup. don’t normally have sensitive skin whatsoever but it made my skin so red and itchy every time I use it, don’t know what to do with it because I have a whole bottle and can’t use it. smells good, but that’s the only benefit, if you want a refreshing mist just use water or caudalie grape water sticky, itchy mess
