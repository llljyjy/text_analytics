Whenever I notice a whitehead pimple start to form, I dab this on a few minutes before going to sleep and I wake up to a pimple that’s at least 50% flatter. It’s almost as though it speeds up the whole start to finish cycle of the pimple. This is down to an impressive array of acne-fighting ingredients: Sulfur, Zinc oxide and Salicylic Acid - all of which I always look out for whenever I’m purchasing an acne product. Add to that: Calamine lotion which helps with the inflammation aspect and you can start to see how this works on more than one level. In fact I’ve used many acne fighting products before but seldom found one that contains so many of the best old-fashioned acne fighting ingredients. The only thing worth bearing in mind - other than the fact that the bottle is not to be shaken before use, is the high alcohol content (a necessary bacteria-fighting evil in this case) which is the transparent layer on top and can be drying to your skin, and the very reason why I don’t reapply more than once in 24 hours. I love how quickly it dries, never transferring onto my pillow, and the bottle is small enough for travel too which is a bonus. I have used it during the day but find it slightly tricky to disguise with makeup, so I tend to stick to overnight use only.~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
