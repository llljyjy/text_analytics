10 stars for this spray if I could. From the first spray I loved it.  I have normal medium deep skin. I don’t need much to cleanse and moisturize. As matter of fact, my routine usually consists of makeup wipes with primer/moisturizer in them (yes there are some of us out here that do great with makeup wipes). I then spray one of the three MB facial sprays that I already loved and have used for years now it works as perfectly as a little moisturizer and primer for my makeup. If I go a little over board, my skin lets me know right away with a couple of small white heads.  I didn’t think it could get any better and have been pretty happy with my routine. But this spray took it to another level that I didn’t even know was possible. My skin lovessss it.  Not sure how to really explain it, my already normal plump skin looks even healthier and plumper in a good way.  I also use the hyaluronic dew drops right before the spray (received both as a gift with purchase btw) and it’s like a 1-2 punch.  Somehow it’s not overly moisturizing while being very effective in overall appearance and feel. I also use it as a setting spray after makeup because why not.  I would recommend any skin type to at least try this spray, even the oily girls cause it gives you that plump moisturized look without being a heavy added moisturizer (if that makes sense). Ok I’m done. Love Love Love LOVE this facial spray!
