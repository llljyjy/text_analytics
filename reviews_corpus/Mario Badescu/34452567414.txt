The product would not apply to my face. When I poured a small amount into my palm to transfer it onto my face, it would separate and move like a slimy jelly when I tried to apply it from my hand to my face. I tried several different things but it was an odd slimy cleanser and it did not have any foaming action. My face was not left feeling clean so I did return it. I love this line and would not expect this from it. Not what I thought
