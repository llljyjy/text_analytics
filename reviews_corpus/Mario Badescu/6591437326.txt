I buy these sprays so I can use them on my neck/chest area. I do not like putting lotion on my neck so these sprays do the trick to treat this area. I’ve used the other scents of this exact product and really have had no issues with any of them besides this one. I’m not sure if the ingredients have been messed up for my bottle but it really smells like the soda Sprite when I spray it. I smell a FAINT hint of lavender, but it really just smells like Sprite. It is the strangest thing. Again, not sure if this is the intended smell but it’s definitely not lavender. I would recommend getting a different scent if you do not have a preference (I like then green bottle)! Odd smell but does the job?
