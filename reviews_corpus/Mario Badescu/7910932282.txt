Really dislike the packaging of these products.  In particular, the moisturizer regularly clumps and dries out in the narrow nozzle.  Not only does that waste a substantial amount of pricey product, but it comes out of the nozzle in a congealed clump, followed by a burst of usable product.  So I have to figure out how to get rid of the clog and then use the product. This is a substantial problem and even though the products are nice I will not use them again. packaging makes use unpleasant
