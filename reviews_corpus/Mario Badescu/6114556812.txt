I am allergic to most everything, but this was an easy addition to my routine.  It is thick and creamy and goes on easily. I gave it 4 out of five because my husband does NOT like the smell (floral), and well, he sleeps next to me! I donâ€™t really like fragrances wither, but I really feel that the quality is there, and my skin is protected while I sleep. nan
