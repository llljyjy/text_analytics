I had high hopes for this product, but it just doesn’t work for me. I don’t think it has the time to work properly because it flakes off within a couple hours. By the time I wake up in the morning there’s barely any product left to wash off. Maybe this product isn’t good for oily skin types and it just flakes/falls off easier? It didn’t negatively affect my skin, but it didn’t help either. Don't Love This
