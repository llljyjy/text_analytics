I’ve been a fan of the entire line of Mario Badescu facial sprays for years. This spray is by far my favorite! I find it to be the most hydrating from the entire line. I especially like the fact that it is color and fragrance free. The aloe, coconut water, and hyaluronic acid have a very soothing effect on my skin. It feels so soft and smooth afterwards. It’s a great final step to set makeup for a more, dewy look! I also apply frequently in hot humid weather and during air travel. Just make sure to mist from about 4-6 inches away from face, because these bottles do not produce the finest of mists. All in all a great product for the price! nan
