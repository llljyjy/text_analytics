This is a nice purifying mask, it is a bit messy to use but smells nice too. It doesn’t come with a spatula or anything. I use a good 3 “scoops“ of it with my fingers 2-3 times a week. It leaves your skin feeling refreshed, purified and not too drying. Your skin will feel like a clean, good canvas for serums and creams to follow. I wash mine off with a warm cloth, but it does require some work to get it off as it dries on your skin like a second layer. Clean canvas
