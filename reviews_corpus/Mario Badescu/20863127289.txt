I love trying new lip products! I was in search of a good lip balm that wasn’t oily or super thick. I decided to try this and it did not disappoint. The formula is light and very cushiony and very moisturizing. I don’t find myself needing to reapply every 30 minutes and it’s not oily at all. This is seriously like the perfect lip balm.
