I was so excited and happy to get my hands on this N°41 Spf Mister because it’s a spray bottle which means you can spray it into your skincare routine right before going out or after the last step over your makeup as well! I love the idea you can do both.. before i would always apply my regular Spf cream for my prep skin step before doing my makeup since i obviously couldn’t apply it after since it’s cream based but once i got this N°41 Mister i am obsessed and satisfied. it’s an extra step i no longer have to worry about if i either forget to apply my spf before makeup or if im out in the sun with my friends and forgot to wear spf but this mister would surely come in handy to apply and re apply as many times is necessary. thank you so much Habit team for creating this! :D <3 amazing Spf mister spray!
