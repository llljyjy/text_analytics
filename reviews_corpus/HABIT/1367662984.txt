This SPF has been a staple in my routine for the last couple of years. First, the pocket-sized packaging fits nicely in my makeup bag, making it easy to carry around. I have good intentions about wearing SPF daily, but I’m also super forgetful. The N°41 Mister wont disturb your makeup if you forget this step or when you need to touch up mid-day.The mist on this product is so ultra fine - the kind of spray that I wish every product had. It’s a clean sunscreen with only 16 ingredients (about half of your average sunscreen). It does have a slightly strong botanical scent, but it fades quickly. I’m super impressed with this and am so excited to see Habit Skin at Sephora. Never leave home without it
