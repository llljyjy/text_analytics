I am so excited that Habit has come out with another spray sunscreen but with a higher SPF! I know that 30 is the standard and a higher SPF may not be necessary but for my sake, Iâ€™m happy. This sunscreen leaves me protected from the sun with a very dewy finish. The scent is not my personal favorite but I can look past it for the convenience of reapplying my sunscreen as I should be! nan
