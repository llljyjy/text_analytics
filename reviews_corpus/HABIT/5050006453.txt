I love this sunscreen! It’s the first product I’ve found that I can reapply over makeup that doesn’t make my skin break out or appear oily.  It doesn’t leave a white cast either, which is amazing! As a melasma sufferer, I’ve been looking for an easy, non-messy way to reapply sunscreen for years and I’ve finally found it! I love all of the Habit scents, but the new peach one is my favorite. My only wish is for this product to come in a larger size! Try it, you won’t be disappointed! MUST BUY - my favorite new sunscreen
