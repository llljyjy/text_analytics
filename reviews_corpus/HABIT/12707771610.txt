It’s a nice way to reapply sunscreen and the idea is cool but I look like a greaseball after applying and it takes off your makeup. I end up having to bring mattifying powder everywhere to go over it. It’s also quite heavy on the way. Like a oil consistency. Doesn’t dry. I don’t like the smell either. fry something with this on your face.
