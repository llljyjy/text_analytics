I absolutely have been loving this SPF mist. Reapplying SPF every 2 hours can be super inconvenient, especially on those days that I wear a full face of makeup, but this makes it so simple. It has a light floral fragrance and has been super gentle on my sensitive skin. AND- it doesn’t leave a white cast like some SPF’s do. This is the first SPF mist that I have tried and I definitely will not be turning back. SPF Reapplication made simple
