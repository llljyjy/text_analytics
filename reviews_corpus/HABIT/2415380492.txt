Yes, it is a chemical sunscreen. Yes, there is a LITTLE chemical smell when you first apply. Yes, it IS a small bottle for the price. HOWEVER. This is the perfect sunscreen for reapplication - it fits easily in your purse/bag, has a high spf for a spray sunscreen, smells very subtly but wonderfully like floral peaches, and leaves a really nice glow to your skin. As a super pale human, I need to reapply basically every 25 minutes or I will fry like an egg. This is one of the few light/No feel sunscreens that keeps me from feeling my skin burning in the sun vampire style. This is a nice option because it is quick, and not at ALL messy or sticky. For face/neck/arms, I find a bottle in my purse usually lasts me all summer for reapplication (about 3-4 months). It’s also really nice in situations where you don’t want to get your hands slimy- tossing this in my dry bag while kayaking is really nice- one hand application and no sliminess while trying to paddle (or hold on to my paddle). This isn’t my first Habit order and it won’t be my last! summertime glow!
