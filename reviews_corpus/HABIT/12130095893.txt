I wanted to love this, but unfortunately it fell short. I love my Coola SPF mister but this one has an extremely strong smell that definitely lingers on your skin - about an hour after applying my partner told me they could smell it! It also burned the skin around my eyes, and as someone with oily skin, this left me feeling really greasy for hours after application. I bet this would work better for someone with dry, not overly sensitive skin. Wanted to love, but missed the mark
