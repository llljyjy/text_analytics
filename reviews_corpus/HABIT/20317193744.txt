To my fellow super sensitive, acne prone, always-breaks-out-when-uses-sunscreen people…don’t hesitate for one second on buying this! I tested this out over the record breaking heat wave we had out here in LA this labor day weekend, and oh my GOD! It’s magic wrapped in a refreshing scent. It doesn’t leave my skin sticky, it doesn’t burn my face or eyes and it didn’t budge any of my makeup either. I used it after my regular face sunscreen/to set in my makeup for the day, and also used to reapply to make sure my skin was protected from the harsh sun. The mister is perfect, it’s super fine and doesn’t leave my skin insanely wet like a lot of sprays do. The scent isn’t too strong, it has very light floral/citrus notes- i’m sensitive to smells and this was something I was cautious of when first trying but I found myself excited to spray throughout the day. My skin looked so dewy and fresh after using this, it’s the perfect pick me up + perfect, easy way to reapply sunscreen and the size of the bottle fits in all my purses! This is a new, all year around staple for me. A sunscreen GAME CHANGER!
