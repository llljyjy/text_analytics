I probably annoy people with how much I talk about loving HABIT, but I can’t help it! There’s no other sunscreen product like it. Yeah, there are other facial sprays with sunscreen. They have a low level of SPF. Why settle for SPF 8, when HABIT offers SPF 38, SPF 39 and SPF 41? Other facial sunscreen sprays smell bad. HABIT has three different non-traditional scents that smell amazing (and more on the way, I heard!). And other wannabe sunscreen facial sprays sting your eyes, which means you have to spray them into your hands and then apply it to your face. That defeats the entire purpose of a facial SPF spray. HABIT can be sprayed directly onto your face and on top of your makeup. You don’t need to rub it in. It’s a truly touchless application. Oh, by the way, this is my third bottle of HABIT No.41. The first one was gifted for review. The second I purchased. And once again, I received one for review. This is an absolute skincare staple for me. This is my third bottle of HABIT No.41
