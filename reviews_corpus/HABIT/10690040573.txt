I received this product complimentary from Habit. The fine mist can be easily sprayed onto the skin. It can be used by itself or over makeup and skincare and refreshes the skin with a beautiful floral botanic scent. The key ingredients in this mist are Geranium Flower Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil and Lavender Oil. I use this mist as the last step in my skincare routine. After spraying it on I just wait until the mist settles onto my skin and there is no need for any rubbing. It does not leave a sticky feeling to my skin and it feels very lightweight. My skin feels so soft and smooth and refreshed and the mist smells absolutely wonderful! The compact size of the bottle makes it so easy to bring this mist on the go for reapplying during the day! Easy to use, smells wonderful
