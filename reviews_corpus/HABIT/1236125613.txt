I honestly was so excited to use this product. I get pimples so easily and reapplying SPF throughout my day with my hands never felt good, especially with how out and about I am during the summer time. I brought this to the beach with me and was reapplying regularly like I knew I should and still managed to get close to second degree burns on my face. I don’t know how or why. This product should have worked. I’m really sad it didn’t. It has seemed to work through out my days otherwise I guess it just isn’t as strong as I hoped. For context also, I am taking acne medication and used prescription products on my face so I knew I would be hyper sensitive, I just wasn’t expecting to look this awful after one beach day. quite the let down.
