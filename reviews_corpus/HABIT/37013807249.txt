Found this product online searching for facial sunscreens for sensitive skin. I keep this in my purse and it’s heaven sent for the days I’m at the soccer fields all afternoon in the sun. I’m fair skinned and burn quick, ongoing joke is only I could burn in the shade wearing SPF 50. I was hesitant due to it not being a higher SPF but it has worked great for me so far. nan
