Yeah i’m kind of disappointed. I was really hoping to like this product as a replacement for the Coola spf setting spray but the only improvement is the smell. It leaves my skin sooooo greasy and shiny feeling. I have dry skin and don’t mind a little extra glow, but this was gross feeling. Like literal grease being sprayed on my face. I wish I liked it more but I wouldn’t personally recommend this product to any skin type. It’s okay if you’re in a pinch I guess, but I’ll stick to stick sunscreens for reapplication. Could be a lot better
