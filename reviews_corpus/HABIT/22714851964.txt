I have been a fan of Habit for quite some time! I was excited to see another scent coming out & they did not disappoint! It’s the perfect hint of peach + neroli & I love utilizing the misters in general because I’m constantly on the go & don’t always have a restroom to wash my hands to reapply sunscreen. This is especially important when I have makeup & don’t want to use those SPF powder brushes over and over. Habit’s white peach + neroli mister gives you a nice glow while protecting your skin...a win win! IT'S A YES
