For full transparency, I was gifted a travel-sized version of this product by HABIT - but I absolutely LOVE this mist and carry the mini version on the go with me EVERYWHERE. Whether I’m relaxing at the pool or in my car during my lunch hour, this mist is so convenient to just get out, spray and go. I will say it does have a tendency to be oily, which doesn’t really bother me when I’m not wearing any makeup - but when I am wearing makeup, I easily just fix it with a matte setting spray! Other than that, I adore everything about this. It’s not too fragrant, and the mist is just thin enough to be refreshing and thick enough to cover a wide area of my face at once. A must for traveling - and a life saver if you forget to put on SPF every once in a while. MY LIFE SAVER!
