this little bottle is so convenient for easy spf reapplication on the go - much better than putting goopy tubes into your bag and having it make a mess! not to mention there’s no mess on your hands either as you can just spritz and be done. only gripe is that it’s not water resistant - but i wouldn’t be using this before a pool or beach day anyway. will definitely be getting more. this product was sent to me in exchange for an honest review worth it!
