I am so in love with Habit’s mission to provide clean, quality SPF products! The N38 has a delicious scent - the cucumber isn’t too overpowering. I have sensitive skin, so trying products with fragrance can always be a gamble. Both my skin and makeup react really well to N38! This will be a makeup bag mainstay! Delicious & Lightweight!
