I was looking for something that would be easy to apply that wouldn’t irritate my sensitive eyes, this goes on fine initially-  but later in the day my eyes can detect the scent or something and it irritates them. Bummer but I’ll still use it for swimming or whatever , not for daily use for me It’s ok
