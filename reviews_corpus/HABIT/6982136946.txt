I love the concept of being able to reapply sunscreen on the go, especially when Iâ€™m outside and/or have makeup on. However, after spraying, I realized that this makes my skin quite oily and I already have oily/combination skin - so this would be perfect if you have naturally dry skin! Also, the smell reminds me very strongly of eucalyptus and a very faint floral smell afterwards. Not my scent of choice, but definitely great if you love eucalyptus + floral scents! nan
