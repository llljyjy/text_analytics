I LOVE this sunscreen I apply before, after makeup for extra protection, as well as use it all throughout the day! It doesn’t leave me greasy or even feel like I’m wearing sunscreen at all which I love! It does have a scent to be carful if your skin is sensitive to that but so far I’ve had no problems! Love for the summer season!
