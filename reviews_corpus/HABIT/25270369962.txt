I LOVE this series by Habit, and this is a great new scent! My favorite is still the Rose, but this is a close second. This sunscreen provides great, easy, on-the-go coverage and doesnâ€™t leave any greasy residue. Great for over makeup or face paint and smelled amazing. Another great product by Habit
