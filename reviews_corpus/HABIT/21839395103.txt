This product was very easy to apply, zero white cast — but it burned my eyes even after minutes of letting settle. I really wanted to like this product because it was everything I wanted & needed, but couldn’t deal with the stinging and had to wash my eyes every time I used it. The product smelled of rubbing alcohol after applying as well. Eye stinging.
