(gifted)I wanted to like the idea of putting this over makeup because it was mind blowing to me, as a forgetful person. I love the convenience of this spray, but i constantly worry about using too much since this bottle is 30$. I only do around 3 spritz every application to get everywhere protected. The smell is very strong, in all honesty, it reminds me of mosquito “off” spray, which I personally don’t mind, the scent does dissipate after a while. But if you’re into CITRONELLA scents, this is for you. The finish of this sunscreen is super shiny, and oily, so it’s best to powder after application with a translucent powder to get rid of excess shine. Overall, I thought the convenience of this is could makeup for the smell and but I don’t know if I would recommend 30$ to spend on a .9 fl oz sunscreen. wanted to like ;(
