I’ve been using Habit sunscreen for about a year. I have both the original floral scent and the newer cucumber one. When the White Peach and Neroli came out I had to try it! It smells delicate and juicy at the same time. I tried it out on a Pacific Ocean dolphin watching trip out in the sun for 2 1/2 hours with no shade and didn’t burn at all. I highly recommend all the Habit sunscreen mists and this scent will be staying in my regular rotation. It’s the only sunscreen I have been able to consistently wear with no greasiness or breakouts.
