I’ve been using Habit for awhile because it’s so convenient. I started with the original and then switched to the cucumber scent for summer because it was refreshing. Habit sent me the peach neroli which is also a really nice scent. This sunscreen is so convenient and I love that I don’t have to rub it on my face when I’m out and about. love
