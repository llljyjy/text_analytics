I’ve been looking for an SPF product for daily use on my face for the last 10+ years, and this is the first sunscreen product that I’ve ordered more than once (I would have ordered N*41 more than twice but it has sold out so quickly that I’ve only been able to get my hands on two of these misters). Things I love the most about Habit’s N*41: non-greasy (lightweight), smells amaaazin’ (hints of lavender, geranium, rosemary), quick and easy to apply, chemical-free, sustainably-made! As a lifelong advocate (i.e., extremely pale person) of SPF use, I love the completely new and revolutionary approach to daily SPF application that Habit is leading by making daily sunscreen use quick, easy, and feeling+smelling good! Do yourself a favor and buy NOW before it sells out! Do yourself a favor & buy NOW before it sells out!
