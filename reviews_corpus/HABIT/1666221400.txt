I got this in gift set a little over a year ago and it is the best sunscreen to reapply over makeup. I’ve repurchased it over and over and I keep a bottle in every bag. No white cast or little dots. It doesn’t disturb anything I have on my face, doesn’t sting when when I sweat and it runs into my eyes. Even my husband swears by it and keeps one in his car and I’ve been annoying him for years to wear sunscreen. It’s delightful. nan
