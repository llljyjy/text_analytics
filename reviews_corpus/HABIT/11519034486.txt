I have been using Habit since it first came out and love this product. It’s so easy to spray on throughout the day when you’d normally forget or you just don’t want to be globbing on a cream over your makeup. I love all the scents they have created. This one is probably the lightest of them all. It’s very delicate. I did want a bit more peach scent to it but I still love this product and use it daily. Convenient SPF for daily use
