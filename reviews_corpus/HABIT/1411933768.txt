amazing product. I wasn’t sure about coverage but the brand did a video showing coverage under UV light. It’s honestly the only thing on the market I where I can reapply spf *over* makeup without ruining the makeup. I thought it might leak in my purse but zero issues with the cap/bottle! love the scent. I’m a big white florals person, and was surprised how elevated this scent was for a sunscreen. This stuff has kind of become my new chapstick haha. Rn I have one in my makeup bag, one in my purse and one in my car. Works great for the tops of hands instead of oily sunscreen that’ll transfer onto things/clothes. I’ve purchased about 4 bottles so far. It's become like chapstick, I keep one everywhere!
