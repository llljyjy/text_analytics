I love Habit - it’s changed the game as far as getting sunscreen on myself and my kids in the morning.  We all look forward to spritzing ourselves before we leave the house, and reapplication is easy and doesn’t mess up my makeup.  This is my now favorite fragrance - it’s so sunny and beautiful.  Reminds me of warm nights walking around in the tropics.  Just love it. My favorite sunscreen
