I’m in love with this new scent! Daily SPF is as important as taking vitamins and just like gummies make me more likely to take my vitamins, Habit makes me more likely to remember to apply my spf! This floral peach and orange scent is the best one yet! Even my kids let me spray it on them. I am subscribed to the original scent already but I’m definitely switching to this one. Easy and enjoyable and makes me apply more often
