Ok yes, there is something to be said about the strong- ish scent that this sunscreen mist has, but I am willing to overlook this because it is so easy to apply over and over and I love the dewy look it gives me. The scent quickly dissipates and you don’t smell it after that initial whiff. This and shisheido sunscreen are my now new go -to’s. nan
