The Habit sunscreen is the best face sunscreen I’ve ever experienced that has truly made my life easier. Most regular sunscreens end up irritating my eyes and ruin my day from discomfort, as even if I do wash my hands after application there usually is still a layer left on my fingers that ends in my eyes. Habit is in the perfect size to take with me everywhere and apply within seconds without leaving my skin sticky or needing to wash my hands after application. I now enjoy applying sunscreen daily. The cucumber one is my favorite so far, it smells nice and refreshing. I love it and it’s honestly one of my favorite products ever! Mist yourself
