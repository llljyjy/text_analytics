I love Habit’s other two scents, but this new one is my favorite! It is light and sweet and I’m in love. I love how Habit’s sunscreens aren’t greasy and feel much lighter than typical sunscreen, but they still protect my skin from the sun. I used it on vacation and it held up well and worked especially well over my makeup! Light, protective, and doesn't mess up makeup
