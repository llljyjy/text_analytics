I really like this spray. It makes it very easy to reapply sun protection throughout the day. It doesnâ€™t break me out (sensitive skin) or burn my eyes once I open them after applying. If I feel oily I wait 20 min for it to absorb into my skin, then use blotting paper. Lastly, I find the scent refreshing. I purchased this product with my own money. Easy Peasy SPF Reapplication
