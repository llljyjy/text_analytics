I’ve used N41 and N38 before. I love the small size and convenience. I was hoping the peach smell would be a bit stronger, since it’s my fave. I’ve noticed this version doesn’t sting as much as the other two. The mist feels finer and I do have to apply a little more product that usual. Throw it in your bag or carry in your pockets
