So I recently used the No 39 and don’t get me wrong - it provides the same protection and easy application as the No 38 - but to me the Cucumber fragrance is EPIC! Habit has created an awesome, easy to apply, and super effective product, but it’s hard to beat the fresh scent on No 38!! Oh the fragrance!!
