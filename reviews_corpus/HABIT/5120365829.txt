It smells like the transition between spring to summer, all in one portable little bottle. I have very sensitive skin and eczema, and this is the only sunscreen I haven’t reacted to. This is the only sunscreen I used on my face for a full day at Disney World, and not one burn! It’s part of my daily routine, and I always keep a bottle in my bag if I need a refresh. I LOVE the peach and neroli scent, and just how light yet effective it is when spritzed on. Light, effective sunscreen for sensitive skin
