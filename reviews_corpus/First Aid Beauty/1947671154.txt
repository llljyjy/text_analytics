Why oh why oh why did this have to be reformulated to include essential oils? This product is no longer safe for my super sensitive, rosacea prone skin. I’ve been purchasing this product for over five years and now I have an entire tub of it I won’t be able to use because it’s no longer fragrance free. So disappointed. If you have rosacea or very sensitive skin, be cautious using this. First review .. so disappointed
