Iâ€™d say this product is really amazing when it comes to hydration all day, it has begun to heal my hyperpigmentation. But overnight, it gives me little pimples. They go away in a day or so, it just leaves my skin a little bumpy. But during the day use at work, my skin is super super soft!!! Smells great too Great!
