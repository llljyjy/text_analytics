I’m very picky with my mineral sunscreens and I tend to prefer more chemical ones. This however is great so far. I like that it has no white cast, which is a common problem I have being a medium-deep skinned person. It’s also Hawaii compliant which is amazing! It’s lightweight yet somehow moisturizing and non greasy. Fab sunscreen from FAB
