I bought this product when my undereye area was freaking out and really sensitive to my usual skincare products. I also used it on my hands when winter set in and I had issues with cracked, irritated skin underneath my wedding ring. This cream was really calming and made both problems go away. Couldn’t ask for more! It’s now my go-to moisturizer. Healed my irritated, cracked skin on face & hands
