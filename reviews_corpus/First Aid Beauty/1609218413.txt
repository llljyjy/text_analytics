I am a Vit. C addict and so far this is a dream! The consistency is much more watery than I expected but the result is that it plays well with other skincare (like moisturizers) with no pilling. My skin is very sensitive in that any change to my routine tends to bring purging but so far my skin is nice and clear. Iâ€™ve loved other FAB products and this one seems to be following in their general footsteps! nan
