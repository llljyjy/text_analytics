This is the first vitamin c I have ever purchased so I can’t say much about how it compares to other  brands but as a person that’s new to vitamin c serums it’s a great starter. It’s gentle on my sensitive and easily irritated skin. Tho has brightened my skin soooo much. After my pregnancy I got hormonal acne and some hyperpigmentation and that has almost gone completely away. Because of my anxiety I pick at my skin a lot and I was beginning to get blemish marks and this helped with that as well. One pump is more than enough product for a whole face and neck. nan
