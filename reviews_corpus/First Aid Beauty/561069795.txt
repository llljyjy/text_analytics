I got this and expected it to take a while to work (like other Vit C products I’ve tried) but I’ve been using it for a week and my skin not only looks brighter but also much more even! The product itself is very light and not at all sticky. You only need to use less than a dime size for it to cover your face too. One thing is it comes out fast so be careful not to waste it! Best Vitamin C Serum!!
