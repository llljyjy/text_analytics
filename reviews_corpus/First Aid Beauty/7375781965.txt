I really like this vitamin C formula. It is very gentle and will be great even for sensitive skin. I like convenient pump packaging. Formula is lightweight, clear and liquidy. It goes on very smooth, absorbs quickly but does feel sticky. I didnâ€™t experience any negative effects or irritation like with some other Vitamin C serums. I noticed my skin looks brighter, has more even out skin tone and complexion, looks glowy and feels smooth. great for sensitive skin
