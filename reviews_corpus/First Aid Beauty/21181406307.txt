Unsure if this was a mistake on Sephora’s end or not but the product I received was not these two tubes but rather two pots. I love this moisturizer but I wanted to switch over to the tubes instead of the pots since there is less chance of contamination that way. I’ll probably end up scraping it into a travel tube so that I can still use the product but I definitely wish I knew this before purchasing. misleading packaging
