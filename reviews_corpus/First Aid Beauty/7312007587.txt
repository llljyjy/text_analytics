I have mixed feelings about this… it is a nice foamy cleanser but if your skin is dry like mine then you really feel dry after using this… I used this with the FAB moisturizer for dry skin and there’s something in them that my skin just isn’t liking… I also broke out and I have never had acne issues before… I would def try it but if your skin is dry it might not be a good match!
