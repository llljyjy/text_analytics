this does make my face feel very clean but often dry afterwards (i use tretinoin most nights though so my skin is already easily stripped), it’s never made me breakout and has kept any acne from flaring up. a little goes a long way, literally a pea sized drop will lather your whole face (not if you’re wearing eye makeup though). it is an amazing cleanser to use after getting sweaty or dirty and that’s the best thing i have to say. i use waterproof mascara and this does remove it but i have to rub too much for my liking, and sometimes it makes my eyelashes clump together if i don’t use enough. my under eyes are irritated from the friction and it always feels like there’s some mascara left behind, i can’t rub my eyes without feeling like i’m tugging on my lashes. it gets the makeup off, but not before it dries out my eyelashes and under eyes from having to rub so much. i use banila cleansing balm mainly for my eyes, then i double cleanse with this after just to use it up. i won’t be buying again though, pyunkang yul’s low ph deep pore cleansing foam is my holy grail and i’ll be sticking to that. i bought it off ohlolly for like $14 and removes my waterproof mascara just as well as banila’s balm does, and it’s even better because it doesn’t leave my eyes foggy like the banila balm. definitely try pyunkang yul or even banila over this if you’re looking for a waterproof makeup remover and cleanser that is truly gentle. effective cleanser, but not a great makeup remover
