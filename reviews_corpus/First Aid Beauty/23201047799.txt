LOVE this as a hand and body cream!! Rich, creamy and wonderfully hydrating. I have sensitive skin that turns red and can break out with certain ingredients, but I’ve had no reactions to this FAB cream. Been using this for years! I prefer the tube to the tub as it’s more sanitary. Highly recommend! Best Hand + Body Cream!
