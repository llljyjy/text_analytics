Beyond excited that FAB came out with a vitamin C serum.  Just as expected its really good!  Lightweight texture that absorbs into skin nicely and plays great with other products.  I have been using it for the past 2 weeks and my skin looks brighter and youthful.  Cant’ wait to see long term results with continued use.  If your thinking about purchasing this one, don’t hesitate!  Highly recommend So Good!
