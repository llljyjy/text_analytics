You know what’s insanely hard to find? A moisturizer that can be used in the morning that doesn’t make your makeup melt off. I have literally tried so many, and by noon, mine is half off. When I first read that this needed to be applied in the morning I was hesitant, but I love Vitamin C based serum and so I figured I’d give it a try. It’s fantastic! It gives me enough moisture that my makeup doesn’t go on dry but not so much that my makeup doesn’t last.  It works as a great moisturizing base. The texture is great. Not liquidy, not sticky and not too thick, some nice combination in the middle. I’ve only been using it for about a week and a half but so far I’m really enjoying it. My skin has started to look healthier for sure! I’ll update as I use it!! does wonders and doesn’t make your makeup melt of!
