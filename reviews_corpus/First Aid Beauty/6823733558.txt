I have combo/dry sensitive skin with occasional perioral dermatitis. I wanted something thicker than lotion so I tried this. After I wash my face, I use HA serum then this cream. If you don’t have inflamed skin/open wounds on your face, this is a great moisturizer but since I have the condition around my mouth, this stings for several seconds. I ended up using this everywhere else on my face since I don’t have that reaction elsewhere. Another thing is that I didn’t find this as moisturizing alone and often find myself layering another layer of cream on top. If you have a skintype like mine, I’d suggest just using a cheaper moisturizing cream mixed with a couple drops of non-comedogenic hydrating oil. This is still a good product as it was more moisturizing than my previous lotion. I’d buy again when my eczema is tamed and my skin isn’t as dry. Careful if you have dry sensitive/eczema prone ski
