Let me start by saying I loved this product so much when I first started using it. My hands, especially during winter, tend to crack and bleed at the knuckles and cuticles especially. I finally caved and bought the ultra repair cream. It was amazing! The cream was thick, absorbing relatively quickly. It did cause a little burning at first because my hands were so dry and cracked. That subsided after 10 minutes max. I finally saw my skin looking normal and it did take away the small eczema-looking patch on my arm within a week. I was so amazed by this cream, I stocked up and would have anywhere from 5-10+ 14oz jars on hand at any given time and also bought this every year for Christmas for family and friends.Then I started to noticed the formula was becoming thinner and not working as well as it used to. I noticed my skin going back to the way it was. Then the price got outrageous $78 for a 14oz jar? Seems a little excessive for how much cream I was having to use. Then it was getting harder and harder to get their TSV on time for Christmas. Or even at all,  I had it on autodelivery for the Christmas pear fragrance and waited 2 months after it was supposed to ship and kept getting the run around. I finally cancelled it because I got sick of waiting and I havenâ€™t bought another product from them since. Then they stopped selling it! So I ended up going back to my old lotions that were less than 1/2 the price for more product. Used to be great product 3+ years ago, not anymore
