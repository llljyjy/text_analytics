This sunscreen is glorious. I’ve tried quite a few at this point, including Paula’s Choice, Glow Recipe, Supergoop (Unseen Sunscreen and Glowscreen) and Biossance. So far, this one is my favorite. The texture is creamy and lightweight on the skin, rubs in easily, absorbs without leaving a white cast on my light (light-medium in summer) skin, doesn’t pill with any of the various skincare products I’ve used it on top of, and wears beautifully under makeup. It doesn’t have that chalky texture you often see with mineral sunscreens, doesn’t have a detectable scent, and leaves a beautiful natural finish - not matte, not dewy. Wish the SPF was a little higher but I love it so much regardless! nan
