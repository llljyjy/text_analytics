This toner does exactly what it’s meant to do! Soothes and hydrates. I was looking for a toner without AHA/BHA while using another treatment at night that shouldn’t be mixed with actives. Through research I came to the conclusion my breakouts are being caused by a damaged skin barrier so I’ve been working on correcting that. This toner has integrated perfectly into my routine and is a great option for sensitive skin that needs some TLC. Lovely!
