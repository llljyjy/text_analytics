one of the worst eye creams iâ€™ve tried. theres pigment and sparkles added which fakes the appearance that its doing something, but really its just a mask like makeup. also pills up and creases under the eye. did not help my dark eye circles at all in the long term (i tried for 3 weeks) pigment & sparkles fake that its working, creases
