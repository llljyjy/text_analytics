This helps my hands heal. I can see the difference in using it for 2-3 nights straight. Because of frequent handwashing and hand sanitizer use my cuticles have been splitting, and over all, my hands and nails were looking very worn. They look much smoother and together now. Highly recommend for that. Took a star off because fragrance is listed. I tried it once on my face, but Im a bit scared of using it there. Iâ€™m very acne prone. The next day I had a few whiteheads around my nose, but I cant blame this in just one use. Might have been something else. It works
