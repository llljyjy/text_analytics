This had been my go-to moisturizer since it hit the shelves over a year ago. However, I noticed that the consistency of the new jar I recently got was different… felt greasier and didn’t really sink into my skin like it used to. I thought it was the temperature change (even though it was the perfect year round moisturizer for my combo skin) but after looking at the ingredient list realized they changed the formula. Looks like they cheapened the quality: lowered amount of peptides and ceramides, and increased amount of fillers and preservatives such as xanthan gum and phenoxyethanol. Why the unnecessary reformulation for a product with rave reviews, while keeping the same price point? Epitome of corporate greed I tell ya. utterly disappointed.
