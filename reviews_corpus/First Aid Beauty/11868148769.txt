I loved this stuff!!!!  Seems to be another sneaky change in formula though. I’ve been breaking out so bad! The texture is different, almost greasier, and pills when rubbing into your skin. I really hope I just got a bad batch and the new one coming is different. I went into Sephora and ulta to compare the testers they have on the shelf to the new boxes they got, and even the representatives saw a difference in the lotions. One was more like a matte, whipped butter. And the new looks like creamy body lotion. Took me forever to find a good lotion, I really hope they didn’t change it. change in formula
