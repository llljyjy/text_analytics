I have sensitive skin so I decided to try this product. I had no idea that I had eczema until last Summer when I started using this product and it caused flare ups on my cheeks and nose area. I got small red bumps which were bumpy and itchy. After trying multiple tropical creams recommended by my doctor, I was able to get rid of it. Well, it took me 6 months to heal. For some reason, I always thought it could be the face mask that might’ve the skin irritation. So, I took another chance and tried it again. I’ve used it for a week and it triggered my eczema again and I’m back at using tropical creams. If you have dry sensitive skin, please don’t take a chance.If you’re suffering from the same problem, ask your doctor to recommend you “Protopic 0.1%” as it helps with eczema. Also, I’ve been using Keihl’s ultra hydrating cream everyday for almost a year to moisture my skin. Triggered Eczema
