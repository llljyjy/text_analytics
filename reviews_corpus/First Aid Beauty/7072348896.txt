As a super fan of FAB products, I can assure you this is another home run. I have extremely irritable and sensitive skin, and had no issues with this product. It has no fragrance, doesn’t burn, and helps to keep my skin moisturized. The serum is not sticky and you don’t need a lot of product per usage. Would highly recommend giving it a shot. Another FAB win!
