I think any of these negative reviews are likely comparing this to chemical sunscreen. After going through my entire first bottle I can very easily say this stuff rocks and is by far the best mineral sunscreen I have ever used- and iâ€™ve tried some expensive ones. I like to mix mine with a drop or two of Drunk Elephants Sunshine Drops and even as a fair person this gives me a lovely glow while protecting me from the sun without chemical sunscreen!
