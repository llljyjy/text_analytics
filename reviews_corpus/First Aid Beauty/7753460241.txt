I have tried a number of moisturizers and finally came across this one! Bought 3 already now - I typically have to repurchase every 2.5 months so it does get pretty pricy. I like to only use it in the morning, and then I’ll use the heavier/greasier first aid moisturizer at night. But yes I love this cream, it doesn’t make my face oily at all in the mornings/throughout my day at work. I’m obsessed and will continue buying this! My go-to!!!
