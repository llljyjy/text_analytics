OKAY I normally cycle through moisturizers. I’m always trying out new products and I rarely ever will buy a full sized product after testing a sample. I loved the sample size so much I bought the full sized one and I can’t rave about it enough. I have really sensitive skin that is often dry from using retinol plus very reactive. Im picky about a moisturizer. The texture of this is so perfect it’s fluffy but also rich. And an added bonus is that it is unscented! I love the way this hydrates i love it sooooo much I’d give it 10 stars if I could
