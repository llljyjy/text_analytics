I want a tinted version next! But this spf is lovely I have to admit. No eye sting, no greasy finish, no white cast & no pilling! Iâ€™ve tried it with just skincare for all natural days & under makeup - both options are easy peasy with no issues. FAB has my wallet at this point, but they really put thought into their products & formulas, so they are always a hit with me! The dewy and light finish is awesome & makes me want to wear my spf - which is the point after all! Must try!
