This does brighten my undereye, I truly can’t deny that. I also love that it leaves my skin glittery, it’s very cute! It’s a good cream to use in the morning for the birghtening effect, if that’s what you’re looking for.The downside is that it’s not moisturizing at all... So, for what it’s worth, I won’t be re-buying this cream and will be looking for a more hydrating one! Brightening, not moisturizing
