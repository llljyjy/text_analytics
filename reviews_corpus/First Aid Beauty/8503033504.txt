I love this moisturizer. It doesn’t really have a scent which I like. It’s very lightweight while still hydrating at the same time. I never feel greasy while using it. Someone with really dry skin might need something with more hydration though. It’s a great basic every day moisturizer and it’s one I always reach for. lovely lightweight moisturizer
