I bought the Home and Away kit because it showed squeeze tubes, however it arrived with two tubs. Even the travel size is a tub. I would not have purchased if I knew it was a tub instead of squeeze tubes. I much prefer squeeze tubes that do not require you to dig your hand in to get the product. It feels unsanitary and messy.
