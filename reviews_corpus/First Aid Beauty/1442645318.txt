I received this product for an exchange of my honest review. I love that it has clean ingredients and that it’s Hawaiian reef safe. I have eczema prone skin, so it’s important for me to have something that will not irritate it. I also have family members who are allergic to certain sunscreens, so it is also important that it be a mineral zinc oxide sunscreen. It does however leave a slight white cast on the skin, but I find that most zinc oxide sunscreens tend to do that on darker skin. It blends well and doesn’t feel sticky and I feel like it’s quality for the value. safe clean ingredient sunscreen for sensitive skin
