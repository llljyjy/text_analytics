I always love to try new sunscreens and I am in constant search for that one that works well with my skin and my eyes (since a couple of sunscreens I tried made me teared up)When I tried this NEW Mineral Sunscreen Zinc Oxide Broad Spectrum SPF 30I was recently gifted, I fell in love! The texture is not greasy at all, blends nicely, doesn’t leave any white cast and doesn’t irritate my eyes and did not make me tear up. This is now on my top list of best sunscreens I’ve tried to so far! No white cast and doesn’t irritate my skin
