Hooray!!!!  I absolutely LOVE  this sunscreen!  I am 53 and have very sensitive, dry skin.  I’ve tried countless mineral sunscreens and this is right there in my top three.  It goes on silky smooth with little to no white cast.  I do wear a tinted sunscreen on my face. I’m hoping F.A.B. next comes out with this in a tinted version and it could move up to my #1.  Currently, however, I use this mixed with my Elta MD sunscreen on my face and then use this alone on my neck.  The dispenser is very similar to Elta MD (which I love).  There is no scent or sticky residue left behind.  My only reason for giving it 4 stars rather than 5 stars is the price.  The other non-tinted sunscreen I’ve been using is about 1/2 the cost. It is a Korean brand so I cannot see the % of Zinc.  LOVE, love that this one has 20% zinc. I think one of the highest % I have seen and is still great formulation without the severe white cast.   So, I may end up strictly using this one on my neck/face if I feel that the coverage is better than my current non-tinted sunscreen.  F.A.B continues to turn out amazing products for maturing skin. A big thank you.  I am sold! nan
