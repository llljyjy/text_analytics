I’ve received this product as a free sample and have been using it for two days. I consider my skin a combination skin and I don’t think that was the best choice for me. My skin feels tacky right after applying the product, as if it didn’t absorb it, and during the morning I woke up with a very oily face. I expected more since it’s a very hyped product on social media. not for combination skin
