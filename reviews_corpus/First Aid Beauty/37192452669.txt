I LOVE this product!! I received it as a free sample from First Aid Beauty and I was a little worried that it would irritate my skin as I have sensitive skin, but the past couple of weeks I’ve been using it, my skin has been completely fine and improved. I put a small amount into my palm as directions say and massaged it onto my face and neck and right away I noticed it made my skin look brighter and radiant. I haven’t been wearing much makeup with this summer heat and this product has really made my skin look so much better, will definitely purchase once I run out! nan
