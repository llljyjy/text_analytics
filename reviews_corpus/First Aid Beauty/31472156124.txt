I’ve been testing tons of eye creams over the past year for wrinkle prevention and this one has stood out from the pack. It actually moisturizes all day and makes a noticeable difference in fine lines. I wear contacts and this doesn’t bother me at all as far as sensitivity. It might be my favorite day eye treatment out of the 9 brands I’ve tried so far. Pretty effective imo
