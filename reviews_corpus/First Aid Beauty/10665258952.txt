I recently got this and the first day that I tried it, my face felt amazing. It’s only been 4 days and I’ve seen an improvement on my face. It’s soft and it doesn’t feel dry. If you have sensitive skin, this product is for you. This company has saved my skin and I’ll continue to buy from First Aid Beauty ❤️ Go buy it
