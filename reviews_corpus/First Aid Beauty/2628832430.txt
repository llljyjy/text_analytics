I used this as my face moisturizer for five years and it was the most reliable product I’ve ever had. I recently moved and due to environmental changes this is too hydrating for my combination skin now. No worries, though — now I just save it for dry hands, elbows, etc.! Truly the ultimate skin-sensitive moisturizer. nan
