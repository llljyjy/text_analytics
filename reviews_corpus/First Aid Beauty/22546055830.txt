Iâ€™m honestly not so sure why I saw so many one star ratings, because this cleansing oil is really good. I used it when I had a FULL face of makeup on, including waterproof mascara, and it took off all of my makeup no problem while leaving my face feeling clean. I would definitely recommend! Amazing!
