Got this with points based on the reviews to try before purchasing a full size. It was just ok, the hype was so huge that i expected it to be a game changer. At first it does feel very hydrating and soft but it dries up so quickly that my morning it the area i apply it to is so dry that it feels like i washed my hands and didnt apply lotion. Lots of other products out there that do what this claims just ok, nothing special
