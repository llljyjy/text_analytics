I didn’t use it for my face so I don’t know if it work for your face but perhaps I did use it for my body because out of nowhere I started to have back acne. Maybe because i started working out or i don’t rince my back enough after I wash my hair but anyway. I was surprised after 3 uses my back acne was gone so it has now become a staple in my routine. A little goes a long way I only use a pea size amount of it and only on my back at the end of my shower :) back acne
