[Gifted by FAB] I don’t typically enjoy using Vitamin C very much as most of the ones I’ve tried have a bit of a funky scent, but I really appreciated that this one didn’t have that at all. It has a bit of a watery texture but is easy to use. I do like the packaging, though when it arrived, there were some dry clumps that looked like something had leaked. Thankfully, I haven’t noticed any further leaking from the packaging. Although I haven’t seen noticeable brightening, I will continue to use it as it’s been enjoyable to incorporate. nan
