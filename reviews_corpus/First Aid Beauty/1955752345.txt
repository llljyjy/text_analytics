I got this while it was on sale to try and wish I bought more! I’ve tried gold bond cream to l’occitaine cream and this is by far the best. Not greasy but keeps your hands supple. I work in health care and wash my hands so much. This has been amazing for the winter dryness as well. Cannot recommend enough. Best by far
