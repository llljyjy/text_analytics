This is the first mineral sunscreen that I have used that I loved right off the bat. It is fragrance free and leaves no white case on my skin. I have super sensitive skin and have no broken out and had any negative reaction to this product. It wears well alone or under makeup. I will definitely be repurchasing this product. nan
