I love love love this toner. My skin is sensitive and gets pretty dry in the winter and this always saves my skin. Upset skin barrier? Use this for a few days and youâ€™re good to go, same with dryness and other irritations. I also use it after using a strong exfoliating treatment or mask to prevent irritation later on. This stuff has saved my skin so many times and I will continue to repurchase this because of that. Saved my skin
