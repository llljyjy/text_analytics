I received this product from FAB in exchange for an honest review. I was currently using a different vitamin C product before being gifted this. The texture of this product is very lightweight, watery, and not sticky. At around ~$30 an ounce it is cheaper than most vitamin C products on here and works just as effectively, giving a great glow without causing breakouts. I will likely purchase this myself once it runs out. Good Vitamin C product at a great price!
