This is a vitamin c serum that does not sting skin nor smell bad!As someone who has used a lot of vitamin c serums over the years, this is a very welcome release! First off, the packaging is fantastic - it’s a twist pump that protects the antioxidant formula inside. The product itself is clear and unscented, and the formula contains a vitamin c derivative as well as brightening licorice and calming colloidal oatmeal.Because this is a vitamin c derivative, it does not require a low pH in order to be effective - which also means it does not sting the skin. Additionally, it’s far more stable than L-AA, which means you won’t have to worry about this product oxidizing (a process that happens rapidly with most L-AA serums).The only note I have is that there is a learning curve to using the pump system. The first few times I used it, I noticed it sprayed out a bit. Per the instructions, make sure you are pumping this at a 45 degree angle!Overall, great product for those looking for an easier vitamin c serum and/or one that will work on sensitive skin! No stinging nor bad smell!
