I’ve used these pads for about a year and my ultimate thoughts are that I find them functional but not necessary. They didn’t make a huge difference to my skin but I enjoyed using them when I thought my face felt very dirty. No cons really, they don’t sting and don’t really have any scent. The pad was useful to physically remove any residual dirt on the face but the formula itself was really mild and didn’t really remove the texture on my face as much as I wanted it to and it didn’t do anything for my hyperpigmentation. All in all, I think this is a good product for people with normal skin and mild texture. Good for normal skin people
