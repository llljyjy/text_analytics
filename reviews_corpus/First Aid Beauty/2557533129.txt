This product will ALWAYS be a staple in my skincare routine! I use it after cleansing and it just hydrates my skin to the point where I feel like I don’t even need moisturizer (I do moisturize after because the skin needs an actual moisturizer so don’t @ me). I pour some directly into hands, rub together, and massage onto face. It’s non-irritating (just look at the ingredients) and bonus, it smells lightly like powdered sugar but the scent doesn’t linger. This is such an amazing product! FOREVER FAVORITE
