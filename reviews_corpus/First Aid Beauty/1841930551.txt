I’m really disappointed in this product.  I am typically a fan of this brand.  It has a gross cucumber scent that makes me want to gag.  It does not have the consistency of a typical eye cream.  It is very watery.  It hasn’t  done anything for my dryness.  It causes a little burning sensation, although I do have sensitive skin. very disappointing, watery, terrible smell
