Great cleanser!! Gentle, has a nice neutral smell, and I love the way it gets foamy without leaving my skin feeling tight and dry afterward. I have the jumbo bottle, and will continue to purchase the largest size available. I switched from Origins Checks and Balances (which I really enjoyed) to this, largely because I found that it did a better job of removing leftover makeup from my face. Gentle, sudsy, and effective
