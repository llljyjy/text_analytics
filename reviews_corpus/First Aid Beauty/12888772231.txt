I have very oily skin and I wanted to find another moisturizer (Although i love my current one, I was just getting bored of the glow recipe pink juice) This worked for me in regards to controlling oil but no matter what I did it would pill so badly. If you have the patience and can make it work, GO FOR IT! But it just didn’t work for me, I’ll be sticking to my holy grail pink juice haha didn’t work for me
