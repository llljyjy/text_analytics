I bought this because I saw pretty good reviews. I have darkness on the outer corners of my eyes that I always try to cover up but never works really well. I’ve tried other eye creams and nothing really works. Neither does this. It’s lightweight, which IS nice, however, it was constantly separating; it would go from being creamy to just oil pouring out of the tip. I tried to *mix* it best I could in the tube or on my finger. I ended up just squeezing it in the sink and SO much oil came out. It didn’t lighten my eyes or necessarily hydrate them anymore. Not Worth the $58...
