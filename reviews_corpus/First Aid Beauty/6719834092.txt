The first thing I noticed about this cleanser is that it has an unpleasant smell. It has “no artificial fragrance” but it definitely does not smell good or odorless. I have dry skin and my face was so dry and flaky from using this. I have to use a heavy duty oil and moisturizer just to get back skin back to “normal” after. Not good for dry skin.
