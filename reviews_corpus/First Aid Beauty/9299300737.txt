This is my first First Aid Beauty product and I am in love! It soothes and hydrates my skin and I genuinely love this product. My go to toner before was the Pixi Rose Tonic, and this toner is just a bit better when it comes to replenishing my skin and prepping it for me for my actives. I use this one at night and my Pixi tonic durning the day. Would 100% recommend. Itâ€™s Beautiful
