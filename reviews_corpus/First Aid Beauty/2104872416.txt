The new Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 is totally FAB because it actually does what it claims: Lightweight = Yes! Non-greasy = Yes! Quickly Absorbed = Yes! No White Cast = Absolutely NO white cast at all! Yay… I appreciate that it includes hydrating ingredients like Avocado Oil & Vitamin E and that it’s totally fragrance-free and no weird “sunscreen scent”. I really love that this does not burn my eyes like many sunscreens do and that it works so perfectly under my makeup. Well done - a new holy grail sunscreen for me! Another WIN from First Aid Beauty!! Another WIN from First Aid Beauty!
