I like it, it’s fresh and the cucumber scent is pleasant. It’s hydrating and makes my skin feels soft, but honestly for the price I’m not sure it’s worth it. Yes it’s hydrating but as any face cream so I don’t think I will buy this again. But it’s not a bad product, I just don’t feel it do much for me. Hydrating but is it worth it?
