First of all, I do want to mention that I have not used this product enough to see if there is actual improvement in my dark spots. However, this is the most hydrating vitamin C product Iâ€™ve used! Due to the twist pump, I was expecting a gel like serum, but this serum is quite fluid. There is no scent and the best part?! The PAO is 18 months!! For 50 mL of product, I find this pretty promising! nan
