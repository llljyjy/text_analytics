I’ve been using this product for a week and have really enjoyed it! The packaging is incredibly designed to work easily and keep the product fresh. After trying several vitamin c products, this is the first one that hasn’t caused irritation on my sensitive skin. I have had a small breakout on my chin but it could be the product cleaning out my pores. Overall though, the serum goes on really well, absorbs well, and doesn’t leave skin feeling sticky. My face feels bright and I am excited to see how my skin looks with continued use of this vitamin c serum! Brightening Serum
