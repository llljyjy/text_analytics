Loving this sunscreen so far! I often find that mineral sunscreens leave a filmy kind of feeling or even a white cast that is bothersome but this doesn’t and feels incredibly comfortable and I’d describe almost a little matte on my skin. It also buffs in quickly and easily without leaving streaks. It is a fragrance free product, but lacks that sunscreen-y smell that such products often have. Instead it has a pleasant very faint smell when it goes on that I think might be the avocado oil.It says it is not water resistant so I wouldn’t recommend for swimming for a hard workout, but I found it didn’t seem to run off my face for lighter activities like walking the dog or pulling some weeds. Of course you’ll want to reapply as directed.Overall I’m genuinely impressed at what a nice product this and look forward to using it all!I received the product from the brand to test in exchange for my opinions. such an enjoyable a light- feeling product!
