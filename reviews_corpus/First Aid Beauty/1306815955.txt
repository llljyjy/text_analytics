Gladly surprised by this. One of the best mineral sunscreens I’ve tried. There is absolutely no white cast (and I used a lot), no harsh fragrance which is one of my favorite things since I hate for the sunscreen smell to mask my perfume. There’s no greasy feeling after using it and it is actually super blendable. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I think the pump in mine does not work properly as it takes many pushes to get the product out A keeper!
