I love the work this cream does—simple, lightweight, creamy, feels like it tightens a little, and goes well under primer & makeup. however it smells VERY strongly of cucumber, which I know is great for your eyes but I can’t stand the smell or taste of cucumber—that’s just a personal thing. So if you hate cucumbers like I do, just keep that in mind lol! But the cream itself does a great job. smells very strongly of cucumber
