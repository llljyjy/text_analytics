This cleanser is good if youre looking for something gentle and not specifically targeting any problems in particular. I was gifted this cleanser so thatâ€™s why Im using something that doesnt address my skincare concerns. I have very acne prone skin with deep hyperpigmentation and while this cleanser is very gentle and effective against removing sweat, dirt and oil, it just isnt enough for my skin issues. For the price, I think this is a fair size, a little goes a long way and I will be using this product up for a while but I wont be repurchasing. There is practically no smell, good or bad, and it doesnt leave my face feeling overly stripped. This would probably be good for someone with very dry and sensitive skin. While this product doesnt work for me and my specific needs, it is still a good cleanser and good value. Doesnt meet my needs, still a good cleanser!
