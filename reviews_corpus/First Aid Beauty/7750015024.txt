I use this one every other night as Step 3 in my routine. I have noticed an improvement in vertical lines between my brow lines. Applies easily and a little goes a long way. I would not suggest this as the only or daily serum in your routine. I see this as an add on. I do use 2 other brands , one high end and one from The Ordinary purchased here at Sephora. Serums are fantastic for the skin. Solid performance from this retinol serum.
