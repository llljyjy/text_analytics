I bought this after seeing how popular it was and reading the reviews but it doesn’t work for me :( for some reason it doesn’t really moisturize my skin, or maybe it absorbs really quickly but like 10 minutes after applying, it feels like nothing really happened so I’ll apply it twice sometimes. It’s super lightweight and for reference I have normal skin that’s only slightly dry in the winter. Also there’s a weird minty smell. not moisturizing
