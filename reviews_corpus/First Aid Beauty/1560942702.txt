Wow… I can’t believe how much I dislike this cream.It actually leaves my skin drier than it was before I put it on.I will give it 2 stars for its beautiful smell and I like the cool and gel like consistency, but it does a terrible job at what it supposed to do.Sadly, I waited to long to try this and missed my return window. Very Drying
