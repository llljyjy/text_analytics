Like some other reviewers, I’m extremely confused about the hype surrounding this product. It says “intense hydration“ and leaves my face with a dry cast all over. I can’t imagine it being hydrating unless it were combined with a humectant product. The tub is huge and it’s a terrible moisturizer, so I am definitely disappointed. doesn't live up to the hype (at all)
