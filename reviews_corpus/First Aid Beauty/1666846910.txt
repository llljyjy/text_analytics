I had never used this cleanser but had wanted to try it. So bought the 2oz trial size and threw it in my bag for vacation. Omg it smelled like old cheese and sweat. I rinsed it off and that smell lingered. Ridiculous for something to smell that horrid thatâ€™s meant to cleanse your face. I threw it away and had to use my shampoo while traveling! horrid smell
