Because I have sensitive skin, I try to look for a vitamin c serum that doesn’t irritate my skin. This product is lightweight, gentle, non-sticky and leaves my skin looking brighter and feeling soft. FAB’s pump packaging works beautifully, especially when you pump at a 45-degree angle. It layers well with my other skincare products, including spf. A small amount goes a long way. Great for Sensitive Skin!
