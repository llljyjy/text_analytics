If you have sensitive skin and you’re pale, you might want to give this a try. Being a physical/mineral sunscreen I find this doesn’t irritate my eczema/rosacea, didn’t burn/puff up my eyes, and it hasn’t caused any inflammatory acne. I haven’t had any problems with it pilling or behaving oddly with other skincare and makeup. It leaves a slightly dewy/natural finish on the skin. There’s no strong sunscreen smell and doesn’t feel super sticky or thick. It will probably leave a bit of a cast on darker skin, it is not sweat/waterproof so it’s better suited to daily wear rather than active/beach time, and it is not an oil-free formulation so it could potentially cause some comedonal acne (blackheads & whiteheads). Overall it’s a solid option with a few caveats. Solid option for pale sensitive skin
