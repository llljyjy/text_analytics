One of the best Vitamin-C serums that I have ever tried. I have very sensitive skin and suffer from eczema on my face. I’ve been using this serum for 3 weeks now, day & night & my skin looks so much brighter. It did not break me out & I love that it’s very light weight. This has been the only Vitamin-C serum that I have tried, that did not break me out nor irritated my skin. Highly recommend!!
