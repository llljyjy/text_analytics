I really like first aid beauty and have used multiples of their products. I was hopeful for this product as an oil based cleanser and could combine that with their regular cleanser to make a FAB 2-step cleanser. This is not really an oil cleanser... it’s more of a gentle gel cleanser. I didn’t find it to be effective against water-proof makeup like mascara or brow pomade. There are better oil-based cleansers however true to their nature this does not irritate your skin. Not my favorite
