I love FAB but I didn’t love this product. It’s not an oil at all, it’s a gel so it has a weird consistency when trying to use as a cleansing oil. It did okay at removing eye makeup, but it felt very drying and stripping. My skin was squeaky clean (in a bad way) even while rinsing it off. It felt weird and bad for my skin barrier so I returned it. nan
