I’m a combo skin guy that naturally leans on the oilier side so I love water based products and heard great things about this. I just don’t get the hype at all. It stings when I use it and it’s a moisturizer? I tried this for a few days, it stung, so I took a break and the problem stopped, and then it stung again.It wasn’t as hydrating as Tatcha’s watercream nor did I care for the consistancy, though it did absorb well and it did hydrate. So...it works. I almost considered not even finishing it, but I’m cheap. 100% would not buy it again and I would gift it to someone else if given it in the future. Stings my skin
