love it. I have combo skin and I use it all over, less on my t zone and more on my cheeks. doesn’t make me break our, provides a nice layer before my sunscreen, when I wash it off my face is left soft to the touch. outperforms some really expensive tinted moisturizers or primers I’ve tried by a mile. highly recommend! so glad they gave me a sample, bought a tube.
