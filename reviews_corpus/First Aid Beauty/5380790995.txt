This product, I’ve been using since high school. More than 10 years later it’s still (imo) the mvp. I’ve tried other toners/exfoliates just for the heck of. Curious to see if more money meant resulted in a better product; but nope! I always revert back. This product never breaks me out or causes any irritation. Needless to say, I’m hooked! Top Tier MVP
