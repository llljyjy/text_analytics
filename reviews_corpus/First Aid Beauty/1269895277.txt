This is an incredible primer and an incredible moisturizer rolled into one! My skin drinks this up and it leaves a beautiful pearlescent sheen that translates to a subtle healthy glow when you layer foundation on top of it. Itâ€™s a little bit too shiny and pearly for my taste to wear on its own, but I know some people love that look. I sometimes also pat this on as a highlighter over my makeup. nan
