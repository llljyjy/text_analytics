Great cleanser! Very mild, no fragrance, doesn’t strip your skin. However, I’d say to avoid the value 11oz bottle. The cleanser seems to separate so when you get to the last 1/4 of the bottle, the product is too thick to come out from the pump. So I’m consistently opening the bottle and trying to mix it with the pump to get the product to come out. Definitely getting the squeeze 5oz bottle next time. nan
