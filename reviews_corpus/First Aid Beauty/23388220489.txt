I’ve been using this product for the last two weeks and have really loved how it’s reacted with my sensitive skin. The smell is very minimal unlike other vitamin C serums I’ve used in the past. This one doesn’t bother me. This product has a good price point compared to over ones as well. So far I’ve enjoyed the product and will keep using it with spf. Good for Sensitive Skin
