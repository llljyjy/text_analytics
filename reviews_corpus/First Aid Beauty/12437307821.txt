I LOVE this. As someone with very sensitive skin, it took a lot of trial and error to find a product that worked for me. I used to use BeautyCounter Coco Cream Cleanser, but it became too much of a hassle to always ship it when I needed more instead of buying it in-store. I did some research and found this First Aid Beauty product, and the cream texture works really well with my skin. Iâ€™ve noticed how much clearer and smoother my skin has become, as well as more evenly colored. Love love love this product and would recommend it to anyone. Best Cream Cleanser EVER
