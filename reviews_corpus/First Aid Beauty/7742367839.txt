This is a really nice eye cream with some amazing ingredients. The star of the show is retinol, an anti-aging hero that has actual scientific data proving its effectiveness in combating wrinkles and other skin issues. Since the skin around the eyes is thinner and much more sensitive than the skin on the rest of the face, it’s nice to have a product that can provide the benefits of retinol with a concentration appropriate for that specific area. I’ve been using this for a few weeks and haven’t experienced any irritation. I haven’t noticed any differences either, but I don’t actually have fine lines to target around my eyes yet, so I’m using this as a preventive measure.I can’t bring myself to give it 5 stars because of the unnecessarily high price and also the undisclosed percentage of retinol. While I assume the percentage must be low, I’d still like to know the exact amount of retinol I’m getting, especially since retinol is the ingredient being used to advertise the product. The Paula’s Choice Ceramide-Enriched Firming Eye Cream is a better choice, in my opinion, since the percentage of retinol (0.025%) is disclosed and it also contains more ceramides and peptides than this one by First Aid Beauty. Still, it’s a good quality product. nan
