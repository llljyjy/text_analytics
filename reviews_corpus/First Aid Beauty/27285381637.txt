This is a great product! I like the gentle exfoliation just from using the pad and the solution is very effective. It keeps my skin clear and has a noticeable brightening effect. I do like the slight cinnamon scent as well. These pads are so saturated with solution though that it feel wasteful to throw it away while it’s still soaked. I also use it on my neck and arms just to use it up and it has had a great effect there. There’s extra solution left also which is great to use with cotton rounds after the pads run out. nan
