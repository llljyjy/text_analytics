I have a health issue that causes my upper and lower eyelids to get very inflamed and sometimes swell.  While the problem is internal, it still affects my skin.  Often times I can’t use any moisturizer or eye cream because they could sting and burn.  I tried this today (and my eyes are flaring up), and this cream was soothing and moisturizing! I’m so happy! And it’s almost half the price of what I was previously using.  I believe this is my new eye cream! finally!!
