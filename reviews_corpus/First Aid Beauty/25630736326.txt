My leg has been damaged for years from how water growing up and it has left my skin tight, dry and really itchy. I’ve tried lotion after lotion and oils after oils, and nothing could have revered the damages UNTIL I tried this product. I’ve only used it a few times I I can feel and see major differences. I bought it originally for my boyfriend’s drink skin and wanted to test it out for myself. It works wonder on the face as well, even for my oily skin type. I’m so happy I bought an extra bottle during the sale! I probably would have paid the full price as well Repaired my skin
