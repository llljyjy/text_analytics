I am an avid FAB user and was excited to try out the new sunscreen! IMO, this relaunch is 100x better than the previous product. It is easy to apply, goes on smoothly, and does well under makeup. Depending on the amount of product you use, it takes a minute or two to rub it in, though I find it easier if when Iâ€™ve applied FAB moisturizer beforehand. I do not have especially sensitive skin, but this product does not have an overwhelming or fragranced scent which is a plus! My only concern is the pump occasionally stops working, but one could always cut open the tube towards the end of its use to get the remaining product. Overall a great product, thanks FAB! nan
