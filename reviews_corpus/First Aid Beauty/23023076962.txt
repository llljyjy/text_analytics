I’m blown away with this sunscreen! It’s mineral, it’s clean and it’s so easy to spread! This formula doesn’t feel sticky, greasy or leave a white cast. There’s almost no scent to it. And the fact I’m most happy about - it doesn’t break me out (despite most SPFs do). It leaves natural finish and feels pretty hydrating so that you may want to skip your AM moisturizer. All in all I find this sunscreen to be just perfect and hope it’ll be available in jumbo size. Hands down the best mineral SPF I’ve tried!
