I was excited to try this product because it promised no white cast on any skin type.  I loved the packaging, very smart to use that type of pump.  The sunscreen was non greasy which is what I have been looking for, I am shiny enough on my own.  Letâ€™s talk about the white cast...it was there and it was not going anywhere unfortunately.  I never really felt the product absorbed completely into my caramel colored skin, despite the claim that it leaves no white cast. The sunscreen left my skin dull and gray.   If are looking for mineral sunscreen that does not leave a cast on darker skin tones, this is not it. Leaves a white cast
