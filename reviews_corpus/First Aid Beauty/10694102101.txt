The sunscreen has a nice consistency,  not too thick or oily. Truly fragrance free which is really great. My only concern is that I was left with a slight white cast and gray finish. My skin looked dull. I rubbed it in for at least 90 seconds but couldnt get rid of the white cast. Iâ€™m on the lighter end of brown skin and cant see how this will work on darker skin, which is unfortunate because it states no white cast on any skin tone. Nice, fragrance free, but unfortunate white cast
