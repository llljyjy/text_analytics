This cleanser does a great job of gently removing complexion makeup, and I love the travel friendly packing that twists to stop product from dispensing. However, this cleanser is not great at removing eye makeup. I find that when I try to gently rub away my eye makeup, this cleanser stings my eyes. I always have to go in with a q-tip to remove excess eye makeup after I’ve already cleansed. I think this product is great if you just want to remove some light complexion makeup, but otherwise I wouldn’t recommend it. Stings when removing eye makeup
