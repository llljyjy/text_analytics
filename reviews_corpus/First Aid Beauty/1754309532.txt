I got this as a sample. 1st impressions were it was instantly moisturizing and didn’t have to wait for it to “soak in“ my skin. Then I noticed the palms of my hands were very greasy and oily. I want to feel moisturized, not oily. I felt like I wanted to wash the oil off my hands but it’d defeat the whole purpose. Greasy/oily
