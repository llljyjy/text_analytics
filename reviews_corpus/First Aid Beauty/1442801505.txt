I’ve been using this 2-in-1 cleanser for almost a week now and so far,  I’m mostly pleased.   It does remove at least 98% of my full face of makeup,  leaving only a smidge of “stay all day“ liner from my tightline/lash area. My only complaints are that the word oil is misleading as it doesn’t feel at all like an oil (in the traditional sense)  nor did I see any oils listed in the ingredients - which wouldn’t be a big deal except its literally called an “oil“ cleanser and can leave me a tiny bit dry.  But to be fair,  I do have dry skin to start with. so I almost always feel like I need to serum and moisturize right after cleansing anyway.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this if you really don’t like the greasy part of a double cleanse or really need the 2-in1 time saving option.  It’s not AMAZING, but it is nice and it works well. Not quite an oil,  but it's good...
