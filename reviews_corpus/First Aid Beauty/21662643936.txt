I recently switched from an acne specific cleanser to this one and so far so great. it’s been about 3 weeks, I had a few VERY SMALL breakouts for about 3 days when I switched then it cleared up and my skin is sooooo soft now. I couldn’t believe it! It way less than the cleanser I was using and my skin is actually hydrated without breaking out. But what is with that smell?! I know it’s “clean“ but other clean products don’t smell like they’re spoiled. I hope they can change that without changing the formula. Unfortunately it seems I’m getting used to it, but I am self conscious I smell like something rotten. Great Product, Terrible Smell!
