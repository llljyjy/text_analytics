I received this product as a gift in exchange for a review. I think the packaging needs quite a bit of improvement. Otherwise, the serum is great - feels light on the skin and smells great! There is a good amount of product compared to other brands, and it works for my sensitive skin. It doesnâ€™t feel sticky at all! nan
