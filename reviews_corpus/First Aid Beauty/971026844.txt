I have only used used this product alone and without makeup. I like that it is thin, that I can see where I put it, and that there is no smell. It does give a white cast and I have light skin with a slight tan right now and when I sweat I could see streaks. It also stays a bit tacky and never dries down. I will use up the product because I received it for free but I would not purchase it. nan
