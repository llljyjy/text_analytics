This is the sunscreen I have been searching for my entire life! It contains zinc, which means there is a white tint when you apply, but it’s almost instantly absorbed. It remains just long enough for you to make sure you got everywhere covered! No greasy film and doesn’t melt into/burn your eyes. It’s also scent-free which is a MUST! Highly recommend! Your new FAVE sunscreen!!
