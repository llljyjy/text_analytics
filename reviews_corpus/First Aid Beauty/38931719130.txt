I have never used a vitamin c serum before, but i really like how this one makes my skin look! It doesn’t really have a smell and a little goes a long way. It’s a huge bottle that will last me several months. It does sometimes make my skin a tiny bit sticky and oily looking, but overall it goes on great! It’s very hydrating and leaves my face looking bright! nan
