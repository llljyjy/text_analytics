I have been testing out different Vitamin C serums for a little while now and liked the price point on this one. I have now been using it for the last three months and do not think I will be buying it again. The consistency of the serum is gel-like, which is fine, except that it dries like a gel as well. It sits on the top of the skin like a light gel mask and if you put any makeup or other products over it, it begins to peel. I put it on this morning and when I touched my face by mid-afternoon it looks like my face is flakey in some parts. I am no beauty guru, but would not recommend this product. Peels and Flakes
