Best toner I’ve used. I typically get severe eczema breakout patches on my forehead and the sides of my nose. (Super red, dry, itchy flaky)Since I’ve added this to my daily routine, I rarely get any angry patches. I find applying a generous amount with my fingers works best for me and then letting it dry for a minute before adding my serum and moisturizer. nan
