I am a pretty picky sunscreen user. I find most of them to be too oily and not kind to my sensitive skin. I’ve been using this for about two weeks and am OBSESSED. It is so gentle and perfect for people with more sensitive skin. I also really love that it is unscented which is so hard to find in sunscreen. I’ve been recommending to everyone I know that this stuff is the best! Even my friends with sensitive skin have been enjoying so I think it would really work for all skin types. I think. The price is also super fair for the product and how much you get. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SUNSCREEN!
