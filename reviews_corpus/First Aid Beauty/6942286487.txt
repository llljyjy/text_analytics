My favourite daytime moisturizer to wear under my makeup. I’m very insecure about faint 11 lines forming between my forehead. But, when I wear this moisturizer with The Ordinary’s Matrixyl, my forehead is noticeably plumper and smoother. This moisturizer will forever be a re-buy for me! Note: I have sensitive, acne prone skin Will forever re-purchase!
