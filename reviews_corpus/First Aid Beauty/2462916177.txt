I haven’t finished the jar but it really isn’t providing any moisture. It does make my skin very soft in the morning, but I need to layer another water based cream over this just to feel like my skin is getting moisturized. It is winter and my skin is dryer during this time, so I’m going to finish the jar, but I’d pick something else if you’re looking for something really hydrating. Moisture isn’t great
