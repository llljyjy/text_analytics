I was given this as a gift to try and I have to say I really like it.  Very lightly scented but not noticeable.  It absorbs into my skin super quickly.  I use it on my face and my foundation goes on nicely over it- none of those little pill balls.  I also use it on my neck as I had surgery and must protect the scar.  I especially like that it rubs in quickly and does not leave me super white nor sticky.  I  like it so much I will purchase when I run out. zinc sunscreen that really absorbs!
