I have normal skin, though I can be prone to dryness because I use a lot of chemical exfoliants to control my acne. This cleanser foams really nicely, and does remove makeup pretty well. However, it left my face feeling so tight and dry - squeaky clean. This was not soothing or hydrating, but it didn’t break me out. I’ll be using what’s left of my travel size as a body wash only. very stripping
