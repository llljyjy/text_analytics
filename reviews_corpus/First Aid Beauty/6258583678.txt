This is by far one of my favorite mineral sunscreens! I haven’t noticed a white cast with it at all (granted I’m very pale) but it rubs in very well. I do apply under my makeup and it lays very nicely, unless I apply two layers of the sunscreen. Usually mineral sunscreens are hard for me to wear under makeup, but this one is very pretty with or without makeup nan
