I’ve purchase this product and I have to admit, It does what it claims. However, I do not have sensitive skin but it did slightly burn across both of jaw lines. I am not fan of creams that burn unless it’s purpose is to exfoliate. Although I’ve enjoyed the results of my skin, I just wasn’t a fan of tingling so prevent rashes, bumps or any form of irritation, I’ve just decided to return it. It did brightening my skin, the hydration was minimal, and it’s pretty light weight. You do receive quite a bite of product for the price and the ingredients are lovely. I am just not sure what ingredient is contribute to the tingling/ burning sensation? If you mind the burn, you may have to return
