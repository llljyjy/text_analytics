Awful! I love First Aid Beauty cleanser, repair cream, and obsessed with their radiance toning pads so I expected to love this as well. It does not remove makeup at all! I was thinking this would be comparable to Green Clean makeup removing balm but it does nothing to my makeup at all. By the end of it I still had mascara, eyeliner and foundation on after scrubbing twice with this. So disappointed nan
