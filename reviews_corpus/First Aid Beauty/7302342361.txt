This product was gifted to me, and I couldnâ€™t have been happier!!! After using this product, my skin felt very supple, and moisturize. The first time I used it, I paired it with a glycolic, resurfacing serum, and it crumbled all over my face. So I started over and wore it with a moisturizer on top. The result was absolutely phenomenal! I did the balance test and boy did my skin snap back! This product is no joke! I will definitely be keeping it in my skin care regimen! GET THAT BOUNCE!!!
