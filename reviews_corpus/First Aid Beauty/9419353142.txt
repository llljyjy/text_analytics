I have wicked dry skin and usually i am a BareMinerals Butter Drench only girl but my mom bought me this and I LOVE IT. It is very light but wow does it hydrate. Usually I have to reapply towards the end of the day (mid afternoon) because my skin feels tight but not with Butter Drench and now THIS!! No second application for me! SO GOOD
