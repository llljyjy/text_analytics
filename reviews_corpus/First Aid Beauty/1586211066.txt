Used this for a couple years. Is a great moisturizer and very nourishing. Its also a great price and has ingredients good for the skin. However it has dimethicone which I try to avoid. Moisturizers without dimethicone or silicones are hard to find, so I used this when I could not afford or get a better one without silicones. I really suggest that First Aid Beauty make a version of this without silicones!! Good for the price. Has silicones.
