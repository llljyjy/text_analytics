This has pretty great ingredients which would definitely help as an eye cream. But as far as brightening dark circles immediately, it didn’t really help in that department. There’s some shimmer that is pretty good, but there’s no tint or brightener, so it didn’t really counter my hyperpigmented skin. Also, I have brown/tan skin with indian girl dark circles so that could be why. I bet this would work super great for a fair skinned person with negligible hyperpigmentation, because the shimmer does look nice. nan
