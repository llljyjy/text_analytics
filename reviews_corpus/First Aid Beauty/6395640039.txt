I’ve been looking for a new oil cleanser since my favorite was discontinued. This isn’t it. I usually have to apply twice to remove makeup. On days I don’t wear makeup it does get my skin feeling pretty clean, but it’s very drying. As a person with dry skin, that beats the reason I’m looking for an oil cleanser. Another reviewer said the product feels more like soap than oil, and I would agree. nan
