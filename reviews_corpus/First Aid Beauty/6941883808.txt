I absolutely love this cleanser. I used to use it for years and then stopped for some reason. I’ve found my way back to it and I’ve fallen in love with it all over again! The texture is so nice and my skin always feels SO soft after I wash my face. I love that it is fragrance-free as well. I’ve started using both the cleanser and the ultra repair cream and I think my skin is really liking the combo. :) The Best!
