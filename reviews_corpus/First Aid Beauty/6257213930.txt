Love love love this product as I have super dry skin especially in my T zone. My only negative comment that held me back from giving this product 5 stars is that this product PILLS extremely under any makeup and sunscreen I put on top. This is why I only wear it at night and it works for me. Great nighttime moisturizer but pills
