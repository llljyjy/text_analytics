This is it. The best moisturizer ever. There is no product I use more voraciously than this one. I have oily/acne prone skin but this doesn’t break me out. It’s pretty thick but just feels so amazing on the skin. I used to use it only at night but now I use it morning and night. It’s also affordable. I use a silicone spatula to get it out of the pot to avoid contaminating it. Love love love. nan
