My skin can get very oily and I use this product during the day along with The Ordinarys’ Niacinamide and it does WONDERS! Great for summer use as it can get very humid outside. The feel of the Product doesn’t feel heavy, feels cool upon application, and last about 8 hours of hydration. Helps with Oily Skin
