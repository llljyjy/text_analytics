Love this product, i havent had any irritation on my sensitive skin and my face is left feeling clean but not dry. I removed a star because the product separates which leaves me having to shake it up for a fair consistency, which is not very user friendly in this toothpaste-style tube. A true go-to for acne prone sensitive skin
