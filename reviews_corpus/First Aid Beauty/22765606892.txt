I love this eye cream for morning! I don’t wear make-up and so I love the glitter/shimmer in this product because it gives me a little glow in the mornings. If you wear make-up it might be a little annoying, so I wouldn’t recommend before other products. I love the subtle smell of this, definitely going to stick to this for morning routine. Great brightening cream if you don't use makeup
