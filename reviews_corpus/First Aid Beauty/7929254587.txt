I bought this to help combat some extreme dryness and flakiness i’ve been having on my face. Within 2 days i’ve noticed that the dryness is starting to heal and the redness on my cheeks is starting to heal as well. I like this because it doesn’t feel greasy like and oil would but it still makes my skin feel hydrated. The only problem i’ve had is the dropper was sticky when I first opened the product and I can’t seem to get all the gunk off, other than that though this product performs wonderfully on my dry skin! Noticed a difference in DAYS!
