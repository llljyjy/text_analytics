This sunscreen packaging is a lot bigger than i thought it would be. It truly blends out to clear, which most mineral sunscreens do not that claim to. I have oily/acne prone skin but am also really easily prone to irritation and this is perfect. Feels really good on the skin and doesn’t make me react/burn or get red, and hasn’t made me breakout. I also noticed that it controls my oils nicely and i don’t feel like an oil slick by the end of the day. 10/10 recommend. Great for sensitive and acne prone skin
