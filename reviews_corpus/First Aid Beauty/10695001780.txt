Amazing product. The ingredient list is one of the best I’ve seen for sensitive, dry skin. It has the most luxurious texture and soaks right into my skin. It makes my skin have a nice healthy glow. I have always stayed away from vitamin C because it tends to irritate my skin. I love everything from first aid beauty and was so excited to see they came out with this! The packaging is also fantastic. If you aren’t careful, too much can come out of the bottle but I love the twist pump keeping air out from ruining the product. I have only been using this for a couple days but I would definitely try this if you are on the fence about it! The best for sensitive/dry skin!!!!
