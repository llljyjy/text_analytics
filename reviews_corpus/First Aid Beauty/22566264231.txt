First Aid Beauty did a great job with this serum. I love this vitamin c serum. I only just bought it so I haven’t been using it long enough to say if it’s keeping my skin bright & clear but, it feels good & has a nice texture. It layers beautifully with the rest of my routine and has no scent. My skin has not had any negative reactions  to the serum either. Another great thing is this serum is 1.7oz so it’s more than the standard 1oz most brands have & the I love the packaging! : Vitamin C :
