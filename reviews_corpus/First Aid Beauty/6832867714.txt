Been buying samples of different types of eye creams to find the best for my skin. After testing several different eye creams at Sephora, I chose this one because it still is hydrating without being sticky or greasy. After a couple weeks of use, I began getting little pimples under my eyes and around the eye bone areas. It seems that anything with hyaluronic acid or vitamin c in it has been causing this. Nice cream just not for me. Caused Little Pimples Under Eyes
