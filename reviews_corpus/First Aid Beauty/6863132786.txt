Bought this moisturizer for my boyfriend to start his first simple skincare routine with a toner. He was using cerave moisturizing cream but said he loves this fab moisturizing cream way better because it’s not sticky like the cerave. I also have sensitive skin and when my skin feels dry, I would steal his moisturizer cream and use in replacement of my night cream as it’s more hydrating. Love it! Will continue to purchase! Great hydration and not sticky!
