I had horrible perioral dermatitis (little bumps around mouth and nose) for 2 years after harming my skin barrier with harsh products. I am so nervous to try new products in the fear that they’ll break me out. Since I’ve started using this, my skin has never looked better. It hasn’t broken me out at all and in fact my scars look a ton lighter! I also love their facial radiance pads and use them about twice a week. I can’t say enough good things about this brand and am so thankful for an awesome skincare line that isn’t harsh but works great. Perfect gentle face wash!
