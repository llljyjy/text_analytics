Love this as a winter moisturizer for my normal to oily skin.  So many great ingredients that nourish the skin and provide relief from any irritation caused by retinoid or acid usage.  A little goes a long way! It’s a yummy, thick and creamy texture, but sinks in well and hydrates without leaving a film on the skin or feeling heavy.  I try and steer clear of anything with fragrance or essential oils, as it can often break me out, but the tiny bit of eucalyptus oil is no issue for me.  It’s one of the few moisturizers (fragranced or non-fragranced) that doesn’t break me out, so it’s a staple in my routine! Hydration without the greasiness
