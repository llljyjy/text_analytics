Disclaimer: I received this serum in exchange for a review. For reference, i have normal/dry skin. I do think this is one of the best vitamin c serums in the market. It has great ingredients and helps brighten, and is amazing for sensitive skin. It’s super lightweight and my skin drinks it up. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a simple vitamin c serum! hello bright skin!!
