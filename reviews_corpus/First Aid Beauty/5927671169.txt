This is everything a Vitamin C serum should be!  It is lightweight and unscented.  It has soothing ingredients like colloidal oatmeal so it never leaves my face irritated after use.  It absorbs well, doesn’t leave behind a sticky residue, and never pills with other skincare and makeup.  It has increased overall radiance and evened out my skin tone, such as lessening the redness on my cheeks.  The packaging is innovative and helps the formula stay fresh and potent, which is especially important for a Vitamin C product.  You twist the blue cap counterclockwise to reveal the pump and twist it clockwise to conceal the pump.  The mechanism clicks once it’s fully open or closed, which will be great for travel so I can feel confident that it is completely shut and won’t spill.  When dispensing the serum, be sure to tilt the unit at a 45 degrees angle because if it’s more upright, the liquid will drip down into the crevices.  Also, pressing down firmly halfway on the pump will dispense the proper amount each time.  If you fully press down on the pump, it will be too much for one application.  It’s a learning curve for sure, but I definitely feel like I have the hang of it now that I’ve been using it for a few weeks! Effective yet gentle!
