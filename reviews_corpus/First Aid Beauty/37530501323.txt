I really like this sunscreen. Zinc oxide sunscreens are supposed to be better for your skin than sunscreens with other ingredients. While the sunscreen rubs in pretty nicely and doesnâ€™t feel very oily, it does leave my skin looking a little oily and with a little bit of a white cast. But other than that I love it and would definitely buy again. nan
