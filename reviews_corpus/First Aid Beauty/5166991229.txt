First off I have genetic dark eye circles so not a lot of eye creams do help, but this eye cream oh ma gawd it got rid of it like 70%. The results definitely took it’s time, I think I noticed after a week that it’s doing something. Definitely going to repurchase it’s a holy grail for my dark circles. nan
