Iâ€™ve used this a couple of times. There is no noticeable scent. Does take about 30-45 mins to blend in fully. It did leave a slight white cast on my brown skin. I think if I apply a light foundation it may be okay. My skin does feel a bit tacky though so I may need to change out my moisturizer according to some other reviews. nan
