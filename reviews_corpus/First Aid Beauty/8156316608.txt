I honestly have no clue why this product isn’t extremely hyped up because it works SO well. I’ve been perfecting my skincare routine and needed a toner that would help hydrate and reduce my post inflammatory erythema (the red marks after acne that aren’t hyperpigmentation). Although PIE is said to fade on its own and products don’t help, I have noticed a significant difference since adding this to my routine. Because it is so soothing and calming to the skin, it really helps eliminate a lot of the redness. Also, the fact that it has hydrating ingredients creates the optimal environment for skin to heal and help the PIE fade faster. Overall, my skin is so dewy, hydrated and even toned since incorporating this product. Holy grail for sure <3 BEST hydrating toner that got rid of my PIE
