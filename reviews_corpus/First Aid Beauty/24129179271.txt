This product has been great for my skin! I have really sensitive skin that breaks out in hives whenever I even touch hot water, so I needed a product for sensitive skin. On the other hand, I am a teen, so I also needed a product to help with my acne and keep my skin clean. This is such a nice face wash! It feels so nice on the skin and makes it so clean without stripping or drying my face. Some reviews say the smell is awful, but to me at least I really cannot smell anything besides like a soapy smell whatever that means. I recommend to anyone who has sensitive skin and also wants to clean their face! So fye
