I love this face cream. I tried Kiehls for a few months and that was okay. I ended up purchasing this Ultra Repair Cream in hopes that it would help with my redness and capillaries on my cheeks. I did notice a minor difference. I normally wear this over Youth To The PeopleTriple Peptide + Cactus Hydrating + Firming Oasis Serum and my makeup looks beautiful. I have sensitive combo skin and Iâ€™ve had no bad reactions to this. I like the scent also. nan
