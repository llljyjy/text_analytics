Thankfully I got this as a freebie for a different purchase I made because I would be so upset if I spent actual money on this product. It smells so revolting it is literally unusable. I can best describe the smell as citrus vomit. I didnâ€™t break out thankfully but I would only recommend this to someone who has no sense of smell. Smells so revolting, it's unusable!
