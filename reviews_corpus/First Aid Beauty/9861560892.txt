Disclaimer: I received this item for free in exchange for an honest review. As a longtime fan of First Aid Beauty, I was excited to try their new vitamin C serum, especially since I’ve been meaning to add vitamin C to my routine for a while. I have been doing research to find the right percentage, and 10% seems like a good, moderate place to start. I have eczema and dry skin, and I don’t have the money to buy luxury skincare products that run out quickly. So a serum with hyaluronic acid is perfect. Also the bottle is almost twice the size as farmacy’s new 10% vitamin c, at pretty much the same price. So if it works well, it’s a great deal. I’ve only been able to use the product for a few days before this review. But my first impression is that is an elegant formula, that isn’t too sticky, especially after topping it with moisturizer or sunscreen. It sits well under makeup, and is runnier than their hyaluronic serum. The instructions say to tilt the container 45 degrees, and that instruction is a must if you want to avoid having serum drip into the gaps on the lid. It’s a click top, where you twist to have the pump extend. Overall, I’m happy with the price and the formula! However, I can’t comment on its efficacy just yet and it’s important to dispense the product correctly to avoid losing any. nan
