I use it now for my eczema patches that I get in my chest and body works greats itâ€™s SUPER HYDRATING. A little goes a long way. You can make it thick for night cream or light for day use. However, I use to use it for my face a few years ago and worked great but now unfortunately my face has changed and it clogged me but hey exfoliating fixed that. nan
