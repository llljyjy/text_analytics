I was looking for a good winter moisturizer as my skin was starting to feel very dry (also from the retinol I was using). I was skeptical about the hype around this at first, but upon using it a couple of nights, Iâ€™m finding that my skin feels very soft and supple the morning after I use it. I find that I have to tap/rub it in gently a lot when I use it though (it takes a bit for it to soak in) but otherwise, I am very happy with it Soft and supple skin the morning after!
