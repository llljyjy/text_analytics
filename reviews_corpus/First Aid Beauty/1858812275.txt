This serum brightens my complexion instantly. It works great on sensitive skin. I donâ€™t feel itchiness or irritation. It does a good job at nourishing the flaky dry spots that I have. There is no scent. The twist pump is good for dispensing product and keep it clean. I feel the product is sticky on my face though. Overall it is a go. instant brightness
