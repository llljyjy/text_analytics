This sunscreen blew me away!!!! Immediately became one of my favs. The texture is super nice, in the middle of liquid and cream, and sinks into my skin super quickly. I used this all week at the beach (no sunburns!) and I also use it for regular daily use. It’s one of the few sunscreens I’ve used that hasn’t made my face feel greasy and oily but also hasn’t made my face feel dry - it’s totally undetectable. Also wears under makeup well and doesn’t pill!!!! Very natural finish with 0 white cast. I’m soooo impressed with this sunscreen and will be repurchasing when I finish mine. New Favorite Sunscreen
