I have been enjoying this sunscreen for the last two weeks and it has held up very well! I don’t feel it at all underneath my makeup and there is no white cast that I’ve noticed as a darker skin woman. The sunscreen also has no scent which is perfect for people sensitive to fragrance. In addition, the packaging is great, but it takes a while for the product to first come out of the pump so be patient. nan
