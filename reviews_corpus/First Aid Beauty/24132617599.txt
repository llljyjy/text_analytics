I’ve been looking for a mineral sunscreen that leaves no white cast and is quick to absorb for years! And here it is! Thank you FAB for such an amazing formulation! Not only it spreads easily but also feels lightweight on the skin and adds beautiful glow to it. There’s barely noticeable sunscreen scent to it, which I’m ok with. One more thing to mention - the packaging says this SPF is not waterproof. I applied it yesterday before going to the pool and didn’t get any signs of burns despite spending several hours in the water. So I’m pleasantly surprised! My new fave SPF!
