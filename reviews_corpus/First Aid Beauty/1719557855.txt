This is a nice lightweight sunscreen. Perfect to wear year round. I tried it on a very hot humid day and was outside majority of the day. I did not feel extra sweaty or any thick paste on my face. I have olive skin tone and it did not leave white patches on my face. I would definitely get this again. Lightweight under makeup if your doing that   I use a lot of FAB products and this was a great one Lightweight Formula
