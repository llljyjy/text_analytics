I’ve been buying the Full size unscented Ultra Repair Cream for a few years and I notice this jar and my 2nd jar is off. Petro chemical fishy mold smell again. Cream doesn’t glide on or absorb right it stays on top of my face and hands too. It’s almost like there is too much oil in it. I’m moving on to a more reliable less chemical smelling deep moisturizing cream. Not reliable. Petro fishy mold smell again.
