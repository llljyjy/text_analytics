I tried this product for a week as a new addition to my skincare routine with Tretinoin. My skin is normally combination, and this stuff had my skin flaking SO BAD. it also stung a little going on, so maybe not great for sensitive skin. Had higher hopes for this based on reviews. Going back to my old, more expensive brand. Still on the search for something FA safe, affordable, & ACTUALY moisturizing... not moisturizing enough w tret, stingy
