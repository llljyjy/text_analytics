This is not really like a cleansing oil. It is a gel texture that removed tinted moisturizer and my other light makeup easily, however it was having trouble with my (non waterproof) mascara.

I can’t imagine picking this over a cleansing balm.For my fellow sensitive skin people, I would highly recommend Clinique’s fragrance free cleansing balm. burned my eyes, kind of drying
