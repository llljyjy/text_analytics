Picked this up because I like the First Aid line and it had “firming” in the name :) I use this on my neck and chest and it improves the look of my skin. I’m not sure that it’s helped correct anything but my sun damaged neck and chest looks firmer and healthier when I use it. There have been days I skipped this step and I always regret it. nan
