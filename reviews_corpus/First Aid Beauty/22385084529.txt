I picked this cleanser up during a sale a couple of weeks ago and I can already see that it’s helping with my skin, particularly in the chin area. It’s really smooth and I just add a little water to helpnit spread a little better.spbetter. I have also left it for a few minutes like a quick mask and that has been refreshing as well￼ Good gentle alternative to treat problem skin.
