I have used this product off and on for the last year and I can say Iâ€™ve noticed a difference. When not using my smile lines and under eye bags became more noticeable, however after consistently using the product my lines have gone away and I have very bright under eyes. As far as the separation of the product, this will happen sometimes when I am traveling and there are temperature changes. If you shake the container or set it up right it will eventually go back to the normal consistency. nan
