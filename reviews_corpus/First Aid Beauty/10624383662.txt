I love this eye cream! I have heard you don’t necessarily need an eye cream but I have found as I’ve gotten older I definitely need one added to my regime! I love first aid beauty products in general and this didn’t disappoint. It feels so hydrating, is easy to apply, and dries nicely without balling up. I use this under my concealer and it blends seamlessly. There is a faint scent but you can’t detect it when the product has been applied to under the eye. First aid beauty does it again!
