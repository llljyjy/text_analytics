I received this 10% Vitamin C Serum from @firstaidbeauty recently & wanted to review it. It’s a watery-type consistency serum that I use as my first step in the morning & at night. It has a very dewy effect, but isn’t sticky. I’ve seen a bit of a difference, mostly with brightening, but it will probably take a good month or so to see any results with hyperpigmentation. The bottle is genius! There is no cap. You just twist it to open it, then twist again to close it. It has a pump that comes up so you can pump the serum in your hands. Definitely use an SPF, especially after using Vitamin C serums. This serum isn’t sticky, it’s lightweight, absorbs very quickly & doesn’t pill at all. I will definitely update the more I use this serum if I see any further results. Thank you so much @firstaidbeauty for this chance to try this great serum! nan
