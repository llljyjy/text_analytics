I love these so much! There is no harsh smell, no burning, and it does not dry out my skin (compared to the kind of pads I had been buying from regular stores). These are gentle enough that I began buying them for my son who is starting to get blackheads and pimples. They are expensive (for me) but I continue to purchase them because they really are worth it. Worth the money!
