I’ve been a fan of First Aid Beauty for a while and just started using their Vitamin C Brightening Serum. So far I’m impressed! It’s a very lightweight serum, that goes on super smooth, and a little goes a long way. It is a little bit sticky, but nothing too noticeable. I’m looking forward to seeing the results after a couple weeks of consistent use! nan
