I really enjoy first aid beauty and use a lot of their products so I was excited to try the sunscreen. I was a little disappointed because it did leave a white cast in my skin. I am medium to dark skin tone so it might work for someone who is lighter. It made me look pale and left a film on my face like it didnâ€™t absorb well in my skin kinda just sat on my skin.
