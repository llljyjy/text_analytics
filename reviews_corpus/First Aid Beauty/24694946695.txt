When I used the product for many months, I didn’t have any issues and it did moisturize well. I even used it on my baby’s skin and it helped. However, after a few months, it felt like I got sensitive to one of the ingredients (probably the eucalyptus) and got pimples on and off when using the product. Also, after a point I felt like it didn’t leave me moisturized for a few hours later, just right after. I think it might be a hit or miss. A must have for sensitive skin, till you react!
