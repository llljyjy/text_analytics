I’ve been using this sunscreen for about a week everyday and I love it. It is very easy to blend. There is no white cast which is great—many other mineral SPFs are chalky and leave a strong white cast. This one is undetectable. It is not too glowy or overly matte. I recommend applying it with a moisturizer if you have dry skin. I usually apply after moisturizer or mix it in with it. The packaging is a pump which is nice. Mine did tend to take more effort to pump out than I would’ve liked, but it does ensure that you don’t overuse or waste product. Highly recommend and would purchase again! Excellent SPF!
