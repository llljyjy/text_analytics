This is the best vitamin c serum I have tried! I have sensitive/ acne prone skin that doesn’t like when I change up my skin care routine. My skin didn’t break out or have any bad reaction to this product what so ever. It is super hydrating and leave my skin bright and glowing. I also really like the packaging the pump is easy to use and doesn’t leave a mess. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good vitamin c serum. Best Vitamin C serum
