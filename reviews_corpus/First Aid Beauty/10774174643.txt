I’m giving this five stars. Great product. Very moisturizing but not greasy. Fully absorbs into the skin. Clean and light smelling. Feels cooling when applied. I’m an Esthetician and have tried so many different eye creams. This is one of my, if not my number one favorite. Can’t beat the price either! Great eye cream! 5 Stars!
