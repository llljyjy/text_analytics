I was super excited when I saw that First Aid Beauty had released a mineral sunscreen again. I say again because I was a complete fan of their discontinued mineral sunscreen that was pretty similar to this product and I was disappointed when I no longer saw it anywhere back in 2019 or early 2020. It’s now in a pump whereas the previous version was in a squeezy tube and was hard to get all the product out. The price is lower compared to others, fragrance free, and doesn’t cause my sensitive skin to breakout! I’ll be buying another soon! Highly recommend! It's back!
