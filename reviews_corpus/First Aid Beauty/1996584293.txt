I’m really happy with this sunscreen. I wear sunscreen everyday and I’ve been loving First Aid Beauty’s Mineral Sunscreen in my skincare routine. The packaging is nice and I love the dispenser. The formula doesn’t irritate my skin and is easy to blend. I’m olive skin tone and this sunscreen blends easily. It looks nice underneath my makeup and feels lightweight. This sunscreen doesn’t have a scent. I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a new sunscreen for your everyday skin care routine. Sunscreen is a must!
