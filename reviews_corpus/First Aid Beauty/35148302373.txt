I love, LOVE this moisturizer. I have spent years trying to find a facial moisturizer that supported my moisture barrier but didnâ€™t cause my skin to get extremely oily and break out. This one IS IT. Besides the steep price, I love this product. I continue to purchase it for myself since it works wonders for me as a daily moisturizer Oily AF but need a supported moisture barrier??
