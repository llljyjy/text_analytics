I loooove this cleanser for a lot of reasons. I have recently been on a hunt to find the best facewash, trying as many brands as I can and trying to find the right texture - regular cleansers, balms, foams, gel, clay, etc. This one is unlike anything Iâ€™ve ever used. It gets EVERYTHING off in one use. Instead of 1-2 cleansers, make up remover AND toner, I can just use this. I was blown away that after using, there was no residual make up or anything that came up on my cotton pad/toner. I use a very thick foundation, powder and eye make up too... so that has never happened to me before. I also noticed that the next morning, my skin looks clean and no pores.Love this product and will definitely re-buy, and likely gift. My New GO TO Cleanser
