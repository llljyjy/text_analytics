So bummed that I didnâ€™t like this moisturizer because the tub is huge and it seems like a good value. But unfortunately there is an ingredient in this product that my face HATES. After about a week of using, I broke out badly which is very unlike my skin. I have clear skin 95% of the time, only get an occasional spot here and there. I have quite dry skin and not sensitive to products typically. I do like the formula and how it absorbs into the skin quickly. But I will be going back to my Clinique moisturizer. Major breakouts
