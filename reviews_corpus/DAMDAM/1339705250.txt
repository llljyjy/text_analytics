Iâ€™ve never tried rice bran oil so I was very excited to try this oil serum. The texutre is lightweight oil and few drops are enough to cover my entire face. There is a natural botanical scent which I found very pleasant. The oil absorbs well and is moisturizing without being greasy or clogging.  I applied few drops of this oil after cleansing and toning my skin. The oil feels soothing on my skin and love how it gives me a natural glow. My skin feels soft and smooth after each application. I also enjoyed using this oil with my gua sha. I honestly felt I do not need additional moisturizer after this. Hydrating and soothing
