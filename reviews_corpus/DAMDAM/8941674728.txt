I love cleansing oils and this one is a really good one. I use this on my night skincare routine as the first cleanser of my double cleanse. This instantly melts and removes makeup, sunscreen and impurities and leaves my skin very hydrated and soft at the same time. This leaves my skin clean and glowy without feeling greasy.I love that it uses rice brain oil as it is an ingredient that feels very nourishing on my dry skin.This is a staple in my night time routine now. Great for dry skin
