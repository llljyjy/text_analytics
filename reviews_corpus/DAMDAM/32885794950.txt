I’ve recently visited family for summer in Arizona & my skin usually struggles with the weather here & becomes dry, this cream has actually changed the game for me. It’s perfectly hydrating but not in a sticky way, I like the matte finish which is great for these hot summer months. It’s left my skin feeling and looking more soft, hydrated and plump. I’m also prone to sensitive skin so i love the fragrance free, very light natural ingredient derived scent that it has, not overpowering at all. I’d definitely recommend you try it because you’ll love it. Definitely Recommend
