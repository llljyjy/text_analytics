A new must have! Light enough to em wear under makeup during the day but nourishing enough to restore my skin overnight. My skin is combination but it tends to get dehydrated easily and this is a great remedy. I noticed my regular dry spots felt really hydrated during the day. This also worked really well with the other products in my routine and caused no pilling. It gives a soft glowy finish and isn’t too far on the dewy side if that’s not your thing. nan
