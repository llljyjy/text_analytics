This is my very first product from dam dam. This Cleanser has a oily cream consistency. it initially does remove makeup and dirt but itâ€™s hard to wash it away so you have to follow it up with a good old foam cleanser to get to greasiness off. Its just u cannot use this product alone as a cleanser. But its an excellent balm cleanser, leaves your skin soft and glowy. First Cleanse
