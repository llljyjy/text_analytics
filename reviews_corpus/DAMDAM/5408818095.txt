I absolutely love this oil. I’ve used it both at night before bed, and under makeup. I have combination skin so I need a lot of moisture to keep those annoying dry patches at bay, oils are really great for this and it’s nice to have one in my arsenal that makes my skin look beautiful and feel lovely. Definitely recommend! Wonderful
