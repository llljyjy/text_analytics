I have very dry skin and live in the desert, so I had high hopes based on the reviews. It just fell flat for me. It’s too heavy to wear during the day, but the moisturizer is on the thinner side (almost like a gel moisturizer).  It leaves a tacky/filmy feel rather than leaving my skin feeling hydrated. After a couple months of using it, I’m not impressed. Won’t buy again. nan
