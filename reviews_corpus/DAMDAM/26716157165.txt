What a fun thing to add to my routine! I love face oils but dread those that cause acne. I’ve had terrible experience with some face oils because even the light weight once’s cause acne. My search for good dewy skin makeup look has been a struggle because I can’t find the perfect oil. This has been an amazing add so far. No breakout and very hydrating too! Makeup goes well too  and doesn’t make the foundation residue show separately. Lightweight! No breakout!
