I received this product for free from DAMDAM in exchange for my honest review.I can’t imagine my face routine without it ever since my first use! I have combination skin where I have some dry spots and a very oily t-zone. Since using this product, I noticed that my face has a healthy glow! It dries matte, yet has a radiance to it so your skin doesn’t look flat. I love that it makes my skin super soft and smooth like a luxurious velvet texture. I have to admit that I can’t stop touching my face because I don’t have any bumps anymore or dry spots and it feels amazing. I have been using this oil before putting on my cream moisturizer and it has been so good to me. A must have for your skincare routine!!
