When it said that this moisturizer was a mochi moisturizer, I was excited to try the texture. So the texture is more of a thick cream. I think this moisturizer is suitable for everyone. Dry skin people would love it and oily skin would appreciate it as their night cream. Even though it’s thick, it’s lightweight and absorbs fast. nan
