Exfoliation is an essential part of my skincare routine, so I loved that this cleanser doubled as an exfoliator. The cream texture is great, and the formula itself is gentle. I started incorporating this into my morning routine and I love how it worked with my toner, serums, and sunscreen. My skin always feels clean and smooth, and never tight, stripped, or dry.
