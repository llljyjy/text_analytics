I like it! I have pretty sensitive skin so I wasn’t sure about rice water, especially because I’ve read mixed reviews on using rice water in your hair. But this didn’t irritate my face and moisturized really well. It’s great over a lotion moisturizer to really seal everything in. Perfect for winter Moisturizing!
