Itâ€™s my first time trying something from this brand. This cleanser is super gentle, it has a balmy and creamy like texture and leaves the skin feeling smooth, definitely non drying.  The tiny beads are invisible but give a mild exfoliation. When wearing make up, you will need to combine it with another cleanser. Non drying
