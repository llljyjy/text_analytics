I was so excited to try this face oil and it didn’t disappoint, after pregnancy and breastfeeding my skin became soo dry and dull, while it has a very distinct smell i personally don’t mind at all, it feels very lightweight and very nourishing. My skin definitely looks more radiant and soft after each use, love it !!! Love it
