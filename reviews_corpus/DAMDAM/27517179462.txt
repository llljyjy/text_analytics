My dry skin really loved this! It’s not too heavy or thick for me, just provides enough hydration for my skin. I could wear it also in the nighttime too since it provides me with a good amount of moisture. I overall feel my skin is softer and even a bit bouncier with this! Not sure if it does anything for brightening either but I’ve seen that as an effect too. Loved it and could see myself getting more of it, or anything else from this line! Plumping and great for dry skin!
