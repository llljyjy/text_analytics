This oil smells amazing and goes on smoothly. It’s very lightweight, so that’s good if that’s what you’re looking for. Personally, I wanted something to do face massages with so it wasn’t the best fit, but still a good product. The oil also comes out of the dropper without pressing, so make sure to move fast! Great oil, but not out of this world for the price
