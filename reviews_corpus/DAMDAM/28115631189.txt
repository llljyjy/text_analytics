I really love how this Mochi Mochi Luminous Cream absorbs into my skin, it is super hydrating and nourishing. My skin looks and feels amazingly smooth and soft but not sticky or tacky. The Shea butter is a wonderful addition in this luminous cream, my skin drinks this up immediately and has a soft beautiful glow and as an added bonus this luxurious cream feels incredible on my hands and has helped revive them, they have been super dry from this intense heat we are experiencing. Overall I am very happy with this Mochi Mochi Luminous Cream, my skin needed this intense hydration. I appreciate that this is not scented but has a clean fresh smell to it. Extremely Hydrating!!
