I was gifted these Damdam rice drops and I gotta say Iâ€™m obsessed! I love the large applicator and the dropper to be able to get exactly the amount I want. This is an oil base so it is great for nighttime to moisturize and clear my skin. I wake up with my skin feeling hydrated and glowy and I love these drops! So good!
