Wonderful!  So softening, gentle and effective.  I wear moderate makeup; this removes it all.  It doesn’t sting eyes at all.  Best yet, it’s fragrance-free (which is hard to find among cleansing oils.)I’ve used countless cleansing oils over the years and was on a search for a new holy grail after MAC’s Cleanse Off was out-of-stock for months.  This is it! Best cleansing oil on the market
