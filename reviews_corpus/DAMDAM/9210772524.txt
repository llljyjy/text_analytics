I was excited to try DamDam’s vegan rice drops oil serum, but I have mixed feelings. My first impression is that the serum is too liquidy for the bottle dropper. When you left the bottle lid and dropper, lots of serums continues to drip off, so be careful when you use it so you don’t spill. Once on my face, the serum was a very liquidy oil texture. It made my dry skin feel smooth, but I was very surprised by the strong odor. The serum smells extremely herbal, even a bit smoky. I personally find the smell quite off putting, and I wish there wasn’t as strong of a smell. My skin definitely feels smooth and fresh after using, and afterwards I put on my moisturizer like normal. I would give a higher rating if it wasn’t for the scent. Good oil serum minus the scent
