A great gentle face wash. Has small micro exfoliant beads that help to get the dirt and grease off your face but do not compromise the integrity of your skin, will not upset any sensitivity. Leaves you feeling fresh, clean and soft without tightness. Didn’t notice any real scent. Doesn’t suds but still works great for combination skin. Overall I enjoy and recommend! Fantastic Face Wash
