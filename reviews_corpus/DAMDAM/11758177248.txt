I really like it. It removes makeup so easily and surprisingly it doesn’t leave the skin feeling greasy. It doesn’t contain fragrance and it is very gentle but effective at the same time, so it is great with sensitive skins. I do double cleansing so this is great for my skincare routine. I just wish that I was a little more affordable but I don’t think that if you make the investment you would regret it. best makeup remover!
