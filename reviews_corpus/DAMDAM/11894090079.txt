While I do enjoy a good cleansing balm, cleansing oils are sooo much easier to use! This one is super silky and does a decent job removing my waterproof mascara. It emulsifies nicely without leaving any residue. The only qualm I have is that I expected the packaging to be more luxe (ie glass packaging) for this price point. nan
