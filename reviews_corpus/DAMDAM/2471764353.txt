Yessss, this oil does exactly what it says! It’s hard to think of putting oil on your face that doesn’t clog it but this stuff is magic! I put a few drops on right after cleansing every night and sometimes in the morning. Even after day one I could see that my skin had a natural glow and was super smooth. Pores, who? My skin was looking SO GOOD. I think you will have to get used to the “oil“ texture but it’s super thin and I find that it does absorb after awhile. It definitely leaves my face hydrated and is great to combine with makeup too! So good!
