I have super acne-prone skin and was hopeful that this would work for me given it’s scent-free and has great reviews. After a couple weeks of use it gave me the worst breakouts I’ve had in awhile along my jawline. Would recommend patch-testing if you have hormonal breakouts.It definitely works though, dissolves makeup pretty well and is gentle on the eyes! Be careful if you have hormonal acne!
