I recently incorporated this product into my skincare routine and quickly realized that it is the perfect oil cleanser to do my gua sha routine! I would recommend this product to people with dry skin rather than oily because it is a great way to cleanse your skin without the ripping effect that other gel/water based cleansers have!Check out my ig @anapaularvbz to see how I introduce it in my skincare routine! Perfect for Gua Sha!
