Nomad’s Purifying  Cleanser has become my favorite cleanser bc it’s a cruelty free exfoliant that gently removes dead skin without stripping my skin of moisture. I love how it has unclogged my pores which helps minimize breakouts and bc the natural ingredients are packed with antioxidants, I’ve noticed my redness on cheeks have gone down considerably as well! Perfect for daily exfoliation
