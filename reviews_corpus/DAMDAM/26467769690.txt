My esthetician recommenced trying a new cleanser to help with build up on my nose and chin so I added this into my daily routine! I use a dime-sized amount each night to wash my face and have noticed a huge difference after just 1 week of daily use! My skin looks and feels way cleaner and my pores look smaller too! My skin looks and feels way cleaner now!
