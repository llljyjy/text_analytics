This was my first time double cleansing and so far so good! I use this at night followed by my regular cleanser. I don’t use it in the morning because I don’t really have a lot of product on at night, so I don’t think it’s necessary. This product is super gentle and makes my skin feel very soft. I don’t really use makeup but it takes off my tinted sunscreen really well and leaves no product on my face. Overall, I would definitely recommend! nan
