This is an extremely lightweight, silky moisturizer. The color of the formula is milky white, and it does not have any fragrances added. The smell reminds me of fresh playdoh or flour dough. The packaging is nice: comes in a plastic container - but the best part is that there is a small spoon within the lid you can use to scoop out the product! Amazing, and you don’t have to use your fingers and contaminate the product. I’ve use this is the mornings for my skincare routine, since it is lightweight. It makes my skin so soft, smooth, and silky. It also doesn’t pill up with my other products and is a great base for my makeup. Nice lightweight moisturizer for every day use
