I love trying out new moisturizer and this moisturizer was surprisingly so nice on the skin. Asian skin care just does it right every time this sits well on the skin doesn’t fully absorb and leaves me feeling really really moisturized but also leave enough to be used as a primer under make up - or make my skin very “glass” like as it sits on top. HIGHLYRECOMMEND Great
