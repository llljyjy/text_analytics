This moisturizer is AMAZING!! It leaves my skin sooo soft, supple and best of all plumped up.  It really does help plump up the skin!  It does have a slightly sticky finish to it, but I use this in the evening so it doesnâ€™t bother me. It might be too heavy for daytime use.  I have some slight fine lines on my forehead and under my eyes and they are less noticeable since using this. Literally overnight my skin looks plumper. Plumper skin
