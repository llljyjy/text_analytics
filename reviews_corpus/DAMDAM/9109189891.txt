Absolutely LOVE it! One of the reasons I love this cleansing oil is that I no longer need any eye make up remover. I use 1 pump of this oil and spread it all over my face to include across my eye lids and lashes. Then I rinse with warm water and towel dry. It removes every bit of make up without exception. Also my skin feels so soft after washing with this. Great oil cleanser
