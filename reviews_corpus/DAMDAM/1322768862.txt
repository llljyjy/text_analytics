It completely removes the makeup. It also leaves the skin feeling really soft and even brighter. I really enjoy using it. The only thing is that it can sting the eyes just a little bit if you get it inside the eyes. So when taking off mascare make sure to keep your eyes closed till it’s fully removed so it doesn’t get inside the eyes. It doesn’t irritate my eyes but it can sting a little if gets inside the eyes. Fully removes all makeup and skin feels great!
