I live in California so you already know I have SUPER dry skin. This rice drop balancing oil serum is such a great addition to my morning skincare routine. It hydrates my skin so we’ll. I’ve been using this for a week and seen a great difference in my skin. Less lines and smoother. The most important thing is that this product uses clean ingredients. So hydrating!!! I love this product!
