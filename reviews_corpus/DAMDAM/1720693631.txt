What a lovely oil! A little goes a long way with this Balancing Oil Serum. It softens and helps lock in hydration. I love how this feels on my skin and my face looks so hydrated and fresh since I’ve been using this serum. I was hesitant about putting an oil on my face, but this hasn’t caused any breakouts or issues and my skin seems really to respond well to it. nan
