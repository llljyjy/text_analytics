I liked this moisturizer but I would probably only buy it during the winter. I have combination skin so I prefer a lighter moisturizer, however this one was an odd combination of light and heavier. I think it still worked well on my skin I just prefer something a little thinner. I will say that my skin still felt hydrated and happy after using it though. nan
