Silk Rice Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil from Dam Dam came in a sleek bottle. Just a simple pump. My skin is very sensitive and it gets irritated after makeup. I used this cleansing oil and my makeup melted beautifully without making my skin feel dry or irritated. My skin felt smooth and soft. Lovely product, clean beauty. Itâ€™s now become a part of my skincare routine. Clean skin, soft skin
