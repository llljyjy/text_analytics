Super excited to try this and love that the ingredients are pretty clean. It took all my make up off. It lathers into a nice foam creamy cleanser which was easy to apply. I will note it feels as if there is a film on your face when rinsing off that I do not enjoy, but drying my face with a towel seemed it went away. nan
