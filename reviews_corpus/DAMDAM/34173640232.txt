I was gifted this cleanser from Nomad for my honest review. The product comes in a good sized tube and is a thick paste. There’s minor exfoliation but nothing heavy and uncomfortable. It’s fragranced which I don’t love, but it’s not so terribly strong that I can’t tolerate it. After using the cleanser my face feels clean and not overly stripped. My skin tone also looked more even right after using it which is rather magical for a cleanser. Immediately added it to my routine for day and night. I tend to break out from coconut derived ingredients so we’ll have to see whether I can avoid it happening if it’s just in a cleanser. Overall I like it a lot and can recommend! If only the fragrance was lighter then this would’ve been perfect. Gentle and effective
