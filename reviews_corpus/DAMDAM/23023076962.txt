I use this oil as a first step of my PM routine prior to second cleanse and it works amazingly well! It feels very gentle to the skin yet effectively removes build up and makeup not bothering my sensitive eyes. I love that this formula is fragrance free and has perfectly short and simple ingredient list. Iâ€™m also glad it comes in a bottle with dispenser, which is very handy. My new fave for double cleansing
