This moisturizer is very milky and very light on the skin! I wanted to love it, but it didn’t fully absorb into my skin once I applied it. The first time I used it I definitely used too much so I assumed that was why it didn’t absorb. But I’ve used it more often and even using a small amount it takes a lot of time to absorb. It does moisturize, but nothing too special to keep in my routine consistently. It’s a decent product! Decent but doesn't stick out to me
