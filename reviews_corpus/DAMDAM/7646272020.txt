It’s fragrance free!! And it moisturizes!! This is the ONLY moisturizer that has cured dryness and doesn’t have all these actives and unnecessary ingredients. There’s a place in the market for a moisturizer like this cause so many have all these actives and ingredients that not everyone wants OR wants daily on their face. This is more of a night moisturizer as it may be too heavy in the daytime unless the air is extremely dry and/or it’s winter. Absolutely love this product. I have sensitive, highly reactive acne prone combo skin by the way. Definite staple in my face care
