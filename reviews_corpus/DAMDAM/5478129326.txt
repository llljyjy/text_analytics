This cleanser deserves all of the praise it gets and more. It is a soft cream cleanser with a mild amount of grit, when you emulsify it with a touch of warm water it glides over the skin and has a perfect texture to do a face massage with. The scent is heavenly, like a gorgeous spa. I am allergic to pretty much any scent in my skincare, but my skin actually loves this product even with the natural scent/oils that are in it. My partner started using it and his skin has been more balanced and soft than in years, heâ€™s hooked on it too. Buy this if you have delicate, sensitive skin in need of balance. Perfect soft cleanser
