I did not like the texture  in the beginning because it feels really  sticky on  your skin. It doesn’t absorb and leaves a white film if you don’t rub it in enough. I do feel my skin is much plumper and softer after. I started using a little less than my normal amount and started to appreciate taking the extra time  to rub in the cream. Once you get use to the texture and  spending a little extra time rubbing the cream in, it’s an amazing cream! I would not use this for the summer but definitely a winter staple. Rub, rub, rubbing it in is the magic
