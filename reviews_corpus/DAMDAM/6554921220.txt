I’ve been a big fan of Asian skincare lately. That’s probably because they seem way ahead of the United States when dealing with what goes on our faces. This Damdam mochi moisturizer goes on nice and smooth and makes my face feel nice and plump. I don’t smell any fragrance which is also a plus. I’ve only been using this for a week now, but I love it already. I love it already
