I really am enjoying this product, I wash, tone, apply eye cream and then just apply the face oil as serum and moisturizer amd it works great. Applying it feels like Iâ€™m also giving my face a massage and my skin loves it.  Since using it my skin looks healthier and more radiant overall, and it feels so soft. I love that you can use as a serum, add a couple drops to a cream or as a night treatment. I have tried all three methods and they all work well. Wonderful, versatile product! Versatile with results!
