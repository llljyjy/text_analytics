I like the packaging of this product because of the pump. I also really like the consistency… it’s very thin but not too oily and felt really good on my skin. The cleanser worked decent at getting off my makeup… not the best I’ve tried. It also irritate my eye and I woke up in the morning with it still feeling sensitive and watery. Maybe my fault for using it to get off eye makeup! Overall, I’ll definitely finish it but wouldn’t repurchase. It’s okay
