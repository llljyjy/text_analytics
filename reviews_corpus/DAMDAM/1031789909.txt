This vegan rice oil is amazing for hydration. I was curious to try it since I have dry, dehydrated skin. It glides on so easily and feels great on my skin. Itâ€™s a serum oil hybrid and packed with healthy ingredients like Rice Bran Oil, Avocado Oil, and the Jojoba Oil. I use it during the night and day. It can also be used as a primer. Awesome vegan face oil
