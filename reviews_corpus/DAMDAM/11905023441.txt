DAMDAM Tokyo gifted me their Mochi Mochi Luminous Cream. I apply this cream at the end of my PM routine. It is thick and seems to take a moment to absorb. My skin unfortunately did not improve, as I think this the product was too thick for me. I didnâ€™t like how oily my face felt by morning. I started with only a patch test first. I decided to use all over the face before giving a full review. Which caused cystic acne. I have not dealt with cystic spots in months. So while this cream was not a good fit for me, I still recommend it to others. I would just add for those with oily skin to patch test first. A Good Night Cream
