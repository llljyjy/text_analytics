What a nice product! This is my first time trying this product and this brand. It feels very light on my skin. I applied it on my forehead, cheeks, and chin. It blended into my skin very easily and my skin felt moisturized.  I used it on clean skin and before I applied makeup. My makeup did apply smoothly as well after I applied this serum. Loving this Vegan Face Oil!
