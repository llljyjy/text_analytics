I have never heard of this brand before so when I was asked to get this I was super excited! The texture was not what I was expecting but it felt nice. I donâ€™t know why but I was thinking it was going to be mochi like, like the OTZI clay mask or something. The smell was nice and it was extremely hydrating. I used it at night for a week and o really like how my skin feels Nice
