I got this Rice Drops Vegan Face Oil  as a gift from DAMDAM! I started using it for my after washing my face, put some drops on my face and give a little massage with, after that I use my moisturizer and that’s it! Since I got it, I’ve notice that my skin has a natural glow and looks smooth. The oil has a very satisfying effect, incorporating it to my routine also helped to get relaxed and enjoy that moment of my day! Loving it and definitely highly recommended, now is part of my top on skincare products! New favorite one!!!
