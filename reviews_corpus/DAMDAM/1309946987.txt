This is my first time trying DAMDAM as a brand. Tbh I don’t know much about it but appreciate I had the chance to try this cleanser. I like that it is a chemical exfoliant (beads and scrubs are archaic and too abrasive). It doesn’t foam much which can be a plus or minus for whoever is using it based on their preferences. Also, it is extremely gentle. This is a pro for someone with extremely sensitive skin and who doesn’t wear much product on their face. This would be a con for people who want a cleaner feeling or wear makeup and SPF. (Too) Gentle
