I love this oil!!! I went skiing recently and my face was insanely chapped and dry, I put this on and everything felt so moisturized and rejuvenated!! It goes on super smoothly, has a super nice and light scent, and didnâ€™t break me out (and I have sensitive skin)! Big fan and definitely will keep using!! LOVE IT
