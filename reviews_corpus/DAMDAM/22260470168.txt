I have sensitive, dry skin and have been looking for an oil cleanser to remove makeup, impurities, dirt, etc. I’ve been double cleansing with this for about a week and a half now, so far my skin feels great but I am purging a little bit (white heads in random spots and more black heads around my nose) I think double cleansing is too much for my dry skin, but this product is wonderful! It’s not drying, removed makeup easily and is fragrance free!! Great product- maybe not double cleanser though
