Game changer for dry and sensitive skin! Iâ€™ve never tried an oil based cleanser before, I was shocked by the results. Within a week my skin became softer and my dry winter spots cleared up. I highly recommend this cleanser for anyone with dry or sensitive skin. Even after several uses, I never experienced any irritation. With any new products I typical experience a degree of redness, but this cleanser was gentle enough to prevent irritation! Great for dry & sensitive skin!
