I received the Mochi Mochi Luminous Plumping Moisturizer from Dam Dam complimentary for my review. My skin goes through periods of time where it’s super dry, so I’m glad that I was able to try out this moisturizer because it worked extremely well with my skin. I love that it felt hydrating but wasn’t too heavy at the same time. I definitely see myself using this moisturizer in the mornings and at night! love this moisturizer!
