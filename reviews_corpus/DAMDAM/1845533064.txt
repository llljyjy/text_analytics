I always use a cleansing oil or balm and this cleansing oil has been incredible on my skin. I’m allergic to many scents and ingredients and so glad this has 0 scent! It’s gentle but effective even getting my waterproof makeup off. It breaks down the makeup I use and isn’t drying to my skin like other cleaning oils I’ve tried in the past. Doesn’t strip the skin and is a great one to use for daily use even for just skincare cleansing routines! Definitely recommend. nan
