This face oil had a lightweight texture that glides on the skin easily. You don’t need more than a few drops to cover your face and neck. I like using this oil in the evenings as my last skincare step. It feels incredibly nourishing and hydrating without feeling heavy or greasy. It absorbs well into the skin but still leaves the skin with a light veil of oil that hydrates the skin overnight. I always awaken with renewed, refreshed, and hydrated skin! This oil helps plump out my lines and smooths out the texture of my skin. My skin feels really soft and supple when I use this oil! I’m a big fan of this formula for my dry and sensitive skin! I can’t recommend it enough! Hydrating and Softening
