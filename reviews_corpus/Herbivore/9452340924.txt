The Herbivore Nova 15% Vitamin C + Turmeric Brightening Serum is the newest addition to my skin care routine. I love the glass bottle with the fun yellow colored product. The winter time has left my skin feeling and looking dull and lacking radiance so this was a good product to help combat that. The texture is not too thin and it smooths over the skin evenly. It eventually absorbs fully into the skin and does not leave behind any residue. It has a strong herbal scent which I don’t personally like but that won’t prevent me from using the product. It does dissipate after some time so it’s not a big deal. I like that it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and healthy looking. My skin texture has improved and it doesn’t look as lack luster as before. Definitely a great addition to my morning routine. nan
