I have dry/combo sensitive skin and usually use FAB products. I bought this because it was recommended to me in store and I wanted to try the Blue Tansy mask. This is a great set to try, and I brought it with me abroad for 3 months. 1 month later, I still have plenty of the cleanser and mask left over. I LOVE the Aquarius moisturizer, I think it’s actually better for dry skin than for oily skin. I went and bought it in full size. The mask is very good, but I don’t use it as often due to my sensitive skin/busy schedule. The cleanser is also great, non-irritating and non-drying. After 4 months’ use, my skin looks clearer and more moisturized. Compared to my usual FAB products, I like the cleanser as much as FAB’s pure skin cleanser and the moisturizer more than FAB’s ultra repair cleanser. I have tried many brands said to be safe for sensitive skin, but developed reactions to all but FAB and now Herbivore. I’m glad to have another option in skincare. Definitely worth a try!
