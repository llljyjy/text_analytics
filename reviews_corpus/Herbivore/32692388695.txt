Herbivore Nova 15% Vitamin C + Turmeric Brightening Serum is a creamy brightening serum that absorbs quickly and does not pill. It has a ginger turmeric smell that fades quickly. I love the minimalistic packaging. I am loving the glow this gives me. Moreover it is Vegan and clean. I love this product but its costs $64. Really excited to see what long term results I get from this brightening serum. Kindly gifted by Herbivore. Wonderful Serum
