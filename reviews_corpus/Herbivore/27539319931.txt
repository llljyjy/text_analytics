I’ve been wanting to find a great nighttime moisturizer for my dry skin in a dry winter. This unfortunately wasn’t it. Initially it seemed fine on its own. It sunk into my skin quickly (though my skin tends up drink up skincare like a sponge). On its own, not enough hydration or moisture for me, but I could always add serums. The main problem was when I layered it with the Herbivore plumping cloud jelly serum. It started pulling!!! Even though they’re both same line, same brand! I was really surprised. Plus the rose scent isn’t my favourite. Unfortunately not for me. Glad I tried the tester size before committing to a full size! Pilled with the Cloud Jelly serum!
