This set comes with 3 different products, and I like all of them! The pink jelly cleanser is actually a makeup remover. Wasn’t what I originally thought, but I liked it still. The other masks are nice too. Be careful with Blue Tansy, it has an extremely strong smell. It’s not a bad smell, just strange because of the natural ingredients. It’s great for oily skin. My face was so soft the next day. 100% recommend. Awesome Set
