I have oily/dehydrated skin and I thought this would be the move. However, this has to be one of the worst creams I’ve ever tried. It absorbs (mostly), which is decent. But about an hour of so later, my face is an oil spill. One of two things is happening: 1. It is way too thick and comedogenic or 2. It is criminally under-moisturizing. The cream is THICK. It’s like applying Jello honestly. Based on the ingredient list, you would think this would be well balanced. But for me, it’s not. Something in here is too thick (thus cannot be absorbed/used) or not enough (does not help dehydration and thus my face makes more oil). Considering the reviews on their own website average 3 stars, I’d skip this for sure. Also smells horrible, but I’ve never been a fan of rose water. Rose water does nothing on its own and is mostly a filler ingredient (unless it’s rose oil). Considering it’s in the first 5, this to me is a cheap influencer brand. Too thick and not hydrating enough
