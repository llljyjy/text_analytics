I’ve received this product as a small sample. I didn’t pay attention to the smell but this product is difficult for my skin to absorb. Like it leaves white residue on my skin and it does not absorb immediately. It feels soft. It reminds me of putting soap on my skin. I certainly will not be purchasing this product. Maybe my skin type does not agree with this formula. Not for me
