This product is honestly one of the most noticeably effective products I’ve used. Right after using my skin feels softer, and the next day it’s smoother and more evened out. The smell isn’t bad, may take some getting used to but I’ve grown to like it. I usually get a few pimples each day but the mask has made it less frequent, and it helps reduce red marks left over from previous blemishes. Overall I would really recommend it. Really good for acne
