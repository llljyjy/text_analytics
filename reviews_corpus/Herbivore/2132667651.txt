My skin feels great the next day after using this but it left my skin red everywhere I had applied. Redness cleared up by next day as I used this at night. I did 10m for first use (did not patch test which was silly on my behalf) so if you have sensitive skin listen to the recommendation of 5m application. Scent didnâ€™t bother me actually, just smells more natural. nan
