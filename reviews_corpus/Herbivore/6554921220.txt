I love how this Herbivore moon dew eye cream has a retinol alternative in it with the ingredient bakuchiol. My eyes can sometimes be sensitive to retinol so I love that I can use this cream without any problems. I also appreciate that this jar of eye cream came completely full of product, when I know some brands have their jars only half full. I love the way this cream makes my eye area feel and Iâ€™ve already recommended it to a bunch of friends. Amazing retinol alternative
