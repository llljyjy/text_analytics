The texture is so smooth and creamy. Feels lush and nourishing when applied. I didn’t find it to be heavy or greasy on my dry skin. Absorbs quickly and completely. Leaves my eye area feeling hydrated and looking bright. I didn’t experience any redness or irritation. A little goes a long way so this small size should last a while. Just adore the texture!
