I’ve tried quite a few vitamin C serums and this is one of my new favorites! It has a really nice creamy texture that applies smoothly and absorbs really well into my skin. It doesn’t leave any tacky or sticky feeling that I’ve experienced in the past with serums. My skin looks really bright and glowing! Excited to keep using this. Amazing vitamin C serum!
