On my second container already, this is absolutely a holy grail moisturizer for my combo and extremely reactive skin. It has a very natural almost herbal scent but itâ€™s very subtle and dissipates complete once absorbed. It has an almost jelly like texture but goes on very smoothly, leaves my skin looking plump and radiant all day. Ultimate holy grail moisturizer!! nan
