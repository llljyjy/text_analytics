I recently came back to this after having used it a couple years back. This is incredible! First off I love the smell and it exudes a lovely vibe. I use it in addition to my naturopathica moisturizer as the last step, I have dry skin so I use both. I struggle with hormonal acne and uneven skin tone. This has completely aided in balancing the moisture levels in my skin (I actually have very dry skin) without making it too oily. It does not break me out at all, if anything I have found it helps in soothing breakouts. The biggest positive I would say is its effect on my skin tone, I have seen a drastic difference in my usual redness since using this. I also think it is helping to fade old acne marks. Incredible
