no. u can find way better, i recommend maeloves vitamin c for cheaper and it’s better imo, i don’t like the smell and i do not recommend putting this on before makeup. it totally peeled off my foundation and concealer when i put it on like 15 minutes after applying  it, it’s not good and i’m glad i didn’t buy the full size. if ur looking for a good vitamin c it’s not this. nope
