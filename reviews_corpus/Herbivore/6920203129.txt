I was a little skeptical, since vitamin c in serums are unstable and are supposed to be in dark bottles - not clear. I am so glad I made the jump. it has been only a week of using this serum during the AM routine and the small sun spot I had developed on my nose has practically disappeared! It was an absolute trip when I noticed because I never had anything work so quickly before. My skin also feels firmer and the wrinkle on my forehead has almost disappeared too and my laugh lines are a little less pronounced (I’m almost thirty in two months). I 100% recommend this serum. People complaining about the smell and rating this so low because of it is a stretch. I can smell it just when I apply it but it goes away almost instantly as it absorbs so fast and also, it’s turmeric so of course it’s gonna smell a bit bitter. For me, the benefits and effects absolutely outweigh the smell “issue“. Just make sure you always wear 50 spf sunscreen and reapply every two hours and wear sun hats :) my number one face serum
