I received this product complimentary from Herbivore to try. It’s labeled a serum but has more of a lightweight lotion feel to it. This was nice cause vitamin C serums can sometimes be really sticky feeling (looking at you Summer Fridays). The serum absorbed nicely and worked well with my other products. It has 15% THD vitamin C which is the most  stable formulation, which could explain the clear bottle but I’m a little concerned about formulation breakdown. The addition of arbutin, turmeric and kadaku plum for brightening and skin tone is nice and helps distinguish it from other vitamin C serums. It does have a slight scent but fades quickly and I don’t mind smells if it gives results. Most likely won’t replace my holy grail C-Firma, but definitely a good option. Good addition to the Herbivore family
