I bought this product when I went to visit Sephora with a friend, and this was recommended to me by one of the employees there to fix my reddened cheeks and complexion (I wanted something to brighten/whiten me out evenly). I hesitated on buying it since it was more expensive than products I usually try out, but I find myself liking how it feels after some weeks on it. It definitely has some smell at first (tumeric) and it’s important to clean the place where it’s pumped out with a finger (may leave some residue), but it absorbs near instantly into the skin and doesn’t feel tacky, gooey, or oily like some serums I tried. For something which seems to have a sort of thicker consistency and its vibrant color, it really is a product which just instantly blends and absorbs into the skin and I really like it. And idk if it’s me, but I feel my face is kind of prettier, and I definitely have less rosier/reddened cheeks. Main complaint is that it’s really, really expensive, or at least more expensive than what I would’ve liked my serums to be since I’m not that rich oof. I want to try out more products during my duration here in U.S., so I probably won’t be repurchasing this any soon. It’s more due to me wanting to try out more brands though. But I will probably repurchase this in the off future after I finish rummaging through small samples in Sephora AND I actually have the money for it oof. Anyways, if you have the money, I definitely would recommend this product! Like it better than I thought
