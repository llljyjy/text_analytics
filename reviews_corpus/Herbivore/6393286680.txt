Finally pulled the trigger! I’m pleased so far with the product and it’s doing the job it’s intended for. Only reason I give 4 stars is the price...so expensive. Anyway, it absorbs well, doesn’t sit on top of skin and just gives a really really beautiful & healthy glow. The smell people are not enjoying is simply the rosehip in there. You can’t get away from that when it’s one of the powerhouse ingredients lol that’s what rosehip smells like, take it or leave it ? I recommend it and it’s nice they have a smaller size available for those who want to just try it out and see how it works for you. I started with the larger bottle after reading the great reviews and I don’t regret it! Does the job!
