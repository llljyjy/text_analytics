I love that Sephora finally started selling this mini size because I didn’t want to buy the large size and I also didn’t want to buy a set just to try this. This oil made me break out initially but I think I’m okay now and my skin feels smoother/softer. However, it has done NOTHING for my oily skin. If anything, I look like I a layer of olive oil on my face all the time now and I have to use two or three blotting sheets at a time. And this is me only using two drops of this thing on my face. So I’m torn about it because I do like how my skin feels but I don’t like how oily I look and how many blotting sheets I need to use just to get rid of that oil shine. Does not help oily skin
