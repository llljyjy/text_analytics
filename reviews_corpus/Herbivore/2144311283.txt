Newly pregnant here and devastated when I had to give up retinol. When searching for safe/clean alternatives, this came up and I’m going to give it more time, but haven’t seen a huge difference. One of the other products I’m using has made a tremendous difference and the nights I use this, I wake up and my skin just looks meh. Don't want to write it off just yet...
