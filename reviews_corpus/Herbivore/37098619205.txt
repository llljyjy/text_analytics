I’ve been looking for a good skin care regime that moisturizes my sensitive, dry skin without burning my skin as so many others have.  I did some research and Herbivore had good recommendations and was naturally based so I gave it a shot.  The cleanser and serum work great and moisturize my skin as hoped, but I am sensitive to something in the moisture cream as every time I tried to put it on my skin had a burning sensation and was reddish afterwards. I will have to keep looking for a moisturizing cream that won’t harm my skin. If you have sensitive skin, this may or may not work for you. Great except for the cream
