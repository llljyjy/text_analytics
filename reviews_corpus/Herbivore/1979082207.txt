So far I’m really liking Herbivore’s new vit. C serum! I can definitely tell it goes right to work after I cleanse my skin in the morning. It says to use twice a day but I’ve started slow with just a morning application. I do think my skin purged a bit but seems to be past that now! The smell is a bit strong but not too off putting. It sinks right in and goes to work and in excited to see my skin brighten up! Ok for dry sensitive skin
