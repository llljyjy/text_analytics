The serum is like Herbivore’s other products-clean and pure with no unnecessary chemicals or preservatives. Because of this it has a sweet smell which could be off putting to some people but I didn’t find it offensive whatsoever. As far as it’s efficacy I found my skin has lightened slightly and has given me that lit from within look; a radiance of sorts. I look forward to continuing its use for more effect in the coming weeks. The thing I loved the most is how incredibly soft and supple my skin felt after using it. The serum absorbs well and doesn’t feel tacky or sticky on my skin. I found it to layer well with other products and makeup. Although I received this complimentary for my honest review from Herbivore, I would repurchase and this will become a staple in my routine. Clean beauty
