I have incredibly dry and flakey skin that gets agitated just by looking at it and I didn’t have a single problem with this oil. I can even layer it under a moisturizer before bed and it’ll absorb before my face hits the pillow. My skin has been going through it lately and this has kept me looking glowy and radiant. Would say this might be too heavy for combo and oily skin but this is a miracle worker for people with dry skin. Clients have told me they can’t even tell I have dry skin when I assist them in-store. Must buy!
