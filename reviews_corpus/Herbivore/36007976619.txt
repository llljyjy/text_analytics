Idk how to feel about this.. it made my skin super soft and glowy but a day later i had a small breakout. i have really sensitive skin and this didn’t irritate it. I don’t have acne prone skin so someone who does probably shouldn’t use this but it was worth trying:) i’m still gonna use it tho<3 Soft skin but broke me out
