I’ve this product. I was skeptical the first time because I have oily skin and thinking I’m putting on an oil  would make it worse but it’s actually balanced the oil on my skin, got rid of my acne and really brightened my complexion taling out redness i didnt noticed i had so kuchnof until I used this. I have rebought this a few times now and love it. The only thing is that it goes bad fast because it’s more natural. I think that’s why the company came out with smaller bottles which I’m so thankful for. this has become one of my fav products!  Its expensive but worth it for me because it makes me feel like I can go make up free more confidently when I want to. Love Love Love!
