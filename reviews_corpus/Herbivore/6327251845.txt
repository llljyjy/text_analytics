I’m giving 4 stars for NOT breaking me out like so many products with BHAs added do (95% of products break me out due to allergies and sensitivities). It’s okay for a “gentler” exfoliating serum but DE glycolic and the no-longer-available OH invigorating night treatment work better. I’d rank this with Bliss’ AHA/PHA and OH dewtopia. Some people say they don’t notice a difference but I notice a difference when I DON’T use some form of glycolic acid nightly. And my skin didn’t become dull so I know it worked somewhat. The Prism 20% AHA peel/mask works really well, especially in conjunction with this, but I have a difficult time paying for things that I rinse off my face within a few minutes. I think if you’re new to chemical exfoliants, it might be worth a shot, but if you’re just looking for a less expensive alternative to DE, there are cheaper options that work as well as this one. The bottle sure is pretty, though. And the scent is not offensive (smells a little like cinnamon candy to me). nan
