I’m a huge fan of Herbivore skincare so when I saw they came out with an eye cream I had to try it out. I love how this creamy and thick texture feels nourishing yet lightweight on the skin. It doesn’t make my skin feel greasy and doesn’t irritate my sensitive eyes. What it does is a deep nourishment to the skin. I’m honestly loving this eye cream and can’t wait to see the results of prolonged use. nan
