I really enjoy the texture of this product, and the way it makes my skin feel. I do feel like i see a difference in my skin’s brightness and texture. I love the look of the packaging- it’s super minimalistic and clean-looking, and I always prefer glass bottles. The only thing I didn’t love was the scent of the product...I feel like some sort of scent could have been added to make using this a more pleasant experience. nan
