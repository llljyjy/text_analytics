This unfortunately broke me out. I have really sensitive skin, and had high hopes for this oil, but just couldnâ€™t find a way to make it work for my skin. However, it was super-moisturizing, and I really liked the heaviness for use at night. If your skin is less acne prone and not sensitive, this might work well for you! nan
