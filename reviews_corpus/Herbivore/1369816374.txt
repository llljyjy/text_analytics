This serum is great for clearing sebum and shrinking my pores when I use it regularly. I havenâ€™t found another product that works like it. It goes on light, too, so I can wear it with my other products, too. No pilling, no peeling skin, just great pore purging after 1-2 weeks of use. I keep coming back to it
