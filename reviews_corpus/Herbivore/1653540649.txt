I’m really particular with my moisturizers.  My skin is combo dehydrated and if I use anything too heavy I’ll get blackheads and clogged pores.  I’ve been using this cream nightly for 2 weeks and so far so good.  It’s medium weight and dries to a semi matte finish for me.  No breakouts and my skin feels hydrated and soft. nan
