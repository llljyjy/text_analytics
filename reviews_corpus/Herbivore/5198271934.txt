I bought this product for my ornery husband (43 year old), who throws a fit if I try to impose a multi-step routine. He is also a naturopathic physician, and harsh chemicals are not an option.The serum is a great consistency, very mild scent, and quick to absorb. It is very gentle- but also very effective with diligent use. His skin is glowing, fine lines are plumped out, and skin texture is smoother and firmer. I also tried it, and woke up to beautiful, glowing skin. There were no side effects for us: No peeling, redness, or irritation that comes with retinol use.Highly recommend! Great natural alternative to retinol
