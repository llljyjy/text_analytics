After seeing all the gua sha videos on TikTok, I wanted to understand what the hype was about. After only 2 weeks of using it, I canâ€™t imagine my routine without it now. It is such a soothing exercise and there are so many YouTube/TikTok videos on how to incorporate into your routine. I also notice a significant difference on my jawline and cheekbones--they look slimmer and much more defined. Beyond the way I look, it makes me feel wonderful! LOVE
