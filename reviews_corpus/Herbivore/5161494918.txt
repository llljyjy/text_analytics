I am going to go to my grave with a bottle of this in my clutches! So it’s 2020, I’m going along thinking I have a handle on life, there’s a work life balance, I’m going to the gym and eating healthy… and cue the start of the global pandemic. Not only did all of that go to hades in a hand basket but my skin did a complete 180 (I’m blaming stress) and I mean it’s bad, I’ve always had smooth skin and I woke up one morning to uneven, dull, patchy skin. No matter what I did or tried it just didn’t get any better, that is, until my BFF suggested I give this bay boy a try. I saw results before the end of the week, I had my skin back by the end of the month (and honestly it felt and glowed better than before).Is it a miracle product? Well, kinda. I’ve always had sensitive skin (I mean I developed an allergy to highly popular dermatologist created brand) but the CBD (and other magics) has really made a difference in the appearance and feel of my skin. So when people ask me what I do to keep my skin healthy and glowing I usually point them in this direction. Happily Ever After
