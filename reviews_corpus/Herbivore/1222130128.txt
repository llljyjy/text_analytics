I wish I was better at remembering to take B&A’s because this product is really fantastic. I’ve been using morning and night and can see results within minutes - less puffy, even color, all around more rested looking which is great because I can’t sleep for sh$t in the summer and I’ve be tired AF lately. I don’t even really feel the need for under eye concealer for zoom meetings or casual outings. Very excited for the king-term results! nan
