I’m very picky when it comes to my skin. I break out easily, and some creams will either make me oily or too dry. I originally bought the Auqa cream they had but it wasn’t moisturizing enough. So then I tried their Pink cloud. Amazing!! My face is so soft, looks so fresh and bouncy! I also use the the Pink cloud wash and even my acne is slowly going away. I still get hormonal break outs but my skin has not looked this good since pre-pandemic (before masks). I just bought my second jar. I will continue to use until it stops working for my skin. Love Pink Clouds
