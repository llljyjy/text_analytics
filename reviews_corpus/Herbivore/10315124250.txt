Have just started to use it today so I have no idea what kind of result I’m going to get. However, I’m confused why many people complained about the smell, it actually reminds me of Chanel No. 5 the moment I sprayed it on my face. Also, I notice that the texture is really thin and water-like. It dries up within seconds after you pat your face, so it is not that moisturizing type of mist. Left no sticky or oily residue at all. Smells like Chanel No. 5
