I received this Nova Brightening Serum complimentary for my honest opinion.  I really love the bottle and color of the serum. The serum is a light yellow color and a nice texture.  I really like that it is vegan and cruelty free. The turmeric smell is a turn off for me but it fades away after you rub it in. That is the only real con I have about this product. The serum goes on evenly and absorbs well. It doesn’t leave a sticky or greasy feeling. I have been using it morning and night and it has really helped my face feel hydrated. I haven’t noticed a big change on my sun spots but it does help me have an even skin tone. I think with continued use I’ll see a difference on my dark spots. Very Nice Serum
