I was going to give this a 4* until I got to the end of the bottle. the packaging is horrible. Because the container is glass and with a plastic spout, once it gets to the bottom it’s very hard to get the remainder of the product around it. it’s also thicker so it isn’t a liquid that you can swish towards the tube. I tried to turn it upside down to switch to another little container and because the top part is flat it it got stuck there as well. You’re not missing a lot of product, but enough where I was very frustrated. Other than that, it has a STRONG turmeric smell. If you’re averse to turmeric, I wouldn’t recommend it. personally, I liked it + I applied moisturizer which I think diluted some of the smell. I did enjoy the feel of the serum. However, the packaging itself was frustrating enough for me to try to look for alternatives. Great product, horrible packaging.
