This is an absolutely very gentle sensitive skin-approved retinol-alternative serum. I have sensitive skin and have a strong reaction to retinol. This serum doesn’t give me any redness and irritation. I like to apply it in the morning and it absorbs fast and hydrates my skin well. I love that it’s pregnancy-safe and it has a light grape bubble gum scent, Works well with my sensitive skin
