I purchased this to try out for my step daughter whom is 12 and beginning to get hormonal acne; I wanted something to help with her breakouts but wouldnâ€™t strip her sensitive skin and this product DELIVERED. We started out by using it every other day to really clear up her skin at first and then reduced to once a week. Her skin has completely cleared up, even stubborn black heads on her chin and nose. It worked so well for her I tried it for my breakouts and I can confirm first hand, it produces on what it promises. When you first apply them mask you can feel it cleaning your pores without your skin tightening. The sales rep at Sephora also said you can use it at night for spot treatment, which I have not done yet but would definitely try. Love the product, definitely worth a try if you are trying to deal with acne prone skin without over drying. Clears up skin without drying
