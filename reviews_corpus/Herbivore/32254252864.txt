This is one of my new faves among the vitamin C serums I’ve tried. It has a lovely creamy texture that goes on gently and quickly absorbs into my skin. It doesn’t leave the tacky or sticky feeling that I’ve had with serums in the past. My skin appears to be really bright and radiant! I’m looking forward to continuing to use this.
