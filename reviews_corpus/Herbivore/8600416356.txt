I like this moisturizer but I felt like it didn’t last very long for the price. It lasted me maybe 6 weeks using just enough for my face both am and pm. Made my skin really soft and has a very nice light smell that didn’t irritate my skin like many other fragrances can. If you have the money for it, it’s a good moisturizer but there are other options that are just as good but this brand is very pretty and effective which I do really appreciate. nan
