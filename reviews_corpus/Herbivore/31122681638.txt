Performs like a retinol, with the benefits of a moisturizing mask. I have aging (41), but still breakout prone skin. This masks handles all my concerns. Helps fight acne and wrinkles, but is also gentle and hydrating. I dont experience any dryness or irritation, and I often do with the bakuchiol serum. I like to use this mask 3-4 times a week. Anymore, and I do get a little dry.Whatever your concern, Moonfruit will likely handle it with flying colors. Herbivore does it again!
