I just want to begin by saying that just because this product didnt work for me doesnt me it won’t work for u, everyones skin reacts differently but here are my thoughts (for reference i have combo skin and used this nightly). I was recommended by a sephora employee to try this product out when I told them that i had combo acne prone skin and needed something less harsh. They recommended this product as a “softer alternative” to retinol so I gave it a go. And this is by no means a cheap product so I was hoping that it would work. Unfortunately it left everywhere I usually get oily bumpy and I had a lot more pimples appearing. Although it was leaving my cheeks feel much softer. I used this product for maybe a week and the moment i stopped using it my skin got increasingly better and i could then tell that it was the product that broke me out. nan
