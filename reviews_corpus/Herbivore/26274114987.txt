I received this complimentary from Herbivore.  What a fun serum! It comes in a simple glass bottle with a pump and  there serum is a lime green color.  The scent is subtle but does have a hint of turmeric to it. It dispenses as a cream and blends easily and absorbs quickly into the skin. It could just be my skin but there is a brief tingling sensation when first applied but that stops. This serum has improved my dull skin and uneven color.  It has also softened my dry skin. Fun Effective Serum!
