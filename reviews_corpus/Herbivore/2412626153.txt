I got a pretty generously sized sample of this in an order a few weeks ago, and after finishing it I decided to buy the full size. For reference, I have very fair, oily, somewhat sensitive, acne-prone skin with mild rosacea. First, let me address the scent. Yes, it smells like turmeric because it contains turmeric (duh). I knew what I was getting so I wasn’t bothered by the smell. I also think the scent is pretty mild and it doesn’t linger. If you don’t like the smell of turmeric or have never smelled it before, this might not be for you. Personally, I was interested in this product largely because of the included turmeric. I struggle with skin redness and the anti-inflammatory properties of turmeric can help with that. It’s also supposedly good for acne. So far, I really like this serum. I’ve been using it for the past couple of weeks as part of my morning skincare routine. It’s moisturizing and spreads over the skin easily. It’s a gentle formula that hasn’t caused any irritation or breakouts. It doesn’t make me greasy, but I find it gives me a really healthy glow upon application. I have a bad habit of picking at pimples and my acne marks take forever to fade, but I do feel like this is helping speed up that process. I think over a longer time period I’ll be able see the effects more dramatically and form a more comprehensive opinion on this product’s overall effectiveness, but I just wanted to write a review with my experience thus far (especially because there are quite a few negative reviews based on the scent). Yes, it smells like turmeric
