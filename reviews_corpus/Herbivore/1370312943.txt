This product has been very effective for my skin. Noticeably softer feeling skin after just a few uses and texture from old acne scars appears slightly smoother. Has a slight scent but not offensive or irritating (I’m pretty sensitive to scent). Took a star off because the consistency is very thin and digging into the jar to apply feels kind of unsanitary especially for such a “natural” product without the typical preservation system. Wish it came in a tube that you squeezed out rather than an open jar. smooth &soft skin - will definitely repurchase!
