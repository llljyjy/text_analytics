My few fave!! I’ve been wanting to switch up a few morning products and added NOVA. It’s instant brightness and I’m in love with the clean ingredients- it’s so good! I’m also super sensitive toMost vitamin C and this does not react to my sensitivity It does smell like turmeric- which I love ❤️❤️❤️ It’s not overwhelming but does add a nice zest. This is definitely a must have ! nan
