I’ve always used clay masks thinking that the tight feeling in my skin when clay dries was the true sign of my pores being cleaned but boy was I wrong. Not only is this mask super gentle, but my skin feels so clean after and my pores seem smaller. My face really glows the day after. Just a note that the scent is pretty herbal which I don’t mind but others may. This is my absolute favorite mask of all time. nan
