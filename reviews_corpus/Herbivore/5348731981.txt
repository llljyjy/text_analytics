I tried the Herbivore Nova Brightening Serum that I was gifted by Herbivore, in exchange for my honest review. First off, the packaging and color of this serum is so bright and fun! Nova Brightening Serum is made with a 15% Vitamin C & Tumeric blend, so it’s perfect for those with dark spots, uneven skin tone or just want to help combat the signs of aging! The serum is really lightweight and seems to just melt right into your skin. I’ve found that 1-1 1/2 pumps is a good amount and you should definitely start with 1 pump until you see how much works for you. The scent is very light and smells natural, but also pleasant. It leaves my skin looking hydrated and glowing! I have also noticed my dark spots starting to lighten and my skin’s texture looks more even with each use. This has easily becoming a new favorite serum! New favorite serum!
