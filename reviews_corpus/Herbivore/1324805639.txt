I’ve been using Herbivore for years and somehow missed this product. I assume because it is the oil that’s been around longest, it’s getting less attention. I hope that changes. While I like the other facial oils, this one is the apex. It absorbs into the skin so beautifully and has the most lovely fragrance. I have sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin, and this oil somehow manages to address all issues. I hope less people sleep on this product, it is *chefs kiss* best facial oil ever
