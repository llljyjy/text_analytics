I used this serum in my mourning routine and I saw my skin deeply hydrated and prepared for the day. The scent was very pleasant, very herbal and that relaxed me as I applied it, it really made some of the dark spots I had in my face disappeared and even my skin tone. Relaxing scent, effective on reducing dark spots.
