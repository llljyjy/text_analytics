I absolutely love this new Bakuchiol serum as it offers the same anti-aging properties as retinol without the side effects, or irritation. After using this serum for a while I am seeing improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles, my skin feels softer and smoother all without dryness, or irritation. This serum doesnâ€™t contain any added fragrance and its natural scent is very light, so it really is suitable for sensitive skin. It has very nice creamy texture, yet absorbs quickly without leaving any residue and layers well with other products. nan
