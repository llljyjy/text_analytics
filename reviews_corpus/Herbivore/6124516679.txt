Been using this for over a month, almost always following Herb.’s Bakuchiol (sometimes after a gentle exfoliating treatment).  I have chemical allergies-- many other products cause skin irritations, trigger asthma and/or migraine; this one is problem-free.  Also noticeably, REMARKABLY hygroscopic!  I use it every night, and sometimes won’t even top with a moisturizer; my face is always hydrated in the morning (previously, always dry).  After applying, before I fall asleep, it can become a bit sticky to the touch, but that just reminds me not to touch my face.  This product attracts ambient humidity like nothing I’ve worn before.  Following the most stressful 3 months of my life (while wearing an N95 all day everyday):  the dehydration/ fine lines around my mouth are becoming less apparent; my healthy pores look smaller; clogged pores are diminishing...  I don’t write many reviews, but Herbivore’s Bakuchiol is really good, and I’m AMAZED by the hydration from Cloud Jelly! Big-Time Humectant
