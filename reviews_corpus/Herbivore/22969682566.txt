I’m being picky about my skincare and have acquired a lot of masks along the way trying to find the best ones. I didn’t love how messy this one felt. Sticking a utensil in to get the product doesn’t work well because it’s very thin. I just started using my fingers and it got the job done but it wasn’t the best. It smells and is inconsistent in color. I put it away for a few months while I was using other products I’ve liked more. I pulled this out again and was reminded, the smell is not great, it’s gooey, like the thinnest slime. so after I used it I actually wondered if it had gone bad. The color seems even weirder than it was before. I threw it away. Thin slime
