After using this for a couple weeks, I am noticing my under eye area is a little firmer and hydrated. My bags arenâ€™t gone, but they are lessened considerably. This blends quickly and is not greasy. It does not cause irritation or flaking like retinol products have for me in the past, nor does it pill when I put make-up over, leaving a smooth prep area. Paired with the cute packaging, this eye cream is a winner! A great retinol alternative
