Can really feel it toning my skin. My wrinkles and deep lines are much less noticeable! The retinol does dry your skin out at first, but your skin will get use to it and even out. Great texture. Wrinkles are much less noticable. Dark spots and eye circles less. Go out without makeup now. Highly recommended! It works!
