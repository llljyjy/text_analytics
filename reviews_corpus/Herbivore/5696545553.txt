Absolutely love this moisturizer! I initially tried the pink cloud because I have drier combination skin; however, that one stung so much on my skin and eyes it irritated my acne more. After switching to this one my skin feels calm and I do feel like it’s helped with my blackhead issue a little bit that I’ve always had around my nose. And my breakouts have finally started clearing. nan
