I was kindly gifted by Herbivore, their brand new Moon Dew Retinol Alternative Eye Cream in exchange for my honest review. I love the purple color.  It comes in a jar and is thick and luxurious, with a texture almost like a paste.  It has a light scent reminiscent of grapes. This is natureâ€™s retinol, 1 % Bakuchiol that smooths fine lines and wrinkles. It also contains plant peptides to visibly firm skin and reduce puffiness, and additionally honey locust seed which is rich in polysaccharides to instantly tighten and visibly lift skin.  I apply morning and evening gently around my lower eyes with my fingertips.  I feel like my skin is very moisturized without any residual greasy skin or tackiness. After using it twice a day for more than a week I cannot see any visible improvement.  My skin feels hydrated but it did not seem to help the appearance of fine lines, dark circles or puffiness. Hydrating but no improvement to fine lines
