I really love me a good eye cream and this is actually my first one with having retinol in it. I love the texture of this too its not too think or even too light. This is just right and applies very nicely in my under eye areas. I love how smooth my under eyes feel after application and just how this is helping with some wrinkles around my eyes. I think this product is very nife and seeps in very well. Creamy beauty
