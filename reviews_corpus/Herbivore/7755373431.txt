Nova has the consistency of a lightweight lotion, which adds an extra layer of hydration to my dry skin compared to the watery consistencies of many other Vitamin C serums on the market.  Turmeric definitely comes through in this serum’s scent, but it disappears after a few minutes or when moisturizer is applied on top.  The higher concentration of Vitamin C in this product definitely makes a difference.  Once two pumps are spread across my face and neck, my skin is glowing!  After using this serum for two weeks, a dark spot that I’ve tried to get rid of for years has even started to slightly fade.  I love that the pump can be locked with a simple twist so that it won’t spill.  As someone who travels frequently and likes to bring skincare with me on the road, this feature is extremely helpful! Gives skin a glow & fades dark spots!
