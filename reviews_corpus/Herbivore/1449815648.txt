Absorbs well but smells strong (not in a good way personally for me, although some may like it), and the colour cannot be good for us, right? If it weren’t a bright orange colour, I might feel more inclined to use it more than I do. Thankfully, I purchased the mini bottle and barely use it given the bright colour. I don’t think I’ll be repurchasing it though as I haven’t seen any major changes in my skin’s hydration levels either. Crazy colour
