I have used the Herbivore eye cream for 2 weeks and really enjoyed it. The eye cream is silky and creamy. My undereye area feels immediately hydrated after using it. Itâ€™s very gentle. I love an eye cream with retinol alternatives without causing any irritation. The cute purple color is a plus. The price is fair for an eye cream that contains peptides and bakuchiol. I was gifted by Herbivore for testing. nan
