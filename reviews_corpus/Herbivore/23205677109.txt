I absolutely love this vitamin C! The color of the packaging as well as the serum itself are so eye catching and look great on your vanity. As for the serum itself, it applies easily and sinks right into your skin without leaving any sort of stickiness! it layers well with other products. My skin after using is left brighter and my spots are beginning to lighten! nan
