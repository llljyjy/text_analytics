It is an ok product. It gets a lil sticky on my face, and adds moisture. But nothing too magical. Also, I had to use a lot of it to cover my face. Wouldn’t recommend for my skin type if you are looking for dewy skin. I am huge into water based serum, but this one didn’t do the trick for me Not for my dry combination skin type
