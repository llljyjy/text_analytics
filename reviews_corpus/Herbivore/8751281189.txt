i got a sample sized bottle and have been looking for a good, strong vitC serum. i love this so far! it isnt making my skin freak out (used after moisturizer first few times to adjust) and i dont need to use much for my whole face so a full bottle should last quite awhile. the smell is strong but fades within a minute or two - if a product is working this well then a smell wonâ€™t bother me! gonna buy full size once i run out of this great product
