I really love this product however after several months I think bacteria of some sort is growing at the bottom.. I never touch the dropper to my face and Iâ€™m unsure of how this happened. It stays in a cabInet so no sun exposure. Curious if it has happened to anyone else?! Pre-Growth this product made my skin glow, and helped my acne heal. I liked to lather it on at night alone and wake up to beautiful skin, or put a tiny amount in my moisturizer in the morning! Great Product/Bad Packaging
