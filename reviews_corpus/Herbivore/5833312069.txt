I love this Gua Sha, but it’s fragile so you have to be careful with it. This is my second time buying because I dropped it (literally an inch above the bottom of the sink) while cleaning it and it broke in half. I’m placing a tiny bit of blame on Venus Retrograde though, haha. Love it but be careful.
