I got a sample of this. This definitely does what it says it will! After using, my skin has a nice, matte texture. Great for daytime. When I used it at night I found I woke up with my skin a little on the dry side, which surprised me because itâ€™s got a very rich, creamy texture. Works as Advertised.
