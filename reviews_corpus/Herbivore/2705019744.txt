This is a quality serum. I really like that it’s moisturizing without being oily. I have combination skin, and I found that it helped the dry spots on my skin and didn’t make me oily. It’s lightweight and has a very light turmeric scent. I also think the packaging is cute and minimalist. I definitely would recommend this serum! nan
