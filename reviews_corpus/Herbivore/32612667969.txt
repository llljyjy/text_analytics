in terms of the actual quality of the product, it’s just okay. it seems to do the job but it does leave a sticky feeling on the skin, however a lot of cleansers do that. the biggest issue that i have is the smell. it isn’t super strong, but it is present and i personally cannot stand how it smells (i can’t really describe it well but its of the “opening a 3 month old trash bag and taking a whiff” variety, just not super strong). if it weren’t for the smell, i’d probably just finish the bottle and not repurchase since the product simply isn’t worth the price tag, however i genuinely don’t think i can bring myself to use it again and will likely return it. smells gross and the product doesn’t stand out
