I really wanted to love this serum, but I ended up being disappointed by it in more than a few ways. Pros: nice consistency, quick absorption, and an absolutely delightful scent (if you find the smell of turmeric pleasant). Cons: left me greasy looking for about an hour after application, lackluster results after using the whole bottle (complexion seemed a bit brighter/glowy-er, but dark spots hadn’t faded one bit), and like many other reviewers mentioned, the packaging is exceptionally wasteful for a product this expensive. In terms of results, my skin is much happier with a combo of Herbivore’s Pink Cloud moisturizer and Derma E’s Concentrated Vitamin C Serum (added bonus: buying both  is only $4.00 more than purchasing Nova on it’s own), so needless to say, I’ll be sticking with the products my face prefers. I'd spend my money elsewhere if I were you.
