A little goes a long way! I apply it to the areas of my face where I deal with more redness and it has noticably lessoned that redness over the past few days. The tumeric smell is strong, but not in an unpleasant way. More like it reminds me of the smell of the body care section in a While Foods, which I like. Gifted by Herbavore Botanicals for my honest review Great for redness
