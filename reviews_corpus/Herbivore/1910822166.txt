I’ve used this oil morning and night for literally 5+ years. It’s my tried and true. I use a bit less in the summer and a bit more in the winter. My only thing with it is; bottle to bottle the oil can smell a bit different and I’m guessing that’s because of the natural ingredients. However, I’d still give her a 10/10. My Staple product
