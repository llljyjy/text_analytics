Why is no one talking about how this orange oil transfers EVERYWHERE? White sheets, pillow cases, towels, t shirts… you name it, it will get an unsightly orange mark on it using this oil. It comes off in the wash but still annoying for such an expensive oil. I only use this at night because, as others have said, it makes your face tinted if you’re fair. Due to the cost I’m using this up but will not purchase again because of the color transfer. If you remove the color transfer issues, this product is a decent oil. It definitely helps to lock in the moisturizer I apply in the prior step of my skin care routine. It has not personally broken me out either. It does have a funky smell though, like leftover take out. If you’re cool with that and don’t mind orange color getting on everything, this would be a good oil for you. Orange EVERYWHERE
