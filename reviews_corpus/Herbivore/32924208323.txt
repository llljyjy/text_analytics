I honestly love this, after cleansing I apply a small amount to slightly damp skin and I feel like it really preps my skin for the rest of my routine! It’s fairly lightweight, absorbs quickly, and doesn’t feel heavy or greasy on my skin. It’s really nice to use before and after something that I know is going to be a little harsher or drying on my skin, like a clay mask, or treatment for my acne. I also like to use it to thin out the texture of my sunscreen and make the formula a little more hydrating! It’s not a necessity, but I sure do love it!! perfect for oily skin!
