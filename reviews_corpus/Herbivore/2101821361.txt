Herbivore’s new Nova Brightening Serum is GORGEOUS! The formula contains an exceptionally high quality of vitamin c, and I love that they also included turmeric in the ingredients! The scent is herbal and calming and I love how the serum is creamy instead of thin / watery like most. I can’t wait to see my dark spots lighten with this in my routine! Nova Vitamin C
