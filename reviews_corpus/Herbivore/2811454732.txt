I use this almost exclusively as my cleanser. I love everything ah it. The texture, smell, and results. I don’t like anything that smells artificial or perfumed; this has a light and refreshing rose scent. It’s definitely not “rose perfume” but natural, diluted rose water. That’s a big difference for me because I don’t like my skincare scent to linger. I get a thorough cleanse without any sort of dryness. As a 43-year-old with sensitive skin, that’s important. It has powerhouse plants that really do improve your skin. I definitely recommend. Worth it.
