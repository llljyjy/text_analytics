herbivore serums are some of my favs! they always have unique ingredients and thicker consistensies. immediately the color of this one jumped out to me, very aesthetically pleasing and fetching. the scent I found to also be pleasant and the texture holds true to the others Iâ€™ve tried. it draws nicely and leaves a nourished glow to my skin. nan
