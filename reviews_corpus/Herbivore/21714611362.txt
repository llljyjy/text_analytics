I’ve been using this serum for 5 months and I’ve almost finished the bottle, I’ve probably got a few more months of use if I had to guess. I’ve really been enjoying how moisturized and plump it makes my skin feel compared to my last serum. It dries down pretty fast so it’s not just sitting on top of your skin for minutes on end, the texture is pretty nice, and I love the cute pastel pink color. I’m honestly surprised I’ve made this little bottle last so long but you really don’t need a lot to cover your face. A little goes a long way! I also enjoy that it doesn’t overly hydrate my skin since I’m oily/combo and too much moisturizer makes me look wet after an hour lol. I can comfortably not wear makeup with this and it gives me a plump, glassy skin look. ✨ nan
