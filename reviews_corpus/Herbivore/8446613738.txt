This serum is truly magic in a botte! It comes on smoothly glides through the skin and leaves your skin feeling fabulous with an instant glow probably from that turmeric!! The serum is golden and light not thick so I wear this under my moisturizer and foundation. The serum does have a natural scent nothing strong but in my opinion you can smell a hint of the turmeric in it. I would recommend  to anyone looking for a vitamin c serum and and an instant glow!
