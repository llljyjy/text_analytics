This was my introduction to Herbivore and I do quite like it. I have super dry skin that is also acne prone. None of these products gave me a breakout. However, when it comes to all three I don’t think I would purchase the moisturizer in a full size, I’ll def use it up tho. I love the cleanser so much and will be buying a full size when Sephora has 20% off. The serum is nice but I’m not sure it will be worth the price tag when so many other more affordable brands have better  hydrating serums for less $. Overall, I love that Herbivore made smaller sizes to try out their products and wish more brands did this. The products are def beautiful and I’m glad I bought it. nan
