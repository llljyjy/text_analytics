I am a recovering over exfoliator. I haven’t used AHA/BHA exfoliants in about a year. I recently introduced this serum to my routine and found it to be quite gentle. I didn’t experience any tingling or uncomfortable sensations. It does leave a tacky feeling on the skin so I would recommend only using it as night as there it potential for pilling. nan
