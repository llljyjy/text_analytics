I received your his nova vitamin c serum complimentary from Herbivore in exchange for my honest review. This 15% vitamin c serum has turmeric which helps brightens your complexion and even skin tone. It claims to see results in 7 days . After 7 days my skin looks brighter and my dark spots faded a little bit . You can smell the turmeric in this serum . It smells earthy and I love it . The serum is not sticky and layers well with my other skincare products. This is a great vitamin c to try for hyperpigmentation and dark spots . Brightening vitamin c serum .
