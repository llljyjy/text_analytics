I have been using this product for over a year. ￼ have slightly sensitive skin, and this product does not disrupt my skin in any way. It truly moisturizers and leaves my skin glowing. The fragrance is very slight and does not linger. Love this product… It’s in my Hall of Fame of holy grail products. ￼ Holy Grail
