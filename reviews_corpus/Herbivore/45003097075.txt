Honestly, I bought this serum because I already had the cleanser from the same collections, and thought it was amazing, so I believed this would be as amazing as the cleanser. Yeah, it hydrates and plumps for a little while, but nothing too special. You can get better serums for much lower prices, or better serums for the same price. I do want to make it clear that it is not a BAD product, I just donÂ´t think its worth the price, and I could have spent my money on another cheaper but better serum. Nothing special.
