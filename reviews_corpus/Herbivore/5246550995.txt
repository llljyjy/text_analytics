Herbivore states that their products have a shelf life of 12 months when kept out of sunlight and at room temperature of below. I’ve followed those instructions, and my product grew mold! I have no idea how long it’s been growing, but I’m so disgusted. Beware and monitor for mold if you really want to buy this product. Herbivore claims this is normal “sediment” that they saw in lab testing but wouldn’t send me any photos showing that this was a normal effect in the products.  Definitely spend your money elsewhere! Beware of mold!
