To preface: I have VERY sensitive skin. I bought this during the Sephora summer sale back in July for $33. Honestly it was a good deal, but due to burning sensation (normally any product I try, for the first 2-3 times always tingle my skin) I had to take it back. I had read very good reviews and consistently used it for almost a month, twice a day with the Glow Recipe BHA and PHA Toner and Plum Pump Hyaluronic Acid Serum. The fore-mentioned products never irritated my skin. Pros: Very hydrating. My skin did look more moisturized. A little goes a long way due to the think consistency. Glass packaging!!Personal Cons: Constantly broke me out. Extreme tingling on my face every time I applied it.I will say that I do NOT recommend the products to others with very sensitive skin. If you are tougher skinned, do try! Not for sensitive skin!
