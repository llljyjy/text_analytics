I received this Retinol-Alternative Serum, Moon Fruit, complimentary from Herbivore Botanicals to try out in exchange for my honest review. This serum, which contains 1% bakuchiol + peptides, is very gentle on my skin, so I definitely have been liking it a lot so far! The scent of this serum is okay, not my favorite, but not bad either! Overall, I think this serum has definitely been helping my skin look brighter and more hydrated! nan
