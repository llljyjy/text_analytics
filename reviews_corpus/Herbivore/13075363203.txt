This is an incredible face cream!  I decided to give it a try because I love Herbivore’s vegan hyaluronic acid line (Cloud Jelly serum and Pink Cloud moisturizer).  I use the Cloud Jelly & Pink Cloud at night, followed by a lighter moisturizer during the day.  I ran out of the daytime moisturizer and needed a replacement fast, so I ordered Aquarius via Sephora’s same-day delivery service.  This is the first and only truly mattifying moisturizer I’ve ever used.  I have reactive, red, skin and when my skin is in crisis, it overproduces oil.  The Aquarius moisturizer is moisturizing and mattifying.  This mattifys without overdrying my skin- when I’ve used other mattifying moisturizers in the past, my skin has felt tight, dry, and uncomfortable.  But not with this one!  It is even gentle enough for my sensitive skin.  I am not surprised though- another big win for Herbivore!  I highly recommend this product!! Another Great Product by Herbivore!
