This is a really good moisturizer, I got a sample of this and used it a few times and I was so pleased with it at first , it even had make-up looking so much prettier . I was so ready to go out a purchase a jar but I started to notice that it was breaking out my face. The first time I used it I got 1 or 2 bumps so I didn’t realize that it was from the moisturizer, then by the 3rd time of using I definitely realize that I was getting more bumps every time I use it so now I can’t go out and buy it. I think you will love it tho if you don’t have that problem with it breaking out your face because besides that, it can be a good moisturizer. Really good moisturizer but it’s not for everybody
