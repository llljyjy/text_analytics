This cream is fairly lightweight but packs a punch with moisturizing. I wouldn’t recommend for oily skin types (would be better for dry or mature skin) but it definitely softens skin over time and helped with texture. It has a very light, faint rose smell to it that isn’t artificial or overwhelming. nan
