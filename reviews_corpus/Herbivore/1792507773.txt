I received this complimentary from Herbivore in exchange for my honest review. Vitamin C is a must in my skincare regimen and this couldnt have come at a better time as my vitamin c just ran out. I am used to vitamin c so I was happy that this had 15% as I had some scars as of recent. The component of this is great as it locks which means I can take it with me when I travel. The consistency of the vitamin c is creamy and soaks  right into my skin. The smell is a bit earthy but very faint for me so I am okay with it. Though I know itâ€™s takes awhile to see results in the few days I have used this I can tell this is going to make a different and brighten up my skin. nan
