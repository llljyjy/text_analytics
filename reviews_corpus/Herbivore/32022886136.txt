Yes, it smells but it is doing an amazing job! By putting it into the fridge youâ€™ll have a great experience. Removes post-acne, soothes pores, and smooths the skin! One of the best masks that I was trying with visible results after 1 week. I was using it for one month as a following. Everyday until I see the result - then twice a week! Would buy again AMAZING MASK
