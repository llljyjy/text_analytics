I don’t usually write reviews, and I love the Herbivore brand, but this purchase was a disappointment. First the amount of product in the jar was a bit surprising. It was well below the cap, for example there was no, not a bit, of product on the security cover thingy. That’s never happened before, I can usually get a few days from that alone. The first time I swiped some out I scraped the bottom of the jar, also surprising. Ok, on to the cream- I was looking for a lightweight summer moisturizer for my VERY oily, pore noticeable skin. This moisturizer was heavy, I used it during the day for a few days but it was heavy. Uncomfortably so. This may sound odd but I could almost feel the shine on my face. So did not help at all with oil AM or PM. I can’t comment on how it would be on pores long-term because I had to stop using it. nan
