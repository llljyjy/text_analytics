I bought this roller a few years ago and absolutely loved it. I dropped and broke it recently so I purchased what I thought was a replacement. It is awful. It is not the same product at all. It is a cheap imitation. The stones are not jade. They are plastic and are not cooling. The hardware is cheap. The bag isn’t even pink. It’s peach. Same product description, same company, same price, but cheap imitation.  Sephora needs to stop selling it. They are better than that. Do Not Buy!
