I’m probably one of the few reviews who isn’t posting a review in exchange for product. I was very intrigued about this when I first read about it and picked it up as soon as it can out. I instantly loved it! The smell is pleasant and mild, however it’s not a normal skincare sent so I’m sure that is throwing a lot of people off. It’s a slightly sweet, spicy/earthy scent and it fades away by the time you are finished with the rest of your skincare routine. I’ve noticed a visible improvement in the redness and discoloration of my skin as well as overall improvement of tone. I definitely feel like my skin looks healthier and more radiant. This will definitely be a repeat buy. Love this product!
