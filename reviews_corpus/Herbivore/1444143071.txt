[Gifted by Herbivore] I’m always so excited about Vitamin C launches because I am still searching for the one! So far, this is probably one of my favorites in terms of the formulation and how it feels on the skin. It absorbs well and seems to play well with my other products I personally am not a huge fan of how it smells (I think it’s the turmeric? But it smells strongly of ginseng to me) but thankfully, it dissipates quickly. It’s quite expensive for its size and unfortunately, I haven’t used it long enough to see the actual effects, but as a whole, I do enjoy using it and will continue doing so in my routine. nan
