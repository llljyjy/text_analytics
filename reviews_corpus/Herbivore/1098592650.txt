Well I was looking forward to trying this line.And with all the positive reviews.So I bought the serum and the moisturizer.Once I put it on and just after a few min my eyes started to water and I got the worst headache.I thought I would ask the company if they could recommend one of the products without any scent.All I got was an email with them beating around the bush and would not even answer the simple question.The cream was the same as well. I did not see any listing for fragrance so  that is why I gave it a try.Terrible customer service. I will never buy from this line again.Just a simple question so itâ€™s a simple answer.Not impressed. nan
