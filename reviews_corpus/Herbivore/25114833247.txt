This mask is by far the best exfoliating mask I have ever used. It is non irritating thanks to the blue tansy in it and still cleans out all the gunk in my pores. In just 2 uses my pores look so much better, cleaner, and smaller. I will say that the shelf life of this product is not that long but other than that this mask is truly iconic. iconic
