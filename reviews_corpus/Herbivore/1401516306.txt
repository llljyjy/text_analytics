I really love this mask. I feel like this mask is underrated for what it does for redness as well as how nice it makes the since feel after use. I always have a flushed appearance on my cheeks which has over time gotten worse as I have gotten older. I didn’t mind it when I was younger but I’m getting older, the redness started to overpower the colour on my face. I use this mask around once a week now and enjoy the overall experience of it - how it feels immediately when applied, the cooling sensations, the immediate reduction in redness, but also how it also seems to clear up/polish up my skin once I wash it off. Will definitely repurchase when I am out. I know some people find the aroma and look off putting but neither of those things bother me, as long as I can see it working I’m good. love this blue mask
