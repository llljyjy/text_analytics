This was a game changer in my beauty routine! This new cream by Herbivore is better for the earth and your body. It has eco-friendly packaging with eco-friendly ingredients that my skin soaked up. I used a small spatula to apply this every morning and night. There is a light and airy fragrance to the cream with it being a beautiful shade of purple. I saw an immense difference in my fine lines and crows feet within a few days of use without any harsh chemicals having to be used on my skin. I highly recommend! Great choice!
