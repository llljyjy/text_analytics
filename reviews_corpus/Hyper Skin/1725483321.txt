This is a solid vitamin c. I purchased it after my cousin stunted on all of us in the family zoom chat with her glowing skin! I asked what she uses, & she shared this with me. I purchased the mini since I’m using other vitamin c products from YTTP & Glytone. I really think it’s too soon to tell whether it works, & i don’t think vitamin c serums are effective at treating hyperpigmentation on my skin; however, i can share what I do/do not like about this product. Like: doesn’t irritate my skin, absorbs well, no weird smell or excessive fragrance! Also brightens my skin a bit and plays well with my other daytime products. Dislike: none so far. Unknowns: not yet sure whether this would help against hyperpigmentation, though it does help brighten my skin a bit. Because it is not irritating & doesn’t stink, I would recommend it. Solid Product; Too Soon To Tell
