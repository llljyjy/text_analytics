This product was gifted by Hyper Skin, I was so excited to try it. Branding of the Hyper Skin products are so cute!! Packaging makes it easy to understand what ingredients are in the product. Directions on the side of box and a little product goes a long way. Initially upon application my skin was burning but after a few mins it went away. My skin feels refreshed and I woke up with bright skin today. Giving this product 3/5 stars because it unfortunately stained my towels and stings upon applying. I do have very dry sensitive skin so that could be irritating it. nan
