This is the perfect set if you’re looking to test out the brand. You get their best selling serum along with their cleanser. The formulas seem really gentle which I like as someone who has sensitive skin. The serum is a lot more lightweight than I had thought it would be. it’s yellow tint likely from turmeric and it’s really thin so you just need a small amount to spot treat. Great duo set
