As a person with sensitive skin I was a bit apprehensive but decided I would trust Hyper Skin and I have no regrets. I didnâ€™t experience a burning sensation or any redness from use. From my first application my skin was supple, brighter and the discoloration on my cheeks seemed lighter. Could this be? Results from initial use? Absolutely!!! nan
