The first product I used was their Brightening Dark Spot Vitamin C Serum & since then I have been inlove with this brand! Their dark spot serum works so when I found out they were releasing an AHA face mask I knew I had to try it and I’m glad I did! I really love the ingredients in this AHA mask & so far after using it a couple of times, I have not had any bad reactions. I haven’t had the chance to use this for a month but I am slowly seeing a difference in my skin. My skin definitely looks much brighter than before and I think using this with their dark spot serum really helps! I definitely recommend checking their products out!*Gifted by Hyper Skin but all opinions & experiences my own. A MUST HAVE AHA MASK!
