Nice mask that definitely seems to brighten my skin. As with any strong AHA mask, it gives my somewhat sensitive skin a little tingle, so I only use it once weekly. I haven’t used it three months so I can’t tell you the long-term effects but I can tell you that my skin already looks brighter. One star off because I don’t love the packaging. Complimentary from Hyper Skin Nice !
