Gifted by Hyper skin, Iâ€™m pleasantly surprised by how much I truly love this Duo set. First off the size of products are perfect they are super nice for travel and can be compacted to have in a over night bag. The cleansing gel is extremely gentle on the skin very light weight. Scent is so fresh like tangerine/citrus very nice.  The serum is like cream/ gel texture it glides on effortlessly and is slightly tacky but not annoying or anything. This set is a game changer for my skin it has never looked brighter and smooth. Game changer
