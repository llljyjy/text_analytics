This is a pretty good mask and I love that they adding sea buckthorn which is in my favorite moisturizer. It didn’t sting upon application which I have noticed with other AHA masks I’ve used. I think because they used mandelic acid it might’ve helped with easing the stinging. This is a pretty good mask and I’ll continue using. This product was gifted by Hyper Skin. Pretty Good Mask!
