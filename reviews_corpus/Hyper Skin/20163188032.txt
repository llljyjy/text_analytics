I love the way this cleanser feels on my skin! It doesn’t leave me with that dry, stripped feeling after I use it. This has just the right amount of lather and I’ve started noticing a more bright, even complexion since incorporating it into my routine. The scent is light and pleasant, it smells very natural and I love that there isn’t added fragrance. I’m usually very cautious with cleansers because of my dry skin type, but this has been a perfect match! nan
