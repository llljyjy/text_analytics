This face wash is doing just what it’s supposed to do, it has brightened and faded the dark spots on my face.  I’ve been using it every morning for the last 2 months, the gel consistency took a bit of getting used to but now I just add the tiniest bit of water to get it lathered then get my Foreo to do the work.  I have very sensitive, dry skin and I’m so so happy that this has worked for me. New addition to my routine
