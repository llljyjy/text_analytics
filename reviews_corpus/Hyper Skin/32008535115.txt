This stuff really works! I had been using the Olay vitamin C serum for a couple of months, but my dark acne spots werenâ€™t really fading. Used this for one month for my hyperpigmentation and the sun spots under on my cheeks and my dark acne spots on my chin faded noticeably! Will definitely keep using this. This stuff really works!
