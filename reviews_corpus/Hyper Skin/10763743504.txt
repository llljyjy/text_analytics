This is such a wonderful product that my skin is loving lately. I have been using it for some time now and my skin is feeling plentiful  and clean now. I also am starting to see some old acne scars and spots starting to be more lighter as I apply this. The texture on my skin is starting to look more smooth also and less hole like due to long time picking. The scent is also lovely and fresh like. Overall I am really enjoying this Wonderful cleanser
