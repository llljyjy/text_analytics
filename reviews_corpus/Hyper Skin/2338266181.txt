LOVE this brand’s packaging and branding. I’ve been using this for about two weeks in hopes that it would help fade my dark marks left from acne. Unfortunately I haven’t noticed a change. Overall it’s a good cleanser that doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, but the results have not been what I had hoped for. nan
