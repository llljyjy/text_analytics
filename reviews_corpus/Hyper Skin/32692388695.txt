I really enjoy using this fragrance. It is a gentle cleanser that lathers well and does not have a strong fragrance. It has a jelly texture. Also it did not strip away any moisture from my skin. My combination skin did not feel dry after using this. I like how my skin feels after using this cleanser. nan
