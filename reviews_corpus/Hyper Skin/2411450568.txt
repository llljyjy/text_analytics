This cleanser is pretty gentle, lathers well and didn’t leave my dry skin feeling stripped or irritated. It also has a very light citrus-like scent to it. Since I began using this I have noticed that a large dark spot that I have has slightly lightened so I’m happy to keep using this to see if I get further results. Gentle cleanser
