I have combination skin that sometimes leans more oily and sometimes more dry depending on the season and it’s also blemish prone. The texture of this cleanser is jelly-like which is different than most other cleansers but I really enjoyed that. It is thick but a little goes a long way and I find that it develops a nice lather without being overly soapy. I absolutely love the scent. It doesn’t have any added fragrance but naturally smells like sweet orange citrus and is just heavenly. What’s most shocking about this cleanser is the results. Within one week of using it dark marks that had been on my cheek from past breakouts for going on a year now were noticeably diminished! I couldn’t believe just how much of a difference this made in such a short amount of time. I use this like a normal cleanser in the AM (just rub in and rinse) and then in the PM I rub it in and let it sit for about 5 minutes while I get ready to shower and then rinse it off. I think that doing it that way really helped to jump start the dark spot reduction. I’ve tried to get rid of these dark spots for months now and this cleanser reduced them by a good 75% within a week. This is the cleanser to buy if you have dark spots. I can’t recommend it highly enough! Amazing Cleanser
