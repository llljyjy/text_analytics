I have acne prone skin that is also dehydrated and I really like this gentle exfoliating cleanser. The gel texture is unique and very gentle. The AHAs keep my skin clear and helps with congested pores and breakouts. Overall, Iâ€™m impressed and would recommend this, especially if you like having a two in one product. nan
