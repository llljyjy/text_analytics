Received from Hyper Skin. This is their new drop it will be available 7/6 and i was able to get my hands on it on a early release. After using it for a week, I havenâ€™t noticed my skin lightening. But it is infused with citrus and has a lovely citrus scent that helps me to start the day in a great mood . The citrus helps me open my eyes. The gel cleanser is light and gentle, has aloe extract, willow bark, mushroom extract, licorice root, cucumber extract and so much more. I do highly recommend using this cleanser!! helps me open my eyes
