Incredible. I use to not get excited for cleansers - they’re on your skin for so little time that most active ingredients are washed away before they get a chance to do anything. But of all the cleanser I’ve tried, this is my favorite! It’s incredibly gentle, and helps with congested pores without damaging your skin barrier. I use this twice, once to remove sunscreen and once again to remove any buildup, and it never dries my skin. The product also lasts a surprisingly long time, because you really only need a dime sized amount for your entire face. I’m not as confident that it works to even skin tone, but it might have some lightening effects with long term use. I would treat it more as a skin smoothing and pore reducing cleanser. Obviously try to avoid your eyes with any AHA cleanser so you don’t irritate them. I’ve also tried:• Youth to the People Super-food Cleanser: Drying, mediocre, over-hyped, includes way too many marketing gimmicks in the ingredient list that don’t actually do anything.• Korres Yoghurt Cleanser: Nice, but formulated more for oily skin types as it is a foaming cleanser. I tolerated it well for a few weeks but slowly my skin became dry.•Tatcha The Rice Wash: Very luxurious and elegant, almost like an oil cleanser. Gentle on my skin and cleans very well. This is a HG of mine, second only to this Hyper! cleanser.•many others that i’m probably forgetting because they weren’t special Really really good
