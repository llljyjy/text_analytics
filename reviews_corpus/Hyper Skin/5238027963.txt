This is probably the best cleanser I have used probably ever. Very often I switch cleansers and never finish them until I this one. I have used it for couple weeks day and night. The gel texture is beautiful with a very faint scent of citrus. It cleanses well and removes makeup. My dry skin feels hydrated and plump. It leaves skin feeling super soft and I have noticed brighter skin overall. I just love this one so much and recommend this 1000%. Definitely excited to finish the bottle. I will be buying a back up if this just to have because I know I can not go a day without it. Loveeee this cleanser!
