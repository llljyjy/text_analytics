Gifted by Hyper Skin! Honestly, usually Iâ€™m not the one to talk about the overall experience when it comes to the packaging/colors of the product or anything of that sort, but I will say this apart from actually being a fairly effective treatment, (I just wish it smelled a little bit better) this product just feels really playful and very fun to use! I love the colors of the packaging and the overall design of the bottle! nan
