I am a huge fun of face masks due having combination skin and some pigmentation. This hyper fade and glow mask is a great option for my skin concerns. After using two times in a week a got big difference on my face pigmented areas and it gives a unique glow to my skin. Also I saw my dark spots from acne I had long time ago are getting fade. I found this mask a great one and I decided to buy this once I run out of this tube. Highly recommend this Obsessed with this face mask
