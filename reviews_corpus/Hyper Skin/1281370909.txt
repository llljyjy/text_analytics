What nonsense! I used it long enough to know for sure it doesn’t do a darn thing, which is also long enough to know that I can’t return it. The positives are no noxious odor and it’s not sticky, but zero results. I have a sun spot and some post breakout pigmentation that did not care about this goo! In the photos, I think those customers would’ve had the same results just from the passing of time and skin naturally healing. I’d think a sun spot is a better test because it’s likely to change on its own without intervention. Don’t buy this product. Hyper Pass!
