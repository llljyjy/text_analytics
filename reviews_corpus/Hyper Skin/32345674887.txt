I have never written any reviews but this serum made my pores look larger and my skin looked dull. This serum did not work for me and this could be my skin only. I didn’t notice any difference in my hyperpigmentation. I’m sorry but this serum is not just it. Plus like 5 days after this serum oxidized really bad on me like it turned dark brown so I had to return it. no
