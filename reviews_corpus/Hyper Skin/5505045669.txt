I am really enjoying this face wash. It has a unique jelly texture that feels moisturizing on my skin.  It says to let it set for like 30 seconds before washing off. I didnâ€™t actually read that before the first time I used it but I did it anyway because of the ingredients and the fact that it is supposed to help fade dark spots. I liked how it felt and do think with continued use it will be effective for me and my skin issues. Jelly texture, like a wash and a mask
