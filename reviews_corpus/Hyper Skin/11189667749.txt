Love the ingredients in this mask, it has mandelic acid, niacinamide and glycolic acid so I knew instantly this would be great for my uneven skin tone. It goes on nicely, I didnâ€™t feeling any stinging and my skin looked brighter right after my first use. I need to continue using for about 30 days to see a noticeable difference in my darks spots but so far I have high hopes that this mask will help me. Gifted by Hyper Skin nan
