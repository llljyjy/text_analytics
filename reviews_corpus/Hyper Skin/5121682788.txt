This mask is good especially if you have acne prone skin. I really like the texture and the fact that it has mandelic acid but doesnâ€™t irritate or sting my skin. I used it both on my entire face and as a spot treatment on some breakouts I had on my chin and they seem to be healing a lot faster. Also my skin is soft and a little brighter after the first use. Will continue to use to see if the spots fade. Gifted by Hyper Skin. Good for acne prone
