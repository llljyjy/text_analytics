I don’t see any brightning, and my skin is very light and clear so I would easily notice. I don’t notice any hydration either. The only thing I can say is it does dry quite dry so perphaps if you used it as a foundation primer it would have a purpose. I don’t wear foundation so I can’t say if it works in that function. Given its ingredients I’m surprised it doesn’t atleast hydrate a bit. My skin is normal, not dry or oliy so I feel I am able to judge the lack of hydration well. Serves no purpose.
