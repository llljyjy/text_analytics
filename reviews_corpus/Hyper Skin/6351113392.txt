This is my first time trying this brand and I really like this cleansing product so far - Descent is really lemony and refreshing, reminding me of the vitamin C in this cleanser. Iâ€™d like the way you feel so far am I dry skin and I hope to see how it helps lighten up any hyperpigmentation or scars over the next few weeks as I use it more consistently. Smells so good!
