Hyper Skin’s Even Fade and Glow AHA Mask is a keeper! It’s a bright, unique color and my face tolerated the mask very well. I have hyperpigmentation on my face and neck from acne. With age, I’ve developed large pores on my cheeks and really bummed out about it. It resembles an orange peel. I’m always on the look out for products that are innovative and even more so ones that are clean and natural. The mask is vegan, cruelty-free and contains mandelic acid to help fade dark spots instead of hydroquinone, which is a chemical that’s been frowned upon. I wanted to use this mask for several weeks before posting my review to make sure the mask did what it promised...and it delivered! My dark spots noticeably have faded and I expect them to fade more with contained use. The texture of my skin is visably smoother, even and brighter. I also think the mask’s addition of niacinamide, glycolic and salicylic acid played a part in that as well. YES!!!
