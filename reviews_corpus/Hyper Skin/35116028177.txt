I changed my Youth to the people vit c serum for this one and couldn’t find a difference. Maybe it’s because I was already using vit c serum, but was disappointed. Also, my skin wouldn’t absorbe moisturizer well after using it, I had white thick pieces of moisturizer over my face, and I didn’t had this problem with other serums. I will continue using it until finished but won’t buy again. disappointed
