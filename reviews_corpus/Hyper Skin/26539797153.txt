Currently using the Gentle Brightening Gel cleanser from Hyper Skin. I love the texture of the gel and the fact that it’s foamy, I prefer cleansers that foam. I also like that it’s fragrance free. So far I haven’t noticed a big change regarding dark spots or uneven skin tone, but it’s too early for that. nan
