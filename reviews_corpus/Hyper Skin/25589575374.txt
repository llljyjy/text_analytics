Love it! This was my first time trying a face mask with AHA and I’m very impressed with the results! My skin is truly GLOWING!I have oily skin with a bit of acne and clogged pores, so ingredients that help evening out the texture is something I always look for skincare products. This mask was super easy to use, no discomfort after application and my skin looked a lot brighter and healthier even after the first use. I noticed that the texture started to improve after a few uses and I hope it will get even better after 1-2 months of using this mask. The packaging and branding of this brand is outstanding too, which makes the product even more appealing. I’ll definitely repurchase!It was gifted to me by Hyper Skin in exchange for my honest review. Great mask!
