Gifted by Hyper Skin. This works really well, really fast! I am so glad I patch tested it on the back of my hand before using it on my face, because of how strong this seems to be (at least for my dry sensitive skin).

It does sting a bit around my nose, but most exfoliating masks do that. Strong chemical exfoliant mask
