I’m enjoying this face wash so far! I’m stunned that it has no added fragrance, because it smells so nice - it has a fruity scent to it. This seems to work well on my combo skin - not too drying, but also not smothering or making my skin feel heavy. I like the gentle exfoliation that keeps my skin smooth and bright, but it doesn’t make my skin tingle or burn. nan
