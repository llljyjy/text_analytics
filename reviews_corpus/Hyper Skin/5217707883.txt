This is a lovely gel cleanser. It leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed without that drying after effect. It removes most of my makeup and the best thing is that it doesn’t irritate my eyes. About the brightening effect, I haven’t use this long enough to notice the difference but my skin stays clear and does looks smoother.  A little of this product goes a long way. Gentle on my skin
