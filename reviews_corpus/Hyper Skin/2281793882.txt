This product was gifted by Hyper Skin for review purposes. I saw an immediate overall brightening effect, however I didn’t see fading of any dark spots. I’m a little disappointed because I wanted this to help with dark spots. I will say that it is quite drying, so it is crucial to apply moisturizer after using this mask. If you have dry skin, I wouldn’t recommend this as it would probably feel really uncomfortable on the skin. My pump also didn’t work, so it was really inconvenient trying to squeeze the product out of the packaging. Overall, if you’re looking for an overall brightening effect, this might work for you. If you’re looking for something to specifically lighten dark spots, I haven’t found any luck with this product. nan
