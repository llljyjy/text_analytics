I bought this brand-new product and was shocked when I saw that my eyes looked brighter and rested and de-puffed after 20 minutes, and lasted into the next day. They also woke me up; my eyes literally felt more open. However, they are kind of cold-hot; I invited my daughter to use them too and she couldnâ€™t keep them on a minute because they were so uncomfortable. But this is a holy grail product for me. I only wish I knew how often I could use them. Holy grail eye-opener
