I have all three of them, one in my car, one in my purse/backpack, one on my vanity. i hardly have product faves but this one is it. i have chronically chapped lips so im serious about hydration and this does its job like rent is due tomorrow. it feels much less like a gloss and more like a lip oil, hydrating and shiny but not sticky. it doesnt have plumping effects in the description but people always ask me if i did something to make them look bigger, and always comment on how nourished they look. my dad forgot his chapstick (yes, like...og chapstick) and asked to use mine and gave a bewildered look when I pulled this out. then he asked me where I bought it so he can get one for himself! looool even my dad loves it
