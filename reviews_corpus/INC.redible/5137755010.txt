Great, fun product! It’s blue and has a shimmer, which is cute, and doesn’t leave any glitter on your skin. The container has plastic tweezers inside to pull apart individual masks, which is convenient. It sticks on easily, and stays put so you can do other things without it sliding off. I like to keep certain products refrigerated so it’s cool to the touch, and this product is definitely cooling! After putting this on, it feels very cool/slightly tingly the whole 20/30 minutes you have it on. It has the same feeling as if it came straight from the fridge the entire time. I gave it 4 stars because the feeling may be a little intense for some people, but it’s definitely a personal preference. I loved it, and it did not hurt/burn or feel overpowering. It would definitely wake you up in the morning. Overall, a cute and fun product that feels relaxing for an amazing price of $1 per pair! Cool and Affordable
