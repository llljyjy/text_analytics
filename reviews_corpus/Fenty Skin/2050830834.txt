Honestly, I’m not a skin care buff but I’ve tried my share of moisturizers and this is the one! I always go back to it. It leaves my face hydrated and leaves my makeup flawless with my foundation (and I use basic drugstore foundation). I don’t find the scent too strong, it’s the perfect mixture for me, and a little goes a long way. Keeps me coming back!
