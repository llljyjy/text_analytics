RiRi knocked it out of the park, again. This lip oil is so shiny, a very subtle pink color, and keeps your lips moisturized all day. I love it both on its own, and as a glossy topper-- especially on top of her hydrating lip tint once the glossy sheen fades. This product packs a ton of shine and a little goes a long way, so I can see this lasting a long time. Plus, the hydrating feeling lasts a long time during the day too. This didnâ€™t feel oily, so much as a very hydrating and thick gloss. Which I appreciate! Thank you Bzzagent and Fenty Beauty for sending me this to try and review! I would definitely recommend it! CHERRY ON TOP
