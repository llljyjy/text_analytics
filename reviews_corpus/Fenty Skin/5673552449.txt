Received this as a sample and im going to purchase the full sized bottle. I have oily dehydrated skin and this makes my makeup apply so beautifully and it doesnt not make me oily. I was hesitant at first because I dont ever like teying any celebrities skin care lines because to me i figure its all about them making a coin rather than selling out a good product that WILL help. I read so many reviews on this, mainly bad and which is why i was also iffy . But its been day 3 of me using and so far its been great! dehydrated/oily skin approved!
