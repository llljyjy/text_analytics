I’m a 25 year old male. I sample a lot of different skin care brands and products and I always give an honest review about what I think. I received this Fenty Skin product as a sample product as well, and this time is no different.Overview: This isn’t the first Fenty Skin product I’ve tried and it won’t be the last. Everything I’ve tried from Fenty is high-quality and worth every penny in my opinion. I exercise a lot and I live in Texas where it’s incredibly hot, and all that sweating and heat tends to dry up my skin. I’ve tried many moisturizers, but this one is different, as it’s not a moisturizer, it’s a toner that hydrates. I was skeptical when I first poured it into my hand, as it felt heavy and gooey, but boy when it touched my face I instantly knew it was a game changer. I’ve been using it for about a week and half now and my girlfriend has already complimented me on how good my face looks. This product helps your face recover from dry skin and keeps it moisturized/hydrated, all while evening out your skin tone.PROS:- The only product I’ve used that helps with my dry skin, WHILE also not feeling gross when sweating during workout or Texas heat- Evens out skin and reduces look of pours.- Hydration titan.- The bottle design. I like the twist head piece, as pumps tend to be harder to travel with and are more likely to leak.- Good for any time. I usually use Kiehls for nighttime moisturizer, but I’m going to start alternating with Kiehl’s and this from now on. It’s definitely my go-to now for daytime after my morning shower. I also tend to put some on mid-day.- Smells great.- It’s not runny, so you’re less likely to have it drip off your hand when you pour it into it.- One of those products where you know it’s good right when it hits your skinCONS:- Although I like the bottle design, the fat water looks exactly how it sounds. It looks like fatty water. Was a little grossed out the first time I saw it NGL. Another Staple Product By Fenty.
