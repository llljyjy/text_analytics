I received this in my Buzz Campaign and this is amazing. 1. It left my lips so hydrated and soft. 2. It doesn’t change the color of your natural lip. (Often times when it’s a “clear” or “neautral” lip balm it can leave an almost white or pale pink cast on melanated lips. 3. The design of this is genio us!! You do not waste any product at all. For some the hygiene aspect might be a problem but I normally only use this for when I get out to the shower and my hands are always clean. I would suggest using this ONLY after your nightly shower. Clean hands, and lip sleeping mask. Amazing.
