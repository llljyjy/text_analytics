I received this product through a free sample product & I was already excited b/c I love the Fenty brand in general. I was blown away at how moisturized this product left my skin feeling throughout the entire day. I was so excited after just one use that I told my sister to try it. My face is soft to a touch and super moistures at the end of the day. It holds its bounce. I genuinely love this product and will continue to use it. Itâ€™s super light weight but does exactly what it says it does. Def worth a try! New Addition To My Routine
