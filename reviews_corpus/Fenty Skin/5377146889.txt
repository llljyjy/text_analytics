It is thick, very moisturising and not sticky at all. I first used it right before bed, I woke up and it was still on my lips. I am someone who always has lip balm with them and uses it multiple times a day. This oil is so amazing and that didnâ€™t touch my regular lip balm until noon. I will be stocking up as soon as it is available The Best!
