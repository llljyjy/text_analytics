This is such a great face mask. I’ve never tried anything by Fenty before and I am shocked at how much I really enjoyed it it. It makes my skin feel exfoliated and smooth. I don’t think it has much of a scent and I like that it is a nice and light clay mask. It also contains salicylic acid which help to prevent breakouts. I’m excited to use this product on a regular basis and I hope to see results from it. Love this clay face mask
