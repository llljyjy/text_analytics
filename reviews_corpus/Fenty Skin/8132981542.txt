After trying multiple sunscreens, including Supergoop, which I so dearly wanted to love but unfortunately ended up with massive breakouts, I was starting to feel a bit discouraged with SPF. I decided to try this one as it is oil-free. For reference, I have normal to combination skin and am somewhat acne-prone. I’ve been using this for two weeks, and haven’t had any issues with breakouts yet! It hasn’t pilled or created a white cast, which is great. The only downsides so far have been the fact that although it is a moisturizer, it can be a bit on the dewier side, so much that my makeup (Glossier skin tint, elf concealer, Urban Decay setting spray) seem to be more prone to transferring, so keep that in mind. The fragrance is a mix of floral and sunscreen, which doesn’t bother me, but could possibly irritate or annoy some. Overall though, very happy! Amazing, but...
