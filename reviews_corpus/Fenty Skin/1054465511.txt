I have tried literally dozens of different sunscreens and this is the only one that I can stand to wear. I HATE the feel of sunscreen on my skin. It feels sticky, sweaty, and thick, and it always breaks me out. This sunscreen is a game changer for me. It feels just like a light moisturizer and actually sinks into my skin rather than sitting on top. I have sensitive combo skin with a dry forehead and greasy nose, and neither the fragrance nor the coloring have caused any reactions - no breakouts, no sensitivity, nothing but protected skin. I was hesitant to use skincare from a celebrity, but I am so pleased with the quality of this product! Worn every day for a month and will repurchase when I run out. Best sunscreen I've tried!
