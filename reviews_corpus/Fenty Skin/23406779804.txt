At first I really liked this product. Loved the smell, the texture, the applicator and consistency. However, it doesn’t do what it claims to. I have dry spots in the corner of my lips that I have been trying to get rid of. My actual lips do feel just a tiny bit softer BUT I have been using this daily applying 2-3 times a day and at night with no relief for my issue. So, with that being said I’m not really sure how hydrating or conditioning this is. I feel if it was the dry corners of my mouth would not still be there with no significant change. And no, it’s not a cold sore on my mouth it’s just dryness at the corners . I do like it , just doesn’t moisturize. nan
