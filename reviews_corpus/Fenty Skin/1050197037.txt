Where has this been?!  I have very dry Midwest skin that has to adapt seasonally to all the changes.  This has saved me.  I only use it at night.  The scent is super light and not overpowering.  My skin drinks this stuff up and when I wake up in the morning my skin is still very hydrated and moisturized.  Just a shake and a drop or two go a long way with this one.  I can say there is definitely a reason this essence sells out so often!  Grab it while you can! Hydration Blessing
