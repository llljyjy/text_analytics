Just started using this a few days ago. I am a licensed Esthetician and this is an absolute must have for dry skin. I like to cleanse my face then immediately massage this into my skin with my fingers! Then apply your favorite  SPF/moisturizer afterward. This keeps my skin moisturized all day! It also smells like Green Tea which I love! An Estheticianâ€™s new must have.
