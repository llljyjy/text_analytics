I have super dry + sensitive skin that hormonal acne prone. This is the only salicylic acid product I’ve ever used that doesn’t dry out my skin. The texture is so fun. You can feel it dry but when you wash it off your face doesn’t feel stripped or dry at all. Fantastic. Definitely purges stuff out of there! definitely buy it
