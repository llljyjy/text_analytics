I received the Fenty Skin Cocoa Cleans’r as part of a free sample program. I love most things Fenty and was pretty excited to try.Getting right into it, the cleansing bar is generously sized at 5oz, about a handful. First impression is minimalist but cute. I love all things cocoa and coconut but the strong scent of this bar makes me realize I like NATURAL smells, not the fragrance versions of those smells like this. I will say, after using the bar, the strong fragrance smell did decrease and it leaves a faint hint of the scent after bathing.The bar lathers up quickly and richly. If you love a bubbly, creamy lather, this will satisfy that desire pretty quickly. I left the bar uncovered in the shower for a couple of weeks and can say that it has not melted quickly. This bar could last you a while.I did not notice any particular changes to my skin after using for 3 weeks. I was neither dryer nor more moisturized after using. It seems to be a pleasant but pretty basic soap bar. I think this is a good intro to higher end, artisanal soap bars from smaller businesses.Overrall, I like it ok. I don’t love the strong fragrance but I do love the lather. Not sure that I would recommend for anyone with fragrance or skin sensitivities. A fun addition to your skincare but not a staple. A fun addition, not a staple
