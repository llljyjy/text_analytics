I’ve used this bar for around two weeks and its pretty good. It smells great but leaves my skin with a squeaky feeling that leads to it being super dry. My skin is very soft after it though, but I’m not sure if thats just because it very dry. I did receive this through a free sample program, so I probably wouldn’t buy it again. Drying but soft
