I use salicylic acid multiple times a day (cleanser, serum and spot treatment), so my skin can definitely handle it. After the first time I used this mask, I noticed some dry flaky patches on my face the next morning. I applied my regular products and it was gone the next day.  Later that day, I applied the mask. That night, I had dry flaky patches of skin on my face again. The product description says it’s non-drying,  but each time I’ve used it, the same thing has happened. My skin isn’t any clearer to make make the dryness worthwhile. I’ve experienced new breakouts along my jawline since I started using this!  I will say that I appreciate it being fragrance free -- I’m not sensitive to fragrance but I know some people are! I also really like the texture. It reminds me of a cloud, or some kind of super soft foam. Disappointed...
