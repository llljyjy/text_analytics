I received this product as part of a free sample program. From unboxing and smelling the bar it has a light coca scent. It lathers extremely well and left my skin feeling very clean and soft. The scent didn’t transfer from the bar to my skin well as I could no longer smell it after getting out of the shower which was disappointing since I enjoyed the fragrance. Overall I think it’s a good cleanser. nan
