i received this product as a part of a free sample program. i loved it so much! it’s a more hydrating and moisturizing toner than other toners i’ve tried, which is something i like. this would be a great toner to use when my skin needs a break from actives. i also love that its ingredients are clean!! the toner also smells incredible, like cloves and vanilla. i would repurchase this product and recommend it to friends!! nan
