I’m not even exaggerating when I say this is THE BEST lip mask i’ve tried (and trust me, i’ve tried a LOT). Most other lip masks leave my lips still feeling dry & in need of more moisture once it wears off. This lip mask makes my lips feel SO moisturized all day and night. It is a literal pillow on your lips. It has a light scent that I personally love and it feels thick and hydrating. I love that it has Vitamin E as well as amazing oils that truly repair the lips. It makes my lips soft, plump, and reduces cracks and lines. I LOVE love love this lip mask I can’t live without it now that i’ve tried it! THE BEST Lip Mask i've ever tried!
