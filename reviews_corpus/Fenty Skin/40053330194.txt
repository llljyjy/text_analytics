I’ve been using this for almost 2 weeks now and I’ve seen such a beautiful new difference that I haven’t seen in past products that have AHA’s. It’s great how it makes my skin GLOW and my mother who has been buying it for me has noticed. Don’t judge by the small bottle, if I can say that because IT PACKS A GOOD PUNCH (it’s a GREAT DEAL). I didn’t judge but I had the normal thought but thought good things and good things came. I’m so happy to still have this product. It does brighten my skin and makes it softer instantly. I use it Thursday/Friday this week and last week Friday/Saturday for the first time and it was great. My skin’s complexion has improved (it has gotten brighter and clearer) and I feel like my childhood skin is coming back but greater as an adult. It’s more beautiful and I’m getting REALLY NOTICED by everyone in the streets and busy places!!! My mother and grandmother are investing in you Rihanna until I start work soon (after a long period of no work sadly) and this has definitely helped my skin. I still have an oily skin problem but it is working out and I’m working hard on my skin routine, let alone my health overall on a daily basis as I deal with stuff beyond acne. Thank you so much!!!
