This is a real discovery. Beautiful small skin care product, affordable.The starter kit is worth the money and I will renew the cleanser soon. The fat water is surprisingly easy to use and make my skin just hydrated right. The gel-creme is interesting as it contains FPS 30 , non-greasy and hydrating at once , even dry skin. LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEE this product. Became an instant fan! nan
