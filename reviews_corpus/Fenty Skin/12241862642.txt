This mask was very surprising to me, in a good way. At first I was a little afraid to try it because I have sensitive skin, but it actually worked very well with my skin. It left my skin feeling refreshed, smooth, and clean. I even noticed a difference of my skin not being as oily, which was a big plus for me.This mask has 4 main ingredients in it: Kaolin Clay, which helps with impurities and extracting dirt and oil. Charcoal, which are the black balls that look like cookie crumbs, helps detoxify and absorbs oils. Rhubarb and Ginger Extract, helps soothe, calm, and condition irritated skin. Last, is salicylic acid (BHA) which helps clarify the skin.The price is $32.00 and has 2.5 oz of product, which is very affordable and a great price with how much product comes in it. I will definitely be purchasing this mask when I run out. Great mask for all skin types + sensitive skin.
