I’ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and it’s truly done wonders. My cheeks were covered in dark marks from old breakouts and now they’re so much lighter! I used to think they would never go away. On top of that, the texture is silky smooth. It glides over your skin and leaves your face feeling very supple. I will say, the pump is something I had to get used to. You have to press down on the top, like a button. You’ll get used to it after the first few tries. Also, you don’t have to press much: a little goes a long way! nan
