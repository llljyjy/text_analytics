for $14, i think you can find the same stuff at the drug store. this product is really nice just not worth the price. it has a nice light cocoa butter scent that doesn’t really last on the skin once you’re out of the shower. it lathers decently and leaves the skin feeling really nice and clean. i do like this just don’t think it’s truly worth the price. save your money
