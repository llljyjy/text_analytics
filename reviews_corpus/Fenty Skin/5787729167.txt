I used as tested for about two weeks both a few times on wet and dry skin. After two applications I did notice smoother skin texture and slight lightning of acne spots only on newer healed ones. As for pores, i noticed no changes to my pores they did not reduce in size or any cleaner look. The charcoal bits will remain whole if not squished and blended with the rest of the mask prior to the mask drying. I would recommend this more for someone that needs only slight pore cleansing. Great for sensitive skin
