This product is great. It has changed my skin. I’ve been using it twice a week for the last 4 weeks. It’s taken bumps off my face that I thought were just going to be there forever. It has reduced the size of some of my milia also and hopefully will clear them. Doesn’t have the best scent. But I didn’t think it was as bad as others are saying. I also use other products (serums and such) afterwards. So again, I didn’t see that the smell lingered like some said either. I’d recommend it and also tell people to use it twice a week to see the best results! Skin Changing
