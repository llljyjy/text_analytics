Disclaimer: I received this product as a free sample, but I will be 100% honest in my review!I would actually give this 4.5 stars, but I liked it! For whatever reason, I thought this was a facial cleanser and I was so confused when I received it. It’s big! And heavy! But I quickly learned it was an all over cleanser (hence the name, lol). The smell is very sweet but it’s not very strong. This really reminded me of African Black Soap so I would say it’s Rih’s take on it, which I appreciate. It’s very nice and I love the way it smells! It doesn’t take much to lather at all. I actually used this after a plane ride and traveling from NYC (as I usually feel icky and gross after traveling, especially from busy airports and cities), and I immediately felt so refreshed after the first wash. I genuinely love this. I would have never thought to use this either and it’s quickly become my favorite! nan
