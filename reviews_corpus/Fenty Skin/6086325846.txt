I used this product for over a week twice a day before reviewing. I would also add that I am a huge skincare nerd and have just learned so much about ingredients. The one question I have about this product is the percentage of vitamin c - it is ascorbic acid which is a strong version but at what efficacy? I do love that from the second ingredient on we have lovely things for the skin like aloe! The packaging is refreshing for a 30ml serum - typically these are found in dropper bottles but you can never get every last drop. I like that itâ€™s also refillable. My really only qualm is the price. For this price I want to know exact percentages of the vitamin c and niacinamide! I will say after a week of usage my skin is glowing and so soft! Glowy soft skin but needs more details for price!
