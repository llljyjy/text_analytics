Gifted by brand The first thing I really like from this mask is - its non drying mask rather than other masks which dry a-lot. The charcoal particles get dissolve as you apply on face. I like to apply twice a week for 15minutes. It really soothe my face and make it smooth and soft. Plus thing it doesn’t dry my face and it’s fragrance free. nan
