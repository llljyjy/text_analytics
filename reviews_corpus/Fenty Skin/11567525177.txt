I received this product and exchange for an honest review. I really do like this cream for my eyes. It is so nice and soft on the skin. I didn’t necessarily notice anything at first. I have dark circles under my eyes and this is due to my night job. It wasn’t a quick change, but I did see how it lightened my skin was. It’s very subtle. I am very happy with this product. I have been using it every day and it really is refreshing. It leaves my skin so hydrated. Love the feel!
