This is a quality product. Been using for 2 weeks and can see a noticeable difference in my skin - softness and tone are improved. Definitely don’t use more than twice per week. It’s small for a reason. A little goes a very long way. Only draw, it smells like perm like everyone is saying. However, it doesn’t linger and didn’t bother me that much. it’s worth it so far
