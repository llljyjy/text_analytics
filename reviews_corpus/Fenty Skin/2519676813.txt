This stuff is great! I received a bottle as a part of a free sample program, and I was blown away by this. It smells lovely, and it truly has made such a difference on my skin. It doesn’t leave me feeling too “wet“ or greasy for the day. It goes on nicely and doesn’t seem to melt to the Florida humidity I unfortunately live in. I love this stuff! nan
