Ok, I was super excited to find a vegan friendly light-weight, oil free daily face cream with SPF 30. If you filter through “clean at Sephora“ for face moisturizer with SPF 30 and oil free, there are only 2 options (last time I checked). What I like about this product is that you can buy refills, it’s oil free, cruelty free and invisible. Two things I don’t like: 1 - it’s scented. The scent is nice, but fragrance is known to be a skin irritant, is unnecessary and I personally found it to be a negative/bothered my skin. 2 - it has a sticky finish. I found myself rinsing my hands after applying. If this product was fragrance free it would be 5 stars! nan
