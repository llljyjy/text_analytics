I’m about to purchase my third tube! I’m in love, the consistency is like a thick gel with a very light scent. It’s great if you have oily skin and does a good job at removing makeup. My only issue is the packaging I wish it was a regular squeeze tube instead of the twisty bottom..does get harder to squeeze product when there isn’t much left anymore. ITS A GOOD CLEANSER
