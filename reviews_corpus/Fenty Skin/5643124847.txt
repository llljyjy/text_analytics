I received this product as part of a free sample program and after using it for a couple of weeks I can say that it is a great soap. It smells really good and lathers nicely on the skin, I have been using it with a loofah and that helps me exfoliate. It has also helped me with my back acne. I plan on purchasing it after I run out but it is a huge bar of soap so it will last for a long time. The only thing I don’t really enjoy is that it leaves me with a “squeaky clean“ feeling, however, that goes away easily after applying lotion. Great product!
