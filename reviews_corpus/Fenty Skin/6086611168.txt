I really enjoyed this project. I typically go for heavier clay masks, but this was a nice change. It is light and airy and went on with ease. It felt like it calmed my skin. I definitely feel like it helped with shine. The fragrance is very subtle which was nice, especially for those who donâ€™t like overpowering scents. Overall, great product and I will definitely use again! Light and Airy!
