After using this product, my skin did become more balanced. It’s really lightweight similar to emulsion so it was easy for me to apply. It did have a very light fragrance I liked. However it didn’t really help with my dark spots and how it was designed made it hard for me to control the amount of serum pumped out. Overall great for balancing my skin tone but it didn’t really help with dark spots. Hair tied is when I first used it and after trying it out for a week is when my hair is out. Lightweight and made my skin tone balanced
