I was so excited to try this product because I really liked the whole cookies and cream idea. I would say it lives up to its name of being a detox mask because it has salicylic acid in the ingredients which helps clean out pores. I really liked this in the form of a mask because salicylic acid toners and serums that are left on the face can be really harsh on sensitive skin but I found this to be gentle since you wash it off after 10 minutes. However, I would only use this once a week and if your skin can tolerate more, increase to the 2-3 times a week. One con is that it doesnâ€™t list the percentage of salicylic acid. As someone with sensitive skin, I would appreciate having access to that information so I know how often I can use the product and gauge how long to leave it on for nan
