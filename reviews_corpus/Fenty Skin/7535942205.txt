I love this toner serum. I was hesitant to purchase it because I’ve tried Rihanna‘s cleanser and sunscreen and they didn’t work out. I broke out because the sunscreen was heavily scented and the cleanser just never made my skin feel clean. This is a different story, pores are snatched and my dark spots are fading so quickly. It has a mild scent that smells like warm vanilla to me, but not even close to being overbearing. I’m so happy I decided to give RiRi one more try. I remember seeing that this isn’t the best for dry/dehydrated skin, but pairing this with my favorite moisturizer my skin feels so balanced. you need this!
