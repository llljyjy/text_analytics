I know we all want Rihanna to drop new music, but I’m going to need her to continue dropping skin care products! My friend purchased this mask for me because I really wanted it and I am in love! It feels like mousse/clouds when touching and applying it to my face. I really like the concept of the beads working into your skin. It didn’t dry my face out like most clay masks do. Rihanna really knows what she’s doing. I’ll definitely purchased again once it runs out. Keep the skincare products coming Rihanna!
