I received a sample of Fenty Skin, cookies and clean from Bzzagent, in exchange of my honest review, so here you have it.I bit about myself, Iâ€™m a girl with a maturing skin, and although I have very feel breakouts, I do have a combination skin (oily and dry).This facial detox has a pudding consistency, it has no fragrance and spreads easily and dries fast. As you apply it, all the charcoal beads pop and blend to the clay. I used it without and pre-face wash and I still had a great result. Honestly I would prefer washing my face with this clay, rather than using and other soft-soap like facial wash, just because I can tell with the tips of my finger that my face feels clean, all the oil was removed, and all that was left was I nice, smooth skin. This is facial detox is worth your money! This is facial detox is worth your money!
