I received this product as a free sample from BzzAgent 🐝. I’ve used this for about two weeks now and it has definitely showed results. I have some dark spots on my chin from acne and they’ve began to slightly fade!! My skin also seems much brighter these days. This serum also doesn’t pill up or react weird when I use my other products on top as well. The applicator is also nice and easy to use. I also love the packaging, looks so sleek and modern. I actually really enjoyed this product and have been loving the results. Surprised 😮
