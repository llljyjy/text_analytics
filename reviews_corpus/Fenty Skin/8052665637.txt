I received this product as part of a free sample program, but I tried this for a few weeks before reviewing. I’ve been using this product twice a week after cleansing my face. My skin has started to oil more smooth and have a glow. One thing I don’t like is the smell, the product smells chemically and thick. I’ve used different AHA products and they do not smell like that. But with that being said, the smell isn’t that overwhelming and I’ll probably continue to use this product. Great product, weird smell
