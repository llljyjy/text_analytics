I like using this product at night and it has helped my skin to an extent in feeling better. Cute and eye-catching packaging. Overall, I enjoy this product. One less star because I am yet to be convinced 100% it does what it claims and I expected the product to smell a little like Cookies Nâ€™ Cream but the no scent is okay too. Adorable & Fun!
