I have combination skin with some texture. This smells good & absorbs quickly in the skin. Like another comment mentioned it feels good but doesn’t do much, and I agree. It didn’t make me break out or anything but I don’t notice a difference in my skin as far as brightening goes but it does help with my oil. It’s been over a month. I probably won’t repurchase once I use it all. nan
