Honestly it just feels like regular soap the only difference is the smell  and that it feels smooth on the skin . But it made my skin feel itchy . I wasn’t a big fan of this product .  Received this product as a part of a free sample program. I prefer the soap I usually use because it makes my skin feel smooth without leaving a soapy and itchy feeling . The only benefit of having this product is the scent / smell . I wouldn’t buy this product . I have sensitive skin and I dislike the soapy feel it leaves after using the product. Definitely wouldn’t recommend this product at all . The soap looks pretty and is aesthetic but it definitely isn’t a must have product. Nope
