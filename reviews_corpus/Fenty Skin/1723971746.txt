Love this!  Rihanna hit it out of the park with this soap. It smells amazing, natural but not overpowering or overly sweet. Makes your skin feel so soft and moisturized. it is also so great that you can use this on your face and body so great for travel. I love the soap dish too - such a smart and innovative design. I left off one star because the soap dish is kind of expensive. But now that I think about it, now that I have it, I will use it over and over so probably worth it in the end.  Thanks Rihanna! Love Love!
