It works on my combo skin. Yes it is shiny, so you’ll need to use a little powder on the T-zone. The purple color reflects the light and blurs discoloration a little bit. It smells like a cherry candy. The only thing that bothers me is the packaging. Good that it is refillable, but it’s still plastic and the whole product does not come out. I like to use the product till the very end ml, since I paid for it, why waste it. nan
