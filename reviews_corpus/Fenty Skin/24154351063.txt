So, I wasn’t expecting much. Another face cream, this one I bought because it had SPF and was rated high for use with makeup, so I gave it a whirl. Now let’s get started. It comes in two pieces. There are no instructions for assembly and it was a puzzle to figure out so part of the reason for one star going off is for that. The other reason for the loss of a star is because when you get to the bottom of the jar you can’t scrape it, it’s entirely too skinny and long to insert anything into. But yes, it’s nice that all you have to buy is the refill insert. So, two pumps and your face is covered, but how it’s covered! Most face moisturizers I end up with my fingers coated with a disgusting film I’m looking for a tissue to wipe off. This Fenty Skin Hydra Vizor Invisible Moisturizer goes on liquid and ends up an almost powdery finish which feels like a delight to finish and buff in. So for all the reasons to lose a stars, it’s got so many reasons to gain stars! I’ve never had a face moisturizer like this before! It’s perfect for summer! No more putting a moisturizer on and sweating through an oily layer instantly. This is really quite a change from the norm! Absolutely built for summer weather! As for being makeup friendly, I’ve never come across a moisturizer that was this makeup ready this fast after application! Usually I have to wait ten, fifteen minutes, or turn on a fan, but this product it’s almost instantaneous! All in all, if it wasn’t for those niggling things, I would have given it five stars. Truly remarkable product LOVE IT!! Head over heels!
