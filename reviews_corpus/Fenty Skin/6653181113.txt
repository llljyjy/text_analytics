My skin actually feel fresher and cleaner after using this. It gets a great lather going that smells incredible too. My skin feels soft after stepping out of the shower prepping me for lotion. I would lather a small amount in your hand first and then rub it on. This bar is def worth the buy and I will be recommending this to friends/family! Love the Smell, Can't Get Enough of It!
