Very nice! I loved this toner, as someone with dry temperamental skin, itâ€™s nice to have something pretty basic that excels at keeping my skin soft and supple! Definitely would recommend to anybody who needs an extra boost of moisture for winter. Only con for me is coconut oil in the formula because mine tends to be sensitive to that Loved it!
