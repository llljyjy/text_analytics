I love this cocoa cleansing bar! The price is  amazing because the soap is a decent  size and will last for a long time. The soap is very moisturizing and a light coco scent. Alot of people was saying it’s drying. It’s not drying, I feel that if you’re overly using the soap it can make your skin dry.  I love it even more because it’s a natural soap! Hopefully fenty skin comes out with a body oil.. this would go amazing with the soap. Just buy it
