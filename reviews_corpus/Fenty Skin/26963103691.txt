I love that the clay mask comes in a little tub container rather than a squeeze bottle. The texture is interesting but I like it! It’s kind of doughy/pudding-like. I have pretty sensitive skin that’s easily damaged and dehydrated, and this mask was not harsh on my skin at all. It’s slightly drying, but my face does feel good and fresh after using this mask! nan
