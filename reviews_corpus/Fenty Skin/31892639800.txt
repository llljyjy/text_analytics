I absolutely love this product! I happily received this for free in exchange for my honest review. I cannot think of anything negative to say about this product except I wish that the vanilla frosting-like scent was a tad more pronounced but I understand that other people do not like their skincare to be scented. The texture is thick and has a smooth application.  I apply this at bedtime and my lips feel nourished and hydrated after waking up. The packaging is clever and sleek. It’s a twist up, no waste component that allows you to use your finger with application while also keeping the product from being exposed to contaminants. Did I mention I enjoy this product? I haven’t found anything from Fenty that I have not enjoyed! Love having this in my nighttime skincare routine
