I bought this hoping to cut some steps out of my morning routine. I have oily, acne prone skin. I have been working on the texture and overall pigment for the last few years so the Niacinamide in this was a big selling factor for me. I wash my face during my shower, use a toner when I get out then I would have loved for this to be my last step. It is way too heavy for oily skin. It took forever to absorb into my skin and even when it did, it left a bit of a “sticky“ feeling to my face. I don’t wear a lot of makeup (part of the reason I am working on texture and pigment) and barely after 2 to 3 hours, my face was so shiny and not in a good way. I like the way the product smells. I like the way it is packaged and it doesn’t take very much to get coverage. I really had high hopes for this but I had a feeling with my oily skin that it would most likely not work. Little about my skin: Fair/light, 36, oily, acne-prone. I live in SW Florida now so SPF is an absolute must on the daily. With the use of SPF, Niacinamide and Retinol, my skin texture is pretty smooth and the pigment is also pretty uniform. I have one small wrinkle beginning on my forehead so I am hoping all of my skincare measure will help me keep them at bay. I gave 3 stars because I think it is a great product but it just wasn’t great for me. I really really wanted this to work for me. :(
