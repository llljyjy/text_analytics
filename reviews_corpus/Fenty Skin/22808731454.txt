Skin type: oily/acne-prone This whipped clay charcoal mask is so dreamy! After just fifteen minutes I noticed reduced excess shine, a more refined skin texture, and thorough removal of dirt and oil. It’s so creamy and I love how the charcoal requires being worked into the skin a bit, my face feels so clean and perfected after using this mask. If you’re in need of a pore detox, look no further. 10/10
