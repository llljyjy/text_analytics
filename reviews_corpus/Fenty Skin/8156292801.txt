I have been using this product for about a week now. I will say that it lathers very well and has a pleasant smell. I do feel as if it cleans the body but at the same time I notice my skin lacks moisture once fully rinsed off. But overall I do like the product and will continue to use.   “I did receive this product from a free sample program” Fenty Bar.
