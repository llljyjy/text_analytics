I received this as part of a free sample program, and I’m LOVING it. A little goes a long way so it’ll last me a long time even though I use it twice a day.It’s super thick and hydrating and it goes great over lip color or lip balms to lock everything in. It gives a glossy, smooth, non sticky finish that my boyfriend says makes my lips look “extra kissable“ lol. Highly highly recommend this lip mask! New favorite lip product!
