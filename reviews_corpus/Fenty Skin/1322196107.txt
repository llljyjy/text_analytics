I love this moisturizer and love that it has SPF.  The formulation is light and leaves my skin hydrated and glowing! I only wish there was an unscented formula.  I’ve used other Fenty products, and their scent does not seem as strong as this one.  It’s not an offensive scent, but I think sensitive skin types would do better with an unscented version.  Aside from the scent, I love the formulation and will continue to repurchase. Another win for Fenty
