For the past few days I have used this product and tested it to other products I have. The fragrance is amazing, it lathers nicely on the skin and the amount of product you receive is great for the price. The only downside to this product is it leaves my skin very drying and I have to use extra lotion on my body. I would purchase this as gifts for my friends and family during holidays, gatherings and special occasions. Iâ€™d recommend that anyone should try this and it might be your new favorite! Good product & Sweet Fragrance!
