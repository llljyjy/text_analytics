I’ve always had pretty textured skin so when I received this complimentary to try I was very excited. The product is nice, it’s easy to use, and it works well enough. I think it is a little more gentle than I was expecting but that’s not necessarily bad. I think this would work very well for someone that has less texture than I do, but for me it wasn’t quite it. Works well
