I really enjoyed this bar! It doesn’t take too much to lather up into a nice foam to use on your face or anywhere else. I use this to double cleanse after I remove makeup and my skin is always so clean and fresh! I really enjoy the scent and I love how much soap you get for the price. Overall, this was a really great item and I’m very happy with it. I also found it was really easy to store, even without a soap dish. I only wet a tiny section at a time and then stand it on its side to dry- the bar is super smooth and doesn’t even look ugly when it’s been used up a bit! nan
