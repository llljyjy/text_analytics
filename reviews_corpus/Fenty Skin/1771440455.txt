The product itself is a 10/10. Super gentle and effective cleanser at a good price point. A little goes a long way therefore the bottle lasts a long time. My only complaint is that the dispensing system is not my favourite as the bottle gets to about half full itâ€™s harder and harder to dispense from the twist top cap. Would prefer a pump top or an easier squeeze bottle as the twist cap makes it difficult to dispense. Dispenser needs work
