I recieved this product as a free sample and would like to give my honest review. I was excited to try this Fenty soap which is the first Fenty product I use and I wasnt amazed. I am used to Dove and can say that works and lathers much better on my body. This product made my skin feel weird like others Ive tried and it didnt feel moisturizing ine bit. The smell isnt the best either... I will continue using it as its not the worst product ive tried but will not buy it again. Could be better
