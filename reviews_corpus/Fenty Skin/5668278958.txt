I used to like this, but now every time I use it, it breaks me out. :( Little bumps all over and a painful bump under my lower lip right now. Always seems to give me little bumps all over my face the day after I use this. Sad. Also not sufficient for sunscreen in the daytime (use a stand-alone SPF on top of a moisturizer; itâ€™s not diluted that way). Breaks me out
