This is a nourishing, long lasting lip oil with a perfect amount of sheer tint. It has a very pleasant cherry smell which makes it even more amazing. It’s hydrating and makes my lips feel very soft without being sticky. It also has a pleasant cherry taste which I love. I’m really obsessed with this product and totally recommend it to everyone. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. Amazing!
