I read a lot of reviews with concerns and complaints of breakouts the next day after using this mask. The mask is detoxifying, and contains clay and charcoal that is meant for drawing out the skinâ€™s impurities. The breakouts is the skin purging and drawing out the impurities in the skin, which means the mask is working. Breakouts during purging usually a couple weeks before it starts to clear up. To help with the purging process follow up with a daily skin routine, start ingredients which help with barrier repair, such as ceramides and hyaluronic acid in a non-comedogenic formulation. nan
