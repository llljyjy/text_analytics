I would say that I have mixed feelings about this product, The packaging and presentation is nice. The scent inside is a bit too strong for my own personal taste. I has hoping for a bit of cherry, not a bomb of strong scent. All that aside, it applies nicely and evenly. Looks great on the lips and keeps me looking luscious for several hours. Great
