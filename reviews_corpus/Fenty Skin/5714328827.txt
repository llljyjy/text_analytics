I was recently gifted this Fenty Skin Watch Ya Tone Niacinamide Dark Spot Serum complimentary by Fenty Beauty and Bzzagent in exchange for my honest opinion. I have tried Fenty lip products before but this was my first time trying their skincare face products. I really enjoyed the packaging of the product, it felt very durable and was aesthetically pleasing. To use the product, screw off the cap and push on the bottom for product to come out of the bottle. It seems like a good product that would not leak if you bring it for travel. The serum itself has a milky white texture that did not feel tacky on the skin. It felt lightweight and my skin was nicely moisturized. I have noticed that the texture and appearance of my skin is brighter but have not noticed super visible differences in my dark spots yet since I have only been using this product for a week. The serum contains potent Niacinamide and Vitamin C to brighten all over and reduce the look of dark spots, while also evening your skin tone. There is no strong smell or fragrance to this product either. Overall, this product seems very promising and I will continue to use it. I would recommend getting this product for how clean and earth conscious it is! It makes me feel good that I am using clean natural and healthy products on my skin. Great serum for brightening and even skin tone!
