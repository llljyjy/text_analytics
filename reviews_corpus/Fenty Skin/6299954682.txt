I received this product as part of a free sample program. I was very pleasantly surprised, and am a big fan! This is a very rich and luxurious soap that lathered well and created a lovely shower experience. I liked that the cocoa smell wasnâ€™t too overpowering which can be the case with other products. It was enjoyable to use and left me feeling clean and happy. I would repurchase. nan
