Very sticky. Caked up in the corners of my mouth like little lip boogers in my mouth. Wasn’t a fan of that. Very thick feeling when you apply. I didn’t really notice any conditioning difference in my lips post wipe off but I have always had pretty hydrated lips. The smell and consistency of it reminded me of being back in the early 2000s and having the different flavored clear lip gloss tubes and trading with all my friends. Nostalgic. Sticky
