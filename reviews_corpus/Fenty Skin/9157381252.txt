With Laneige going downhill I was excited to receive this as a free sample to try and test out. In comparison it seems a lot thicker than Laneige but I don’t typically wear any other lip products so it’s very nice in the winter when they get really chapped or right before bed. Love the packaging and the texture. Love that it also has vitamin E in it! Better than Laneige
