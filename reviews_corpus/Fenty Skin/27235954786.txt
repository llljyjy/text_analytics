I really like the packaging of this product. You roll up in order to dispense the amount you need which I prefer to just reaching into a plastic jar. The product has a thick consistency and hydrates your lips. It is a great product especially for winter when the weather gets more cold + dry. Personally I think it would be even better if it had more oz of product and maybe came in a variety of scents. Amazing Hydration
