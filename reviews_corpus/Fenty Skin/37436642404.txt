I love this lip oil. It is very hydrating and stays on your lips quite well even while eating and drinking. The colors are beautiful and glossy, which really enhances the appearance of the lips. I am definitely more of a gloss gal, I never wear traditional lipstick. Iâ€™m so crazy about this product and I will most likely continue to use it. I am so happy that I have received this complimentary sample, otherwise I might not have known about this product. I honestly hope that they never stop selling this! Inlove
