As a disclaimer, I have very sensitive skin and had to go through several beauty brands to find the right products that don’t make much skin break out into hives.I used this soap for a total of 2 weeks and 6 days prior to the review so I can give a detailed review.I used the soap for both body and face and thank goodness I did because I had 2 different results.As body soap I honestly did not notice any difference between FS and other soaps I use on my body. I did not have any bad reactions but I did not experience anything life changing either (which I realize is a high expectation for soap lol).For my face however, I absolutely loved the soap. My skin was evidently clearer (and this is per the comments I get from people and from my own observation)When used with the FS exfoliator and the face moisturizer, it really does leave your skin smooth and clears up dark spots, of which I had a few from trying so many different face products and makeup. For the use of your face solely, I would recommend this 100% For body use, I’m indifferent because it’s not bad, I just didn’t see much of a difference. The picture attached  with the headphones is my face after using it for almost 3 weeks the one with the pink bonnet is the before picture A must have for your face, indifferent for body
