I have very sensitive skin but this didn’t irritate it at all! I only use it once a week to remove some of the dead skin and gunk on my face and it does wonders ! I would start off with once a week and work yourself up to twice a week! It’s a little pricey but a little does go a long way! skin so soft like butter :)
