With the fenty detox face mask I wasn’t sure what to expect. The texture is of a whipped cream consistency, with small chunks of “beads” that dissolve when you apply it. It made my skin feel very soft and clean. It left my skin glowing, and that’s saying something as I have very dry skin. But it didn’t dry my skin out at all. It didn’t feel heavy when applied on my face either. So that’s a plus. Overall I think it’s a great product 10/10!! Leaves your face feeling amazing!!
