Fun mask to try/use! I personally check amount of product i get and compare it to other products offered at Sephora and the price is just right around their other similar masks like this. It doesnâ€™t have an aroma/scent which is great for sensitive skin people however I personally was expecting a fun cookies and cream smell which would have been amazing! Overall a good clay mask but nothing special about it. It uses Kaolin clay, charcoal and salicylic acid  like 100s others on the market. The jar makes it easy to get every drop of product. I however will not be purchasing this item after it runs out. Fun mask!
