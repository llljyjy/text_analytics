It’s not bad I mean it could use some more work and after it leave my lips  feeling dry and when I wipe it off either mistakenly or on purpose I have to actually wash my lips because it feels like it’s still there while making my lips dry and feeling weird but overall it’s not bad although I don’t really get what it does for the my lips since I haven’t seen any improvement at all and I have been using it everyday but maybe it just me, it might be different for everyone since everyone is different but while wearing it it’s really shiny it feels like am basically wearing lipgloss. The bottle needs fixing because after twisting the end to the right and taking out the lip mask I wanted some more always ends up comes out even though I didn’t twist the end to make it come out, but I always throw the rest out so it’s why am saying if this keeps happening it’s going to run out pretty fast After all is said and done I think it still needs improvement like the product and the bottle the lip mask comes in but I guess people can still try it if they want. Maybe
