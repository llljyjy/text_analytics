After using a few tines, I am very happy with thus product. I don’t know if I like the applicator but the formula worked well to remove dead skin without stripping and made me very glowy. Great for when you’re about to do makeup but need to prep the skin. I received this product complementary in exchange for a review. Great for makeup prep!
