This starter kit by Fenty has enough product to give you an adequate experience. the facial cleanser does not dry my skin out, but gets it super clean and feeling smooth with no residue. I like that you can literally just tap the fat water into your skin and it absorbs nicely. The moisturizer with SPF is nice and has a very light but clean scent. Overall this set had my skin feeling renewed and clean. I look forward to purchasing the full sized products. So Amazing
