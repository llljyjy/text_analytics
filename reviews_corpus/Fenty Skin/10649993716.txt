This was my first time trying the Fenty brand before and I was mind blown. I like this mask so much as it cleans my pores. I apply it before bed and then remove it. I enjoyed being able to pop the specs to turn gray on my face. When I get done using this my face feels clean, rejuvenated, firm, and my pores look less visible. I like that in the morning my face is glowing. This is a great mask and I’d highly recommend it! I didn’t know what I was missing until I tried this product from Fenty. Can’t wait to try more. Pores are less visible
