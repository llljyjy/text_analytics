I was so surprised at how great my skin felt after the first use. For this to be a detoxifying mask, my skin didn’t have that dry and tight feeling. It felt very hydrated and soft. The best mask hands down. I’ve used it twice so far and have had no adverse reaction. Plus it’s fragrance-free. i won’t ever use another mask
