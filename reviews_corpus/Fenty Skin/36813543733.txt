Disclaimer: I did receive this product as part of a ’free sample program.’ However, I can honestly say that I absolutely LOVE the new Fenty Skin Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence Product! Included with my review are two pictures for reference - one of the presentable bottle/packaging of the toner itself and a picture of my face after the first use. The results from my first application of the product (as seen in the photo,) my pores appeared minimized, and my face had a ’dewier’/’glowing’ appearance. Therefore, I am extremely pleased with the results of this toner essence, especially compared to several other skincare brands I have used in the past, which have unfortunately been more harsh on my skin and made my cheeks slightly irritated/red unlike this amazing Fenty Skin product! I can also say that I loved the light scent of the toner essence formula, which had a green tea kind of fragrance to it. In terms of consistency, the formula felt light and airy in addition to feeling hydrating and soothing on my skin, all without leaving my skin dry, which is AMAZING! Therefore, I would definitely recommend this toner essence to my friends and family members, in addition to likely considering another purchase of this product in the future. The one negative thing about the toner is the price; however, as I do not see myself wishing to spend $32 each time I wish to buy more, as you only get about 150 ML of product which can be used up quickly, especially if you use it day and night as the product label suggests. So, in all, if the price is within your budget/you love what you read here, I 100% recommend it! Add this to Your Beauty Routine!
