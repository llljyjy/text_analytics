this essence is actually really nice and hydrating compared to ones i usually use. i feel like others i’ve used leave a weird film on my face which is never good. i’ve used this for about a week so far and my skin is hydrated and i’ve noticed a difference in my red spots/pimples. i usually get a few pimples every so often and so far this has limited them. i would totally buy this product and use it in my daily routine. i highly recommend this product to people with dry and acne prone skin. nan
