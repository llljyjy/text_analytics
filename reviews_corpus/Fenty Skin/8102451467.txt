Let’s start with all the positives, your skin feels great immediately after use. Soft skin, tightened pores, everything feels clean and overall great. But I’d have to say I’m the days you don’t use it? Your face kinda goes back to normal. My negatives are basically that, it works great on the days you use it and I’m iffy about the other days. I will say that my skin has stayed soft, and that this product does not dry out your skin even if it does help with some oil shine. nan
