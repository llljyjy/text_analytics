I purchased this product a few days ago and even tho I’ve only used it twice I must say I love it.. when u first touch it it has a bouncy touch to it it glides on your face smooth and the little beads in it dissolves into your skin and unlike other mask it doesn’t dry your skin at all and leave your face feeling rough and dry .. I must say it’s different from any mask I’ve ever bought and it doesn’t hurt it’s fragrance free. So if anyone says it leaves your skin rough and dry don’t believe it try it for yourself .♥️ nan
