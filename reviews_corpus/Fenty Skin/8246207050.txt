I received the Fenty Skin Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence with Hyaluronic Acid + Tamarind as part of a free sample program and was extremely impressed! The toner had a lightweight formula which felt very moisturizing and refreshing on my face. It did not feel sticky or greasy at all, and left my skin feeling hydrated and renewed. This is especially important for me in a toner, since I always follow always follow up with a rich moisturizer, so I enjoy toners that layer well under my other skin care products. I also loved the mild tea-like scent of the toner, which was not strong or overpowering. I look forward to continue implementing this product in my skin care routine to see future results. I would definitely purchase again and be sure to recommend to others! Absolutely love!
