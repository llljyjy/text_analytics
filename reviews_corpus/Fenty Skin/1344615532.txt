Omg this stuff is so addicting. Not only is it super glossy and incredibly hydrating but it stays on your lips for a long period of time. I have to hide this lipgloss from my daughter and her cousin because as soon as they see or hear the tube, they immediately start puckering. The smell is like candy and makes you tempted to taste it. Doesnâ€™t leave a bad taste in your mouth either if you accidentally lick it. It is so much better than all of my glosses and right now my go-to l. Cruelty free and black owned make this a serious must-buy product on top of the fact it is the bomb. Highly recommend. So glossy!
