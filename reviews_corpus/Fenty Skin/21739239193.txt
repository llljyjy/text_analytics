I really like it, for me it makes my skin look matte without the makeup, for my winter days, yes, summer, not so sure, we shall see how it goes tho. But it came in, WITHOUT A BOX, so a couple items came in damaged though. Was looking forward to the box it came in i think. And it ended up leaking, but Iâ€™m sooo glad that there was still plenty of the toner for me to use. Lose a star because it almost came super damaged. And idk if the letter F was suppose to look like that or not. it leaked
