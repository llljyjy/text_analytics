I received this product as part of a free sample program. Product left my face feeling dry and Iâ€™m not a fan of the smell. But it does lather well and the product is versatile making it very convenient for traveling. However, with how much it costs, I would not want to use it as body soap. Overall, I thought the soap was just okay, just a bar of soap, nothing special. Drying
