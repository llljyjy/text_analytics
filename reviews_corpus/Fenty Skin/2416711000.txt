I really like this mask. Itâ€™s very gentle and easy to use. The texture feels a little jello-like to me in the jar but once removed and rubbed between fingers, it easily applies onto the skin and has a cookies & cream appearance. While applied, its non-drying and I leaves  a very cool feeling. As for the results, my skin is left feeling very soft, fresh, and clear. nan
