Smells great; though I didn’t feel like it was anything ground breaking. I did feel some difference in that it left me soft right after my shower, but as my skin dried off it didn’t make a big difference. Overall good, would use again but don’t feel it’s worth the price. Also, because of the fragrance I did not use on my face. Nice
