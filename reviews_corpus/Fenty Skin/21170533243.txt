I used this product religiously for over a week. It goes on super smooth and doesn’t leave my face feeling flakey or oily. I noticed a major improvement in the dark spots on my face. Even my acne became less red and noticeable. The only thing I did not like about this product was the bottle it came in. I read later on you have to hold it upside down when pumping it but it seemed like I either got too little or too much. You also can’t see how much is left in the bottle. However the product works and it did exactly what it said it would do! Dark spots no longer
