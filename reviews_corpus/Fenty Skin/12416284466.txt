while this serum seemed to help my skin without irritating it, i think its too small an amount for the price point. I struggle with lots of cystic acne and scars so I’m always trying to reduce inflammation on my skin and heal up dark spots. i’ve tried a lot of other products similar to this and I think that wireless one is good, I’m not gonna pay $42 for it overpriced
