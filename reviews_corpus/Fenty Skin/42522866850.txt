I received this as part from a free sample program, but I’ve been more than happy with it. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and I’m seeing a huge difference in my skin. It used to be uneven with dark spots however I can really feel it coming together now. They’ve became more even and my skin is starting to look so much nicer. It also smells really great too I’m very happy. Works great!
