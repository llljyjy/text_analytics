I love this toner/serum combo. It is absolutely perfect for my oily/combination skin. It is light and non oily, yet very hydrating. Doesnâ€™t feel sticky. Glides on like thick water. It has greatly improved my skin. I have no break outs and my skin is super smooth. Definitely a must-have for my skin type. A must-have for oily/combo Skin
