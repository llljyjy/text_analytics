I received this product as part of a free sample program in exchange for my honest review. I found this toner more hydrating than other toners I’ve tried, such as pixie’s glow tonic. I’ve enjoyed using other hyaluronic acid products before and had no issues with skin irritation. I believe this product is similar to other hydrating toners in terms of cost per ounce, and I don’t think the price is unreasonable since it lasts quite a while. nan
