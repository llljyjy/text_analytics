Oh my gosh this has got to be my ultimate favourite lip product now!! It’s like the perfect formula! Super comfortable not sticky not heavy. The color, taste and scent is all beautiful and not overpowering. My lips looked so luscious and even after 3 hours my lips feel like they have a balm on and feels super moisturized!! Absolutely loving it ! I’ve tried the dior lip oil and the Laniege lip mask which was nice for a few mins but after awhile it was just meh. However this really is a cherry on top ;) Best lip oil and fenty product !!
