I’m in love with this mask! I will start off by saying I have super dry skin some days but I also have a lot of blackheads and breakouts. I was afraid this would leave my skin feeling stripped but it did not! It was easy to put on, didn’t leave me feeling like my skin was parched, and I actually noticed a difference in my pores and skin! I love the smell too. I just wish the packaging was less messy but overall this is my new favorite mask! Definitely recommend. nan
