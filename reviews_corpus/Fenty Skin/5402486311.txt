The Fenty Cookies and Cream Detox mask is amazing! First off the packaging is so simple and sleek. I love how it is beautiful to display out on my vanity. The concept and name is so cute and creative in my opinion. The mask itself is such a neat concept. It easily massages in to create a gray charcoal mask. I left it on for 15 minutes and had no issues with it making my skin feel overly tight and itchy. It pretty easily rinsed off and left my skin feeling amazing. I personally love putting on masks about 1-2 times a week. This one easily became my go to mask to grab. Iâ€™ve never tried a Fenty skincare item, but if they are like this product I will definitely be grabbing more products to try. I think that for me this was a 10/10 win. Definitely worth giving it a try if you are into detoxing face masks! Detoxifying Face Mask
