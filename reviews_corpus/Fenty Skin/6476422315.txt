Initially I was NOT a huge fan of this product. I was kind of put off that it was so fragranced and wasn’t sure that it was doing much that I couldn’t do with a few extra steps. However, I was recently traveling and forgot my favorite toner back home. I decided to grab the travel size of this and honestly came around to how convenient an all-in-one like this was, and for some reason the smell didn’t put me off as much as before. It absorbs well in the skin and feels more like a toner than a serum (it doesn’t feel very hydrating to me) but that’s exactly what I’m looking for since I layer other serums on top. For whatever reason I kind of fell in love with the simplicity of this product after a rocky start initially, and so I’ve officially stocked up on this to use, especially when I’m traveling and want to combine steps. Didn’t like it at first but came around!
