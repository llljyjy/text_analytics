Got this lip oil about a month ago and honestly I don’t love it or hate it. It is just meh... the scent is really nice, it’s not that thick of thin, it is actually perfect. The only thing with is that it doesn’t last that long and does sit just there. The whole package and presentation of the product is cute and compact but not worth the money in my opinion. If you’re like me that is always kinda licking her lips this gives a VERY greasy sensation on the tongue, it actually is bothering, but it goes away kinda fast. Wouldn’t purchase again to be honest nan
