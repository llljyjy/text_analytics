Is this a miracle product? No, it mostly just feels like plain Vaseline. BUT this lip mask has GREAT ingredients — castor oil, pomegranate extracts, and vitamin E. It’s also paraben-free, sulfate-free, alcohol-free, silicone-free, is vegan and has some UV-protection. AND it is a cruelty-free product which makes this the BEST alternative to the popular (animal tested) Laneige lip masks. Buy This, Not Laneige
