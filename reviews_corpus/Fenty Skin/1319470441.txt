Doesn’t add much color to the lips but it makes them look super glossy and juicy. Super comfortable and not sticky. The smell is not overpowering, aka you don’t really smell it once it’s on the lips. It’s yummy (more like a tart cherry popsicle/candy rather than a sweet almond cherry if that makes sense). I really like the applicator. I don’t like the bottle packaging design tho, it looks cheap. A bit pricey for what it is? But the product is good. Love
