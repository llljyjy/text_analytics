I love this lip mask so much for many different reasons! First, the packaging is so innovative and I feel like it’s a very sanitary way of dispersing the product. Secondly, I love the way this product feels on my lips. I personally have only used a few other lip masks and this one is by far my favorite. It keeps my lips super hydrated and I don’t need to keep reapplying it because the moisture actually stays for a long time. I love this! I did receive this lip mask as a part of a free sample program. I love this lip mask!
