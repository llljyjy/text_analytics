I really like this lip “oil“. I would say it has more of a thick lip gloss consistency though. It sticks nicely to my lips and coats them with a light shine. I like that it barely has a pigment, and leaves a very natural-looking pinkish color. I usually use glossier balm dot com to moisturize my lips, but I switched to using this instead and I do notice a few differences. It does not become oily and come off like balm dot com does, and it stays on for much longer. I also really love the applicator. It is wide and has a unique shape, allowing you to get the perfect amount of product on your lips. It is a good size to carry around and fits nicely into a bag. Conveniently sized. I also like the smell, it’s not too overbearing but it’s there. Also, I usually have an issue with biting/picking my lips when they are dry but this product has definitely prevented me from doing so because it keeps my lips soft and moisturized, and the sticky texture discourages me from messing with my lips. Overall, I love this lip oil! I am not sure if I would buy this product on my own because it is $24 for a little container of product. Not very price efficient, but if you like Fenty and are looking for a good lip product, I would recommend trying this. Oh also, the packaging is so cute! love this product.. more of a lip loss than an oil
