I would give this 5 stars if it weren’t for the smell. I can’t pinpoint exactly what it smells like but I am sad to say that it is definitely too strong and not for me. Usually after a few minutes of wearing a lip gloss/lipstick, I’m able to ignore whatever it may smell like but that is not the case for this lip oil. Will probably have to give to my sister. Scent is too strong for my liking
