*Disclaimer: I received this product as part of a free sample program* I love this soap! I’m a bar soap type of girl & this is a new staple in my skin care routine. It’s made with cocoa & shea butter which makes my skin super smooth. It’s also has plantain extracts which is definitely new for me but I’m loving it so far! You can apply it to your face & body as well, double win! Nice job again, Fenty! New fav!
