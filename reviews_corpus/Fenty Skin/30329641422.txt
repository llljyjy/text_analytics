I received this product in exchange for my review as part of a free sample program. This stuff is amazing! It’s super easy to use and add to my routine (twice a week recommended). I was worried after seeing some reviews saying this stuff causes their skin to be sensitive and dry but isn’t that expected when you’re putting acid on your face? Use a scent free moisturizer after. My skin has cleared up and smoothed out so much after only using this product for 3 weeks. I definitely recommend trying this product out! A must-have!
