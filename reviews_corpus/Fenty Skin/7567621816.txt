Shocked at how over hyped this is. If you’re looking for a clear LIPGLOSS for $25 then go for it. I was looking for something different and something to recover my extreme chapped lips. From reading the description I really thought this would be a lip OIL and something to recover my lips. This is just a clear sticky lipgloss and personally I hate lipglosses because I’m not 12 anymore. Also if I wanted a clear lipgloss that smelled like subtle cherries there’s no reason to be paying more than $10 for it, very small amount as well. Only positive is the Cute packaging Please pass on this.
