When I received the Fenty Skin Cherry Treat Conditioning & Strengthening Lip Oil to try out, I was a little nervous. I don’t have a lot of experience with lip oils, and I don’t really like lip gloss, as it’s usually too sticky for me. However, I really like this!! First of all, it smells incredible, like cherry pie. It does make your lips really soft with a nice sheen. I would recommend this for sure and look forward to trying other Fenty Skin products! Smells amazing!
