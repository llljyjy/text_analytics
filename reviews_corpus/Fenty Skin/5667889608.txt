Small for the price. The scent is fine, it’s light but you can still sometimes catch a whiff of it. Texture is similar to the rare beauty lip glosses; I personally think this is more smooth than sticky (wouldn’t really call this sticky at all actually). Color is pretty nonexistent once you put it on, and though this is a lip oil, it is glossy but not super glossy. However my rating isn’t based on color or “gloss“: the price isn’t worth it, I also don’t think it’s very conditioning; once the product wears off (which is about 2 hours max if you aren’t eating or drinking) my lips still felt the same. I prefer the laniege lip glowy for a hydrating “gloss“ type, or their daytime lip treatment balm for a quick dry lip fix. I only used it for two days and applied a few times (atleast 3) through each day and before I slept, so if there are strengthening/conditioning benefits I didn’t see them (laneige daytime treatment fixes my dryness in one day with 2 applications). So a star for scent and a star for it not being sticky. from someone who actually purchased
