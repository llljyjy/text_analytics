I LOVE this Fenty Beauty lip oil! My lips feel amazing after using it! The packaging is adorable. Applicator is perfect for hugging the lips and coating them perfectly! My lips are extremely moisturized after application and smell delicious! Aaaaahâ€¦. Cherries. Not only does the lip oil smell like cherries, but it is made with three different types of cherry extracts. It is not often that something is scented and actually made with non-artificial ingredients to obtain that smell. I even let my husband try the lip oil; and he approved of it as well. It makes the lips very kissable. ;) Overall, I really enjoyed this lip oil from Fenty Beauty. My reviews are 100% honest as always no matter if it is bought or gifted! Thanks for reading! Cherry-rific!
