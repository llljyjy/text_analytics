I didn’t get the hype of lip oils because after reading reviews for a ton of them everyone said they all felt like glosses, but Fenty does EVERYTHING right so I had to give it a try, and I get the hype now! This smells SO good, a little goes a long way, and it feels so light and moisturizing on my lips! Don’t overthink it, just buy it! I’m going to buy a back up once it’s back in stock because I’ve used it almost every day since getting it! Don’t hesitate, just buy it!!
