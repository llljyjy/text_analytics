I purchased the travel sized starter set. And after using for a few weeks I purchased the full sizes of the wash and fat water. My face feels clean, smooth and satin. My pores have decreased. My sister has told me several times “ your skin looks good”  those Riri products are looking out for you. I am very happy with them, the only thing I have noticed is the moisturizer SPF leaves my skin a little oily. So, I’m hoping a new moisturizer comes out that can be less oily.
