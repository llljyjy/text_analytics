I received this product from a free sample program in exchange for my honest review. For the most part, I really enjoyed the Fenty Skin toner. I used it before I went to bed. The product sinks into the skin quickly. My skin looked more glowy and less dull toned after using it for about a week. I think my skin did benefit from it and I will definitely repurchase when I run out. There is a lot of product as well so I feel like it will last a long time. I prefer this over a lot of other toners I’ve tried. The one thing I would change is the opening of the bottle. I often apply skin care products with my fingers, but because it’s an open top it’s a bit difficult getting the product out without spilling. Skin is glowing!
