I’ve been using this serum for the past few weeks and I am now a huge Fenty Skin fan. I avoided serum with included Vitamin C for a while due to some previous bad experiences, but I’m very happy I gave this one a shot. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a residue on your face. Plus, the packaging is amazing, and my skin actually looks better! Finally a Vit c serum that works for my skin!
