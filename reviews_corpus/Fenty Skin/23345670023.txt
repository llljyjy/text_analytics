I have been curious about Fenty Skin, so I picked up their soap bar and this milky toner, and both products are must haves for me now! the toner specifically smells amazing, and just puts me in a good mood, but my skin loooves this toner! I have dry skin with eczema, and my bf has oily skin but gets dry patches, and both of us are obsessed with this toner! After using it, my skin feels so hydrated and plump and just so soft, I donâ€™t even use a serum after it and my skin still feels better than it has with any other toner or serum. The whole product from the packaging to the experience to the efficiency of the products, are 10 out of 10 for me. I will never go without this toner again! Riri truly does no wrongðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ Smells amazing, but it feels even better!
