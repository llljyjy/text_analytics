If you love cocoa and bar soap… you’ll love this! While I did receive this item from a free sample program, I would definitely recommend it! The scent is much more powerful in the packaging, prior to use, but it still smells amazing overall! I only used the soap on my body and not my face, as my face is extremely sensitive to perfumed products. The soap lathers up very easily and it left my skin feeling silky and moisturized. The soap itself has a very smooth, buttery-like texture which is also nice when applying. The only downside I found is that because the soap has a very unique shape, it won’t fit inside my shower’s built in soap holder or my detachable shower soap holder, so I have trouble using it as easily and quickly as I would like.
