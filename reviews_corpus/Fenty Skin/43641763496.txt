This made my lips feel so moisturizedive been seeing people compare this to vaseline and i dont think it compares at all. looks like it will last me very long so its very much worth the splurge. smells so good too like vanilla cream.  My lips are never felt this soft…It’s so so good, it moisturizes your lips and with time it makes them more pink. If it’s not sold out totally grab it! It’s helps with dry lips, i use it everyday before bed and sometimes throughout the day! the scent is exactly like the name! This is a good product. I have been using it every night for 2 weeks now and I dont need to use the chapstick on my lips during the day as much as I did before I started using this lip mask. Lips are moisturised and dont feel dry at all. This product is a must! Everywhere with me!
