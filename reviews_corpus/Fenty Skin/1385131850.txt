I love skincare! I use all sorts from drugstore to extremely premium products. It’s OK. You can call me a junkie! When I opened the jar I found the product rather goopy. Some might say masks are goopy. Well good ones can be creamy. They can also be in powder form where you add your favorite lotion to emulsify. I found this mask do be all hype and no action. The price is NOT worth it. There wasn’t any tingle or smoothness or lesser shine. BLAH!For truly better mask use Aztec clay which is a much better value and gets you results. I say PASS on this one! Name hype Not results
