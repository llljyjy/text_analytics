I received this product as part of a free sample program. I have never used a product as great as this one and would definitely recommend it & even buy another. I decided to use the lip mask one night before bed, and you have to twist the base of the container to get the product out; it took a lot of twisting before it came out and I was getting worried it was broken or something... but it all worked out. It has such a pleasant scent. A little bit goes a long way with this product so you definitely donâ€™t need to use a lot and I am sure this will last me a long time. When applying, it goes on very smooth and makes a nice thick layer so my lips felt fully covered. It made my lips feel so smooth instantly and they just felt so good! The next morning, my lips were no longer thickly coated with the mask so it definitely absorbed, but they still felt very soft and smooth and I could still feel and smell the product which I really liked because I could tell that it worked. After a few days my lips still feel great. They definitely feel much less dry and chapped. nan
