Let’s just start with the packaging... It’s pretty freaking cool! I don’t think I’ve seen anything quite like this before, so it totally caught my attention. To use this, you unscrew the cap and push on the bottom to get the serum out. I did notice that in order for me to get it out without any issues, I do need to give it a good shake first. When I don’t, I notice that it doesn’t want to come out right away. The serum itself has a beautiful consistency. It is not sticky or tacky. It has a lovely silky texture that glides across my face and absorbs quickly! It wears well with my other skin care and under my makeup. I didn’t really notice much of a scent, so I would say this would be a safe option for those that are sensitive to scented skin care. As for effectiveness, I’ve been using this for a couple weeks now and it has definitely brightened my face and helped with evening out my overall complexion. I have not really noticed too much of a change in my two dark spots that I do have, they are pretty stubborn, and so far nothing has worked on them. That is the only reason one star has been removed. All in all, I think this one is pretty good and it definitely has me wanting to try more from the Fenty skin line! nan
