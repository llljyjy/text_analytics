Don’t get me wrong, I love this lip mask! My lips get SO chapped during the winter months, and this has been a life saver! It is extremely hydrating and it smells good! The only thing I don’t love is it is a little bit thick. It definitely depends on personal preference, but I like it to be a little more smooth. It does get smooth once you rub it on your lips and it feels nice on them as well. I would definitely recommend, it is a great product for anyone who suffers from very dry lips.
