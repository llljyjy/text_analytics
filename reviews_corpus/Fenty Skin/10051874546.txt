I absolutely LOVE this product. I was super hesitant to buy it because i have extremely sensitive and dry skin and the reviews made me a little scared. But I went for it and am so thankful I did. I use an acne cream that has made my skin peel like crazy and left it so sensitive that even Cera Ve would burn my skin. After literally 2 uses of this, my skin was as soft as a babies bum and the dry skin vanished. it’s such an amazing consistency and the spf is super great especially because of the acne medication i’m using, plus laser treatments. If you are hesitant on buying this like I was, I say go for it! Sephora’s return policy is great so you really don’t have anything to lose. you can always return it if it’s not the product for you. Plus, you can buy the refills after you’ve bought the first on and it’s cheaper! It does have a fragrance so if you’re allergic or sensitive to that, i’d be careful. But like I said, my skin is superrrr sensitive and I fell in love with this product. Also my pores are visibly smaller since using it! LOVEEEE
