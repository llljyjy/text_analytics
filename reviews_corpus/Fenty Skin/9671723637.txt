I became obsessed with lip oils during the pandemic and prior to this my favorite one was an overnight oil from a skin care brand but for going out this one is incredible ! It adds a nice gloss that isnâ€™t too slick or sticky. It has a subtle sweet smell and it makes my lips feel like heaven. I definitely recommend all girlies keep this in their summer bags ! Summer FAV!
