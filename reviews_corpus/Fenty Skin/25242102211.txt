This product is very hydrating and the perfect mask for right before bed. The one downside to this product is the design. At first, I had no clue how to open it or get any product out. When I figured out you had to turn the bottom to get product out, I turned it too many times and way too much product came out. This is because the first time you use it you have to turn it a few times before anything actually comes out. After I used it a few more times, too much product kept coming out even if I turned it just once. It is just poorly designed but I love the taste and how hydrating and long lasting the product is. nan
