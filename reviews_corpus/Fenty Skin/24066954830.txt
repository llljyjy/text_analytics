I love this lip mask! It’s a thick consistency and leaves my lips hydrated and fuller looking. It doesn’t leave my lips dry at all. I do wish the packaging was made a bit different since you have to twist the bottom to get product out and sometimes too much comes out. This doesn’t really have a scent to it but the product itself is amazing! Hydrating!
