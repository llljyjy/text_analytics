This is my first lip oil. It feels really comfortable and smooth on the lips. Not gummy. Overall I really like it. The scent does bother me a little. It smells overly artificial. Like those old lip smackers. Maybe some people liked them but the smell and taste of them was always gross to me. I can smell it for a good while so one star off for that. But other than that I love it. Great minus the smell
