The second star is because I love Rihanna. I wanted to love this but sadly it did absolutely nothing for me but strip my skin. My face and body feels tight, in a dry way after using the bar only once. I had to double back with my regular body cleanser to feel normal again. My face feels tight like all the moisture was stripped from it. For context, I have dry skin, so it was all around a mistake. May be better for those with oily skin. Issa no for me
