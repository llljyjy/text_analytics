It’s smells really good and makes the skin feel and look hydrated. Thankfully, it works under makeup and doesn’t peel at all. I typically use the ordinary HA moisturizer with a drop of facial oil mixed in, but I would more than likely replace that for this because of the smell and feel of this moisturizer. My only minor complaint is that it’s small. I love it!
