This is a great detoxing face mask! The whipped clay had a soft, smooth texture and doesnâ€™t overly dry out your face, as some other clay masks do. I use this face mask before bed and see a difference in the amount of oil on my face the next day. This clay mask is pricey for the size, but overall is a wonderful product that I would recommend.
