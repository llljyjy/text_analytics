I used to use Farmacy’s Honey Drop moisturizer before it was discontinued, and I was looking for an alternative that contains hyaluronic acid but isn’t too heavy for my combo/oily skin. This is definitely a worthwhile alternative. I love that the packaging is refillable and that it has the added benefit of SPF. I took off a star because it can feel a little greasy when I first put it on, but it settles in after a few minutes. It’s super hydrating and doesn’t break me out, which has been a concern with other moisturizers. Will definitely purchase again. Great for Combo/Oily Skin
