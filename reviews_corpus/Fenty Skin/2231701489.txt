I was gifted Fenty Beauty’s Cookies and Clean Whipped Clay Detox Face mask to try and and provide my honest opinion. I love all of the Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin products I’ve tried so far and my skin is more acne prone and oily in the spring and summer. Especially right now that I’m dealing with hormonal changes from my pregnancy. This mask uses Ingredients like salicylic acid, clay,  and charcoal to help deep clean your pores and also rhubarb and ginger oil to help soothe the skin. To use,   You simply apply a thin layer on your skin. I have combo skin so I like applying on my t zone and chin area and once the mask is dry, leave on for about 15 minutes then rinse off.  I love that the exterior box is made with recyclable material and the container and lid can also be recyclable. My skin definitely feels cleansed and not over dry.  I am working my way up to more use but for now once a week is working for me. Love the texture
