I love this lip oil! It has definitely made a difference in keeping my lips moisturised. It lasts for a very long time, with me only have to re apply once a day. I love using it when Iâ€™m finishing a facial, and even use it more than my regular lip gloss. I definitely will be purchasing again! SOOOO GOOOD!
