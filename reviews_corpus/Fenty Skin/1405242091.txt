great spf IF you don’t mind fragrance and you have oily skin! doesn’t leave a white cast, and is very hydrating for my normal to dry skin. i love a healthy glow. i can see how the fragrance can be a lot to handle but i don’t mind the smell. my one issue is the pump, it squirts out the tiniest amount. to properly cover your face you’re looking at least 5 pumps. couldn’t they design one nice pump to cover your full face? fragrant but leaves no white cast!
