I’m sure I will always sing Fenty’s praises. This product doesn’t disappoint. It makes my skin feel smooth, my hyperpigmentation has started to fade much quicker than it was without this and it doesn’t irritate or dry out my face. My co-workers in person and virtually notice my glow every time I use it. The smell isn’t the greatest, but it doesn’t linger on your face and to me the product is worth it. Don’t be discouraged by the size of the bottle, a dime size of product on the applicator is all you need twice a week so it last a long time, I’ve used it for 4 months and I’ve used less than 1/3 of the bottle so far. I do follow it up with moisturizer. An Awesome Buy!
