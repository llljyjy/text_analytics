The best lip oil I’ve ever had. Just got it and I’m obsessed. Better than the Dior lip oil by FAR. Has the perfect consistency, not sticky and heavy just perfect but also it lasts all day. Best subtle cherry flavor and the cutest packaging. Also the applicator is so good and sturdy unlike others I’ve had. So good and feels so hydrating. My lips look so nice with it on and after. Best. Lip. Oil. Ever.
