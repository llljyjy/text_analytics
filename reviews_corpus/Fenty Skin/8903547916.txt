I got this free for my honest review from Bzzagent! I love the way this mask feels on my skin. You gently rub/exfoliate the charcoal beads and let it dry for 10-15 minutes. It helps clear pores and reduces the size of current break outs. There is no scent and it doesnâ€™t strip my dry sensitive skin. My only complaint it is hard to rinse off. Cookie and Masks
