I absolutely love this product so far, it is the best hydrating toner I’ve tried. I have combination skin with really oily areas and dry patches, but this product leaves my skin evenly hydrated and not oily. I received this product as part of a free sample program, but I would buy and recommend it to my friends and family. I have not used it long enough to see it’s effects on dark spots but the glow it gives my skin alone is great. Great hydrating product
