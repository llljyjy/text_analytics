Nice texture. Not thick but not thin. Stays moist for about 4 hours on me. Pretty moisturizing; my lips always feel smooth and hydrated afterward. Great smell. Makes my lips look full and shiny. Applicator is probably the best part--all you need is one dip and thereâ€™ll be enough product to coat your lips nicely. But expensive and not a lot of product. Shiny and juicy lips
