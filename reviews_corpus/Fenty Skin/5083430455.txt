I was very pleasantly surprised with the Fat Water Milky Toner from Fenty Skin having no prior experience with the brand. It is a thicker toner - milky is definitely a good way to describe it - and feels very hydrating on the skin. It made my skin feel super soft and nourished immideately after applying and layered nicely with all of my other products. It has a noticable scent of sweet, milky tea (reminds me of boba tea!) that I liked even though I prefer my skincare to be free from fragrance. I only used this toner at night since it’s a bit heavy for my combination skin during the day, but dry skin types could probably use it for daytime too. My favorite way to incorporate this essence into my routine was to use it with retinol which turns my skin into a desert if I’m not careful. Not once when I used the Fat Water did I wake up to dry or tight-feeling skin - instead I was plump and glowing! The one thing I dislike about this product is the packaging; It’s too difficult to get the essence out of the bottle. I have to shake it pretty hard just to get a few drops and it always makes a mess around the top opening. The idea is nice, but I’d prefer a more traditional toner bottle for ease of use.**I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. Super hydrating milky essence
