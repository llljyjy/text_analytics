I like the exfoliater and I feel that it does a good job however the applicator that came with this is in a simple word, gross. It smells weird, it made my face smell weird and really I don’t know what it did to help? I think you could easily just use your hands or a washcloth to apply this but the one they give you isn’t helpful and I felt did nothing to help exfoliate. The actual product itself though I think works well! I have oily skin though so it didn’t dry me out/I followed up with the rest of my routine. Good Product, Bad Applicator
