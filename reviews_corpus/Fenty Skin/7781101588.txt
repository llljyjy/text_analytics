OK, so let me say right upfront that I am a lipgloss addict. I keep lipgloss by my bed in the bathroom in the kitchen in my car in my purse at work, because I cannot be without it. This Fenty SkinCherry Treat Conditioning + Strengthening Lip Oil Is a revelation for me because it has everything I look for in a lipgloss: the perfect consistency, unbelievable shine, extreme softening properties, and it lasts for a long time. I truly hope they don’t stop making this because this is my new favorite and I love it! Best Lipgloss I’ve Ever Used
