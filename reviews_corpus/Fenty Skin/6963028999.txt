I received this toner in exchange for a review but this is 100% honest. I love this toner! By far one of my favorite skincare items of 2022.  I have sensitive skin and despite the fragrance this doesnâ€™t break me out and has strengthened my skin barrier significantly. Since adding this to my routine I break out less and my skin glows more. TBH I was skeptical of Fenty Skin (like all other celeb skincare brands) but I will be grabbing this and more items from the line in the future. LOVE!
