I got this when it first came out, and I was so excited to try it. The only concern I had was with the fragrance because I don’t use anything with added scents in them. But I have to say, it’s pretty nice. It’s never bothered me  or my skin.  I use this literally everyday. And I recommended it to my mom and she uses it daily as well. I also love that the packaging is refillable!! I always keep a backup on hand. L O V E
