I bought this lip oil a couple of weeks ago, but I wanted to use it for a bit before reviewing. I love it!! My lips have been so smooth since I started using it, and I only have to apply it twice throughout the day. Even after it wears off, my lips still feel hydrated. It also smells so goodâ€¦like cherry pie. Not overly sweet though. Definitely an essential product for me. I already bought a backup! Sweet As Cherry Pie
