I was recently gifted Fenty Skin Watch Ya Tone Niacinamide Dark Spot Serum complimentary by Fenty Beauty and Bzzagent in exchange for my honest opinion. This was my first time trying Fenty Beauty product and I was not disappointed at all. I absolutely loved it. First thing first, the packaging of the serum is top notch. The serum has mily white texture. It is non sticky. It is light weight and it absorbs almost instantly in my skin. The serum contains Niacinamide, Vitamin C, Licorice Root Extract and Barbados Cherry which help reduce dark spots and boost overall brightness of the skin. I have been using this product for over a week now and I can already see visible reduction in dark spots on my skin. Overall, this seems like a promisable product. I also appreciate that the packaging is recyclable. nan
