I live in Las Vegas (the desert) and my lips have been suffering this winter. After the first few days of using this my lips are softer and not peeling anymore. I apply it every night and by the morning  I can tell it sets in without feeling like it’s completely gone. I’m purchasing the cherry lip oil as well so I don’t fly through this product.  Love Fenty! Needed this!
