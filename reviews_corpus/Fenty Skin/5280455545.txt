So I bought this today because I work in the mall and I was so excited it was available in the store right away. This is the silkiest thing I’ve ever had on my skin. It’s so moisturizing even my hands were softer after I applied it to my face. This is definitely a new staple in my fenty skin care routine because I have eczema and dry sensitive skin and it feels so good and calming as you put it on. I’ll definitely be buying again!!!
