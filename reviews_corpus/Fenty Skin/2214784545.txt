I am allergic to many eye creams on the market- for some reason my eye area is even more sensitive then the rest of the skin on my face. I was on the fence about buying it, but knowing Sephora’s fantastic return policy I bit the bullet and purchased. I was pleasantly surprised to not only have zero allergic reaction, but also how cooling / refreshing this cream feels to my skin. Concealer sets flawlessly over this cream during the day, and it’s perfect at night too. I don’t have many issues with under eye puffiness so I can’t attest to that claim on this product, but it is beautiful hydrating , seems to be brightening my slight dark circles & wears perfect with my makeup. Love it! Honestly next to my La Mer eye cream, this may be my second favorite one on the market. Fantastic eye cream for makeup & sensitive skin
