I really loved this product upon first use. It seemed to smooth my skin and aided in the evening of my skin tone. I will say that if you have sensitive skin, it would be best to limit your use of this product. I found that if I used too much or too often, I will get bumpy irritated skin. But when used with the proper frequency, it works beautifully! I love niacinamide. Love it
