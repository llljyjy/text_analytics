So far, I’m really enjoying this lip oil. The wide applicator makes for an easy, drip-free application. The formula isn’t sticky and has a lot of lasting power - I’ll notice it on hours later after drinking, eating, sleeping, etc. And my lips feel noticeably softer after use.My only complaint is the flavor/smell. It has the same artificial cherry scent as Twizzlers, which I personally hate (I know, I know!). But the scent isn’t enough to drive me away from using it.Overall, would buy again - and hope they release different scents! softening! but the scent is hard to stomach
