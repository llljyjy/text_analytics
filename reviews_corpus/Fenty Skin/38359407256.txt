I love the Fenty Skin Lip treatment! The applicator is super fluffy and smooth on the lips! It adds a bit of a tint to your lips and almost reminds me of the laniege one. I love that it also is not sticky or tacky on the lips but feels refreshing and nourishing! If you are looking for a treatment with an applicator in the tube- this is it! Love
