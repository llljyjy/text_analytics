i mainly got this moisturizer because of spf and I LOVE RIHANNA, and i did love it, its just the moisturizer doesn’t give a glow to the face its a very matte finish to my skin, it is worth the prize for sure, I just didn’t find it so perfect to buy it again! loved the idea of refill, very environmental conscious product and very clean in ingredients RIRI's moisturizer
