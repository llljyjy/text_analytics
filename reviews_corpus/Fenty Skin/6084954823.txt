The best lip oil period. I’m one of those people that’s addicted to “lip chap” lol. I apply it all day. I’ve tried every single one. THIS IS THE ONE. Omg. I actually forget to apply more throughout the day because I don’t need it. I’ve been using it for a week and already see a huge improvement in my lips. I’ve been using Stacks hydrating lip peel for awhile now and felt like it stopped working after awhile. After using this for a few days I could feel the dead skin coming off. I exfoliate every couple days and my lips have gotten considerably lighter and fuller. So it’s both a great moisturizer and seems to do what it says it will. I definitely notice the skin barrier on my lips getting stronger. It feels like it clings to your lips. It’s hard to describe, but I love it. BUY THIS!
