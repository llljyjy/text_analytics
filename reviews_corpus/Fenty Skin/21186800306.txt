After using this product for a few weeks, I AM IN LOVE with the results. This Fenty lip mask feels so good on my lips and keeps them moisturized. It has very long lasting results. It’s very easy to apply to your lips. In the winter time my lips always get so cold and dry, this lip mask fixes this problem! The scent is also amazing. The packaging and appearance of this product is very sleek and clean looking. Smallish and easily portable for carrying in your purse or bag. I would say it’s a must have for your daily routine. I would definitely recommend this product! Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for a honest review. A must have lip product!
