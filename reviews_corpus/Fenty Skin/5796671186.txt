(Rec’d product as part of free sample program) SO thankful I was able to experience a Fenty Skin product for the first time! I have been using this lip mask almost daily for about 1.5 weeks now. I really like this product! I have extremely dry skin in the winter and my lips always seem to crack. This lip mask keeps my lips hydrated and feeling moisturized. I’m not really a fan of the packaging though. It’s just not my personal favorite. I don’t really notice any scent with this. I really like this lip mask, but I don’t think I’d buy it. It reminds me of a higher quality version of Vaseline. It’s a bit expensive to me. Although I’m not a huge fan because I feel like there are similar products with a less expensive price tag, this lip mask is great! It truly does hydrate and moisturize. I would definitely recommend this product if price were not a factor. Nice Lip Mask
