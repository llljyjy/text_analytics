I received this product for free so I cannot comment on the $24 price tag other than this product does seem like it’ll last a while. I was considering new and perhaps pricier lip treatment options so this came at the right time. It leaves a shine on your lips for quite a while so be prepared for that. I think the stickiness and not really bothersome if you aren’t putting your lips anywhere. It’s putting oil on your lips, after all. The smell is your typical cherry smell / flavor. You know the one. And the applicator feels nice on your lips. It does seem to be helping my lips out... no real complaints from me. Lip Moisture and Shine!
