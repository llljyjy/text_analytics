I received this in the mail a few days ago and was so excited because I already love Fenty products so I knew this was going to be good. I’ve used it every day since I’ve gotten it and I honestly LOVE IT. I have oily skin and very visible pores so I was a little nervous because of how hydrating this would be, but it actually helped all of those things!! It minimizes the look of my pores and makes my face feel sooo smooth. I have a lot of texture on my face and this has noticeably helped with that. I’m also really excited to use this in the winter because it’s hydrating so it won’t strip my face. Def recommend!! LOVE!! even for oily skin!
