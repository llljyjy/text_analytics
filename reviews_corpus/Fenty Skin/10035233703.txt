This product performs probably the best out of all my lip oils I have. It feels weightless and not very sticky on the lips and you really don’t notice it on too much, my lips feel conditioned even after it dries eventually and that’s something I struggle with finding in other lip oils. I would buy this and recommend buying this product especially if you struggle with dry peeling lips. Great conditioning lip product
