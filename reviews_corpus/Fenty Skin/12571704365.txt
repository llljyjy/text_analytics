The smell is phenomenal. The idea is phenomenal. The lather is amazing. Unfortunately, it doesn’t moisturize as much as it advertises. When I use it in the shower, it makes my skin feel squeaky but it strips the moisture. When I come out the shower, my skin feels dry. I want to feel a soft/buttery feel but it doesn’t work on my skin. Keep in mind I do live in a more drier climate so that may be a factor as well. nan
