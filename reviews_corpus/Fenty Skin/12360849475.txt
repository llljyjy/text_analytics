I suffer from dry lips and the cold winter season always seems to perpetuate this situation for me. When I saw Fenty Skin release this lip mask I instantly added it cart and have been using it daily for the past couple of weeks. It does a phenomenal job at keeping my lips moisturized without leaving them feel heavy or too sticky. After application, the mask lasts about 3-4 hours and even after that, my lips feel so rejuvenated and healed. It makes them look plush and naturally plumped looking, and I love that about this product . The mask is not too shiny or glossy, which I also appreciate as a male client, it gives off a nice natural sheen. The vanilla scent is very muted, not to worry if your sensitive to smells, it literally disappears after application. A couple clicks is all you need to do both top and bottoms lips, turn the dial carefully as the product seeps out even after the click is done, a little goes a very long way with this. If you want to use less lips balms all day, do give this a try, youâ€™ll definitely notice a big difference within the first day. Dump those cheap lips balms everyone.
