I’ve been using this for about a month and my skin is softer, blemish free (scars aside) and a little goes a long way. You really don’t need more than a dime-size because it’s both a toner and serum, so it’s a bit thicker than regular toner. Bottom line: Love it and it’s now a permanent part of my skincare routine. Love!!
