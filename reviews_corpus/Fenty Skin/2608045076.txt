When I started using this product, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I decided to add it to my morning skin routine and have been loving it so far. It smells amazing and helps hydrate and make my combination skin feel super soft. The bottle was a little confusing to figure out at first, but I think it’s the only thing that I would change about the product. I received this product as part of a free sample program. nan
