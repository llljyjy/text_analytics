I really wanted to like this product. I have large pores in my T-zone, and I was really hoping for my pores to be “refined” like what the product claims it does. Fat water did nothing for my pores, in fact, I feel like it clogged my pores. It also leaves my skin feeling extremely dry and tight… not hydrating at all. I’m practically dying to put moisturizer on my face immediately after this product. I’d save your money on this one. It feels pretty useless putting it on. There are far better skincare products out there. The only pros are that it smells amazing and the packaging is beautiful. Save your money.
