This toner is amazing for any skin type, but particularly for those who have dry skin. It includes such great ingredients such as Hyaluronic Acid that just plumps, hydrates, and preps the skin for makeup. I have definitely seen a difference in my skin, and I made sure to use it for at least 1 month daily before writing my review. My dry patches are no longer visible and my foundation/concealer looks so much smoother. The super silky texture feels so soft on the skin and the slightly sticky texture makes it the perfect primer to prep the skin before foundation! I definitely have seen my skin improve even without makeup on as well! My skin is much more plump and bright. It has also never broken me out or given my sensitive skin any type of reaction. The slightly fruity, floral scent is also amazing! It helped my dry, sensitive skin turn silky soft after 1 month of daily use! I highly recommend! I am so glad I was able to receive this as part of a free sample program! Perfect Primer for Silky Soft Skin!!!
