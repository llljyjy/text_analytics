I’ve been using this product for a week now and my skin feels amazing. There is a slight scent so if your skin is sensitive to that I wouldn’t advise. But other than that my skin feels plump and full of moisture it’s a thick consistency that’s perfect for hand or cotton pad application. A little also goes a long way so for the price point I’m not afraid of running out of this product super quickly. All in all great product and an easy product for beginners! Easy and Moisturizing Toner!
