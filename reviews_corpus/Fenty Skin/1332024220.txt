This is a wonderful product. I was looking for something with protection from the sun and  found that with the added benefit of niacinomide. I had been looking to add this brightening  ingredient to my skin care routine so was very pleased. It goes on nicely to the skin leaving a dewy but non sticky finish. It was invisible on the skin for me but I have a light colored skin tone. I think my skin looks better since using the product but it was not an overnight change. I plan to buy again. Great Product!
