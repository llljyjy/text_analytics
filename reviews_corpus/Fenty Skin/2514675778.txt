Hello smooth and plump skin. This mask has a great benefits from the charcoal beads that massage into the skin to the tightening of the skin from the salicylic acid as the mask dries and finally a fresh smooth and plump finish. If you’re sensitive to scents this mask would work great because there is no scent whatsoever. A little goes a long way. It’s clean to apply with no dripping messes. Very potent and gentle. 1 Oreo Blizzard for my skin please
