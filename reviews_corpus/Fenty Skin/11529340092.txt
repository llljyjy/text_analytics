I usually am not drawn to bar soaps. I appreciate their sustainability and eco-consciousness however, bar soaps strip my skin of hydration. This soap smells good; fresh and clean but not overpowering. It lathered really well too. My only problem is that my skin did feel very “squeaky clean”, which I don’t mind every once in a while, but for daily use, I find is too stripping. I would recommend this to someone who does love that squeaky feeling but for someone who prefers a moisturizing soap, it’s okay to skip this. (I received this for free in exchange for an honest review.) Love Fenty Skin but soap is just okay!
