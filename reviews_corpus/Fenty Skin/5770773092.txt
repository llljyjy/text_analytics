I’ve tried a lot of lip oils in my quest for soft lips and this one by far takes the cake over the rest that I’ve tried. This feels soft and moisturizing, but never leaves that greasy film that some others have been known to leave behind. It’s also hydrating but not ever sticky. I cannot recommend this enough. I can’t wait to see if they come out with other flavors, as I will definitely purchase Delicious, Shiny, Hydrating
