Fentyâ€™s cookies and clean face mask is my absolute new favorite. I love the exfoliating feel of the charcoal on my skin, and how this mask provides the same benefit as pull of masks without pulling against my skin. I left my mask on for 10 mins, until the charcoal appeared hardened, and I think that was the perfect amount of time. I also love the smell of this mask. This was the perfect addition to my self care routine! Rihanna does it again
