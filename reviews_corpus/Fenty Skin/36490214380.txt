I’m a sucker for cute packaging, and with this SPF, it’s really all you’re getting. Firstly, the consistency is creamy it goes on nice and smooth. But I immediately felt a slight sting which I’m assuming is the fragrance (i have sensetive skin). It could also have been the dyes that give it the color. I don’t understand why anyone would want to put dyes on their face. Then my eyes started stinging which I’m sure is the avebenzone SPF filter since it’s known to sting. I used it only twice then discarded it. I should have returned for a full refund but alas avoid this one. Dyes + Frangrance + Avobenzone = STAY AWAY
