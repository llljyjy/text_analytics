I received this product as part of a free sample program. The one asset of this cleansing bar is that it smells great and the scent lasts. I found the scent lasts on my skin more than normal cleansing bars do, especially the ones made for women. It also lathers very well. My skin doesn’t feel better hydrated but it also doesn’t feel dried out, so it’s average on that front. I do prefer it as a facial cleanser over a body soap. Just personally think it works better as a face cleanser than the “all-over“ cleanser it’s meant to be. Prefer it much more as just a facial cleanser.
