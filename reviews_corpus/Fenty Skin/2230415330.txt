Keeps my lips soft and supple! I love the smell, it reminds me of the fruity clear gloss that I used when I was young! Definitely very reminiscent. It does have a thicker consistency than a normal oil would so it feesl like a lip gloss and slightly tacky to the touch. I think itâ€™s great for keeping my lips moisturized and glossy! Reminiscent cherry vibes!!
