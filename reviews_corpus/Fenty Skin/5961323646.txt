This lip mask is THICK. you seriously do not need much in order to feel like you’re getting enough coverage. I’m not a fan of the packaging, you have to twist the bottom up and the scrape the product off of the top which I think is a little unsanitary. I would’ve preferred a squeeze tube but it’s alright at the end of the day. What’s matters is that this product definitely works. I tried this out for several nights and it stays on the entire night. I didn’t find that it transferred to my sheets or pillows which was a nice surprise. It keeps your lips moisturized through out the night. I think I’ll repurchase this whenever it runs out.. which might be like a year from now considering how little you actually need!! nan
