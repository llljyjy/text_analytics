I received this product for free in exchange for my review! I’d never used Fenty Skin products and was a little hesitant at first because I know sometimes celebrity skincare brands aren’t the best, but I must say I have been pleasantly surprised with this lip oil. It’s a thick consistency with a faint cherry smell. It keeps my lips moisturized all day - I’ve started to carry it around with me everywhere! The only thing I don’t like is the price point. I wish it were cheaper, I feel $24 is a lot of money for something so tiny. Would absolutely buy it again if it were to go on sale though, I really like the product! Awesome, but Pricey IMO
