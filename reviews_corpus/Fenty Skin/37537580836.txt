From the image, I  expected glossy red color added to my lips upon application. I was a bit surprised that it was sheer; it felt a bit deceiving. But I do truly enjoy the thick, nonstick formula of the lip oil, which makes application easy; and the cherry scent--it’s divine! The packaging is also adorable: a minimal, lavender applicator and the cherry on the container that fits and looks pleasing in your purse. Overall, it’s a wonderful product if you’re looking for sheer, glossy lip hydration with a fruity scent, and nothing more. Great scent and thick formula; lacks color
