My oily, acne-prone skin loves this mask.  The mousse texture feels light and it is so easy to spread on my skin. It is a plus because it makes washing it off easier too. My skin immediately looks brighter and feels so clean. Give this a try if youâ€™re looking for a clay mask. Acne-prone skin loves it.
