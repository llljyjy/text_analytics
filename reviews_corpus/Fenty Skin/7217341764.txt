this might be my favorite lip mask i’ve ever tried!! first off, i love the packaging—it’s so unique for a lip mask and helps minimize cross-contamination. as for the product itself, it doesn’t disappoint either. my lips get so dry during colder months so i got this at the perfect time. the texture’s quite thick so i prefer applying it at night before going to bed. nan
