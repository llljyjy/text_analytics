I am loving my Cookies n Clean face face mask. A small amount goes a long way. I appreciate that so the product last longer. I was a little iffy about the whipped texture. However, I am impressed on how the charcoal beads dissolves and the mask becomes an even layer.   I use it on the areas that my skin struggles with is mostly my cheeks and nose. I can visibly see a difference after using this product. I have dry skin and I do not think this dried out my skin as other masks do. I love the clean packaging and color. My sister tried and is going to purchase her own so yes I would recommend it. Love it! nan
