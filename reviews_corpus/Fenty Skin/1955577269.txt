I don’t know what Rihanna and her skin scientists are in the  labs mixing up but I’m here for it. This soap is so moisturizing. I use it to wash my face and Omg it’s just so lathering and moisturizing when I use it I can’t stop massaging it in my face it’s so much lather. When I rinse it’s pure moisture no tightness. I LOVE IT Love the moisture a 10 for me
