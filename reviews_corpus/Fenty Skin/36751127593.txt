I received this today. Cleaned my face, put on the mask for 15 minutes and it’s AMAZING. It made my pores disappear!!!! The mask consistency upon touching is bouncy, but putting it on my face is soft & thin. The black beads exfoliating my face and changes the color to gray. No fragrance. Would buy again. This product is definitely different from other face masks I have.  I’ll be recommending this to family and friends. nan
