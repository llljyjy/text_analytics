I just received it in the mail and I am blown away, my lips were super chapped before I put it on, one hour after application they were smooth supple and no longer peeling. The smell is delectable and there is no funny taste. Don’t even get me started on the applicator it’s immaculate. All in all just get it. Just Buy It!
