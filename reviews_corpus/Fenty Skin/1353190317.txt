I’m super picky about lip products but I absolutely LOVE this product!!! It’s thick and stays on overnight while really hydrating my lips, after one night my lips went from super chapped and dry to soft smooth and supple! Love the packaging too it’s very unique, just make sure you don’t twist it too many time because sometimes it’s slow to come out! Scent is very subtle Best lip mask ever!!!!
