I received this product from a free sample program and I absolutely love it! I was a little hesitant to try based on the name of the product, but I am very glad I did try it. My face feels so much smoother and looks smoother and hydrated without being greasy. I have combination sensitive skin and I am very acne prone especially when it comes to new products, but I had no issues with this product! I am very happy I finally found a product that does not make me break out and also does the job! This is not part of my daily skin care routine. Finally a product that works !!!!!
