Simply AMAZING! I am a sucker for charcoal masks and this is probably the best one Iâ€™ve ever tried! My skin feels super clean after washing this mask off, and the best part for me was that it washes off very easily. Charcoal masks that I have used in the past need to really be rubbed off with water to be completed washed off my face. Very light feel, no scent, and is fun to apply because the mask changes from light to dark when the beads start to blend. I would highly recommend this product to those who have oily/combination skin :) nan
