This is a salicylic acid masked clay mask that is so fun to use. There are clay beads in here that to massage onto your skin, then watch the white mask turn a gray color. You wait 10-15mins and remove. I could see a visible difference in my pores when I used this mask and I really enjoyed it. It didn’t dry out my skin as there are some nourishing and hydrating ingredients in here as well. I was quite surprised, I didn’t expect to like it so much! I definitely recommend. so fun and effective
