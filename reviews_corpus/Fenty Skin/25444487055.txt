I received this product as a free sample. I wouldn’t normally get this kind of product, but I’m so glad I did! Though it’s too soon for me to say I can see any results, it feels so good on my skin and my face feels more hydrated when I have it on. I use this toner as a barrier between my skin and my makeup, and it makes my makeup look so much dewier, and my face so glowy! nan
