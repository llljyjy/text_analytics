Cute packaging, innovative component. The product is a bit sticky and heavy, very much like Vitamin E, so it didn’t feel too comfortable sitting on my lips. I didn’t notice enough of a difference to make me want to use this product again. I prefer other lip masks I’ve tried (or even Vaseline/Aquaphor) that aren’t as heavy and leave my lips softer than this one did. Only benefit to this product is that it looks cute. I love Fenty but I wouldn’t recommend this product to others and probably wouldn’t purchase it myself. Can live without it
