How does this product compare to other products you’ve tried?The opening of this product is somewhat interesting. When I first opened the product, I didn’t notice the slight increase of the cap and was confused since I completely unscrewed the top cap. It wasn’t until I saw the ad that I realized that the liquid came from the top of the cap. This Toner is HYDRATING. This is definitely more thick than many toners I have tried. I would say this is similar in consistency with essences Liquid Gold from Stratia. I would say this is amazing for someone who needs something a little thick but not moisturizer thick on the face. Absorption is pretty good too. Because my face leans more on the oiler side, I would only apply this at night and not during the day.The lineup of ingredients in this Toner is good like niacinamide! Truly a Toner + Essence, 100% hydrating
