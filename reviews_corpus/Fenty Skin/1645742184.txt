This was the first time I’ve tried this mask. Applying it was kinda fun, blending was so easy non clumpy with minimal mess. Any residue left on your fingers, hands easily came off. During the sting process of approx 15 minutes my face never felt stiff which was a great feeling. Then…I washed it off and my skin looked amazing.  So shiny and it felt hydrated. Try this as RiRi’s Fenty line I’ve loved since day 1. Magic Jar
