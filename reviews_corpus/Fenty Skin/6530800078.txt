I received this product as part of a free sample program. I also love fenty products so I may be a bit biased, but I love this product. First, the product and the packaging are adorable which is not necessarily important, but details matter and I tend to enjoy products that have cuter packaging. I don’t really have high standards for toner because for the most part I’ve never noticed a difference when I use it so I had low standards for this toner, but i really notice a difference with this. It makes my skin feel so nice and smooth as well as more moisturized which is important for me since I have drier skin. I’ve also noticed over long terms use some discoloration and slight scarring I’ve gotten over the years has faded and I haven’t changed my skin care routine recently besides trying this toner. I also just feel like my skin glows more and looks more radiant, but I could just be inflating it based on the results I’ve seen. Overall, this is a great product and I would purchase it for money for sure! wonderful product!
