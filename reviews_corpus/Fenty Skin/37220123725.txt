Giiiirl, struggling with oily/combination skin? Look no further!! This mask tames my oily spots and is gentle on my dryer areas. Mask is smooth and easy to apply. Be sure to rub it in to break the charcoal beads! I’ve been leaving mine on for 15 minutes and use it every other day. My skin feels luxurious afterwards!! So soft!! And I haven’t experienced any break outs since using the product, even during that time of the month when I almost always get a pimple or two. Really happy with the product! Looking for luxury??
