I love this mask , this is such a fun mask to apply and watch it turn from white to gray. The only difficulty is that it is a little time consuming to really pop the charcoal and get it to rub into the mask, but it not something that would make me not want to use the mask. I have oily and dry skin, this mask kind of even out my skin but it didnâ€™t overly dry it but I would definitely moisturize after using this mask! cookies and clean
