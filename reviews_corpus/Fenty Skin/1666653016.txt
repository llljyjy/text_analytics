I really enjoy this soap. It is aesthetically pleasing to look at. I love that it’s round and how large it is. It smells like cocoa butter. What I love most about it is how quickly and easily it lathers. You don’t have to use much at all to get lots of lather. It feels nice going onto the skin and my skin does feel soft and smooth after the first few uses. Now, does it make you feel any smoother or softer than Dove? No, not in my opinion. If you like lather and want a soap that looks good in your shower, I would recommend this. Otherwise, it’s a lot of money for a bar of soap. I, however, will likely repurchase. I'm enjoying this soap
