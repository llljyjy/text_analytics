I don’t consider myself to have sensitive skin but I  had never tried a peel before so I was a little nervous as to how my skin would react and it worked well for well despite the amount you get and and I must say I’m me. It made my skin feel softer after the first use andwith using it for about 3/4 times a week for 2 weeksit has made my skin glowy and smooth. It didn’t dryme out or irritate my skin at all. It wasn’t bad but I’ve used better
