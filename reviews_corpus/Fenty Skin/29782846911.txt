This face mask has been my skin’s best friend over the past few weeks.   I love the whipped texture and how light it feels applying on my skin.   There are cool little encapsulated charcoal beads embedded in the mask that burst as you massage the product in.  I’ve used the mask on both wet and dry skin,  leaving it on for 10-15 minutes before rinsing.   It’s fragrance free, non-irritating and leaves my skin feeling super soft.  It has definitely improved my pores and complexion while helping to control excess oil and shine. This is the way clay masks ought to be. Leaves My Skin Feeling Super Soft And Smooth!
