Really loved this product and I love how my skin drinks it up. I would it give it a full 5 stars but I would lying if I said the packaging is completely perfect, Iâ€™d love to maybe see a pump or spray format of the packaging because the plastic can sometimes hurt to squeeze product out and it can be less painful for those who have arthritis but that being said, I do enjoy the formula to repurchase and recommend. love the formula, not a fan of the bottle
