Awesome cleanser. Removes all makeup. It doesn’t dry out your skin, or leave it oily. The only problem is the packaging. The cleanser doesn’t come out easily, and the tube tends to break on the top seal, wasting the cleanser. It would be 5 star if that problem is fixed. Great product, not so great container
