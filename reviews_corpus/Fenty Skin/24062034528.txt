I received this product as part of a free sample program. I was hesitant to try this product since I’m always worried about breaking out. However, this product wasn’t bad and didn’t break me out at all! I found this product to be decently hydrating and very minimally sticky, so I’d probably prefer to use this product more in the winter when the weather is colder. Definitely have to try this product longer though! nan
