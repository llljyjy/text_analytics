This Cherry Treat Conditioning Lip Oil by Fenty is my all-time favorite lip gloss, and if you saw how many lipglosses I have, you’d think I was a loon! It’s all about the consistency and shine, and this one has the perfect texture and the shine is amazing. I love this one because it lasts and leaves my lips looking gorgeous for a long time.
