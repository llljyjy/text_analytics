I’m finally reviewing this after going through two bottles and I can confidently say it’s my favorite Fenty Skin product so far. It feels soothing and moisturizing. I use it as a toner with Hydra Vizor. With those products I haven’t had issues with my oily skin and usual liquid foundation with powder routine. I replaced the Fat Water cap with a pump nozzle top for easier use. I didn’t like the way it dispenses with the original cap. nan
