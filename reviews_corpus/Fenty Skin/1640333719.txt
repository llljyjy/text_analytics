I wasn’t expecting too much from this product, but it has made a noticeable difference in the texture and brightness of my 60+ skin! It seemed to reduce the visibility of my pores and plumped my skin as well. I’m halfway through a bottle, will be repurchasing. Side note:  I use it on the back of my hands and décolletage as well. nan
