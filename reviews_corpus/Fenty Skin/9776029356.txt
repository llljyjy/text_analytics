*disclaimer: received as a part of a free sample program*At first, I was skeptical. I haven’t used a skincare product like this before. However upon incorporating it into my routine, I enjoyed the way tit had my skin look and feel. Soft, glowy and hydrated! I didn’t have to use my toner since it had “toner essence” . & it smells lovely. I could see why the product is labeled Fat Water, it’s light as water but milky base to truly moisturize your skin. Loveeee it ✨ Fat Water?? yes! hydrating and glowy!
