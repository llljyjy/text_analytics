I was very curious about this sunscreen and, to be honest, I was not expecting too much but wow! This is so good!PROS:- Lightweight cream: it has a beautiful texture that spreads so easily. - It gets absorbed pretty good! I was very surprised that the recommended amount to get any advertised spf (a nickel-sized dollop to the face alone) was absorbed so fast! I normally apply half and let it absorb and then apply the other half, but with this one I didn’t need to do so. - It leaves a glowy finish (not greasy) but may be too much for oily skin. - It has good ingredients, like HA, aloe, glycerin, antioxidants and niacinamide to mention a few.- It is clean at Sephora.- It comes with the possibility of refills, which is great!CONS:- It is quite pricey but the quality is there.- It is lightly scented. I like scented products and this one smells so good, so I don’t have an issue with it. In fact I like scented products, but many people don’t and it is not necessary. - It is a chemical sunscreen. This is not really bad, it is just that I prefer physical sunscreens. I don’t have sensitive skin, so it is not an issue for me, but it may be for some. I can’t use it around my eyes though, because it eventually gets in and irritates them, but not my skin.I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador Such a great surprise!!
