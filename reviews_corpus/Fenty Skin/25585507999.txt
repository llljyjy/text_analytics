Fenty Skins Cookies and Cream detox face mask really left my skin feeling nice.  I have combinations  skin, and it is on the sensitive side.   This mask left my face smooth and less shiny as well!  It went on very easy and dried quickly.  While rubbing it in, the charcoal disolves and feels really good on your face.  After it dries, removing it is very easy!   After trying this free sample, I will definately purchase this mask.  I do recommend the cookies and cream mask as well.   I would have given this mask a full five stars, however with the name Cookies N Clean, I wish it had some scent to it.  There is zero scent.  The way this mask works, makes up for the lack of scent though. nan
