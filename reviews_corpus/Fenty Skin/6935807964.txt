Things I like :- the size perfect for my pocket or purse-the application is very unique and effective and delivering the product to my lips- the smell is sweet nice and faint. After all there are 3 kinds of cherry extract used to make this product- my lips feel not only nourished, but cushioned, moist and plump- I like that the oil has some hold, it’s not sticky but it’s thick enough that it won’t look like you’re drooling from the oil bleeding everywhere which I have expect I’m other brandsWhat I didn’t like - that it doesn’t come in a bigger size Ps. Bought at the fenty site so it won’t show as verified in here outstanding
