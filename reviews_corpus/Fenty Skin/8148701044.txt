I can’t say enough how much I love this product! I received it free to test out and I am so glad I did! This mask leaves my face/pores feeling tighter than ever and firm. There is no scent which I really appreciated, and it doesn’t take much to cover your face. It is super light and fluffy and easy to apply. Massaging the charcoal beads was relaxing to me and I love that the color changes once it is applied all of the way. I will definitely be purchasing this in the future. LOVED it
