I’ve used it for about a week now. I use it on my body and not my face. I can definitely understand why people would say it’s too drying if they’re using it on their face, but I think on the body it’s good and leaves a nice clean feeling. I don’t like to use soaps/body washes that are so moisturizing they feel like wet lotion. It also smells really good. Love the smell
