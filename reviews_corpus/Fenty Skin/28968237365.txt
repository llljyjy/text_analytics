I received this product as part of a free sample program. This product is pretty good for hydrating lips. It feels like vaseline but heavier, which is better to use at nighttime. I love the color and the packaging is very unique. I would recommend this products for all the people who have chapped lips during the winter like me. So this is a perfect time for this release and for yâ€™all to get it! I love it!
