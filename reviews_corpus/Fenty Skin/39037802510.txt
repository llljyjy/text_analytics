I have a dry skin and have been suffering skin irritation over years. Lately I have been switching my skin routine with different body washes and lotions but none worked out for me. Thankfully I was sent a sample of the FS Cocoa Bar and now that I have found the perfect remedy for my skin, I am happy to share my experience with Sephora. It locked my skin moisture and  deeply nourished and hydrated it. It also a has soft fragrance that lights up my mood and makes me feel fresh. Those of you, who are looking for vegan or cruelty free product, Cocoa Cleansâ€™r Soothing All-Over Cleansing Bar is the right choice out of many other market products. It is definitely added to my shopping list and would highly recommend everybody. No-more dry skin
