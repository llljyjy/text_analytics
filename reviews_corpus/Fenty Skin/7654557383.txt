I actually love this, it’s probably my favorite daytime sunscreen lotion. I have dry, sensitive but combination oily skin because do a lot of retinol and chemical peels but this is my skin perfector. Protects my delicate skin from the sun while moisturizing it so nicely, it never pills, very easy to reapply and won’t make ur skin look so oily, just glowy. I’ve tried everything and been into skincare since I was a teen and this will definitely be in my holy grain. I only rate it three stars because of the fragrance, I’m worried my skin will build a intolerance to the fragrance so I wish they would lessen or get rid of the fragrance completely. overall wonderful
