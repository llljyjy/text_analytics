I received this product complimentary from Influenster. I think this is a good product but it isn’t the best out there honestly. It didn’t leave my lips after a few minutes of application. It looks like a brownish Vaseline Color. The amount of product and $$ definitely isn’t worth it. I was excited for this product because Rihanna has the best lip glosses I’ve ever tried but this was a complete miss. I think it’s cool because if sleek packaging. Skip! Vaseline is better
