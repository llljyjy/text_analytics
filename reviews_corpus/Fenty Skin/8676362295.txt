I received this cleanser as part of a free sample program, and let me tell you I’m actually obsessed with this cleanser! I have really sensitive skin and I love that this product doesn’t dry me out or cause me to break out. Another reason why why I love this product is because it can be used on both face and body, It leaves my skin feeling soft, clean, and moisturized. Other cleansers I’ve used before leave my skin feeling irritated but this one’s amazing. Definitely recommed it and will be buying soon! nan
