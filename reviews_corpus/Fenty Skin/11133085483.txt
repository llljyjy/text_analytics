Love this!! Smells great and keeps the skin nicely hydrated. Definitely a great choice for normal to dry skin types. My skin is also sensitive and it doesn’t bother me at all. It’s got a great milky texture too. First product I tried from Fenty Skin and it’s genuinely a great toner essence. Highly recommend! Really good honestly
