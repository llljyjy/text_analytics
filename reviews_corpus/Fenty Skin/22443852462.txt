I really enjoyed this product! Iâ€™m someone who get really dry chapped lips at time and found this product to be an extreme help! I used it for two weeks every-time my lips felt dry and it was great at rehydrating my lips. When first putting it on it feels sticky, but the longer you wear it, it subsides. Great product and very easy to use. great for dry/chapped lips
