I bought the fat water and hydra vizor a year back when i was looking for a good skincare product. Now I am hooked on. Fat water has done wonders for skin tone. It have evened out the skin tone as well as reduced the pores by at least 70%. I had a lot of residual tanning from my country and it has all been cleared. When i first started using it i didnt see a drastic difference, but after a year of using only fat water and hydra visor I can appreciate the difference. Fat water has become a necessity for me now. Skincare feels incomplete without it even it. obsessed!
