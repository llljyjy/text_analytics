I received this product through a free sample program . I ’ve been using it a few days and love how it lathers and the faint scent of cocoa is divine. I rinse with warm water and after lathering, I’m left with a soft body! lol, and I love that there’s no residue afterwards. Defintely adding this to the self care routine
