Overall I enjoyed this face mask! I was not expecting the whipped bouncy texture as it is so different from other detox face masks I have used.  It did make it slightly hard to pick up and spread on my skin as it was so bouncy that it didnâ€™t come off my fingers easily.  Once it was on my face though it really worked! I could feel my skin tightening as the face mask was working.  It rinsed off easily and my skin looked firmer and brighter.  I have dry skin so I always follow up a detox mask with plenty of hydrating lotion. nan
