I am in love with this! As I have gotten older I have noticed a dry patch on my chin forming. I added this to my nighttime routine about a week ago,  while still using the regular fat water in the morning, and my skin feels so good! I wake in the morning to all over dewy skin. I also love the sent to this. It is so much lighter than the other day water and just adds to Feb experience. Awesome hydration boost!
