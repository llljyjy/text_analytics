Absolutely not. I love love love the fat water toner serum so I decided to give this a try. Immediate burning sensation, washed it off. 5 day later I’m still suffering from blotchy, red bumpy, dry flaky skin. I tried it on my wrist beforehand and no reaction, my doctor said the face is more sensitive than the wrist so it didn’t react as much. I’ve booked an appointment with a dermatologist, but this has really messed up my skin. For context, I have combination skin, but more on the dry side in the colder months and oilier during the warmer months. I usually use the fat water toner serum with either the laneige waterbank moisture cream or fenty skin overnight and spf moisturizer. Wash normally with the fenty skin cleanser and twice a week with the pre-show glow. Absolutely bummed this didn’t work out with the rest of the lin Absolutely not
