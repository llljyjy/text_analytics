Such a big fan of this!! I have this wonderful combination of very dry skin (which limits my ability to use salicylic acid) and acne prone skin. This mask is probably one of my all time favorites, and I LOVE masks. It’s not too drying - my skin actually feels moisturized. I don’t break out, it actually really truly does help stave off some knarly breakouts. It’s a fun consistency, very bouncy, and easy to remove once it’s time to rinse off. A little goes a long way - I use about a quarter-sized dollop each use. To me, this is absolutely worth the price, it’s really helped my skin, and I will 100% buy this again! nan
