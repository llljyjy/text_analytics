I received this product as part of a free sample program in exchange for my honest review and here it is. The soap application during the shower has a great lather to it and its a fairly large soap which I love. If you like to feel very veryyy clean then this is the soap for you. Right after a shower it does make you feel like it striped all of your sweat, oils and impurities from your skin. After a couple of hours my skin feels normal again and my skin feels pretty soft. It had smelled so good after i took it out the box. Upon instantly putting it under the water and scrubbing myself with it, the smell disappeared and i dont really smell it on my body after im dry which was pretty disappointing because it smelled sooooo good ! Overall, i gave this product a 3 star because it does make me feel clean and soft after an hour or two. The size of the product is also a positiveâ€¦ the negatives:  the loss of smell, and the way it made me feel of having my oils striped was a no for me. I would recommend this product for people that want to be completely striped of oils or someone who has a more oily type skin. I would not recommend this soap to someone who has dry skin. My skin is a combination and it dried me out too much.. My Honest Review!
