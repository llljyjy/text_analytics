I wanted to love this product bc Iâ€™m such a fan of fenty beauty products but this is awful. First, it smells like those beauty supply lip glosses you get for $3. Then, its not conditioning at all. In fact, it made my lips chapped and rough. I also thought it would be more of an oily consistency but it has a cheap thin gloss feel to it. Definitely my least fav product I have gotten from Fenty. Pass on this one, you wont regret it.
