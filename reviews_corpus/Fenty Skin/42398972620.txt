I really like how this product combines both niacinamide and vitamin C into one formula -- it’s nice not having to use two products to get the effects of both ingredients. This is probably a silly misconception on my behalf, but thought the product was going to have some sort of tint to it, given the appearance of the bottle + the product name focusing on ~tone~. The serum has an off-white, milky appearance to it with little to no scent. It feels a little bit wet when initially applying it, but that sensation dissipates pretty quickly. I’ve been using it for around a week now. The appearance of my skin isn’t noticeably different, but it does feel softer in texture and firmer in elasticity! Solid product!
