I’ve been using the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask for quite some time now and I’ve got to say...I like Fenty’s lip mask better! The results are extremely similar (basically the same), but what really makes this a better product is the packaging.  You do not have to dip your fingers into a jar and it comes with a cap to make sure it’s clean.  So it’s very portable and cleaner. Also, it’s a couple bucks cheaper.  I would definitely buy this product! Watch out Laneige...
