I’m not sold sold YET, but only cause I like to give it some time to actually see what happens. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the packaging and didn’t know that it was refillable until it was in my hands, so that is really a plus for me, it’s normally something I look for, but it is hard to just find a light moisturizer with SPF. Moisturizer is super lightweight, decent smell, and then just goes on really nice. I’m a fan so far, and if nothing changes, then I will come back and 5 stars it. nan
