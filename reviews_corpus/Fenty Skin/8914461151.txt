Thanks to Bzzagent I was gifted this Fenty Cherry Treat Conditioning & Strengthening Lip Oil in exchange for my honest review. To be completely honest, I thought the packaging was painfully basic for such a mystique high end brand like Fenty. I found it so surprising. Quality wise, it was fine, a little thick for me, but then again I have yet to find a lip oil I actually love. On the bright side, I thought this Fenty Lip oil was beautifully light, making it so comfortable to apply and enjoyable to wear....thankfully so as many lip oils tend to be heavy and even greasy. Overall, lovely lip oil, unimpressive packaging. Plus and Minus.
