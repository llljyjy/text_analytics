As a lazy girl, i really like that I have a moisturizer and a sunscreen all in one, and it applies beautifully and smells really good. There is also no white cast, and itâ€™s not thick or oily, very perfect for summer. My only critique is the packaging, I wish it came with more product and less plastic. Buy it if you are lazy
