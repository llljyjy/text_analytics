Not sure why so many people are saying this product stinks. First of all, it’s a aha treatment so it’s not supposed to smell like sunshine & rainbows but it also doesn’t smell as bad as some say it does. I do think it’s a bit too expensive for the size, but I have been using it for a month & my skin has never been this glowy before ! Just wish it was a bit cheaper since it’s small that’s the only reason I’m not giving 5 starts Not The Cheapest, But Worth It In My Opinion
