I loved the concept, the text/ appearance of cookies and cream. It is aesthetically fun! Definitely use as directed - I had to use it only 1 per week, otherwise found that it left my skin feeling dry. Apart from that, I did not notice any change to the look or feel of my skin. This performs similarly to other masks you can find at the drugstore, but this product has a heftier price tag. I would not repurchase this product. nan
