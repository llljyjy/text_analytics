This product was probably the nicest face mask that I’ve ever had the pleasure of trying. I normally don’t do the whole face mask thing, but considering I was sent the product to test, I figured why not? I also had my fiancee try it with me, and she loved it as well. The feeling of the mask isn’t too bad, it’s light enough and not too sticky or uncomfortable. The smell isn’t strong and you don’t really notice you have it on too much, unlike other masks. I will say, that if used too much, it tended to dry my skin out. This is probably because I have rather sensitive skin, especially to any form of acne treatment acid, so it’s worthwhile to note that. However, when used every other day, or every few days, I didn’t have this issue. The stuff makes your skin softer and even managed to soften up my beard hairs some. I enjoyed it and would buy it and recommend it to a friend. My fiancee agreed and stated she’ll probably continue to buy it even if I don’t. Soft and Nice
