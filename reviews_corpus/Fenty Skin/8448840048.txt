This is the only lip oil that I’ve tried that doesn’t leave my lips feeling tacky or weird when it wears off. Usually when I use other lip oils like the Clarin’s one, my lips feel sticky and dehydrated after it wears off. This Fenty lip oil feels better than a lip balm when it’s on and after it wears off. The main differentiator of this product in comparison to other look oils I’ve tried is the texture. It’s not too thin so it won’t wear off your lips after two seconds and just leave them feeling greasy, and it’s not too thick – it won’t leave your lips sticky. I will definitely be purchasing this in the future The best
