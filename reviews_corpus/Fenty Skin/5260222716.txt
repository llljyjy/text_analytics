I received this as a free sample & I tried this in the shower for the first time and it smells like cocoa, not too strong but just a perfect touch of it. I like it so far. I tried it on my face as well and it definitely did the job of cleaning. I wouldn’t say it’s magic but I do definitely prefer something clean without all that bad stuff for our skin so this bar is definitely a clean gentle one. I’d give it a try! Smells like natural Cocoa
