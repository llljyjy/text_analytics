I’ve been using this for a week now and have noticed that my lips do seem softer and more hydrated. The smell is good and not overpowering, which is a huge benefit in my opinion. As advertised, it’s not sticky and the applicator makes it easy to apply. And a another benefit is that it’s helped heal my lips after I stayed in the sun too long and forgot to apply an SPF chapstick. Usually my lips hurt for a day or 2 and I applied it immediately as I started to feel pain and had relief within an hour. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Soothed my Sunburned Lips
