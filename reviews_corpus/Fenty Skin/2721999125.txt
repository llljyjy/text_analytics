There are so many options for a cleanser and this is the best one in my opinion. Straight to the point. Doesn’t make me feel dry at the end. Gets rid of any gunk. Love that it’s a squeeze bottle and you just turn it to close it. Even if I don’t use the balm eraser to get rid of make up this will do the trick after a few more scrubs than usual. nan
