I saw this right after I re-upped my Tatcha Kissu. I bought it immediately with the intention of returning the Tatcha if it was love. It wasn’t love and I’m keeping my Tatcha.  The Fenty lip mask is very thick and waxy and quite heavy on the lips. I find it uncomfortable to wear compared to Laneige and Tatcha. The only thing it has going for it is the dispenser which is more hygienic than the others. I get that it’s an overnight product but the others I’ve mentioned provide a better overall experience. I’m keeping it because I’ve already used it but I don’t enjoy it and won’t repurchase. The vanilla scent is not unpleasant. Not bad but No for me
