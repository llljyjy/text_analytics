I LOVE this bar! I have never used a bar soap that lathered this much, seriously oodles of suds.  Plus, it smells like cocoa butter and when rinsed off, it makes water bead on the skin which tells me it’s really moisturizing.  I don’t need to use a shower pouf or washcloth, just my hands.  I use on both my face and body and it leaves my skin velvety. I bought the FS soapdish as well to store the bar in. The bottom of the dish slides open to let the water drain out so the bar remains dry between uses. Perfect combo! nan
