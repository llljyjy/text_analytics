I recently got a free sample of this wonderful face mask from BzzAgent. As someone who has sensitive skin I was wary about trying this. Most of the masks I try my skin ends up angry this one though just made my skin feel great and refreshed. After a use I already noticed a difference in my skin. It just seems brighter and less dull. I would definitely recommend this to anyone! I kept it on about ten minutes it was easy to rinse off and not at all cakey. Amazing!!
