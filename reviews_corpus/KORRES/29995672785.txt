if you have problems with your skin with those annoying dilated pores, then this Korres cream will become your best ally, I have combination skin and my cheeks tend to dilate, and I know the pores look huge, and I was trying this cream and it has gone wonderfully, it reduces them quite a bit no more enlarged pores
