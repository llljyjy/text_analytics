I was pleasantly surprised by this moisturizer. It has a thick consistency but absorbs quickly. I have combination skin. I’m oily by my t-zone but dry everywhere else. This moisturizer helped a lot during the cold dry nights! It has a scent but I’m not sensitive so it did not bother me. That’s the reason there’s one less star. nan
