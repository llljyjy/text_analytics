This cream goes on super smoothly. It feels a little greasy at first but then soaks it and leaves a  really nice finish that goes really well under makeup. I wear lots of layers of products and this cream mixes well. I also really love the scent, which is very light and clean. Highly recommend! Feels and Smells Lovely
