I received this Product complementary exchange my honest review. This is a great moisturizer hands-down. It has a light fresh scent which is very pleasant and it is very moisturizing yet it absorbs into the skin very fast. I really like the container it comes into it is very easy to carry when you travel. Although I should probably say that I got a sample which came in a little plastic tube. It appears that the product comes in a glass jar in full size. The only reason I gave it four out of five stars it because I did not see a drastic improvement in my pores my pores are average size. But it could be just me or it might just be targeted for a limited population. Great moisturizer
