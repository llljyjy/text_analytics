I received this moisturizer complimentary for testing purposes. The things I liked most were that it provided optimal, all-day hydration without feeling heavy or greasy, left behind a nice, healthy glow and a smooth canvas for makeup application. It’s also worth mentioning that it smelled great, as well!My skin is a bit sensitive and tends to be  to be on the normal to dry side. However, I can get a bit oily at times. That said, I only see occasional breakouts so I don’t know that I would use this daily due to the salicylic acid. However, it might be nice to alternate with my regular moisturizer just to help keep the breakouts at bay. When I used this I had a small breakout on my chin and it was gone the next day. Overall, I liked it a lot and would consider purchasing Nice Moisturizer!
