I received this complimentary from Influenster for my honest review. I do enjoy the korres line In general, but this product is just “meh” for me. I didn’t notice much of a difference in my pore area, and I have huge pores. I’ve been using it everyday for 2 weeks, maybe I need to use it longer, I don’t know. It does however feel light on the skin, and I have very oily and acne prone skin. It doesn’t break me out, and the ingredients are nice in this. Overall I probably wouldn’t re-purchase this. nan
