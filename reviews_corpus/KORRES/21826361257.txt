I have large pores on my cheeks and I have been looking for a pore minimizing product that works for me. For someone with oily skin, it is important for me to find a product that works for me without causing breakouts. I can see my skin improving so much! My skin feels moisturized and my pores are now less visible! I definitely recommend. Poreless Hydration!
