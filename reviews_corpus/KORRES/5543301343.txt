I received a sample of this moisturizer in exchange for an honest review. The sample I received was quite small so I cannot say that it made any lasting changes to my skin. I did not notice a difference in my pores. The moisturizer applied easily and smells nice - the scent is not very strong. Overall itâ€™s nice but my sample did not make me want to purchase a larger size. Just ok
