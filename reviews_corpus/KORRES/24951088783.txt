I received the Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream free for review and I was immediately excited when I saw blurred pores! All my life I’ve had great skin but at 40 my skin is changing and I don’t like it. I have pores and texture I never use to have. It’s going to take at least a couple of weeks before I can decide if this is a product that’s going to go into my daily routine, but so far I’m really happy with what I see. The smell is pleasant, hardly has one, and the cream is not too thick. I really enjoy applying it after washing my face in the morning before applying makeup and in the evening after settling in for the night. My skin feels soft and smooth. I’m definitely happy with what I see so far. Feels great on my skin
