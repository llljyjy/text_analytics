This is definitely a skincare product I’m going to have to put away to try again for summer time use. I’ve been having severe dry skin issues with all of the arctic blasts we’ve been having in the Midwest and sadly this product made it worse. I only used it for a week as my AM moisturizer before I had to stop and switch back to my normal one. My pores do look great, however, so I know the ingredients are effective for my skin type. Since my skin gets pretty oily in the summer time, this should help a lot with it. Not good for severely dry skin.
