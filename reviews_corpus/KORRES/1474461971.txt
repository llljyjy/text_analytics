It makes sense that this product is made using grapes considering grapes have such nice even plump skin! Definitely poreless! Lol. This gel works well by itself but also can be added into your routine just fine. Its’ velvety texture kind of reminds me of Benefit’s Pore-fessional primer and seemed to work well and my skin’s texture overall does feels smoother. I’m also not surprised to see salicylic acid being the key featured ingredient, seeing as how it is King/Queen of the skincare world. I personally really like the tube it was sent to me in versus the full size tub container since I’m never a fan of dipping my fingers in and having product get under my nail/s. I would say that is the only con. It also smells lovely! 5/5 would recommend! What a GRAPE product
