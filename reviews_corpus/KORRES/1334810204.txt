Thank you to Korres and Influenster I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.What is it?A lightweight gel moisturizer that blurs pores, controls shine, and hydrates skin all-day using a powerful blend of Hyaluronic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Willowherb Extract, and the antioxidant-rich, Santorini Grape.Benefits include a poreless complexion, balanced all-day hydration and a smooth skin canvas.Sample packaging is a plastic tube.  Otherwise the full sized version comes in a recyclable jar. The print is very tiny and hard to read.  The product  is made in Greece.My thoughts:  A little goes a long way. It blends in well and absorbs quickly.  It does not leave my skin sticky or tacky. It does provide a smooth canvas on my skin for my makeup. My skin felt very hydrated. It has a perfume-like scent, which I do not like.  I prefer fragrance free as fragrances trigger my migraines.  I give it 3/5 stars Too scented
