The santorini grape porkers skin cream is awesome. It is so light weight on my face for any season including the hot humid ball season outdoors. The consistency out of the container is perfect and it wonâ€™t slide off my finger when applying. It feels amazing on my dry skin and provides the perfect amount of moisture without leaving behind any residue or oily look. I was impressed with the mostly natural ingredients. This was received free for my fair review from Influenster. KORRES Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream
