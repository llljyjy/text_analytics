I received a sample of this through Influenster and was impressed by the quality of the cream! I have normal/dry skin and it hydrates my skin throughout the day. The skin cream is lightweight and has a light/medium consistency (which I prefer!) This is great under makeup as a moisturizer before applying makeup. I noticed my concealer/foundation applying much more smoothly which makes me believe the poreless component does work! The only con for me is the smell. Itâ€™s not pleasant in my opinion. Great product with a slightly interesting smell
