What I loved: The consistency of this moisturizer was a nice mix between gel and cream and it sunk into my skin very quickly after applying. I also liked some of the ingredients (hello antioxidants).What I Didn’t Love: The moisturizer boasts its inclusion of salicylic acid, but it’s the 3rd to last ingredient listed which means there isn’t much in the formula. I’m fine with this though because I look to get my BHA exfoliation through serums/toners anyway. I have combination skin, but I didn’t feel that this moisturizer was hydrating enough for what my skin needs during the dry winter months. I’m still really thankful I received a sample of this moisturizer for free from Influenster to test out! Keep in mind that I only had a sample size to try so I’m not sure I saw results, but others who have different skin needs might with the full size. Nice Moisturizer, but Just Not For Me
