I wanted to like this cream, as my skin tolerates most moisturizers, but this product is unfortunately not very moisturizing. On my normal skin, it stays tacky for a while, then seems to just dry down, as opposed to really absorbing. I’ll stick with my Paula’s Choice moisturizer. This just didn’t agree with my skin. nan
