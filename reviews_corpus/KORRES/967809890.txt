I received this from Influenster. I like the consistency, scent, and amount of moisturizing it gives. The texture is nice, it doesn’t pill over my other face products like some moisturizers are prone to. I am bordering on dry skin, so at night it wasn’t enough moisture for me. It would good in the summer when I have to change creams due to sweating. nan
