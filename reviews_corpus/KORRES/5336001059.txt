I was very impressed by this moisturizer! Not only was it lightweight but it has a sweet scent, like sweet tarts, but not overpowering. I have tried gel moisturizers before and they would leave a sticky residue, not this, it is definitely more on the cream side. I also saw a huge difference in my skin, it was smoother and more supple. Definitely a must buy! Sweet and light
