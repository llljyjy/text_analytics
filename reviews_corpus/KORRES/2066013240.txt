I got this for free for my honest review. I got a tiny sample size so I wasn’t able to give it a full try but it did help a bit with a few pimples I had forming on my forehead which was great. It didn’t absorb as well in my skin as other moisturizers but it did ok.  I didn’t notice a change in my pore size either. It did help with tiny forming pimples to help keep my skin clearer. I will probably use it when I see issues starting but not as a daily moisturizer Not bad
