I received a sample of the Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream through @Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  This product is a lightweight gel moisturizer containing Santorini Grape Extract, Salicylic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, and Willowherb Extract.  It is best for those with oily, combination or sensitive skin. Benefits:Poreless complexionBalanced all-day hydrationSmooth skin canvas My experience:  I liked how lightweight this cream was, as it absorbed quickly without any greasy feel.  My skin does feel soft and smooth after using, but I don’t think it is a good match for my skin type (dry/dehydrated), as I don’t really have issues with large pores or oiliness.  It does contain salicylic acid as well as lactic acid, so the cream has some exfoliation benefits, and is not irritating. I received a sample size, which was enough to use for about 8 days (directions say use a nickel-sized amount for face & neck). I used it during the day as it isn’t moisturizing enough for a night cream (at least for me).  I would recommend for someone with oily/acne prone skin.  The only con for me is that it does contain added fragrance, but it is a mild smell that I didn’t mind. nan
