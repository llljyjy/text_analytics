This product is great if you have combo/oily skin. It’s lightweight and makes your skin feel smooth. Has an active ingredient, but doesn’t irritate skin. Absorbs fast. Unfortunately, it dries a little too fast for me in the winter months and need more moisture. Better for someone who doesn’t struggle with that. Lightweight moisture
