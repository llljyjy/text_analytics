I think the product is amazing. I live in NY and over the winter months my skin becomes so tight and dry. I struggle to find products that I don’t have to apply multiple times a day to find some relief. However Korres has almost instantly become a favorite. It’s soothing, hydrating and leaves my skin looking healthy! nan
