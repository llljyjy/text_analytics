received this product in exchange for an honest review.  I loved the feel of this moisturizer on my skin, and the fact that it contains salicylic acid!  Silky smooth, yet very hydrating for my dry skin.  The only thing I didnâ€™t love was the added fragrance, it smelled like sunscreen, but the product has no SPF. Nice moisturizer
