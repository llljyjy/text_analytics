Really loved this cream as a nightly moisturizer. I wake up to a fresh feeling face and feeling very soft and smooth. I donâ€™t really enjoy it so much in the morning as it feels a bit creamy for my morning routine. However, I did notice my makeup just sits nicer lately. Definitely recommend. I have very sensitive skin as this cream did not irritate so that is a definite plus. Lightweight and Smooth
