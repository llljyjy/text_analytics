I received this compliments of Influenster for my honest review. Let me just tell you that I wasn’t over the moon to try this. I mean, I try A LOT of stuff, so when I received the sample it took a couple of weeks to open it. I am 43, and suffer from hormonal acne and I can’t seem to find anything that hydrates, but doesn’t cause the acne to flare up more. This is it y’all! It goes on under makeup so smoothly, but I honestly think it’s just that my skin is actually smoother now. I will actually be buying this and adding it to my morning routine. Love this stuff!
