This is a great, lightweight day cream that hydrates and evens out skin texture!   I didn’t really notice a change in my pores, but I love it anyway!  It is great for under makeup, it really improved the look and feel of my skin.  I did notice also that my skin wasn’t as greasy at the end of the day!  I would definitely consider buying again! Poreless skin cream
