This cream is one of the best I’ve ever tried. It’s has Hyaluronic Acid which helps locks in moistures and is one of the important ingredients in any skincare products, also included as well is Salicylic Acid which is one of the main ingredients in this cream. Salicylic Acid helps your acne by going into your pores and dries, heals and softens your skin. I’ve seen tremendous difference with my skin by just using this cream for two weeks. I’m definitely buying this cream again. Love
