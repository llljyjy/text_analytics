I was excited to try this product due to all of the ingredients it has and claims it makes. The claims are true! I like to use a skin care product for at least a few weeks so I can gauge how my skin will react. This one felt like it showed results in about 2 weeks. My skin is clearer and less congested, my pores are clearer which overall makes them look less noticeable (because there is no such thing as actually poreless, but in this case Iâ€™ll make an exception). As someone in healthcare who has to wear a mask for over 12 hours a day sometimes more or multiple times, I have become someone who has maskne and battled tons of congestion. My skin has become softer with less texture and the overall health of my skin has improved! I will definitely be repurchasing! Great Ingredients!
