I received this product complimentary from Influenster to review and I was REALLY hoping to love it, I had just run out of my normal (PTR waterdrench) when it arrived. It didn’t seem to absorb into my skin, so my face ended up feeling dry still, but with a layer of product on top of it. It felt thick & heavy, & didn’t spread well either and I felt I had to use over twice as much product as I normally would to cover my face. I do have sensitive skin and I did not have any sensitivity related reactions to it. I would still not repurchase. REALLY wanted to like it
