I received a sample of this product from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review. This does not leave my skin feeling greasy like other salicylic acid moisturizers I’ve tried (Cera Ve and Philosophy). It also doesn’t irritate my acne prone skin. It didn’t wow me, but it’s a good daily moisturizer. Good daily moisturizer
