I received this complimentary from testing purposes. I have combination skin that starts out dry but gets oily. Itâ€™s imperative to have a good cream to have the right amount of moisturizer prevent my skin from getting too oily. This skin cream delivers that. It is hydrating without feeling too heavy on my skin, which is the best part of gel creams. I feel it makes my pores less noticeable as well. Having Hyaluronic Acid and Salicylic Acid is also a plus for me. I would definitely buy this and use it in my daily routine. nan
