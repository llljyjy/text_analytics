I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.Honestly, this cream is okay… not crazy about it.The scent is a little strange in my opinion. It does hydrate, but if you have really dry skin you would definitely need something more intense. I don’t mind it but I don’t think I’d purchase on my own dime. okay product
