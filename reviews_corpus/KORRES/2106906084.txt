This product was better than I thought itâ€™d be. I ended up really liking it, it makes my face so soft, my skin looks moisturized and glowy. I has a slight green grape scent it applies evenly and easily it is lightweight and absorbs very well.  Not sticky at all.  After 2 weeks of use my pores actually do appear a bit smaller and my skin texture an bit smoother also. Great moisturizer
