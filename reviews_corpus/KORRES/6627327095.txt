I like this skin cream because I do notice a decrease in my pores especially on my nose where they’re the biggest. I can’t say it’s a huge difference but it is noticeable. I also like this cream because it does keep my face moisturized and soft for the whole day. As someone with sensitive and combination skin, irritation is a concern but I had none with this and it didn’t leave me looking greasy on my T-zone either. The only thing I disliked about it was the smell of it..it smells like clay to me. Besides that, totally love it. It was easy to fit into my skincare routine of a face wash, eye cream, and serum.
