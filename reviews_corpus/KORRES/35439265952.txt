Definitely gives a ’glow’! 1 drop is literally all that I need, as any more than that and my skin starts to look oily. I love the sleek green packaging and dropper, although I’m not sure it does a great job at protecting the serum from sunlight/UV, so I tend to keep it hidden behind some of my other products, where the sunlight can’t reach. The bottle itself appears deceptively larger than a normal 1oz (30ml) bottle, but if you look closely, you realize it has a ’false’ bottom which takes up almost the entire lower half of the bottle space. Not exactly sure why a normal 1 oz bottle wouldn’t have sufficed instead? As this contains a good amount of antioxidants, I feel it’s important they be protected, and that’s one thing that could be improved with the packaging. Speaking of antioxidants, it’s the main reason I purchased this product, and I have noticed a difference whilst I’ve been using it in terms of skin being more supple and brighter (antioxidants effect being more of a long-term use benefit). The only downside to this serum is the fact that it contains drying ’alcohol denat’ which isn’t beneficial in the long run. I have no idea how much is in here, but without that and the Grapefruit-like fragrance, this would have been a perfect product. I’ll continue to use it, but keeping these two points in mind, I likely won’t be repurchasing as alcohol and fragrance are two things I try to avoid in skincare.~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
