I never find myself using one moisturizer exclusively & I’m always on the hunt for a new one. Before I bought this I was alternating between Tatcha, Dr. Brandt, YTTP, Peace Out, and Paula’s Choice just to name a few. I’d use one based on what I felt my skin needed at the moment- but every time one would moisturize my skin nicely, I always felt like it highlighted another problem area, like it’d make my pores look bigger. I don’t really have so many blackheads but I def have combo skin & controlling sebum without over drying my skin is always a balancing act. I bought this on a whim & I absolutely love it. I have hundreds of dollars worth of creams sitting on my counter & I end up reaching for this every single time. It hydrates my skin so I’m not worrying about fine lines but has salicylic acid so reduces my pores & controls sebum or the occasional break out excellently! I’m so happy I stumbled upon this, I sincerely hope they never stop making it! I actually bought this & love it!
