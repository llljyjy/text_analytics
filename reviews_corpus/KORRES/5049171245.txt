I havent used it quite long enough to give a full opinionated review so take my initial impressions with a grain of salt. The texture us nice--lightweight, almost watery in the way it absorbs quickly and cleanly. It has a light fruit kind of scent and it’s main ingredient is salicylic acid so don’t forget to wear your sunscreen with this! I think it’s worth a shot if you like an active in your moisturizer and looking for a lightweight gel that absorbs into skin well Gentle, lightweight moisturizer
