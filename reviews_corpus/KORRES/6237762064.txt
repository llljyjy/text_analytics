This cream just feel o so moisturizing! I have very dry skin especially during the winter time. I now have very dry and scaly and cracked knuckles and my nose is peeling at the moment. But this cream calmed my nose and my hands although it’s not meant for hands, but when your hurting and there is nothing else in sight your going to use what you got. And by god darn it actually helped no pain either like burning or anything! When I tell you this cream is good I mean it! I have tried so many others and there have been some good but this one right here is EVERYTHING! It’s moisturizing and nourishing and help heal my patchy skin! It’s amazing in my opinion!♥️ Wow
