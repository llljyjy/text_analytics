I received this complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I love Korres in general, but I really loved this! The first thing I noticed was the nice scent and how velvety smooth it made my skin feel. I like how it did indeed keep my shine at bay and it might be psychosomatic, but I feel like my pores arenâ€™t as noticeable either. I look forward to continuing use with thus and can see myself purchasing once this is out. nan
