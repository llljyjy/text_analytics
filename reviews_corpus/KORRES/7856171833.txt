I have noticed that this cream actually works! I’m a type of person that has really large pores, dryness here and there, oil as well here and there, my skin also peels a lot as well. I started using this cream once a day in the mornings after cleansing my face and I did noticed that my skin was moisturized. Not oily since it is a really lightweight cream and it’s not oily at all. My skin felt soft and you could tell my pores had minimize as well. Now I use it twice a day and totally love it. However I did wish it could have a little bit of scent since I am a fan of smells. But it works just fine love it. I love it!
