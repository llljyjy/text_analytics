I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. Overall a really nice face cream! Pros: lovely texture, sinks in quickly, didn’t break me out. Cons: scented (I prefer unscented products for my face, may not be a con for most people), didn’t see any change in my pore size, not moisturizing enough on its own for my skin in the winter so I had to layer it under my usual moisturizing face cream. Overall I’d recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin who doesn’t mind a light scent! nan
