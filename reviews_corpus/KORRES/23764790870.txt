Love it!! I think this skin cream is better than a number of others I’ve tried in the past, and those were all far more expensive! I can honestly say I love everything about this product: smell, feel, look... All 10/10 for me! Some facial creams are far heavier feeling, some are too ’wet’, some make me break out a bit, but Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream is none of those... It is light, hydrating (without being too ’wet’), and I haven’t had any bad skin reactions! I highly recommend for dry to normal skin that is just starting to age and need some extra moisture! I only use at night right now and I feel like that is just enough for me, but I do think that it would also work great under make up in the morning. Love it!!
