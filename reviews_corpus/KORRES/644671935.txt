Received complimentary from Influenster. My skin is combo leaning dry, and needs hydration especially in winter. I don’t find this moisturizer to do much for my skin and it’s not hydrating enough for me. When I had oily skin this probably would’ve been great, and I think it’s definitely made for those with normal to oily skin. It has salicylic acid which I don’t really need or use, but someone dealing with acne or blemishes might find helpful. Haven’t noticed any difference in my pores, I’ve used it consecutively for 16 days. It’s not a bad product, just not for my skin. not for dry skin
