I received this item for free from Influenster for my honest review. I naturally have dry skin but during these cold winter months it’s gotten much worst. After about a week of using this I noticed my skin looks much better. A small amount goes a long way. It feels very lightweight and keeps my skin hydrated longer than other creams I’ve tried these past cold months. Overall it’s a great product and I plan to incorporate this into my permanent skincare routine. nan
