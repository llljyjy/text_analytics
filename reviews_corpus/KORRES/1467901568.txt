When using products, I’m very skeptical when it says it’s for sensitive skin, because my skin is extremely sensitive. Anything I use can trigger a rash! This product however, did not! I did a patch test on my hand, since my hand normally reacts the same as my face with products. The smell was amazing, the feel was buttery soft! I was super excited putting it on my face! Felt so moisturizing! It didn’t minimize the appearance of my pores, which isn’t a deal breaker for me, (maybe just a little). It felt very lightweight and it didn’t make my skin feel like something was clearly added on top of it! I’m a little sad that i received such a small sample, but I am definitely purchasing a full size container of this stuff! LOVE IT! nan
