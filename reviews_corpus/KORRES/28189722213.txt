I received a deluxe sample of this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I like this product! I wouldn’t use it as a night cream, but it makes an excellent daytime moisturizer for my skin type. I’m 40+, have combination skin that gets oily in the t-zone, and have occasional hormonal breakouts. My skin is very sensitive. Not only did this not irritate my skin, it actually cleared up a small breakout. It’s a light moisturizer, that controlled some of my t-zone oil. It looks beautiful under my foundation. It worked very well with my cream products and my base looked better longer than it does with my usual skin prep. I plan on buying a full size. It’s the first product I’ve actually loved from Influenster. nan
