I was very excited to try this face cream. I saw that it contained Salicylic Acid and was happy to know that this would also help with my acne prone skin. The cream itself melts nicely into your skin. You can tell almost immediately that your skin looks tighter. I used it twice a day for a week to see how it would work. First off, it did cause a little sensitivity, but that’s normal when using an acid. However, I saw a noticeable difference in my skin. My pores were smaller, but skin was softer and seemed more even toned. I don’t even know if it was supposed to help with that, but I just had a nice glow. I definitely want to continue using this product to see long term results. Great face cream
