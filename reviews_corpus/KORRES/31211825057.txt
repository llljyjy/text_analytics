I enjoy using this moisturizer. It feels very light on my skin and absorbs quickly. I am surprised that it actually blurs the pores as it promises. Another amazing feature it has is that it contains salicylic acid that treats acne well and reduces blemishes and redness. I love the light creamy texture and fresh grape scent of this Korres Grape Cream. I am very satisfied with my product. Light and hydrating
