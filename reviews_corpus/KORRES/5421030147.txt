I recently tried the yoghurt line and loved it, so I was excited to try the grape products when I received this sample for free. I really like it and use it more as a spot treatment because it is very thin, and not as strong as I need for Wisconsin winters. I’m excited to see how it’ll do in the summer. Overall I like it and would buy again A new Korres fan
