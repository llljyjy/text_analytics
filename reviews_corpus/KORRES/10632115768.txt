I have combination skin that gets a little unhappy during the winter because it can’t decide whether to dry out or over-produce oils. This moisturiser is lightweight & absorbs fairly quickly, but isn’t quite thick enough to retain moisture throughout the day when it’s cold & dry outside. My skin does feel soft & supple after application, & I enjoyed the light refreshing scent with hints of fruity sweetness. Good for summer
