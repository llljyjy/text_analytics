My skin has been very sensitive lately, I’m using some acids on my skin, and I went to test this cream. The texture is very emollient, you can see that it moisturizes... I passed it on my face and it really moisturized very well. Regarding pores, he did a low job of filling the pores, it seems like a weaker primer. But for hydration I will definitely continue to use it. That’s okay
