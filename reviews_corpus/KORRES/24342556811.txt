I like the korres poreless cream. It kept my face hydrated all day and made my skin feel so much better. I have been using this for a week now and apply it before my regular moisturizer. My skin looks and feels so much better since using it. I’ve never really had an issue with my pores so I can’t say anything about that but it does hydrate my skin really well. It is a good product for the price. Keeps my face hydrated
