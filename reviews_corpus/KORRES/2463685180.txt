I use this mask usually during winter time, and for context I live in a dry climate so winter is usually super rough on my hair and skin. This mask leaves my skin feels deeply moisturised and plump. Leave it in the fridge or someplace cool to preserve it, but honestly you can also mix Greek yoghurt and honey for a DIY. nan
