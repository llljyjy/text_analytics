I felt this cream was just ok for me. Did it reduce my pore size? Yes I definitely saw a difference in pore size when using this cream. I wasn’t a fan of the texture of the cream, it wasn’t heavy or oily but it wasn’t light either. For my skin it just wasn’t right, it kept it hydrated but I also had some clogged pores while using it. I think another letdown for me was the light almost lacking scent, I was expecting the scent of grapeseed oil or even something a little more. If you like a no/low scent cream this would be something I reccomend. Pore reducing
