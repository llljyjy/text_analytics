The product has a nice light grape scent but not overwhelming- it’s a clean scent. The cream goes on evenly and leaves my skin feeling smooth. I don’t know a huge positive difference in using this product - however, it did not cause my sensitive skin to breakout or have a negative reaction. This product boasts Salicylic Acid, but I don’t notice the usual skin clearing benefits of it. Good, but not Holy Grail
