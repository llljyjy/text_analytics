I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. It smells like a DREAM and it’s subtle too! It’s lightweight, which is perfect for my oily skin, and still hydrating. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. To test the product, I switched out my usual moisturizer and use this for both my morning and night routine. No irritation at all and does well under makeup. nan
