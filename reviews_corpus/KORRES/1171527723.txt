The cream is light and it dissolves on the skin instantly.Itâ€™s a good cream, I used as directed, twice per day but I did not notice improvement on my pores. They are still large and in charge. Would certainly need something stronger but it is a good cream overall. I did only try a sample size of the cream and only used for 2 weeks. Maybe the difference comes with a bit more time.
