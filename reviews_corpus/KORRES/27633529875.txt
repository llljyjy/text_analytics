Overall okay, I received this product as a complementary gift from Influenster, and it was overall okay, I didn’t really feel my pores minimized but I did feel a nice hydrated sensation on my skin. I wouldn’t repurchase this product because I didn’t seem to see a huge difference on my skin after using it for weeks nor would I buy it again for the price point. Overall okay
