I received this product complementary from Influenster for testing purposes. I like the texture of this product and that it goes on my skin very lightly. It has a subtle scent to it and it’s not overwhelming. I can’t say I noticed too much of a difference, as I don’t really have an issue with my pore size, but I do like the product. It definitely left my skin feeling soft and smooth. good product
