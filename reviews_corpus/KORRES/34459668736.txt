In my opinion this is a really good product. I like the smooth texture and light fragrance it has. This product was thick enough to leave my skin feeling hydrated and it wasnt to heavy to cause the purses to become clogged.  This really helped my skin to feel refreshed and not so thirsty. This seemed to allow my makeup to have a smoothier, more defined finish. I havenâ€™t used it long enough to notice a difference in my pore size, but it seems promising. nan
