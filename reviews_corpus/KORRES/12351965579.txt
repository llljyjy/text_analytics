I recieved this from influenster and korres for my honest review. I want to say first I have combo skin. I love the formula it is thick but not greasy. Dried down beautifully. Has a good smell. Also hydrated my skin so nicely with no adverse effects. No redness or irritation. I truly do enjoy using this cream. Works great
