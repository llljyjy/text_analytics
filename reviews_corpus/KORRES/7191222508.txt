I got a sample from influenter to test and I’m kinda disappointed. I didn’t notice any difference on my skin, I felt it hidrated but it was all I felt. Nothing change regarding Poreless result. It also irritate my skin, and I’m usually not sensitive to facial products. Considering price and expected results, not sure if this product is all it supposed to be. Okay moisturizer
