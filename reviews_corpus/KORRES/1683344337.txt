It is a light weight gel moisturizer that is rich with antioxidants. The cream is non sticky. It moisturizes the skin without leaving a shiny or oily feel. It claims to blur pores but honestly I can still see them. I love that it has Hyaluronic acid, Jojoba Seed Oil, Macadamia Seed Oil and Salicylic Acid that keep the skin looking clear and fresh. The cream can be worn both by Oily or  Combination-Sensitive skin types. Packed with antioxidants
