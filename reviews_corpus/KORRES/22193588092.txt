Like how this product smells and feels when applying to your skin. I’ve been using it on one side of my face to compare to the other and haven’t really noticed my pores appearing any different but, I have noticed my skin feeling more hydrated! It seems more of a moisturizer than anything else. Good product though! It’s good.
