I was truly skeptical about trying this poreless serum. I don’t like to try new things on my skin. But being that it’s by a brand I trust; why not. Now I had to get used to the smell. It was a little offputting and leaned towards rotten and unpleasant. But the texture made the application enjoyable with the smooth gel-like feel. A little bit really goes a long way. I love how it felt against my skin. Over the next few days, I had an immediate improvement in my skin. Currently suffering from mask rash, this couldn’t have come at a better time. It smoothed out my skin and reduced the size of my pores. The roughness around my brow line is gone. My skin is going back to normal. I almost gave up and thought it was a getting older thing. My skin doesn’t like the material used in masks and fights back in a horrible facial rash. I got great relief and results. it was amazing to find something that not only healed my skin but made it look better. OMG...What Surpurise!
