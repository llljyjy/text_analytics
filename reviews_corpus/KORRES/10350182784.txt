This moisturizer is great! It doesn’t make your skin feel oily or greasy, and absorbs very nicely into your skin. It has a very light scent, so if you aren’t a fan of scents, I think you’d be safe with this moisturizer. It is lightweight and feels nice. I will say, my skin is on the normal/dry side so I feel like I need more moisture than what this provides. However I think it would be perfect for someone with less thirsty skin! Also the salicylic acid would be great for anyone who has acne prone skin. Overall I think it’s a great product, with great ingredients. nan
