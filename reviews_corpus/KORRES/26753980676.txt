I received a free sample of this and was excited to try it. The sample came with quite a bit of product and I applied it to my face, neck, chest, and arms. The product did make my skin look and feel GREAT (my skin was so soft and glowy) but the smell was awful. I debated taking it off right away because the smell was so off putting. I think it’s the “grape” in the product, there is a very funky, sour smell. The smell isn’t strong but is noticeable enough to be bothered by it. I would buy this in a heartbeat if it was fragrance-free but for now I’m going to pass. my skin loved it but my nose didn’t!
