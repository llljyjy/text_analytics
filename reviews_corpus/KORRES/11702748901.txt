The first day I used it I was like, meh! But boy was I wrong. I’m glad I kept using it. My skin is glowing and hydrated. It’s especially a fave of mine because it is so lightweight but delivers a very nourished, moisturized skin. It does what it says!!! And a little goes a long way! I received it complimentary for testing purposes. Daily hydration for glowing skin
