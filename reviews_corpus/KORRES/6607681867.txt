I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. This cream is definitely nice, it has a clean light scent and goes on really smooth. My skin looked dewy and bright after using it and it lasted about 8 hours which I would consider long lasting. I really enjoyed using this and will definitely use it again. nan
