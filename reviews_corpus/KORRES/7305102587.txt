I was really excited to receive this free from influenster. I have combination skin very oily but in the winter very dry as well. This cream not only kept my oil at Bay but it also kept my skin nice and moisturized in the winter months in Connecticut. My skin felt super soft after I used it daily. I am definitely likely to purchase this when my little sample is done. #ThatGreekGlow @korres Korres skin cream
