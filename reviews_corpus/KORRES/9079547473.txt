I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.  It is a creamy but light moisturizer. It isnâ€™t greasy and application is smooth. I have combination skin and everytime I wake up after a night of using this, my skin feels like it is glowing. I appreciate too that it has three key ingredients to help minimize pores, and keep your skin moisturized with Salicylic Acid. Not greasy!
