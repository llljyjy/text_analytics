I received this product free from Korres and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is a light weight cream ideal for daytime use. It contains salicylic acid which effectively aids in alleviating sebum buildup/congestion in pores, and in turn makes pores less noticeable. However, SA is drying by nature, so don’t expect a deeply hydrating moisturizer. If you have oily skin or experience excessive sebum production, this will likely work very well for you. My skin leans dry, so I found myself reaching for a hydrating mist throughout the day while testing this cream. Overall, I think this product works well for it’s intended use. Best For Oily Skin
