This product is probably one of my favorite from korres as far as a face moisturizers I have tried a couple and they are thicker and don’t absorb as well into my skin the sycilic acid is wonderful and I’m very happy I was able to try this definitely a great travel moisturizer and I definitely would recommend it to people who have problematic skin and need a basic yet potent moisturizer Gentle and effective
