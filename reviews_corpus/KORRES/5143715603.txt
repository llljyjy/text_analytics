this is my second product i’ve tried from this company and been sent to review for free and it’s quite nice. i enjoy the texture and consistency. i was sent a small sample so i’m not sure how long term this product works for my skin but i find it hydrating and the scent isn’t too overwhelming either. wish it was less scented but what can you do! pretty nice!
