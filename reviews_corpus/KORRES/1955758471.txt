My skin loves it! Firstly, it smells great. Also, I did notice that it cleared up my skin after a bit of use. I didn’t necessarily notice a direct change in my pores which is why I’m leaving a 4 instead of 5 (I should have paid closer attention to this and taken a before and after because it’s hard to tell). I also was worried this would dry out my skin but it didn’t at all! Would definitely recommend. Also, I received this complimentary in exchange for my honest review My skin loves it!
