Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin cream is pretty great stuff. It has a perfect texture, not too thin, not too thick. It goes on light and smooth and doesn’t feel greasy. My skin absorbed this well and drank it all up!It has a real subtle scent, so if you like scent free products, I think you’ll really enjoy this one.  Personally, I was a little disappointed, I had hoped it would smell like grapes.Needless to say, my skin felt hydrated and supple to the touch, with an almost airbrushed finished. I was really impressed with this one.I received this product complimentary in return for my honest feedback. Good Quality Moisturizer
