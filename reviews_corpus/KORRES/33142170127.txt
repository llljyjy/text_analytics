I originally received this product as  a free sample and wasnâ€™t sold on it because of how it clogged my pores and made me look greasy. I ended up loving it so much that I bought a bottle. It is a little expensive for me, but lasts a long time. I only use a couple of drops at a time. I apply a drop to each cheek, avoiding my t-zone. It makes me skin so hydrated and soft! I absolutely love it. If I am using it at night I may use a little more, but for skin prone to oiliness and clogged pores be sure to use sparingly. nan
