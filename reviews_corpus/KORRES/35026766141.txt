I love how silky and smooth this cream makes your face! It smells amazing and still feels amazing on your face even a while after applying. I usually do not like to spend much at all on skin products and look at the ingredients to compare the quality over price, but this cream takes only a tiny amount and spreads like a dream over the entire face so the tiny tub it comes in would actually last a while and justify the price for this cheapskate. :) Test subject approved!
