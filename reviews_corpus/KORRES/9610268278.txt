Received this product complimentary from @influenster for my honest review. I need a bigger jar of this product. I have the most sensitive skin that products burn face even marked as itâ€™s safe for sensitive skin. This product not only did it not burn my face, it smells amazing. Not overpowering. It not greasy, absorbs well into the skin and your face feels so soft to the touch. Face feeling smooth
