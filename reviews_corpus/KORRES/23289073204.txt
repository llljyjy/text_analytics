I applied this cream to my face & neck as directed. It was thin & rubbed in well. It felt silky & had a light scent. I am 43 & honestly did not see much improvement with this. I do give this 4 stars as it does moisturize @ claims “90.8% Natural Origin Content”. Ingredients include the Santori Grape Fruit Extract & a few more natural oils. The package is also recyclable! nan
