This cream is okay. I received this free from Influenster and target in exchange for my honest review. This is not my favorite. It’s supposed to make the skin poreless it did not change anything about my pores. It feels like lotion which I hate so there’s that. But it didn’t even add any moisture it dried down and made my skin feel more dry than before so that’s no fun. Would not recommend. it’s not great
