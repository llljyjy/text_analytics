I received this product from Influenster complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion and I’m so happy I did! I’ve used it twice daily for a couple weeks now and wow at the results. My skin feels soft and radiant and my pores seem smaller verses before using Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream. Winter is brutal on my skin because in our line of work we’re out in the winter weather so my skin is always chapped and peeling but not since starting this product! Now it’s glowing and even looks much more hydrated and overall healthy. I can’t wait to continue seeing the results this product will do because so far I’m definitely a fan! Moisturizing!
