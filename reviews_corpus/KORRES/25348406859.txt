I got this product to try and I’ve been giving it a good shot for a couple of weeks. First off, I hate the smell of this product but it feels lightweight and nice on the skin. I don’t notice much overall difference using this product but I don’t mind how if feels when I first put it on. I prefer my other moisturizer but this isn’t bad. I like the ingredients. nan
