Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream has a very nice, light texture. I love the scent which is mild, but pleasing as I am sensitive to scents. Itâ€™s really helped my acne on my face clear up while keeping my skin nice and smooth. I was given this to sample for free from Korres and Influenster for my honest review. This is my own opinion.
