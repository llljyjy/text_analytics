It’s not my favorite moisturizer. I’ve always been a fan of Korres products, but this broke me out and I didn’t notice an improvement in my skin. Overall, it’s not something I would purchase for myself. I have combination skin that has some fine lines and acne. I’ve used products that work much better in the past. This product isn’t for me.
