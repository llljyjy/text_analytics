The texture of the cream is a little on the thicker side which I don’t mind since I live in a dry environment. It claims to benefit those with oily/combo skin, but I noticed I would get super shiny throughout the day and each morning after applying it at night. The salicylic acid did keep my skin/pores clear and skin’s texture smooth. My pores slowly started to reduce in size the more I used it. I’d recommend this to anyone that doesn’t have oily skin. This will be too heavy for me in the summer months. Hydrating but leaves my skin oily
