I’ve received this product from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review. I have a normal to dry skin, and did not notice any change in my pores, will keep using it to see if it’ll make any difference in the future. It has a very subtle scent and feels great on my skin. Works well as a moisturizer. Good Moisturizer
