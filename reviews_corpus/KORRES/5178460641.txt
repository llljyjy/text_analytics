I received this complimentary from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest opinion. After using it for a bit, I’ve found it’s a nice moisturizer for my combination skin. It feels light but moisturizes nicely. It doesn’t feel greasy and my skin feels soft and smooth. I don’t think it greatly reduced the size of my pores but that’s okay - all faces have texture! Nice Base
