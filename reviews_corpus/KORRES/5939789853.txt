I received a sample of this product complimentary for my honest review from Influenster and Korres. I have sensitive skin, and this lightweight moisturizer did not irritate my skin. It also sinks in/absorbs quickly, which is great if you’re in a rush before work (like I am 99% of the time). I have seasonally dry skin, so this winter, I don’t think I could use this moisturizer by itself. I use this with my current skincare routine that includes a hydration serum, so that’s how it works for me. I’ve also tried this under makeup, and it plays well with my current products. As for the pore-minimizing characteristics, I can’t say much about that. I didn’t notice a huge difference. Overall, I think it’s a good moisturizer that may work best for those with normal/oily skin and for the spring/summer seasons. Lightweight and Absorbs Quickly!
