I received a complimentary sample to review. This moisturizer has a gel cream texture that is light and absorbs quickly into the skin. It left my skin feeling nice and soft. I do like that there is salicylic acid in it to help keep blemishes away. However, I didnâ€™t see any of the blurring properties that it claims. Overall, it is not a bad moisturizer and would recommend it to try for those who have oily or combo skin. nan
