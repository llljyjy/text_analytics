I received a sample size product of this gel moisturizer and I have a few thoughts already. First i think this would act great for my skin type more as a primer underneath makeup vs as a moisturizer. I currently need more hydrating moisturizers and creams during these winter months so this definitely does not work for me currently....however in summer I am more oily and think this would be a great option for me then. I did see my skin had a smoother appearance but it isnt the most porefilling cream out there either. I definitely want to try this out again in the summer and see if I like it more then as well as underneath makeup. nan
