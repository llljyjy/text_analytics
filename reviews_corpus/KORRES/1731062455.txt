I received a sample of Korres Santorini Grapes Poreless Skin Cream to try in exchange for my honest review. I am always looking for new products to my skincare routine, so I was excited to give this cream a try. I have combination skin, so sometimes creams can be difficult to use when some parts of my face are dry and some are more oily; however, this was not the case with Korres! I only received a small sample, but as others have mentioned, a little goes a long way! I’ve been able to use this as part of my skincare routine both day and night for about 2 weeks now, and I have seen visible results. Since using this product, I do feel like my skin looks more hydrated and my pores are less noticeable. I can definitely tell in photos of myself that my skin looks healthier and more vibrant- I am loving these results. The cream itself is made with Santorini grapes, which really gives the product a fresh and natural smell that I love! As other have mentioned, the cream goes on smoothly and soaks into my skin easily, which doesn’t leave a sticky or greasy feeling on my face. I know this product is a bit of a splurge, but since just a small dab goes a long way, the full size is likely to last awhile. If you want to treat your skin to the intense moisture it deserves, definitely splurge on the Korres Santorini Grapes Poreless Skin Cream! Fresh and Clean Feel
