This was light but provided great moisture without being too heavy to use under a mask. My skin breaks out frequently due to mask use and this didnâ€™t exacerbate that at all. The scent Is light and it goes on smoothly, without feeling greasy. I received the product free from Influenster in exchange for my review. nan
