I received this product in exchange for my honest review. This lotion is incredibly light and has a wonderful fresh smell that is not heavy. I noticed an improved glow on my face after using, yet it never appeared to be oily or shiny. I found it to be a great base before I apply my primer and foundation. I would definitely recommend this product. Great Lightweight Lotion
