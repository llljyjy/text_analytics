I had not heard of the brand Korres until now and I am surprised with this cream as it’s very lightweight gel moisturizer. I don’t have a big problem with pores however this cream makes my makeup looks smooth and last long. It doesn’t let the makeup crease after a long day. I do have dry skin and this moisturize made my skin feel very hydrating for long time without making it oily. Love it. Lightweight and refreshing!
