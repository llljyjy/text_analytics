I like Korres, but this product was not suited for my skin. I have combo skin, but in the winter (right now) tend to get very dry. While this is a nice light moisturizer, it wasn’t wasn’t fit for me. I did give this to a teen and she loved it! Great for her acne and perfect for her skin type. I you have oily or “normal“ skin this might be a good fit for you! great for oily skin!
