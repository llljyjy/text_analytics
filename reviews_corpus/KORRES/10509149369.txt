I received this product free for review from Korres and Influenster. Let me first say that my skin has changed over the last year. My skin went from combination to dry very fast. That aside I can see where it would be good for Combination and oily skin. I’m not sure if I had normal skin I would like it. When I used it my skin looked very dry. I had high hope because of squalene in the product. As for blurring my pores that didn’t happen. All in all it’s an ok moisturizer for normal, combo and oily skin and I would recommend for those skin types for a daily moisturizer that is lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin! Combination and Oily skin recommended
