I was expecting more of a grape scent but there really wasn’t any of that but it was a good moisturizer. I think it would have been better for an oilier skin bc my skin is usually dry and sensitive and it kind of dries me out more. I don’t know how much it helped with blemishes but didn’t cause me to break out so I take that as a win nan
