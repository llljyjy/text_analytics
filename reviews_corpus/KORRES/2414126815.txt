I received this product complimentary from Korres and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I actually really love this cream, the jars are really beautiful. It is a light formula and I did not experience that greasy feeling I often get from moisturizers. As someone with sensitive skin, I appreciate the weightless texture of this product. It does not cause any breakouts or clog my pores. I love the smell of this product because it is light and earthy. light on skin and scent!
