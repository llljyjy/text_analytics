This product is alright, I have combination skin but the oiliest part of my skin is my nose and the rest of my face is normal. So I was really hoping this would help even out my nose with the rest of my skin but it didn’t. It did keep the rest of my skin feeling the same but I’m really disappointed it didn’t do anything to my nose. Besides that it has a nice light smell and it easily seeps into my skin which is nice. But for me personally I wouldn’t buy this in the future. nan
