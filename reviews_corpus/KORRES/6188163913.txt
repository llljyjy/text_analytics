I used this cream is replacement for my usual morning moisturizer, after washing and toning. Wow, I have never used an SPF moisturizer that was actually so moisturizing and not tacky! I really enjoyed this, and it sat nicely under my makeup. Additionally, the smell was lovely! Lightly grapey, big fan. Great product and scent!
