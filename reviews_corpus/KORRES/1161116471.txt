The experience: Living in LA, skincare has to prioritize humidity, which has been <15% when I was trying out this facial cream. Due to the dry climates, this product was not quite enough to be used alone for my normal to dry-combination skin as a daily moisturizer; however, Iâ€™ve discovered a very powerful specialty purpose for it. I used this as a 2nd serum under another heavier moisturizer for several nights before menstrual period cycle. The combination of salicylic acid and hyaluronic acid help me to combat that annoying hormonal breakout, and recover faster than without this cream. That was a huge win for regaining that skin confidence.Scent: pleasant, faint fruityEffectiveness: yes, specialty itemAesthetics: minimalistic, quality, smoothingVerdict: recommend for specialty use during controlled period of time, drier skin types could layer this under another moisturizer Specialty Moisturizer
