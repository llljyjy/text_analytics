I got complimented on my makeup one day. I wasn’t wearing any makeup though. I was just wearing this. My skin looked amazing! I recently had a baby, and my skin has been on a roller coaster of ride. This product did wonders for me! Another time I wore it I was told I was glowing. I have super sensitive skin, and that always makes me nervous when trying new products. I have zero compliants about this one. It’s a keeper! Glowing
