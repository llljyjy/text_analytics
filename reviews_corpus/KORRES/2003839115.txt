I haven’t used a Korres product since 5 years so I was looking forward to this new product. The packaging wasn’t that great but hey spring is coming so light green was fine. The scent is a typical korres fragrance and texture is great for dry skin for the summer and if you have combo/oily skin than I would prefer to use this for the winter. Ok for sensitive skin but didn’t notice anything with my pores. New product from korres
