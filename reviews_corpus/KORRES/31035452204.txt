I received a #Korres #sample from @influenster @ThatGreekGlow in return for an honest review. Upon first inspection of the tube, the only instructions are to apply to face and neck twice daily and avoid eye area. There’s no mention on the tube about benefits other than the product name being, “Poreless Cream.” So I looked it up on @Sephora’s site and the before and after are after 28 days of use. Why send a sample if it takes longer than the product available to see results? I used it every day for 2 weeks and the results weren’t there, plus it was taking a toll on my skin and I am not sensitive to new products. The product has little scent. It is extremely oily during application. It dries down but is heavy enough I can still feel it on my face throughout the day. When I shower and start to wash my face, there is nothing but product and oil under my nails and on my washcloth which is not normal with my usual skincare products. I wouldn’t recommend unless you have dry skin, and I wouldn’t recommend as a poreless cream either as it didn’t minimize or blur mine at all. Not it
