I received a free sample compliments of Influenster and I happy that I did. This really  works! I have seen a noticeable difference since I started using Korres Poreless Skin Cream. It is perfect for my combination skin. It really reduces the oil and appearance of my pores. My skin is smoother, softer, and has less blemishes. It smells light and pleasant. It absorbs into my skin completely and leaves no residue behind. It is non-irritating and gentle.  Excellent product! I definitely recommend this skin cream. Less visible pores
