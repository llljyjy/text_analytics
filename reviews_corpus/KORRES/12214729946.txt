I loved this skin cream! It really did what it says, minimized my pores, kept my skin feeling/looking hydrated and made my skin look smooth. It is very lightweight and applied great! It has a very subtle scent which I liked. My makeup looked great after applying it. Would definitely consider it a staple in my routine. Amazing
