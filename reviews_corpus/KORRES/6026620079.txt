i received this sample complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest review of this product.. and i really like it. i like the consistency of the formula as it does not feel greasy on my face whenever i apply it and afterwards it does not either and dried super fast. i also noticed almost immediately that my pores were less visible and filled in which made applying my make up on top of it a lot easier. would make for a great primer or just to be used alone to make skin look more even. nan
