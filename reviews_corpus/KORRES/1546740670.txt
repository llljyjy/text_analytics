I received this product as a free sample from Influenster and Korres for sampling purposes.  I first noticed the smell., which at first I didn’t know if I liked.  Then as I applied it, I noticed it had a kind of coconut smell which I love.  It’s absolutely amazing.  After my first use I could feel my face tighten up!  I love this product!  The gel in a moisturizer is a definite plus for me.  I’m so used to creams, yet the Korres Moisturizer made in Greece really changed my mind!  I’ve already told my friends about it and recommend they buy it!  I know I will.  It doesn’t take a lot of moisturizer at all.  A little goes a long way.  #ThatGreekGlow #complimentary @Influenster @Korres The best moisturizer I used!
