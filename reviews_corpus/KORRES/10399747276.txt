So pros & cons:  pros - it worked great for my acne.  For some reason, although I’m in my late 30s, I’ve been getting more breakouts lately, probably hormones.  This was surprisingly helpful in clearing my face up more quickly.  Cons - it’s nowhere near moisturizing enough for my dry winter skin.  So, I’ve been putting this on any breakout spots then using my DE products everywhere else.  Would I purchase… probably not, but I’ll use what I have left. good for what it does
