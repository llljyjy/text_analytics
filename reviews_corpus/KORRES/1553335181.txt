Great moisturizer. I really have loved this product. I’ve tried other Korres products and this may be my favorite. The moisturizer is just heavy enough for the winter season without feeling heavy or like it’s clogging my pores. It goes on well under my makeup too. The scent is nice and light and great consistency. Great moisturizer
