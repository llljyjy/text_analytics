I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review, and all I can say is WOW! I deal with enlarged pores around my nose and under my bottom lip. I am pretty put off by them, but hey...it’s part of who I am. Enter Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream, and I no longer have to look at those huge pores anymore! Not only are my pores tremendously minimized, the rest of my skin looks healthy.  It feels healthy. The cream is not heavy and absorbs in without a greasy look/feel.  I am not a fan of the smell but in love the product so much that it doesn’t really matter. This product will definitely continue to be a part of my Daily skin care routine! Great product!
