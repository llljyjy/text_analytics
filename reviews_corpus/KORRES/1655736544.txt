First off, it smells nice but without a strong perfumey fragrance. It’s a very light, subtle green scent. It spreads really nicely and absorbs easily. My skin was very soft after use and did appear smoother, especially where my skin is more oily. It’s almost like a gel-cream but leans more cream. At the time I tried this, my skin was quite dry and sensitive so it didn’t work quite as well because in winter I do need more moisture. It was only SLIGHTLY less effective than my normal winter moisturizer, so it did work and my skin didn’t have any bad reaction to it. HOWEVER, I think this would be perfect for summertime, especially because the salicylic acid would quell any pimples from extra sweat and oil produced in the heat of summer. I really like Korres as a brand and find their products to have great ingredients and work effectively, and this product is no different. So I give this a solid 4/5, and when I retry it in spring/summer I have no doubt it will jump to 5/5. works well, maybe better for summer or oily skin
