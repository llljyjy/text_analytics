Really enjoyed trying out this skin cream and brand. There is a wonderful subtle scent to the cream itâ€™s hardly noticeable, I did have a slight irritation, but my irritation came from having super dry skin to begin with and went away after the third application.Now, my skin is noticeably hydrated, soft, and have little to no problem with excessive oiliness. Overall, I recommend and will purchase full size to help with the rest of this cold season. Well done Korres!
