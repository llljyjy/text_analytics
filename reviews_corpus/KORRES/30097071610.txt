I received this product complimentary for my honest review. The primer itself is a cream consistency that goes on just like a moisturizer. It  left my pores smoothed out and leaves your skin feeling moisturized and tacky. Ready to grip and hold onto the foundation. There was a slight smell to it, but nothing overwhelming, just the smell of the natural ingredients, which worked well at holding my makeup in place all day. It is a good primer with hydrating ingredients. Not sure if I would buy it again or not. Smoothed and hydrated
