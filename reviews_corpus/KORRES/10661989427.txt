I got the Korres Poreless skin as a sample from Influenster and Korres, in exchange of my honest review. I have a very acne-prone skin, and honestly I have struggled with acne and large pores ever since I was a teenager. I have tried every single product that treats those issues possible, within my budget and I have never seen something treating my pores like this one.I applied a very large amount on both sides of my face, specifically targeting my cheeks. I felt an instant tingling to my face, and about 5 minutes later the changes were clear, my pores shrunk dramatically. Because this product is so great I didnâ€™t feel the necessary of applying primer before foundation. Forget about anything else
