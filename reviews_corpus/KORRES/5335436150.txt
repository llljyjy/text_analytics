I used applied to my clean face before applying makeup. I didnâ€™t notice any shrinkage of my pores. However, I did notice how moisturized my face felt and looked. It did give a matte look to my makeup, which I really liked. Ingredients includes Santorini Grape Extract and it is a vegan product. Korres is also Cruelty Free. I do recommend. Korres Skin Cream
