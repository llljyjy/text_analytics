I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really like this product. It is extremely moisturizing without being heavy. It soaks in to the skin quickly and evenly and really does help to blur pores. The sample that I received was ample size and the tube was a great delivery system. The cons are the following: the full size product comes in a jar which allows air and elements to get to the product. It also does not have an SPF so you will need an additional product for sun protection. Finally it does have fragrance. To me it was not off putting or overpowering, but it is there. I am debating if I will repurchase at this point - I really love the product but dislike the packaging Great product, less than ideal packaging
