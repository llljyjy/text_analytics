I am a tough critic for anything that goes on my skin - it’s crazy sensitive and it’s hard to find something that’s a good match. This moisturizer was great - wonderful fragrance (but not too strong), smooth texture, and left my skin happy and moisturized. The only downside for me personally was that it’s a little heavier than I care for as a day time, but loved as part of my night time routine. I received a sample size and squeezed every drop I could put of it! Loved this!
