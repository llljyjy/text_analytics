I started using this cream in my night time regimen and wanted to love it, but It didn’t do anything special for my skin except moisturize. Skin was soft and supple. It didn’t have much fragrance. It doesn’t have a wow factor for me to leave my existing moisturizer for this. Easy pass. Not extraordinary
