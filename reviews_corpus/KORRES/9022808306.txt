I received this product for free for testing purposes and my honest review. I really enjoyed using this product, a small amount goes a long way. I use it after I wash my face before I apply my makeup, it gives my face a smoother finish. I have large pores and I struggle with finding primers or moisturizers that can help with pore visibility. This product did not take care of the problem, but it definitely helped. Softer Skin
