This product was received as part of a promotion from Influenster and Korres— While my review is genuine, I did not purchase or pay for this product.  This skin cream was such a surprise! It has a very gentle, clean scent, and absorbed well. I’ve only been testing it for a couple days now in place of my daily moisturizers, but I can already feel the texture of my skin evening out! I’m excited to continue using this product, and look forward to more positive results. nan
