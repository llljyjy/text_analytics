I normally avoid products for acne because they tend to be drying or not moisturizing enough. This one is different! It is super moisturizing and doesn’t feel like an acne product at all! It also seems to fill my pores really nicely and foundations sit so nice on top without an extra primer. I don’t have bad acne by any means but I’ve had no new blemishes since using this. I think this is the perfect winter moisturizer for someone with dry skin and blemishes. nan
