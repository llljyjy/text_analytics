This product definitely nails the lightweight description. It sits on your skin for a moment before sinking in, and does not leave any oily feeling behind. Maybe itâ€™s just me expecting it, but my pores did seem a little blurred after applying - which is awesome! Minimal scent and simple packaging. I received this product for free through Influenster for testing purposes. nan
