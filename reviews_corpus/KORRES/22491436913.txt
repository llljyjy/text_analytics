* I received this sample of KORRES Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream for free from Influenster and KORRESin exchange for my honest review! First off, this skin cream is made in Greece, so it makes me feel all fancy, like a Greek goddess! :) The cream has a light scent and it absorbs quickly leaving my skin soft, smooth and hydrated. I have large pores on my nose, and I feel like this helped make them slightly less noticeable. I also had a patch of irritated skin below my nose when I started using this cream, and it seems to be clearing up with twice daily application. Greek Goddess Vibes!
