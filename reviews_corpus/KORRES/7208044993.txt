so far so good! this product has melted nicely into my skin and leaves it feeling hydrated and soft. i haven’t really seen a huge difference in my pores since using, but i’ve only been using a short time. i keep this in my skincare fridge to get a nice cool feel to it while i rub it onto my face! love it!
