First I am 40 years old and I am a skin care addict ! I received a .68 oz deluxe size from influenster and I am extremely happy with the natural ingredients in this product and how it blurs my pores. At first I felt like it did not work but then I used it proper following my skin routine in the morning and under makeup it looks beautiful under my makeup look like my skin. It does not have a strong scent, it is very light and goes away quickly after about a minute. My skin is glowing and toned skin honey !!! I loooove this !!!! Anything that makes me look younger and healthier I am all for it ! Got me glowing inside out !
