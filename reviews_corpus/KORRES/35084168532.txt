I have been substituting my nightly moisturizer with the Santorini skin cream and it has made such a difference. It feels so cooling on the skin when it goes on and just hydrates so we’ll after washing my face before it gets dry. It also smells so good if you’re someone who loves a good smelling face product. I will be keeping this in my night time routine for sure! Great for dry skin!
