I received a sample size of this product in exchange for an honest review.I like how lightweight this formula is. It absorbs quickly and my makeup goes on well afterwards. I’m pale and prone to redness especially when trying a new product but I didn’t have any sensitivity to this. The scent is light and fresh. It does have a slight blurring effect which helps with the appearance of minimizing pores but I love how soft my skin feels after using this for just a couple of weeks. Definitely has improved the texture of my skin gently. Lightweight Clean Formula
