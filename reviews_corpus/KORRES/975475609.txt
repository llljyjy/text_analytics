I received this product for free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review. I have been using it for a couple days now and it has really made my skin feel very smooth and hydrated. I have combination skin and it has worked great on my skin. It has also helped to minimize my pores. It’s a great face cream that doesn’t leave my face oily! Love it!
