I was a bit skeptical when I receive this product. I ended up being pleasantly surprised by the Poreless Skin Cream. After using it for 2 weeks, I did notice that my skin looked smoother under my makeup. I do like the way that the salicylic acid smooths out my skin so that it looks good even without makeup. The smell is light and pleasant and the Poreless Skin Cream is non-greasy and very lightweight. I will be adding this to my morning routine from here on out. Love it!
