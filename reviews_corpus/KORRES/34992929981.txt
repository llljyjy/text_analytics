I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I enjoy this cream but I wouldn’t say it makes your skin poreless. It’s light and goes on leaving your skin clean and fresh. Does not leave your skin oily. It has a light scent that won’t over power you, I’m sensitive to smells and this cream is perfectly scented. Overall this is a good face cream but don’t expect your skin to be poreless. Good not great
