I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. My combination skin needs something extra on the T zone for oil control and pore minimizing. As a brand, I love almost every product I have try from Korres. When I saw this product I was hesitant about how much would it work because I have try so many others that just don’t work. But korres didn’t disappoint! It’s perfect for my skin because it controls the oil without drying it or causing flakes. It worked great under my make up and kept my T zone oil free longer than other products. It gives a healthy glow to the skin without marking it oily. It’s just the perfect balance for my combination skin. The ingredients list includes hyaluronic and salicylic acids which make so much sense in this product and for combination skin type. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Perfect balance for combination skin types
