I received this product for free from @Influenster and @korres in exchange for my honest review!It’s lightweight, absorbs quickly, mild, and is actually incredibly hydrating. I have combination oily skin that is dehydrated… so this was perfect for me. The salicylic acid will give you a slight tingle sensation, but that’s how you know it’s doing some work. It smells like grapes and apples - fruity and fresh. I like to use this during the day and use a thicker cream before bed. I’d recommend this! #korres #influenster #TheGreekGlow love the salicylic acid in this!!
