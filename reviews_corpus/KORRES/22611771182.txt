I received this from Influenster for testing. I do have oily/combination skin, and I felt like this did give me a very nice balance. Lately with wearing masks, Iâ€™ve been breaking out on my chin, and this provides a nice, light and long lasting moisture, without making me greasy and clogging my pores . nan
