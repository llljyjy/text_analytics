I like this product in a sense that it didn’t irritate myskin or cause any breakouts, which I’m prone to, soI’m glad in that aspect. I received a sample sizedproduct compliments of Influenster for testingpurposes, and I used it consistently until it ran out. Idid like the way it made my skin so smooth, but Ididn’t necessarily notice any difference in theappearance of my pores. It could be that I ran out ofproduct before being able to use it for multipleweeks at a time, but l’d be willing to purchase thisproduct so that I could continue to see results overtime. Good Product
