I was given this product absolutely free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for an honest review so here we go. I absolutely fell in love with this the first time I used it, but my first impression was literally to set it to the side. I had never heard of Korres and the packaging is dull, I just thought… “oh great ANOTHER face cream!” But when I finally tried it, this product spoke for itself. I saw results instantly. It changed my skin from dry, dull and uneven to dewy, plump, even and glowing! This is my new go to moisturizer!!! Don’t judge a book by its cover
