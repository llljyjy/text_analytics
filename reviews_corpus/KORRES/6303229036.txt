This is a great skin cream!! I was a little worried I wouldn’t like the smell because I’ve never tried a grape cream before but I don’t mind it at all and love how this cream feels on my skin!! I always break out at first when switching anything up in my skin care routine so I was super surprised and impressed when my skin actually cleared up with this cream! I would definitely recommend. I received this cream complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes. nan
