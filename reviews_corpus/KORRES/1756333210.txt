I received a free trial size of the moisturizer. I give it 3 stars because I have dry skin, this did not give me enough moisture I usually need.  Pro: Matte finish, minimizes pores,not stickyCon: not given enough hydrationOverall I this this is a decent moisturizer if you have oily or normal skin! good for oily or normal skin
