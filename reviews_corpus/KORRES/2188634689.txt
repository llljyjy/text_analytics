Korres poreless skin cream contains salicylic acid and claims to smooth and balance skin. It has a creamy texture and an extremely light scent. I really had high hopes as I’m looking for my pores to appear smaller but I didn’t notice any difference. It is a nice moisturizer, I will continue to use what I have but I wouldn’t purchase in the future just because it didn’t do anything for me. Just okay
