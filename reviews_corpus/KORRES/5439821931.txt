I really like how smooth and lightweight this cream is, it has a buttery consistency that glides over your skin really nicely and effortlessly. I decided to work it into my morning skincare routine after cleansing, and then applying an SPF moisturizer on top. I find that alone, this product is not moisturizing enough by itself, at least not in the dry Winter climate I am in! I definitely feel like it makes the appearance of my skin smoother and shrinks my pores slightly. I wouldnâ€™t say this is a miracle product, but I am enjoying it and would purchase the full size if I was looking specifically for a cream with salicylic acid. I apply the Korres velvet skin drink oil at nighttime, but I think using it on top of this cream would be really moisturizing and give the skin a nice dewy finish! nan
