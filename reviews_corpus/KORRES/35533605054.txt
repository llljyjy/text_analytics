Pleasantly surprised with my results! This was a great match for makeup! Nearly unscented, and a little goes a long way. Can be a bit heavy for a full skincare routine or before layers of SPF. I do have sensitive skin especially in the eye area and I had no irritation or reactions. Would purchase and recommend. Effective!
