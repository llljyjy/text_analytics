I always feel bad writing less than stellar reviews, but I think it’s really important (especially since I got this for free and those are all the reviews up). This cream didn’t perform any miracles on my skin. Used a few times and couldn’t wait to get back to my normal skincare routine (Flora and Bast CBD Serum in the AM & PM is my favorite ) Meh. Nothing special.
