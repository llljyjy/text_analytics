I received this from Influenster for free for testing purposes but all opinions are my own. It is a very lightweight product but did provide hydration to my skin. A little bit goes a long way. It does have a light fragrance which wasnâ€™t my favorite. Fortunately the scent did not linger all day. I do like that it has salicylic acid to help with my acne prone skin. Would recommend. nan
