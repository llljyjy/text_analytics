This is a very good moisturizer. I am very picky when it comes to facial moisturizers. I have dry skin in the winter and oily skin in the summer. If my moisturizer is too oily it runs into my eyes and burns bad. This moisturizer doesnâ€™t make my face oil and leaves it feeling very moisturized. Not a fan of the smell but after a few seconds it goes away. Very good
