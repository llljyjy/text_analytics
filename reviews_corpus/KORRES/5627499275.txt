This cream really did help minimize the appearance of my pores on my nose! However it was slightly drying so I layer it with a thicker moisturizer and that seemed to fix that issue. I didnâ€™t notice much of a difference in the pores on the rest of my face but overall I really do enjoy this moisturizer and will definitely purchase the full size! nan
