I received this complimentary from Influenster . My face DRANK this up. Unsure if it was a bad skin moisturizer day or what. But I had to use more than usual. It has a light fragrance to it; I didn’t mind it because it wasn’t overwhelming and didn’t linger too long after application. Application was smooth and as advertised poreless!. I would be interested in trying other products from this line. Dry Skin?
