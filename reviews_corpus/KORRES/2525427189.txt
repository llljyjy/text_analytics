I’ve been using this moisturizer for about a week and I love it so far. It’s very rich but sinks into my skin so fast and doesn’t leave any greasy residue behind. I live in a very cold climate and the air is so dry so my skin really feels it when a good moisturizer is introduced. The smell is really refreshing too. I can’t speak to any long term results but I like everything about this product so far.  I received this complimentary from Influenster and all opinions are my own. Really nice for cold dry weather
