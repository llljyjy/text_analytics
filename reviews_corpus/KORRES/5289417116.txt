I really enjoyed this product. I received a sample size from Influenster for review and was happy with how it made my skin feel. It absorbs nicely into the skin without leaving it feeling greasy. This time of the year I have really dry skin and this product did a good job of getting rid of my dry patches. It has a nice light scent that I enjoyed. Would definitely consider this product the next time I need a moisturizer. Smells good absorbs nicely
