I recieved this product from influenster and Korres complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion and I love the benefits of this cream! I have only skin and I instantly noticed not only instantly smooth soft skin but thought out the day my makeup lasted and I seemed to be producing less oil than before! It smells great and light scented not overwhelming by any means! Makes a great addition to my morning skincare routine as a moisturizer or after moisturizer as a makeup base! I would definitely recommend this product to a friend! Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream
