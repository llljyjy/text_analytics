I am always weary of trying new products but when o was sent this product complimentary to try and give my honest opinion I was a little excited. This product does not have a scent which for me was amazing since I have sensitive skin.  I put it on at night instead of my regular cream and I did feel like my skin was more moist and smooth.  The next day my foundation went on a little smoother and had better coverage.  This is a really good product will definitely add to my routine when my skin needs the hydration. Pleasantly surprised
