I was happy to try this brand as I previously had not. I received a sample bottle through Influenster so can’t speak to the packaging aspect of the product. As for the product, overall I think it’s a solid choice! It’s lightweight, goes in smoothly, and has a great light scent to it. I didn’t personally notice a huge difference in my pores, but was pleased with the level of hydration it provided. Great Option
