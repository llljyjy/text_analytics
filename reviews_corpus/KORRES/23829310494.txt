I received this product for free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review. I used this product every day for weeks; applied before makeup. I personally don’t like the smell, reminds me of my grandmas lotion. However, I will say that it does feel good on my skin. Not sticky or oily. Left skin feeling nourished. I was looking forward to my pores appearing smaller because the ones on my cheeks are quite noticeable but they did not change. I personally would not buy again. Works as well as a good lotion. Didn’t help with pores
