I received this product free in exchange for my review. To start off with, I liked the packaging a lot. It was very simple but eye-catching. The product itself works well. I did not initially realize that it was like an acne cream, I thought it was a moisturizer so I was disappointed but then I realized what I was actually using and started to take more notice of my complexion, and it has been clearing up. I am a very hormonal 36 year old and I have been dealing with breakouts a lot lately, so to see that my complexion looks nice is a pleasant surprise. The product smells nice, it did not burn or leave my skin overly dry. I have been using it morning and night  after my moisturizer and really enjoyed the results! I would purchase this product in the future. Good stuff
