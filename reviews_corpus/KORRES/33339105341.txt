This skin cream left my skin feeling soft and clean.  It smells good, no overwhelming scent, soaks into skin pretty quick.  I do not have large pores so I canâ€™t say if it helps with appearance.  I will continue to use while I decide if I will be adding it to my daily skincare routine. Great facial cream
