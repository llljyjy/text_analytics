This product is alright, not amazing but not bad. It might be better for summer skin, since it didn’t help to moisturize my winter-dry skin. It does make my skin look a bit smoother after application and the smell is very lovely. I’m going to try it again in the spring since I don’t need as heavy of a moisturizer as I do now in the winter. nan
