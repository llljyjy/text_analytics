I’m in my mid thirties and have recently stopped using birth control, which I have been on since I was 17, and I’ve never had issues with my skin until now. Never realized that the birth control must have been keeping my skin clear because now, hormonal acne is an uninvited presence once a month. Since I have stopped taking birth control, maybe 2 years now, I’ve experimented so many different products to see what works and what doesn’t. Then I found this. This holy grail cleanser! While I might still have one or two little pimples that pop up once a month, it is no where near as bad as before. This cleanser definitely works for me. nan
