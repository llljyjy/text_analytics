This Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream was a light cream that soaked into the skin fairly well and didn’t leave me feeling sticky like some moisturizers. I’m not quite sure if my pores looked any smaller - claims to minimize pores. Additionally, salicylic acid and hyaluronic acid are low on the ingredient list, so I’m not certain on how much pore unclogging and hydrating this product can really provide with long-term use for those that really have acne concerns. My skin was not irritated by this product, nor did I experience any additional breakouts from trying this cream. Light smell that’s pleasant (last ingredient is fragrance). When I applied a light layer, it worked well under my makeup. Overall, not complaints, but I’m not sure that this would be my first option for very problematic skin. Pretty Good, But Not Life-changing
