I received this in exchange for an honest review ~ I have been using it every morning for about a week and I am really loving it. It’s super lightweight, sits well under SPF and makeup, and feels very hydrating for how light it is. I took off a star because every time I apply it, my skin burns and stings for a minute. It does go away quickly, but I’m guessing that people with really sensitive skin might want to stay away from this one. light & luxurious
