I really enjoy this face cream. It’s super lightweight and absorbs really fast. I have combo skin and it’s does not leave any weird residue on my skin. Great for underneath my makeup-I have tested it with multiple foundations and concealers and it doesn’t negatively affect any of them. I do recommend this product! Super nice cream, great for underneath your makeup
