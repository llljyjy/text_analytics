This Korres Moisturizer is lightweight and very hydrating on the skin. My skin is dry and upon first use my pores had minimized and skin was left feeling extremely hydrated. I used about a nickel size amount for my face and it was enough to hydrate my skin and left moisturized for the rest of the day. My skin also had a bit of radiance upon using. I would purchase this moisturizer on my own. nan
