I really like this face cream. It’s really light and it moisturizes my skin really nicely . It helps somewhat with pores but not a big significant change. I have oily skin and this cream didn’t make my face extra oily which is a plus . Also it doesn’t have an overwhelming scent which is also a plus. It brighten my skin and it make it really smooth. I recommend it . nan
