I received this from Influenster and Korres complimentary in exchange for my honest review.  And honestly I loved it!  The cream is light and absorbs quickly but is still so hydrating.  I donâ€™t have an issue with pores but I do think my skin was so much softer in the week that I used this.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a well priced face cream.
