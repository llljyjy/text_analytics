I received Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I love the way this makes my skin feel and my skin feels softer. It’s not greasy, which is great. It smells faintly like old lotion, but it’s a light smell and not entirely unpleasant.  Overall I like it! Great face cream
