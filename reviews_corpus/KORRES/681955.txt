I’m Greek, and I already adore Korres skincare. Now I have one more reason to love the line. Although Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream is geared towards oily or acne-prone skin, my dry skin benefited too. The one-two punch of Salicylic Acid and Hyaluronic Acid, combined with Santorini Grape Extract, makes my skin look and feel smooth. I’m moisturized without any heaviness, and my makeup goes on flawlessly. Within a week of daily use, the appearance of pores in my t-zone is diminished. I can just imagine how oilier complexions would thrive with this cream. It has a light scent that makes me think of sitting on a beach… maybe in the Greek isles. OPA! nan
