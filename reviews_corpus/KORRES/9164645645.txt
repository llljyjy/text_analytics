I received this product in exchange for my review. I was actually surprised by this product. It comes out thick and I was worried it would sit heavy on my skin. However it smooths out and is very lightweight. My skin sometimes reacts poorly to new products but it drank this in! Very hydrating without being heavy. I don’t have visible pores so I can’t speak to that, but it did sit nicely under my makeup. Will definitely be buying when I need more! Lightweight, but powerful!
