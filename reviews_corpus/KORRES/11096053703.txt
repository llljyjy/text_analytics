I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This moisturizer is the bees knees itâ€™s really hydrating and soothing and I have sensitive skin. A little goes a long way and it smells really fresh and not overpowering. I think for the price point you are getting a great product. I would recommend and would buy again!! nan
