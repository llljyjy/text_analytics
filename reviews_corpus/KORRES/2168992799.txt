I was excited to try this and I had heard good things. The product is thinner and goes in smoothly. I didn’t feel that luxurious hydrating feeling I was hoping to feel with this. I have nothing bad to say, I’ve just tried other moisturizers I like better. If you’re looking for a light weight moisturizer, try this! nan
