I really enjoyed this cream it’s not overly oily like many my skin feels great only thing I wasn’t a fan of was the scent. It didn’t really stink but it was not a pleasant smell either which is why I rated this item three stars. I guess when I read Santorini grape I was expecting a grape scent which was a little disappointing. Other than that I cannot complain I like the cream but not the scent
