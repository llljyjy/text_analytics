I received this product in exchange for my honest review. This product smells so fresh and clean. I was excited to try this product based on the ingredients on the label. My skin is dry and acne-prone. After applying this product, my face felt tight and dry, which is a bit worrisome for someone who has had chronic acne in the past. I may give this product another try in the future when I feel my skin is more under control. nan
