The Korres Poreless Skin Cream is a light moisturizer with salicylic acid. It is not greasy and absorbs quickly. Might not be enough hydration for those with dry skin. The scent is light and not too off putting but isnâ€™t my favorite scent. I thought it felt nice on the skin and was not sticky. Due to the salicylic acid, I do have to be careful what other products I use with it and make sure to not use it on the same day that I used products with retinol or other BHAs. Good option for those trying to introduce salicylic acid into their routine. nan
