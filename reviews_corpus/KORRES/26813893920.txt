Ingredients wise this is a great serum. I do find myself sometimes skipping it in my serum rotation though because tbh I really don’t like the texture of it. It has an odd texture IMO. Like just an almost grippy, oily, odd texture. But it is a quality serum. Maybe, just if you’re a texture person give this a skip. Quality but odd feeling
