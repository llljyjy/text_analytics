This product works so well on my combination skin. I like to use a salicylic acid cleanser and also a creamy cleanser like this one for hydration. My skin feels smooth after using this for about a couple weeks now. it doesn’t dry my skin especially because I have acne and i’m already using drying ingredients in my skin care. this cleanser definitely adds the hydration my skin needs. nan
