I received Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream free for review purposes from Influenster. I was very interested in this product because of the following benefits: salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid, vegan and cruelty free I have dry skin, fine lines and texture  with hormonal acne (made worse by constant masking). I loved the smooth texture of the formula and that it was not harsh on my skin. I did not experience any redness or dryness after use. My skin actually looked plumper and had a healthy glow without any reflective particles. The product does not have a strong scent and the cream itself is a firm texture that blends out evenly. Perfect barrier for dry and cold winter months Gorgeous Skin
