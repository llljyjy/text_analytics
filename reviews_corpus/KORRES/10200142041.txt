In reading other reviews, it appears a lot of people like this product. I really wanted to like it. However, after using once, I got the biggest pimple I’ve ever had on my forehead. Coincidence?

This is a lightweight cream that you don’t notice after applying and it’s unscented. I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Not for me
