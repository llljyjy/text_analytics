Love this product. Iâ€™ve been using it in the morning as a combination moisturizer and makeup primer and it has worked well, even with wearing a mask all day. Keeps my skin hydrated, that is usually very dry in winter. Mild scent and smooths my skin. Great addition to my skincare routine! Received from influenster for my opinion. nan
