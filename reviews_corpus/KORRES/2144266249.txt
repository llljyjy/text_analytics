I received this product complimentary of Influenster and Korres in exchange for an honest review. This is a really nice product. The texture isn’t too thin or too thick. It doesn’t feel greasy and goes on light and smoothie.  My skin absorbed this product really  well. It is very subtly scented, so those of you who don’t like heavily scented products may enjoy this one.My skin felt soft hydrated to the touch, with an almost airbrushed finish. It was great under makeup. I liked this one. Great product
