I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange of my honest review: Really cool product. It doesn’t make my skin oily, but feels very moisturizing! It’s also very light and applies so smoothly. I haven’t broken out or reached to the product either which is another plus. Also, I’m not a huge fan of scented products but love the smell of this one. Cool product!
