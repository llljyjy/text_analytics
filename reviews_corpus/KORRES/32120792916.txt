I received this from Influenster for review purposes. I have dry skin and it does a great job keeping my skin moisturized and dewy. The first time I used it, I felt a burning sensation. This sensation faded with time. Unfortunately, the overpowering grape smell still bothers me. It is heavily perfumed and it gives me a headache. The cream has a thick consistency. I only need a small amount for my face. I recommend this only if strong smell does not bother you. Moisturizing but heavily scented
