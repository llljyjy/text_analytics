This moisturizer is okay. It is hydrating and gives a slight glow to the skin but it has a pilling issue. Couple hours after I have it on I see it balled up on my skin. At first I thought may be its the other product Iâ€™m using it with but I switched to different products and it still had the same issue on my skin. nan
