I received this product complimentary from Korres and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is a lightweight poreless  skin cream.  It blends in smoothly into your face and neck without leaving a tacky feel. It does contain salicylic acid to smooth and balance your skin. Overall, it work best either as a moisturizer or primer.
