I received a free sample in a recent voxbox. I will say that it made an immediate and visible difference to the size of my pores - most noticeably the ones on my nose. So I incorporated it into my morning routine after I shower, before I put on my makeup. It not only made my pores basically invisible, but it also seemed to work as a primer (holding my foundation in place better than usual). It’s a little pricey for me, so I’ll be bummed when I run out. But I do recommend if you have the $$. Invisible Pores
