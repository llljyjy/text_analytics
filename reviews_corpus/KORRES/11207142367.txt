It really is lightweight, applies so SMOOTHLY, it smells like it really is made with great ingredients (you can tell from the smell and it’s important for me). Most importantly - the first time I applied it - it did not irritate my skin which is a great sign for my sensitive skin. It also absorbs nice and quickly, and leaves my skin hydrated! I use it after my usual cleanser. I don’t have a lot of pores but the ones I do annoy me :/ I’ll  keep updating about my pores on influenster. Great cream!
