Although I didn’t care for the scent of this product my skin did feel a ton better after using it.  It is now part of my morning routine before I apply anything else to my face. I have large pores in this really reduced The visibility of them.  I’m really glad to see that there’s no silicone in it and that it’s vegan and cruelty free.  It makes me happy to know that there’s a lot of natural ingredients in this skin cream such as sunflower seed oil and olive fruit oil and avocado oil! I didn’t expect that. Good Cream!
