Loved this cream! I have combination skin that I never thought could actually get pretty dry. And I also have large pores that I have been told look like freckles even though Iâ€™m a tanned skinned Hispanic lady. I can say this cream really did help with my pores as well. Overall very pleased even with the scent! Great for large pores
