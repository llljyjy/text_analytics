I have dry and sensitive skin and this facial cream didn’t irritate me. I love the smell of this, it’s relaxing and yummy. The main ingredient is salicylic acid which is great for oily or acne prone skin. However, I don’t have those skin concerns so I can’t say that I was able to truly use and test this new cream for it’s purpose. For the ingredients, I would say this is best suited for oily, combination, or acne prone skin types. salicylic facial cream
