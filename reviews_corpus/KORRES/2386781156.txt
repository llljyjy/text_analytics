I really liked this skin cream! It wasnâ€™t heavy but also not too light-I found it to smooth on delicately and it soothes my skin. I received a trial size and would definitely purchase at this price point. My skin is sensitive and dry and I could use this skin cream day or night ! I think it would wear well under a tinted moisturizer as well. nan
