I received this product to review as acomplimentary from Influenster. The cream waslight and wasn’t very greasy, which I enjoyed.However, I have a very sensitive face so it gaveme bad breakouts. I tried using, but the acne gotso bad I had to stop. My mom began using itthough and she loves it! Her face typically workswell with anything she puts on it. It’s Okay!
