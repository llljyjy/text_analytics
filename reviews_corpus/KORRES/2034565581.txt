I received this free from influenster for testing purposes and it’s truly a lovely cream. This has salicylic acid in it so it helps to slough off dead skin and combat acne. If did very well at both. It’s a very lovely texture with a moisturizing feel that’s not heavy and a very light scent to it. I use this in between other harsher peel creams/gels and it’s a perfect balance to keeping my skin moisturized and smooth. Great day and night cream with salicylic acid.
