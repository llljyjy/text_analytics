I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is a nice lightweight cream. It helped blur my pores and evened my skin tone. I did find it wasnâ€™t quite moisturizing enough for my skin as my skin is drier. I used it under another moisturizer. The price is also a good value. Nice cream
