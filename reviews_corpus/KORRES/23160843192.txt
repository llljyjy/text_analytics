I almost never write reviews but this is rapidly turning into a holy grail product. I have dry sensitive skin with a tendency to overproduce oil and switched to this on a whim after using the Belif moisturizing bomb and the Biossance gel. This is really a game changer -- I have the smoothest, softest skin of my life!! Loved it so much that I switched to the Korres face wash too, and between the two I might never go back to anything else. holy grail product
