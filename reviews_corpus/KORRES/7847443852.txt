I really like this stuff. I think korres is one brand I end up liking everything I try. I would purchase in the future. I wish the packaging was made from recycled materials. The smell is odd. It kind of reminds me of baby powder and cheap plastic and play dough/clay. It feels so soft on the skin. Loves it
