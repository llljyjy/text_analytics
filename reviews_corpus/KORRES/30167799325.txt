It’s a miss for me. I really wanted to love this, not in small part because I absolutely LOVE Santorini, but ultimately I found this to be extremely, peeling/flaky skin level drying to my face. It did not deliver on the promise of moisture, and I did not notice a real difference in the visibility of my pores. It’s possible that because I received a small sample, my skin didn’t have enough time to adjust but I only have my experience with the product to rely on and therefore would not recommend for those with combination/dry skin. nan
