I received this product free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I like this korres poreless skin cream with sylacilic acid. Iâ€™m 35 and still have occasional breakouts. I also have dry skin and a good twice a day skincare routine. This was the last step in my routine and helped those breakouts go away a little faster yet keep my skin hydrated. Would definitely recommend and will be purchasing the full size. Smells ok and preformed well Good for breakouts
