I am so glad that I have discovered a new moisturizer for  myself. This new gel moisturizer that comes out with a creamy consistency is wonderful for me. The texture and feel is great. Like I was saying, the consistency is creamy like yet it is not greasy or heavy at all yet it is not too lightweight. It is a nice combination of the gel moisturizer. I love how soft and silky my skin feels afterwards. The fact that it leaves my skin well hydrated all day without being greasy at all is the best and the powerful combination of ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid, Salicylic Acid and the wonderful new Santorini Grape Extract is just a wonderful plus for me. I will definitely want to continue buying more to see more results. Hydrating, Rich, Gel Moisturizer
