Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream is a good product. I received this product for free to give an honest review. I was unsure about it because some creams are really heavy and oily. But to my surprise this was not. It went one easily and I didnâ€™t feel like it was weighing on my skin. I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends.
