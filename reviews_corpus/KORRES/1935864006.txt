I received the Korrres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream complimentary for exchange of my honest review. This cream smells fantastic. Has a slight fresh grape scent. It goes on smooth and instantly blurs my pores. I’ve noticed a reduction of my pores after about a couple days use, I’m impressed! Ive been using it after I cleanse and before I apply my tinted moisturizer. Makes my skin feel very smooth. It’s very hydrating and a little goes a long way. Love that it has salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid and Santorini grape seed extract. Will be adding this to my daily routine. Instantly blurs my pores
