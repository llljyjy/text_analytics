*I received this product for free, in exchange for an honest review* First impressionâ€¦this product does really moisturize the skin, with the first use. Korres also says this cream will shrink your pores & control oiliness-most people see these changes after 2wks of use. This will only be my 7th night of use, but I will be using it every night until the cream is gone & will update if I see any progress. But so far, I do appreciate how hydrated my skin feels after applying it & I would probably buy more. So far so goood!
