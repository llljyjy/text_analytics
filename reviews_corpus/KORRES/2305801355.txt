This moisturizer is lightweight, not super creamy, dries pretty fast and does create a smooth surface.However, my skin gets super dry in the winter and i dont think this moisturizer gives me enough well..moisture! BUT i think i think in the summer months this would be bomb. Its got a good consistency so youre unlikely to feel greasy. nan
