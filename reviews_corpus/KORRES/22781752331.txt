Not a holy grail to me, but it’s a good moisturizer, It is hydrating, not greasy and didn’t brake me out which is nice (and since it has salicylic acid, It better don’t. Right? Lol) Not a fan of the scent either.  I would say, give it a try if you’re oily acne prone. Decent moisturizer just not my personal favorite. nan
