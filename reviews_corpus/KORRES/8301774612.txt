I love this stuff so much. I have combination skin and thought I’d never use a facial oil. I received this product in a beauty box and gave it a try and holy wow, I’m impressed! It soaks in pretty quickly so it doesn’t leave my face oily. It smells nice and doesn’t cause breakouts. I took it with me on a vacation recently and nearly cried when I got back home because it all leaked out in my luggage (the top must’ve gotten loose during travel). I immediately ordered a new jar. Love it. Worth every penny. I’m obsessed
