I was able to try a sample of this Korres product for free. I was a bit confused about what the purpose of the cream was. The instructions aren’t too clear on the packaging, but that’s probably just the sample. I used it on my skin during my nightime routine as a moisturizer. I was dealing with pumps, redness, and enlarged pores on my nose and chin when I used it. I noticed when I applied it to these areas it smoothed out my skin and got rid of the bumps. It was as if I had used a smoothing/blurring effect on my chin. It also helped with the enlarged pores on my nose. It also helped with the redness. The only reason I’m giving it a 4 out of 5 is because I’m not sure it had much for hydration. My skin is dry and that’s probably why. nan
