I received this as a complementary product from Influenster and Korres. I adore Korres products so I was super excited to add this to my skincare routine. I’ve noticed that this product was hydrating enough for the cold, dry winter we’re having. I’ve been using it for couple weeks now as you don’t need much and it’s not greasy either! nan
