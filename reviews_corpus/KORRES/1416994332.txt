I received this product for free from @Influenster and @korres in exchange for my honest review! I recently had the privilege of using this skin cream and thoroughly enjoyed it. I noticed right away how light the cream is and how easily  it dissolved into my skin. The fragrance was very fresh and not overwhelming or too fruity. I did not notice much of a change to my pores, but I did notice it has improved my blemishes.  For this reason, I will continue using this product. I would recommend this product to people with normal skin. Lightweight and Fresh
