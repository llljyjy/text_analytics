smells great, really fresh! It left me slightly tight and dry which I didn’t enjoy. I also noticed I broke out slightly and had some irritation and this is the only new product I used. overall, this is quite pricey for what you get and doesn’t compare to my ultimate favorite cleanser available at target: BYBI vegan oat milk cleanser. It’s fragrance free and is very creamy and lathers slightly. there are better cleansers
