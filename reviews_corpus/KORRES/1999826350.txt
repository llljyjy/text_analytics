Iâ€™ve enjoyed using this so far. Goes on well and easily soaks into the skin. Light pleasant smell. The only issue is that it is lightweight, which is great if you have combo or oily, or even normal skin. But I have VERY dry skin so I do find I need to add an extra moisturizer after. But it still makes my skin feel great. Good lightweight moisturizer
