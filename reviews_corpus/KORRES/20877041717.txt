I had some expectations of this product / those expectations were not met, but I think that’s a good thing. I expected this cream to act like a silicone primer (just something to give the appearance of smaller pores). But it wasn’t a primer, it truly acted like a daily moisturizing cream. The product itself recommends 2x daily usage, I didn’t use it in that way. The product is hydrating, but I prefer a thick cream at night. So I used this everyday for about two weeks each morning and noticed the appearance on my pores improved. I would recommend for normal/oily skin people! If you’re dry skinned, this may not be enough when it comes to moisture! Not what I expected - in a good way!
