I really like the texture of this moisturizer. It works well with my essence as part of my morning routine. I let it sink in for about 5 minutes before applying my base makeup, and there’s no pilling or gathering - yay! The only con is that I need to use a separate eye cream since this product contains salicylic acid, and I’m cautious to get that too close to my orbital region. I was able to test it complimentary in exchange for my review. nan
