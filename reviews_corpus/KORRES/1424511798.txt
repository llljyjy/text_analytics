I received the Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream in exchange for my honest review.  I really enjoyed this skin cream.  I did feel that helped with the appearance of my pores and it made my skin feel silky and smooth.  It also provided a nice canvas for my makeup.  This is a product that I would recommend and repurchase. nan
