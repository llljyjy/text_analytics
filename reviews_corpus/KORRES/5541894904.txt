Skin prep is an essential part of any makeup and skincare routine. The Korres Poreless Skin Cream has quickly become a staple on days I want a smooth even canvas without any excess shine. This is fast absorbing, plays well with other skincare and has a pleasantly light sweet scent which I think is from the grapes. While I donâ€™t think this makes me matte or poreless, I do have a natural finish and it keeps my skin looking radiant without oil. I think dry skinned people will enjoy this during the day layered over other skincare, and oily folx will like how light it feels. Overall I enjoyed Korres as a brand and will continue to use this. Great for pre makeup prep
