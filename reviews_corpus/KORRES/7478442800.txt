Really liked this skin cream!! It is lightweight, not heavy scented, and absorbs into the skin well. I used it daily and noticed a definite increase in hydration. The “poreless“ effect is definitely there but I wouldn’t rely on it as a primer. It does layer well underneath makeup and doesn’t make you look oily throughout the day. Overall, a solid staple to any skincare routine and I would definitely recommend giving it a try! Staple skincare product
