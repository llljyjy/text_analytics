I received a sample of this product from influenster, and  I’m actually surprised at how much I liked this product. It’s nice and light, and just glides on your skin very comfortably. It absorbs quickly without an awkward scent and doesn’t make my skin sticky or oily. And a little bit goes a long way so I feel like this is a really good value. I feel like a lot of clean beauty products get a bad rap get a bad rap for not being effective, but I really like this one Nice and light
