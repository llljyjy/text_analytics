I genuinely really enjoy this product, it feels lightweight and doesnâ€™t leave a gross feeling on my skin. After use my skin feels soft and smooth, and continues to the next day. I also enjoy using this under my foundation for a primer, my foundation lasts well over it and my pores look smooth.Overall I am thoroughly impressed by this product. A good moisturizer and primer
