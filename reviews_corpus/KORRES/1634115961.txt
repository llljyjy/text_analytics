I have a love hate relationship with this cream.  It really did wonders for my skin in my 20’s and moisturized the heck out it, making it super soft and smooth, but the powerful and cloying rose smell was too much.  Was looking for something like it in my late 30’s and decided to give it another go.  Same affects this time around: deeply moisturizing and even helps the fine lines.  However the plot has thickened, as now I get tiny whiteheads by the next morning. Too soon for a breakout and the pore is just purging/gunk is being pulled to the surface you say? That’s exactly what I was thinking, and have continued to try it every couple of weeks. Same thing every time and it’s really annoying.  Plus the super strong smell is still too much for me.  I’m keeping it in my skin care drawer and will probably reach for it once in awhile, but I doubt I’ll buy it again, or recommend it to anyone. nan
