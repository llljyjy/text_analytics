I used this moisturizer during the day and it was moisturizing enough for my dry spots but not overly heavy for the oilier areas of my face. I like that it has oils, salicylic acid and HA so it packs a lot of benefits in one product. I havenâ€™t used it long enough to see a difference in pores. Moisturizing but not greasy!
