To korres skin care- As Olivia Newton John sang,”I love you, I honestly love you.” Honestly, I never expect much from yet another skin cream promising to banish my visibly large pores. And with Salicylic acid? Won’t that irritate my winter dry skin? To be fair, I gave this a good try at bedtime, after removing makeup. I forgot about it and went to sleep. Upon awakening the next morning…what?! It actually reduced my pores substantially! I saw smooth almost poreless skin and no redness?! How can this be? Well, I’ve continued using it with the same striking results. This is a first class solid product at a reasonable price for the results. I’ll rebuy after using every ounce of the sample. WOW!! All the stars!! No pores-Truth in advertising!
