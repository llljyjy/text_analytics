I received this complimentary from influencer for my honest review. Be moisturizer is that of your average moisturizer has the same texture and consistency it does dry  quickly on your skin and I do love the look of less visible pores. I don’t get a ton of moisturizing from it which is why I’m giving it for stars. I definitely wouldn’t ditch my current waste Riser however I am using it with my current routine and alternating between my current maestri’s are in this one I would like to give it a full two weeks to see if I notice any difference in the production of oils on my skin as claimed overall I think it is a good product but I’m not sure I would buy it and leave my current Korres poreless
