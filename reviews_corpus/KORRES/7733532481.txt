I am really enjoying this product so far! I like that this product is lightweight, non-greasy, and fragrance-free. It is not thick enough, in my opinion, to use as a night cream so I exclusively use it in the mornings. It sits well under sunscreen and makeup. I am rating it a 4/5 because I don’t think I am going to run out and purchase this when it is gone. It hasn’t done exceptional things for my skin or become a favorite, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I would recommend it though as a no-fuss, easy to use product if you have the money to spend, but I personally would not seek it out. This is lovely!
