I got this deluxe sample size  Kores Poreless Skin Cream to try this week. I recived this complementary for my honest review. I have seen good reviews of this brand before but never used it myself. I used it as a morning moisturizer under my makeup. The consistency was a very light and did not leave an oily residue which was perfect for applying makeup on top. I did not really like that it had fragrance but it was very light and was barely noticeable. With only a week of use I am unsure if it did help my skin or not but it was very good while I was using it. Nice and smooth and only light fragrance. Very moisturizing!! Would definitely test more and recommend it. nan
