I love this cleanser, but it’s the only product I’ve ever owned that has mold issues - actual mold grows in the cap when the bottle is kept on my counter or in the shower. I know it uses greek yoghurt (which I love) but I’ve used fresh products before and have never experienced this. It’s only about 5 months old, so I definitely don’t think age of the product is the issue. Maybe it should be in a different container if this kind of thing is happening? nan
