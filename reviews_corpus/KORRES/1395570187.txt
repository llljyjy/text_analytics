I’ve been buying this on and off since 2015 and have turned many with a drier skin type onto it. I lived somewhere very cold and dry for many years and this was my holy grail! Sometimes I wear a cream under sometimes just serums, usually depends on the time of year. I feel like I can see a brightened appearance when I wake up after using this cream. I’ve worked in the beauty industry for years and even with all the other products I’ve been given and discovered I continuously come back to this whenever I feel like I need a boost. One of the most underrated products. Does have a very strong smell but I love the smell of rose so it doesn’t bother me. * I was a Sephora employee but am one no longer. Never received this product for free bought over 5 jars myself holy grail since 2015
