I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. As a person with dry skin, this product did not adequately hydrate my skin. Although, it felt good immediately after, within 30 minutes the effect was essentially gone.I believe it would work best for a person with oily skin because it would possibly offer enough hydration. Not hydrating enough
