I really like this cream. I thought that because it was a gel moisturizer it wouldn’t be as thick or hydrating, but it’s great. There’s a minty feel when you put it on, I think from the salicylic acid. Which I love as an ingredient, it helps my acne so much. This is light, but moisturizing, and also blurs. Would recommend! Light and hydrating!
