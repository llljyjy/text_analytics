I loved this cream! It felt amazing on my skin. It absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling silky smooth. I have felt a noticeable difference in the texture of my skin in just over a week. The only thing I dislike is the scent because it smells like Play-Doh. All in all, itâ€™s a wonderful product that really made a difference in the hydration level and texture of my skin.
