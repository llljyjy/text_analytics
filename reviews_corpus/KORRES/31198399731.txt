Really enjoyed the texture of this cream. I received it as a sample for testing in exchange for my review. I have been using this product as a replacement for moisturizer in the morning and I like the light, fresh fragrance and the way it leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth all day. Perfectly poreless
