I’m a huge fan of Korres products, so was excited to receive this sample to give it a go. It was a sample size, which is still nice, but I find is a hard way to fully represent a skincare product which is meant to be a regimen and daily routine. Therefore, it’s slightly harder to have an accurate review other than initial reaction.The product itself feels silky and smooth right out of the tube and has a pleasant scent. It’s light on my finger and very easy to apply. Immediately it feels cool and tingly on your skin, which I would assume is the salicylic acid working in action. I had a few blemishes needing to be healed and this really seemed to help dry them out and go away over a couple of days, so that’s a huge win. You might think that with those results, the rest of your face might feel dried out as well, but no not at all! My skin felt soft, moisturized and even looked plumper (in a good way) in the spots that sometimes tend to be dull and sunken. I’m a huge fan and very impressed with this product. Would love to see the difference it makes after using continuously for a longer period of time. nan
