Itâ€™s winter here in Minneapolis so I had to add a bit of extra moisturizer to my dry spots around my lips and nose. However, this is a beautiful moisturizer. Smells lovely but not heavy by any means. Blurs pores and leaves a nice glow and tack to skin. You definitely can skip the primer with this product. Excited to try this in the summer months. Lightweight and Beautiful
