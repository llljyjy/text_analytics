I received the Korres Poreless Skin Cream as a sample to test for my honest feedback. I will say I was skeptical at first as my skin can get oily and prone to breakouts. For the last month Iâ€™ve been working outside in extreme winter weather. This caused my face to dry out and burn. For the last two weeks I have been using this cream everyday. I have not had a breakout and my skin looks natural and clear to a point I have minimized my foundation and even feel comfortable without makeup. This cream has a pleasant earthy scent. I started using eye cream when I turned 30, now I know the importance of a good face cream and going to start using this regularly. Skeptic to in LOVE
