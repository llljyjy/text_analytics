This can only be described in 1 word for me: nourishing! My skin has felt so cared for since I have been using it. I have terribly dry skin that makes it hard to apply matte makeup. This moisturizer smoothed it out and wore beautifully under my foundation. So hydrating and did not make my face break out either! I will definitely be buying this in a bigger size! This is an absolute ‘yes’ for me!
