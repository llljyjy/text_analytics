This product is really great for a light weight hydration. It gives your skin a nice appearance while making head feels soft and supple. I would recommend this to people who have more normal to oily skin because for  winter, many of us need something more hydrating.  It has some really great ingredients and no irritation whatsoever. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family. Fabulous for lightweight hydration
