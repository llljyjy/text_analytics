I like that it is a lightweight cream. There’s a scent, but it is super mild and you can barely notice it. I’ve been using it as my morning moisturizer for 2 weeks now and noticed that my skin looks and feels great overall - no bumps or anything. I would make it my daily moisturizer. Lightweight cream
