This one was just okay, I wouldnâ€™t recommend if you have really sensitive skin like me. It made my skin turn red and patchy but again I have VERY sensitive skin. I had my husband try it out for a few days and he thought it was just okay but not something he wanted to throw into his daily routine permanently. Just okay
