I received this complimentary from influenster. I donâ€™t have major pore issues however I was pleasantly surprised - it is a lightweight cream that absorbed right into my normal/combo skin. It has a very faint fresh scent that I like very much. Though it dissipates very quickly. I appreciate the clean ingredients. It does mattify the skin a little bit. I appreciate the low price point for such quality ingredients. Lightweight cream that does reduce shine
