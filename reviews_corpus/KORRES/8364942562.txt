This moisturizer is very light weight with a nice subtle scent. Goes on nicely and sinks into the skin. Worked well as a moisturizer but after over a month of consistent use I didn’t notice a difference in pores at all. If it was marketed just as a moisturizer I’d recommend but not for the purpose it states. Lightweight
