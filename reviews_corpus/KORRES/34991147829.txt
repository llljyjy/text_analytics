I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The cream has a pleasant fragrance that is subtle. It glides on easily and feels fresh and hydrating as youâ€™re applying it. My skin felt super smooth afterwards, and this cream is perfect to use before applying makeup. The salicylic acid helps to keep pores clean but does not dry it out. The hyaluronic acid and santorini grape extract keep my face feeling moisturized. Throughout the day, my skin continues to feel fresh and smooth. So smooth
