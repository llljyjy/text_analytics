I received this cream for free from Target & Influenster for my honest review: this is a very unique product made with salicylic acid and hyalaronic acid.  First off I really love the mattifying effect of this moisturizer. I also love that it diminished my pimples within days of application. The smell has a very light grape scent which i like because my skin is very sensitive to alot of smell.My skin stayed moisturized for a long tome without having to reapply a moisturizer. I also lov the little bottle it comes in you get the perfect amount o cream each time. 10/10 Amazing Mattifying affect!
