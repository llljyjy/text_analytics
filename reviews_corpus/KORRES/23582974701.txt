I found this to be super hydrating. A very small amount goes a long way and leaves a dewy look. Be careful not to add too much as it can quickly look oily. I feel like this is one of those products that you only have to buy a couple times in your life as it will last so long. I did not find this to irritate my skin or break me out, but I would be mindful to make sure to wash my face at the end of the day. Which I do anyways. Overall I recommend. Wonderfully Hydrating
