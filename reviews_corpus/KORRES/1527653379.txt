i’ve has this product for two months and use it everyday - morning and night as my cleanser. i went to use my product today after being gone for a few days for vacation to find my product like this. it’s clearly mold or something because it smells sour. i don’t understand how this happened or why this happened to me, because i don’t see anyone else talking about it in the comments. absolutely disgusting and i’ll never buy this product again no matter how good it is BEWARE
