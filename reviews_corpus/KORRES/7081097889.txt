I was sent my complimentary product from Influesnter and Korres in exchange for my honest review. It wasn’t until I was sent this product did I have the opportunity to try this brand. But let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised. At first glance you may think this is just a thick moisturizer but the power is in the formula. This is a lightweight gel moisturizer to help blur visuals pores, controls shine, and helps your skin feel and stay hydrated all day. This formula has a powerful blend of Hyaluronic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Willowherb Extract, and the antioxidant-rich, Santorini Grape. Ingredient brekadown:•Hyaluronic acid helps increase skin moisture. It also helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. •Salicylic Acid helps treat acne by reducing swelling, fight redness, and clear blocked skin pores. •Willowherb extract is a plant that has anti-inflammatory properties. This is a key factor to help soothe irritated skin (very beneficial to those who have sensitive skin) Equally important within Willowherb it creates antibacterial qualities that can help deal with Propionibacterium Acnes, this is the bacteria that causes acne.All around this is an amazing product that helps create a poreless complexion, balance all day hydration and helps smooth skin canvas. I highly recommend trying this for myself, this may effect your skin type differently so I recommend trying to sample size before purchasing a full size jar. The proof is in the formula
