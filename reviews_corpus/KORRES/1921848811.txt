I have mostly normal skin that can lean on the dry side, and this unfortunately makes me hyperaware of my dryness. I find myself having to use a lot more than I normally would in order to feel fully moisturized. This is definitely a gel moisturizer and not a gel/cream. I feel the ingredients in this compliment my sensitive skin, I just wish it were in a different form that made it more hydrating. nan
