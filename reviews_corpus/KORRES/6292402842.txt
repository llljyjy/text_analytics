I think it’s a good moisturizer for both night and day. I have dry skin and it does feel rather hydrating. I have only used it for a few days but I do like how it applies, doesn’t feel tacky in any way on the skin. I will however state I haven’t noticed a difference in my pores. Maybe that’s over prolonged use? Applies nice.
