I received this product complimentary to test and give my honest review. I received a sample size of this product. Here are my thoughts:May it is the Holy Grail for acne/oily skin with visible pores. It is not impressive to me with normal, resilient skin. Positives: skin feels great after application, does hydrate, is lightweight and a creamy texture. I will finish this sample by putting in my purse as a hand lotion. Hope to see a difference in my very dry hands. It might be your HG! butâ€¦not for me
