This product was super lightweight and fairly hydrating. Light and natural fragrance, nothing offensive. My skin is extremely dry so this product I dont think this is the best option for me anyway. The salicylic acid is nice in a moisturizer because its a naturally dryer ingredient. It did help decongest my pores but at the end of the day I needed a little more hydration. Good for the right person
