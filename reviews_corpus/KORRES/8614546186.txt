I got a free deluxe sample from Influenster and Korres in exchange of my honest review. I tried it in my morning and night time skincare routine and I loved how my skin stayed hydrated. It didnâ€™t leave my skin with that greasy feeling and it is well absorbed by my skin. I also liked the pleasant and fresh smell. Good Hydration!
