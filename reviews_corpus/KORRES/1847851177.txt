I had the pleasure of working with influenster and korres to try out the Santorini Grape Poreless skin cream for free in exchange for my honest review. I actually really like this cream. It’s nice and hydrating on my skin! It makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated. I feel like this product would be nice under makeup. The only things I don’t like about this product is the scent. It has a light scent that I feel like doesn’t need to be in the product. Other than that I really like it! Great cream
