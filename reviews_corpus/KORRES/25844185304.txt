I put in the refrigerator & apply it if i’ve have a rough day, i’m going somewhere special.. I just want a little plump, moisture, glow. & this mask is it. I do NOT use it regularly, more so once every 1-3 months depends. It is super moisturizing and my skin just does not need all that regularly. (my opinion, but i’m not a dermatologist)  Anyways, Love it. Will buy again! Love this!
