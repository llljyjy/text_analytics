I received a sample size from Influenster to try in exchange to my honest review. First of, i think this is not intended for a very sensitive skin like mine. I tried to apply it on my face and i felt a little stinging sensation. Because i’m so scared of what might happen to my face, i didn’t wait for it to subside, I immediately wash off it with water. To be fair mg face is not on it’s best condition when i tried it. Maybe it’s not for me and can work on others. But i like the subtle smell of it. It’s almost unscented. Not for very sensitive skin
