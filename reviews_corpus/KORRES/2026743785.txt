I always love using this brand. While it’s a little pricey you are getting alot of natural goodness. It’s not overly moisturizing but it works. It’s very light on the skin and doesn’t leave a oily feel behind. Has a nice clean scent and it’s not very strong. My reason for a four star is that I had to put extra moisturizer on top because it didn’t work well for my overly dry skin. Not bad!
