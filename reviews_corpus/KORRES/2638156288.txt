I have to say I’m always a little apprehensive to try new skincare products because of my skin being prone to breakouts. And I was pleasantly surprised! Not only did I not have any breakouts in the four weeks I’ve been using it, but it even carried me through my menses with only get one zit! And even though it has salicylic acid it isn’t too drying which is good since I also have dry skin. I’m considering adding this to my routine in place of my current salicylic acid product if I can swing the price! Wow
