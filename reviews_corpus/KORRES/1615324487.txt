I received this from Influenster to sample for free in return for my review. I was really excited to receive a product from Korres because I have always heard amazing things about their skin care. It has a great smell and leaves my skin feeling hydrated. In the amount of time the sample posted I saw some of my porres deminish but I would t say it was drastic. As a moisturizer I would definitely recommend but itâ€™s your really trying to fight large pores there is probably something better out there. Great Moisturizer
