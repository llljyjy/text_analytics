I am a huge Korres fan, and this moisturizer did not change that. This light weight, hydrating cream not only smells delicious…..it feels amazing in the skin. I love it for my AM routine before makeup. It hydrated my skin so nicely, while actually helping reduce pore size. My skin looked really good with my base makeup after using this. And the salicylic acid really helped keep the oils at bay, with my skin was nicely oil controls. This is a perfect before makeup moisturizer and I can’t wait to pair it with the complimenting serum I have coming! This oily skin girl is loving this line!!! Love it! Love Korres!!!
