When I received a sample of this cream complimentary in exchange for an honest review I instantly fell in love on the first use! I loved how the santorini grape extract made my large pores disappear and how the salicylic acid minimized my blemishes. I rub a small drop of it on my face and neck morning and night and it has greatly renewed my skin, giving it a glow. I will definitely keep this on regular rotation in my skincare routine! Best Skin Cream Ever!
