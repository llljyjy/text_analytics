I was sent a sample of this from Influenster for my honest opinion… I actually really needed this and didn’t know it. I’ve been trying countless products to try to help clear up the acne on my chin that’s been haunting me for months now. I use this at night after cleansing and it actually has started to help clear up my face. I am hopeful it will continue to work. Time will tell. It also smells nice and not strong. It absorbs super fast which is nice too. If you are struggling with your skin I would give this a try. Bonus that it isn’t super expensive like a lot of stuff our skin needs. poreless skin cream
