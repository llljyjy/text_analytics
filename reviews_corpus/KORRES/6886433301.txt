I receive this product to test for free from Influenster. I have been using this product for just over 3 weeks and I’m liking it. It did however break my face out the first 2 weeks but over the last week it has been clearing up. It has a nice light clean scent and the product isn’t heavy on my face. I’m excited to keep trying it to see what kind of results I can get over a few months. nan
