I have very sensitive skin so I’m always a little nervous trying new products. The packaging doesn’t scream at me to buy it. I gave it 4 stars because it smells like playdoh or clay, I’m not a huge fan of the scent. I will say, I really like the way it goes on and leaves mg skin feeling super soft all day. Thankfully, it has not made my skin breakout. It’s a great product aside from the scent nan
