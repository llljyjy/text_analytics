Korres products always blow me away!  The grape poreless skin cream has such a light, fresh scent.  The texture is smooth and absorbs into the skin very quickly.  It’s not at all greasy.  I have been using it at night, after applying my night time serum.  My skin looks much fresher and brighter in the morning.  It isn’t irritating to my dry and sensitive skin.  It actually seems to calm irritations from my rosacea.  I highly recommend it and will be purchasing it in the future. nan
