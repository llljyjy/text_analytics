I have been using the Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream by KORRES now every night for a month and my skin feels super moisturized, even during winter! The cream goes in thick and smooth but really absorbs nicely to the skin so it doesnâ€™t feel heavy. The smell is interesting, almost like an olive oil or grape oil scent. I do feel like this is a premium product for adding moisture to dry skin and would recommend for that purpose. Goes on smooth, absorbs well
