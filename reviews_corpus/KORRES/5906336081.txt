I received a sample of this product free to try in exchange for my honest review. I immediately noticed the pleasant scent of this product when I opened the container. This cream is so hydrating and perfect for these cold winter months. Even though it was very moisturizing, it didn’t seem heavy on the skin. It applies evenly and works well under makeup. I’ve been using for about a week and have noticed a slight improvement on the appearances of my pores. Overall, great product, and I highly recommend. Great Skin Cream
