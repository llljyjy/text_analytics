I received a complimentary sample of this cream in a VoxBox from Influenster. I have sensitive combination skin with pores on and around my nose. This cream is lightweight and surprisingly hydrating for a product that contains salicylic acid. It layers nicely over my niacinamide and zinc serum. My skin felt plump and my pores looked smaller. This cream is perfect for my skin type. Lightweight and Hydrating
