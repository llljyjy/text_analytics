I have sensitive and dry skin and I’ve been meaning to add a salicylic acid to my skincare routine but all the ones I’ve tried have been too harsh on my skin and cause irritation…. Until THIS! I have seen a noticeable difference in my pores after using this, my pores have been minimized. This product also keeps your skin hydrated overnight after applying. My skin has also been looking less dull since I’ve used this product. I DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone and everyone! definitely recommend!
