I am a make up artist and skin care addict!  It’s my passion and I love trying out new moisturizers, this one did not disappoint. I use a water cream or gel moisturizer daily, this is a gel cream. The consistency is so nice, it’s refreshing to apply and does not go on heavy but it does moisturize as if it’s a heavy night cream. I used this in place of my regular moisturizer for a week straight. The first day I was sitting in the pick up line at my kids school and just happened to place my hand on my cheek and I was blown away, my face still felt dewy and it was so soft. I felt my neck and everything was so moist as if I had just put it on. It was not greasy it was that nice dewy feel that you get with glowy skin. I was so shocked that I had already had almost a full day running around and my skin was not dry. Mind you, its winter and I am constantly running the heater in my home and car!! That’s impressive!! I have been supplementing my normal moisturizer with oil on top to add more moisture because of the winter dryness I experience, but with Korres I didn’t even have to do that!!! I will be replacing my usual moisturizer for this one and the best part is that it’s half the price of my ride or die! Thank you Korres and influenster for giving me the opportunity to test this product for my honest review. Maximum hydration achieved!!
