So far I am in love with this product. I only got a small sample size from Influenster. I’ve already ordered the full size for when I run out. I’ve been using it about 2 weeks and I’ve seen a significant difference in my nose and chin pores. My nose doesn’t have near as many white heads or black heads. My face has felt so soft since I started using. It soaks in great, leaves no greasy feeling what so ever. No strong scent. Just an all around great product. Can’t wait to see the results after a longer period of time, Poreless
