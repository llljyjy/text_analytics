I used this along with my other skin care & it had my skin feeling AMAZING. I’ve never used anything else like this, but I love it. It has a good scent & doesn’t have an oily texture. It didn’t bother my skin because some products do. A little goes a long way as well. 10/10 reccomend to try this! Recieved it as a complimentary sample from Influenster. nan
