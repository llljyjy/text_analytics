This grape powerless skin cream is a great moisturizer. It goes on smooth and not greasy. Added plus that it has salicylic acid in it to help with problem skin. I have used it daily for a week now and I have had no negative reactions to it. It has a slight smell but I like that it does not have a strong floral smell. The packaging is eye catching. I would recommend this skin cream. nan
