First, I loved the smell of coconut. It immediately transports me onto a tropical island and gives my vacation vibes.Iâ€™ve used this moisturizer als fourth step in my skincare routine, after cleansing, toning and serum. The texture is lightweight, a mixture between gel and cream, not oily or too dense. It glides right onto my skin and was absorbed in no time. No residue, greasiness, stickiness or tight feeling left. My skin looked hydrated, very smooth and bright.I liked how my skin felt using this cream. It is a solid. Great lightweight moisturizer
