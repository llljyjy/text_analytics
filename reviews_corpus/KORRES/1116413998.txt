I received a sample of this to try for my review. The first thing I noticed it the scent is nice and light. Second was the amazing cool feeling when I applied it. It made my skin nice and moisturized even in the harsh cold Chicago winter. It also didnâ€™t make me break out and was not heavy feeling at all. Great cooling feeling
