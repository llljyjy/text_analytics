This skin cream does precisely what it claims- leaving skin looking good while the salicylic acid helps to clear your pores. I have (sadly for me) large pores on my cheeks and I hope that by using this product it will help shrink my pores a bit. In the meantime it’s a great moisturizer under makeup and has a nice finish- doesn’t add to the shine on my face. Well done, Korres! Great under makeup
