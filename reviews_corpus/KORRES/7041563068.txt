i had a sample of this and loved it so much that i bought two full size bottles during the Sephora sale! it makes my skin feel so clean, soft and hydrated at the same time! i have rosacea+acne+sensitive skin and iâ€™m amazed with how it has minimized redness and cleared my acne AND texture on my skin! my skin has never felt better and never felt this smooth! this is definitely a staple in my skin care routine now :) my favourite cleanser!!
