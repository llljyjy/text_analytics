I got a nice sized sample of this from Influenster and honestly, it could be nice in the summer, but for someone with normal skin who uses tretinoin already and loves in a very dry winter climate right now, the salicylic acid is just too drying.  I do think it could be nice for those with oily skin or who experience issues with clogged pores and the like, but that’s just not my situation.  Guess I’ll see how it works for me in June ^-^ Too Dry for Winter
