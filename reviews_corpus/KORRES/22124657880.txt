The Korres Santorini grape poreless skin cream is amazing. It’s a gel type texture. It’s hydrating & Lightweight at the same time. It’s a little thicker than most gel type creams. It has a light scent which is pleasant & not overpowering. It applies so smooth on my skin & works well under makeup. It checks all the boxes for my needs. Smooth & Lightweight
