Not my favorite product by Korres. It left my face feeling dry, but was still oily at touch. It minimized my pores, so I recommend using this product on the forehead and nose after washing your face and before applying a moisturizer on the rest of the face. I usually use it before bed, and wake up with smaller pores. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review from Influenster. nan
