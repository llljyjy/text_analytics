I have been testing out this for a few weeks since I received it. I enjoy the light scent and it feels hydrating. One thing I have noticed that when I layer this under my supergoop sunscreen, it makes my sunscreen pill which I don’t want. I do think it has helped with small blemishes, so I still do like this product. Maybe it would work better with another sunscreen or if I use less products. I only use this in the morning since it shouldn’t be mixed with retinol. nice moisturizer
