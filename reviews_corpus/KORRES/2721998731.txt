Pure skin deliciousness! Received this as a sample and did not expect it to be as liquidy and oily as it was, but love it! thought it was going to be a thicker silkier serum, but this is up my skin alley! I have very dry skin, so it works for me. It can be a combo serum/oil moisturizer. It’s a bit pricey for 30 ml, but worth a buy, especially in colder months. I’d use this as my first layer under a nice moisturizer before bed. OH.MY.GAWD.
