Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream has a very light fresh scent. I have been using it a few weeks and I can tell a difference in the shine around my t-zone. It is lightweight and it glides on easily. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized all day without it feeling oily. I really love the shine control and I will definitely purchase this one. Shine free
