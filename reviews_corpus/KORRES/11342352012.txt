I love this lightweight gel moisturizer! I have very large pores that are super noticeable when I wear foundation because it accumulates in my pores. This cream helped to blur those pores and not cause the accumulation. Makes a huge difference in how my foundation looks. I used to use a moisturizer then primer on top, but now all I have to use is just this one product. It had also helped keep my skin clear of acne as well! I definitely reccomend! Exactly what I needed!
