My skin is combo dry so I was hesitant at first to use due to that but I did have oily T zones I could try it on and must say it was great to have a moisturizer that wasn’t overly moisturizing and won’t make my skin break out. It works great to maintain my skin condition but doesn’t necessarily make it baby soft like the more moisturizing ones do. For those with oily skin I can see this work fairly well. Thanks influencester for the opportunity to try this product! Great in my oily t zones, it works just fine
