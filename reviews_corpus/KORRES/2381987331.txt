This is an excellent second cleanser. It’s gentle and hydrating. My skin doesn’t feel tight after washing and products absorb quickly afterwards. It rinses off easily as well. The only thing I don’t like is the unpleasant smell, but it’s not strong and it goes away once the product is rinsed off so it’s not a deal breaker. nan
