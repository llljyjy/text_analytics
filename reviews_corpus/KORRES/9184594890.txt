This poreless skin cream from KORRES is great. It first off feels amazing on my skin. Definitely leaves my pores looking blurred at the same time as moisturizing my skin. It goes great under my makeup or even without makeup. Doesnâ€™t seem to cause any breakouts or oily skin. I really like this! Great!
