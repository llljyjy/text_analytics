I personally loooove korres products with my favorite being their oil, But this is definitely an amazing product. This doesnâ€™t really seem like a gel more like a whipped lotion and it settles on the skin so quickly and sinks in very fast. There is never a sticky residue and I know this sounds kind of weird, but it smells a little bit like Play-Doh and that smell is very comforting to me and it reminds me of my childhood. Again, the send does not last long but the effects are definitely amazing. Highly recommend. Sooo good
