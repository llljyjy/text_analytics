I received a sample of this complementary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I first used this product on a day when my face was feeling pretty rough and dry due to the really cold temperatures. However, this product ended up being exactly what my face needed! My skin felt so smooth and hydrated. I even forgot to use makeup primer and it almost seemed to double as one. It wasn’t too thick or too thin. I’m planning on purchasing it. I do think it’s a little on the expensive side for the amount of product you receive but totally worth it. Loved it
