This moisturizer is good for oily skin. I was given a sample of this in return for an honest review. It made my skin break out, because I have dry, sensitive skin. However, my son doesnâ€™t like moisturizers, but he tried this, and he liked it! It helps his oily skin stay hydrated without making more oily or breaking him out! I will purchase this for him to use! Good for oily skin
