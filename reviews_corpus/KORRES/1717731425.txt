I was gifted a sample size of this product by Influencer, and loved it! I appreciated how lightweight the product is, and I thought it helped blur some light scars I have on the side of my face. The scent is also very fresh. With that being said, I wouldnâ€™t recommend this product for people who have super dry skin and live in cold areas. For example, I live in Chicago, and will be waiting until March or April to purchase the full size version of this! nan
