I really liked this moisturizer!!! I used it as the last step in my night time skin care routine, after my serum, and I used WAAAAAY too much the first time! I’m used to night creams, which are usually super thick, and this is definitely NOT thick!!! It’s nice and thin, light weight, and refreshing...and a little bit goes a loooong way, take it from me, I learned the hard way!!! It’s not greasy in any way, though, either...it absorbed really nicely and it left my skin nice and silky soft!!! I would completely recommend...the only thing I didn’t really care for was the smell...which isn’t really much of a smell, but I didn’t care for it...it has that typical drugstore lotion smell...I’m not sure if it’s actually scented like that, or if that’s just what moisturizer smells like naturally, but I’d definitely rather them scent it a different way, either which way...I’ve never been able to handle that cheap lotion smell, if you know what I mean...don’t get me wrong, I’m NOT saying that this product is cheap or cheaply made by ANY means, it just kinda smells like it. BUT, that’s just me, some others may like the smell. It’s definitely not a deal breaker, though, by ANY means!!! Good Stuff!!!
