I received a sample of this product to test and review, and found it to be lightweight, gentle, and hydrating without being oily or sticky. It has a neutral unscented smell, which I’m actually not crazy about but I know that’s a plus for many. My skin is going through some stuff right now, and this definitely feels good on the drier, uneven spots. nan
