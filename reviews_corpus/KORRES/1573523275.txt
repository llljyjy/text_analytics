This is a great lightweight, hydrating base layer! Will be perfect in the summertime when Iâ€™m looking for a nice moisturizer but nothing too sticky or heavy. Smells great, and I feel like it evens out my skin well and improves my texture from just a few weeks use. Will be getting another as soon as my current cream runs out! nan
