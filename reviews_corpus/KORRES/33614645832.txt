I received this product for free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review.I’m truly in love with this face cream! I don’t always spend a lot of time on me as I should. In using this cream for a few weeks now, I’ve noticed a change in how my face looks on a day to day basis. This leaves no greasy shine and applying makeup after application is a breeze! I would definitely buy more once my sample size is gone! My face has truly never looked so smooth and young in awhile. I’ve ordered more products from this line to keep up the look and excited to see what occurs over a few more weeks. Also, I tend to have “sensitive” skin, in that it turns pink/red if it doesn’t like certain products. My skin has been so happy with this one! You won’t regret buying this!
