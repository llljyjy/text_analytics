This moisturizer worked well for me. It smelled nice, scent wasn’t too over powering at all, just the right amount of aroma. This cream also controlled the oiliness of my skin. With some facial products, if it’s not right for me, I end up looking a greasy mess. This cream did not do that, it’s lightweight and gives a well hydrated look after rubbing into your skin. nan
