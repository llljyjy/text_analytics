I received a sample size product from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I really like this product. I generally donâ€™t use products containing salicylic acid because it dries out my sensitive skin, but this product did not! Skin instantly feels smoother and more even upon first use. I am hoping that with continued use this product will help minimize pores and reduce acne as my skin has been needing some help with having to wear a face mask daily. It also smells pleasant and natural. OK for Sensitive Skin
