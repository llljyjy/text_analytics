This is a really good moisturizer for combination skin. I didn’t think it would work well, but it is very moisturizing and keep my skin hydrated all day in this winter weather and my skin wasn’t left ashy and had a nice glowy look all day.This did not mattify my skin for more than 30 minutes. I didn’t notice my pores as much, my skin looked smooth and hydrated definitely will keep this in my morning routine. I liked the performance of this product andbI will add to my skincare routine. Great moisturizer!
