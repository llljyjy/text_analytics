I received this product for free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review. I like that this product is cruelty-free, vegan, and eco-friendly. I also like that it contains hyaluronic acid, willowherb extract, which has documented skin-calming and antioxidant benefits, as well as the anti-oxidant-rich santorini grape. It’s lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving any sticky feeling. It’s very gentle on my skin and hasn’t caused any irritation or breakouts. The product claims to minimize pores, control shine, and hydrate skin all day. I have combination skin and this cream hydrates my skin well and leaves it soft (it might not be enough hydration for those with dry skin). However, I haven’t noticed any changes in my pores yet. Also, it contains a fragrance that I don’t like. Other than these, it’s a good product and I would recommend it.⁣#Influenster #VoxBox #complimentary #FreshStartVoxBox #ThatGreekGlow #korres Good Product
