I received this product for free from Influenster and Korres brand in exchange for my honest review. Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream is great. I’ve applied the cream everyday for 2 weeks and I love it. It makes my skin feel soft, subtle and my pores look smaller than normal. It has a light scent and it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I’d recommend this face cream. @korres #Influenster #ThatGreekGlow nan
