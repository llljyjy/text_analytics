Definitely controls the shine, this product goes on like a mosturizer, dries down and controls the shine so Iâ€™m guessing this is good for people who are oily skinned prone. On my end I did notice a softness to my skin but not so much hydration. I did receive this product complementary of influenster for my honest review. I'd give it a try again
