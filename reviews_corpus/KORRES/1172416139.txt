I received this sample size product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The texture of the cream was average however the results were really good. I often develop shine in my T-zone and this is one of the first moisturizers that was able to diminish the oil production with my combination skin. No overwhelming scent was noticed. I think that it definitely moisturized well. I do plan to purchase to full size and would recommend it! Helps diminish T-zone shine/oiliness!!
