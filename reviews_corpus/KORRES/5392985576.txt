I am always so hesitant to try sample products as sometimes thereâ€™s not enough product. But this actually did the job and a little bit goes a long way! I have slight dark spots on my cheeks and after about 2 weeks of use I noticed a slight difference in my skin. It definitely feels smoother and the dark spots are a little lighter. I took away one star just because it has a weird almost like a play dough kinda scent to it otherwise I would recommend! Great for blemishes!
