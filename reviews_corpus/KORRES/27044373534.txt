I received a sample sized bottle to review complimentary in exchange for my honest review by influenster and I have really been liking this so far. I did break out a bit but I usually do when trying new products. It feels nice on the skin and a littpe goes a long way. I wish I could try it for a longer period of time to really be able to see how it would be for my skin, but from what I can tell, its very nice. nan
