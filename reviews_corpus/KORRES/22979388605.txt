I received the Fresh Start Vox from @influenster and @korres for free in exchange for my honest opinion. Included in this box was Korres Santorini Grape Porless Skin Cream.I’m pretty picky when it comes to any type of face moisturizer for they tend to make my skin super oily thus causing breakouts. But I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the way that this moisturizer feels on my skin/face! It’s super lightweight, it controls your shine, and blurs your pores beautifully! The only downside to this product would have to be the way it smells. Although it’s not a strong scent, it’s not necessarily a good scent. nan
