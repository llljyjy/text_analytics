I received this product as a free sample. It is not my top choice for dry sensitive skin, this seems like it is better for people that are more concerned with pores or oil. Despite not targeting my concerns, I still like it. The hydration soaks in fast and doesnâ€™t irritate my skin. If you have particularly sensitive skin, go for the Korres Greek yoghurt or wild rose skincare lines. No regrets!
