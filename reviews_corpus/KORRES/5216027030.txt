I didn’t really know what to expect from a product mentioning Santorini Grapes. Like what do grapes do for skincare? But this product was actually good! I have an oily tzone and this cream did an awesome job of controlling the oils. I also liked that it didn’t burn or sting at all, which is great for an acid product. My skin was soft and smooth. I’d definitely consider buying the full size. Pleasantly Surprised
