This has a pleasant sweet scent that doesn’t linger after application. I found it to be slightly tacky and didn’t mind it under my foundation. It’s hard to say if it reduces the look of pores but to really get a feel for skincare, you need to use for quite a bit of time. I enjoy my sample and will continue to use it. nan
