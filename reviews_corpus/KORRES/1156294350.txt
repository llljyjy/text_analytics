The sample tube prominently displays “salicylic acid” on the label. I have sensitive skin and was reluctant to go all-in straightaway. I spot tested a few problem areas hoping the salicylic acid would improve some blemishes. In the past, my skin has responded well to targeted doses of salicylic acid. The Korres formula has a wonderfully silky texture. While the treated areas felt smoother the next day, the blemishes were still noticeable with little or no reduction in redness. As for the ingredients, they prompted me to pause moving ahead with applying the recommended nickel-sized amount of product on my sensitive skin. Interestingly, salicylic acid is one of the last of the ingredients listed. Citric acid appears much higher in the formula. I was not ready to risk my skin barrier. My take: if you have oily yet stable skin, try the Korres cream. It appears to be a nice blend. If you have sensitivity, spot test first. Know Your Skin Type
