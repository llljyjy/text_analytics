I received a sample of this cream to try and give my thoughts.  I’m pretty happy with it! I have pretty large pores (especially on my nose, ugh!) so I was excited to try this and I have to say it actually did work - maybe didn’t totally shrink them but they did seem to be visibly smaller. And the salicylic acid was good for the breakouts I was having at the time. It is really light weight, too which helps when you don’t want to feel so much goop on your face and it smells nice and clean. Very lightweight!
