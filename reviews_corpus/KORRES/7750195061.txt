This cream is perfect for oily/combo skin since it’s not too heavy but still provides great moisture. I’m usually against creams in the morning since I can get oily by mid-day but I have applied this cream in the morning the past two weeks and my skin loves it. I also love the ingredients contain hyaluronic acid and salicylic acid to keep my skin calm and plump. The scent is not overpowering which I prefer. I received this product for free for my honest review. Oily skin savior!
