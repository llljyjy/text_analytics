Very mixed feelings about this product. It has a familiar scent I can’t quite place my finger of what it reminds me of, it’s not bad but it’s not good either. I have combo skin and it did a great job keeping my skin moisturized with a healthy glow while not becoming oily. I noticed a small improvement on pore size using it everyday for a month. But I didn’t like that I couldn’t wear it underneath my make up, when I tried (multiple occasions) it made a sticky texture. Given it’s price I think it’s a good start investment to begin your skin journey. nan
