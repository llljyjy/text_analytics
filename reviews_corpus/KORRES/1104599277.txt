I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I thought this was a great moisturizer. The texture was lightweight and non-greasy, it absorbed into my skin fairly quickly and left it feeling smooth all day. It didnâ€™t however make any changes to my pores. The scent reminds me a little of olive oil. nan
