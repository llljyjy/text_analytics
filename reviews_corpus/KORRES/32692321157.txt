This skin cream was such a pleasant surprise! It has a very gentle, clean scent and absorbed beautifully into my skin. I’ve only been testing it for a couple days now but I can already feel the texture of my skin improving! I’m super excited to pursue continued use with this product and I’m looking forward to more positive results, especially in the dead of winter. Soft & Smooth
