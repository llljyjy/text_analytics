This is a very nice moisturizer. I’ve been using it in areas where I have large pores to test the “poreless“ aspect and my pores have been looking amazing! A nice lightweight moisturizer that sinks in easily and leaves my skin super soft! I have dry skin, so I use a heavier moisturizer over top and it lays nicely over this product! I have also my makeup going on smoother as well.  I really like this! I received this product complimentary in exchange for review. Nice Moisturizer!
