This product did a decent job at accomplishing what it said it would. I feel that I need to disclose that I had a lot of severe acne when I was younger, so the idea that this cream could ever make my pores disappear or cover them up completely was never on the table. Still, the pores around my cheeks and nose are noticeably smaller once I apply this. The size that I got was different than the one shown in the photo and even with this one, it appears to be the perfect size to just throw into your purse or travel carry on. I carried it with me in my backpack to and from work.I’m a junkie for cosmetics and products with a scent, but the scent here isn’t extremely noticeable. In fact, unless you really made a point of sniffing it, it’s not really that potent at all. That all said I’m on the fence of whether I would buy this again. At my age, I’m not as concerned with pores as I am with fine lines and on that front, I think that this product performs about average in comparison to other comparable creams. nan
