My skin is textured, red and my pores are large. The salicylic acid in this product helps smooth and balance your skin and I found my skin feeling less rough and my pores looking smaller after using this product for a few weeks. As someone with sensitive skin, thIs product was great and my skin felt much better for using it. Smooth and Balanced Skin
