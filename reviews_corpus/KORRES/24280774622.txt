I received this sample-size product free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review.  I’m loving this sample of the New Korres Poreless Skin Cream! Even with this winter weather, it makes my skin feel moisturized, smooth, comforted, and protected. It features active ingredient salicylic acid to keep pores clear from impurities and anti-aging antioxidants from Santorini Grapes. The product is made in Greece. It’s the first Greek skincare product I’ve tried so far and I’m definitely interested in buying the full-size product. I’m loving this one!
