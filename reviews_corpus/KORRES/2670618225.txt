I have received this creme complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this creme for more than 2 weeks so far. I like the light scent of this product. It has clean ingredients and did not irratate or break my skin for the entire time. I feel the freshness and softness after applying this creme but not noticing much effect on my pores. I have combination skin and more towards dry skin during winter time. It does provide some moisturization but not enough for me. Iâ€™d recommend to use it in summer. Love the clean ingredients
