After trying this Poreless Skin Cream for a couple of weeks I can honestly say that my skin feels moisturized through even the most dry winter days! Additionally, I get complements all the time on my smooth skin and small pores since using this cream. Iâ€™m so thankful to have been chosen to receive a complimentary sample of this cream in exchange for my honest review! All day moisture and smoothness
