I have always wanted to try the Korres line of beauty care since I’ve always heard such great reviews on their products. Luckily, I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and I love it! I do have to make a conditional statement and say that this is not something I can use alone or in replacement of my moisturizer. It’s not moisturizing enough during this winter season to be used alone. However, it is amazing as an addition to my current skincare routine to supplement. I have been using this daily in the mornings in place of my regular moisturizer. And at night I use my regular moisturizer to keep my face hydrated. And this routine has worked wonders for my face. It really minimized the appearance of my pores and left my skin feeling smooth with a soft hydrating glow. It absorbs quickly. And creates a nice base for my sunscreen. I love the packaging as well. The color scheme is nice and natural and doesn’t create an eye sore when left out on your bathroom sink. I would definitely continue to use this. A great supplement to your daily routine
