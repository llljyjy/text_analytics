I received a sample of this product complimentary from Korres and influenster in exchange for my honest review. I found the cream to be moisturizing. It has a nice texture and is not too fragrant. I did not notice a difference in my pores while using, but maybe they would improve if I used for a longer period of time. Overall, I like this product. Good
