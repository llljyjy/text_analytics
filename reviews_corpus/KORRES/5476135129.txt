I was pleasantly surprised that this gel moisturizer worked for my skin type. Most products with salicylic acid make my skin dry out too much and this one didn’t! I like the texture of the product as well as the light and refreshing scent. Really glad it’s cruelty free, vegan, and silicone free. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. Even for dry skin!
