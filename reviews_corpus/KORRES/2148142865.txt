I receive this product for free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest opinion. Overall I like this product! I already use several rx topicals so I don’t love using a salicylic acid product daily but id use this on days when I was breaking out bad or I forgot to use/didn’t bring my rx topicals with me. Its somewhat moisturizing but I personally found I always needed to add another moisturizer on top. If you don’t use other harsh skin products, this is a great one to add in when you’re breaking out! nan
