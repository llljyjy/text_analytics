I have dehydrated skin with large pores. Nothing seems to satiate it. It can have days where it gets itchy and tight and just horribly shiny. In my 37 years, I have tried many, different moisturisers and lotions and oils and nothing ever worked for longer than a couple of hours, and then it starts drying out again. This cream leaves my skin feeling refreshed, moisturized and blurs my pores. I received this product free for testing purposes from Influenster. nan
