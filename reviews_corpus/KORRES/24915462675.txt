I love the texture of this cream, it gets absorbed really fast and feels like a gel, it doesn’t leave a greasy layer but instead is lightweight and has this nice faint fragrance, and the best part, as a make-up enthusiast, I love how good this goes with primer and foundation, no pilling and no creasing. If you’re doubtful about this one, let me tell you this: you’ll love it. Get it! Absorbs like a dream
