I don’t have an allergic reaction to salicylic acid but my skin got hot right after putting this on so I wouldn’t recommend for sensitive skin types. Since I saw the reaction of my skin to the cram I stopped using it but the glow is absolutely real! I had a gorgeous glow on(maybe it was the reaction of my skin towards the cream) right after putting the cream on. Yes Glow BUT No For Sensitive Skin
