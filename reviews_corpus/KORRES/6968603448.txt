I received a complimentary sample of the Korres Poreless Skin Cream to review. This is a lightweight moisturizer that has a gel cream texture that is light and absorbs quickly into the skin. It is intended to blur pores, control shine, and hydrate skin all day using a powerful blend of Hyaluronic Acid, Salicylic Acid, and the antioxidant rich, Santorini Grape. I do like that there is salicylic acid in it to help keep blemishes away. However, I didnâ€™t see any of the blurring properties that it claims. It left my skin feeling nice and soft right after application. Through out the day, I feel like my skin did not feel hydrated. I do have very dry skin and I found myself having to reapply a different moisturizer. Overall, it is not a bad moisturizer and would recommend it to try for those who have oily or combo skin. If you have dry, acne prone skin, I would just recommend an additional application of another moisturizer. #ThatGreekGlow @korres @influenster #influenster #freshstartvoxbox #complimentary Nice gel cream
