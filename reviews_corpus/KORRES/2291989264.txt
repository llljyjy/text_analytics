I was very pleasantly surprised by this oil, given that I’ve been struggling for over a year to find facials products that truly make my skin feel hydrated (I’ve gone through tons of hyaluronic acid serums, ceramide serums, thick creams, nothing has truly done it). This stuff is incredible! I got a sample of it in my last order and another few samples when I ordered something else from Korres so I’ve been able to use it for over a week and it is so lovely—it truly does make skin feel like velvet and I haven’t needed to slather on thick creams or other facial oils after using it like with other things I’ve tried. My skin is soft and hydrated for the entire day! I can’t say I’ve noticed much in terms of an added glow or anything, but the way my skin feels alone makes me love this. It does smell a bit like putting white wine on your face to me (since it’s made of grapes) but I don’t really mind since it’s subtle and fades quickly. Definitely purchasing a full size! nan
