I received this product complimentary for an honest review. Iâ€™ve had the chance to try a Korres moisturizer before, and loved it. And this one surely did not disappoint - MN winters can be unruly on my skin and this product left my skin feeling smooth, moisturized, and glowing. I seriously just need to switch all my skincare to all Korres!! nan
