I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest feedback. I noticed an immediate improvement in my skin after the first few uses. I have large pores and some blackheads, with this product my skin looked noticeably smoother and my pores looked blurred. My makeup went on very nice. I love the price point of this cream and it contains many quality ingredients. I would definitely recommend and purchase in the future. Blurs Pores and Imperfections Nicely
