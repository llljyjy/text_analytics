I received a sample of Korres Santorini Grape Powerless Skin Cream from Influenster and Korres complimentary for my honest review. I’ve been using it instead of my usual resurfacing cream for about a week and a half and have noticed some shine control. I was having a little breakout before I started and my skin has been smoothing out since applying this skin cream in the morning and evening. I can’t say that I have seen a reduction in pore size yet. It smells so good and fresh, but not overwhelming. The cream is lightweight and goes on smoothly. I haven’t had any pilling with my other products. Love that this product contains Hyaluronic Acid and salicylic acid. nan
