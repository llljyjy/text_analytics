I was actually very pleasantly surprised with thismoisturizer. My skin had been getting a lot moredry from the cold winter air in NYC, but after onlya few days, this moisturizer made my skin somuch smoother and softer. It also did reduce theappearance of pores and I loved the smell of it.Itâ€™s easy to use and feels great on my skin. Imight just have to switch to this as my go to! nan
