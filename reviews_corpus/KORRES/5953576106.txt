I recieved Korres Santorini Grape powerless skin cream from Influenster to try and review and I absolutely love it! It has no scent and is absorbed instantly into your skin. I left my skin feeling soft and moisturized, but not greasy.  It blurred my pores and left the perfect base to apply my makeup.  Overall I was super happy with this product and definitely will be purchasing more. Soft and moisturized
