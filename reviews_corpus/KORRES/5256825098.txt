I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for an unbiased review. I think this is good for more combination/oily skin. It’s not overly heavy and has salicylic acid which is great for reducing acne and oiliness. The smell of it was kind of a turnoff and I’m not usually sensitive. It also made me a tiny bit itchy. nan
