I received this product complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is a very lightweight moisturizer. It feels nice on my skin and isn’t sticky like other moisturizers I’ve used. It smells amazing, my dog couldn’t stop smelling my face LOL. I haven’t used it long enough to say whether or not it’s helped my acne but I have high hopes. Smells great & lightweight
