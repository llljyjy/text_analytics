I received this product complimentary from Influenster- I just started integrating this into my skin care routine and I usually don’t have an issue with burning, but this product doesn’t agree well with my skin. Doesn’t make my skin red or look irritated, but it definitely burns (and I use salicylic acid products all the time so not sure what my skin doesn’t like). The product does blend well however and doesn’t leave me looking oily. Just ok
