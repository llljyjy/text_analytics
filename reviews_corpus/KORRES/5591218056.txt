I love the texture on this stuff for my whitehead prone oily skin! I use salicylic acid regularly because I have oily, acne prone skin and it is the only thing that smooths my skin. Korres has the nicest texture for all their face moisturizers and this one is really nice so far. I cant say that I see a huge difference yet but it is maintaining my skin by keeping the white heads at bay. Love it! I may want to try the full size. So far so good!
