I received a sample of this in exchange for my honest review from Influenster. This is a lightweight lotion that goes on smoothly and doesn’t have a strong scent. I could see this being an excellent summer moisturizer but it’s not enough for my dry skin. I didn’t notice a reduction in my pores either and I wouldn’t purchase. nan
