I unfortunately did not enjoy this cream. While it smelled nice and felt nice upon application, it dried out my skin within 30 minutes. More than likely it’s just not meant for my skin type. In the colder months, my skin tends to be much dryer, so I’m going to try this again in the warmer months when I don’t need as much moisture. nan
