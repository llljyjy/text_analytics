I have dry skin and this was not the moisturizer for me. It really made my skin feel dry and no matter what caused my skincare to pill on my skin. It didnâ€™t matter if I put a serum on under or it was my first skincare step it would always pill. It did not wear well underneath makeup as it would also pill and cause splotchy foundation. It smelled great and felt good initially but sadly this is not the moisturizer for me. Not my favorite!
