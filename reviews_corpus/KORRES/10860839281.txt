I received this as a complimentary product for testing. I worked this into my nightly routine in place of my normal moisturizer. It left my skin feeling refreshed and it almost has a cooling effect. I love that all of the ingredients are clean. I also immediately noticed a difference in the hydration this cream gave me and the dewy glow it left. This cream worked perfectly with my other skincare products and didnâ€™t cause any breakouts. Definitely recommend!! Great Product
