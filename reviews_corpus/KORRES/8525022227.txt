I received a free sample through Influenster in exchange for my honest review.I love this stuff! I have super sensitive skin, especially on my face, and most products cause me to break out in hives while feeling like my face was on fire. After several hours, im left with “scab“ -like spots from where it ate at my skin.Korres is so gentle & soothing. I no longer have to deal with tight itchy skin! It moisturizes without feeling greasy. It calms my redness and in just a week, has reduced the depth of my fine lines & wrinkle (s) ! My sensitive 43yo skin LOVES it
