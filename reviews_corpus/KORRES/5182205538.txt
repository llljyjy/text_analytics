I received this cream complimentary for my honest review. I wasnt sure what to think when I got this product. I love it. Its light weight with a wonderful scent.  I have to wear a mask and my chin loves to break out because of it.  This cream moisturizers but it doesnt leave the pores clogged and oily causing even more breakouts.  I was pleasantly surprised by this cream.  If it continues to work, I may be switching my face creams. nan
