I’ve been using it for a month, the texture is light like a gel and it absorbs immediately, it doesn’t leave a sticky feeling, and my pores are less visible since I’ve been using it. It helps me not to have shine on my face and leaves a matte appearance that remains throughout the day. works perfect with makeup. It really is a great product ideal for sensitive skin and oily skin. less visible pores❤️✨
