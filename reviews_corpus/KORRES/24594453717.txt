I received this item free from Influenster for my honest and true opinion.I was really disappointed KORRES because I really enjoy the products that they put out. This one not so much so. I stopped using my normal moisturizer and even primer, UGH  EH!!!, since this was SUPPOSED to give me a “poreless” effect. With the ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Willowherb Extract, and the antioxidant-rich, Santorini Grape  I expected I little smoothness and all around healthy skin in no time. Especially from the brand KORRES. I’m not saying it’s a bad moisturizer but for all the benefits that it claims it can bring I was truly disappointed. My skin was still dehydrated I found myself needing to use it throughout the day instead of just the one time, I wish I didn’t throughout the other use a primer is because this was no hope of making me look poreless, there was no effect was my fine lines around my eyes in my mouth that’s what I like to keep them in check and there is no difference, only thing I really saw a difference in was a little smoothness and that I was really disappointed in this cream in for a surprise in the cold is ingredients I was really expecting a lot more different brand. Not that great
