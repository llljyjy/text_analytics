Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream surprised me. I don’t use a ton of products on my skin as I don’t like the heavy feeling that some may leave you with. This skin cream felt weightless and provided a sufficient amount moisture to keep my skin hydrated. My face was soft to the touch and though I did not see a difference in my pores, I love the dress glow it gave me.   You can’t put a price tag on simple effortless beauty. This is high on my list of recommends. Effortless Beauty
