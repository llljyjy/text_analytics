I really liked how it made my skin hydrated and I definitely could see how it helped with my pores but as a person who loves to wear makeup I found that even after letting it sit for pretty then 10 minutes before applying my makeup it made my foundation pill up. Other then doing that it was an okay moisturizer.. Good but not great
