I don’t usually break out or get acne, but I do have trouble finding cleansers that don’t result in my face breaking out. I’m super psyched that after awhile of using this product I can safely say it has never made me break out and it’s made a huge difference in my nose pores (they now look smaller, any black heads gone). Its cream consistency is hydrating but still suds up really well. Really like this cleanser and will purchase again :) Finally found my go to cleanser!
