This skin cream is very hydrating and keeps hydration throughout the day. I can’t really see the “poreless” benefit but maybe in time?? I’ve been using the product daily now for a couple weeks and my skin does look vibrant and great! I generally like products with salicylic acid, as I have acne prone skin. I believe this product has kept my acne under control recently. I would recommend this to anyone with acne prone skin and those who just want added a hydration, by a great natural brand as an added bonus! nan
