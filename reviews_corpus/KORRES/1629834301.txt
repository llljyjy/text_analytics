I loved this skin cream! The smell is light and pleasant and the cream itself provides great moisture. I agree with others that I didnâ€™t find it to be particularly pore minimizing, but perhaps with longer use I will see that. I really enjoy the formula and would love to try some of the other products in this line. nan
