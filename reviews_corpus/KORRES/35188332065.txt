I received a small sample bottle of this product in my Influenster vox box. I do appreciate things like this for my combination skin. But given it was a small sample size I can’t honestly tell you that it minimizes my pores. I assume it’ll take longer use. BUT it does smell amazing and it does make my skin soft. This winter has been awful to my skin working around the farm and this soothed it! I do love it but it’s out of my price range. It’s nice
