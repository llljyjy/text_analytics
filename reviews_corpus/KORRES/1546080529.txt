I received a free sample of this from Influenster in exchange for my review.I’ll start by saying that I have been a fan of Korres products for many years,so maybe I had my expectations set too high for this face cream. This is a lighter weight cream that does a decent job of moisturizing and has just a faint scent of grape. If you have sensitive skin or get alot of blemishes, this most likely will not irritate your skin. However, it didn’t improve appearance of my pores or even out my skin tone. So so
