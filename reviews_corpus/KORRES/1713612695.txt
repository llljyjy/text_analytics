I received a sample size so I am not sure about long term result but I definitely believe there will be! I love the texture of the cream And how it feels after applying ut on my face. It absorbs it with no sticky feeling and smells good. Gives a hydration for a day. I would be open to buying a full size product. Love the texture and smell
