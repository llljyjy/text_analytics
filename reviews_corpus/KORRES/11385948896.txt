I received this product complimentary from Influenster for my honest thoughts and opinions. I’ve been using this cream for a few weeks now and I have been enjoying it.  It goes on creamy and thick but not at all heavy. I have combination oily skin and it does take a moment to soak in but once it does it doesn’t leave your face greasy or oily just a nice natural glow. I also noticed my skin feeling softer after the first few uses so I will definitely continue using. I can sometimes breakout when I switch face creams but I did not with this one. Another reason I will keep it in my everyday skin care routine! Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream
