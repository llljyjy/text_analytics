Loving how this face cream is super moisturizing without being oily. Big plus for being able to use it on all skin types. The fact that it blurs pores is also a major bonus. It is also lightly scented which makes it even more appealing to me. Iâ€™ve been using it as not only a face cream, but as a primer as well at it works great for that also. I received this product for free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review. My new go-to skin cream
