I was sent this skincare cream from Influenster and Korres to try for an honest review. As a grandmother of two, and someone who is knocking the heck at 50’s door, and someone who has always struggled with ultra-dry, blemished/acne-prone skin, I NEED all of the help I can get at this point. This is why I was extremely excited to receive this Korres Poreless Skin Cream so that I can give it a try! After I showered, my skin was ultra dull, splotchy, and uneven-toned. I took a dime-sized amount (less than recommended, I know) and applied it all over my face in a circular motion, and oh my goodness!! It went on so soft and smooth and creamy, and it’s so lightweight! And even though I put on less than the recommended amount, you cannot tell because it’s so hydrating--basically, a little goes a long way! Plus this cream is super lightweight, and not oily or greasy at all! It made my skin super soft, supple, and COMPLETELY hydrated!! My skin looks ALIVE!!! You can tell that my skin is still uneven/splotchy and you can see my scars and dark circles around my eyes. However, although those things are still prevalent, it makes my skin look a thousand times better and feel a thousand times better!!! It smells great, too, not overpowering, just a pleasant, subtle scent. This cream has completely sold me and is definitely going to be a permanent regimen added to my skincare routine! I also love that it is free from all the things we try to avoid, such as parabens, silicone, sulfates, and gluten! It’s vegan-friendly, for those who are passionate about that type of thing, as well as cruelty-free. It’s also hypoallergenic. So, this stuff is simply AMAZING!!! So thank you, Influenster and Korres for sending me this magnificent cream to try out! HeLLo HYDRaTioN, HoNeY! MY SKiN LoVeS iT!
