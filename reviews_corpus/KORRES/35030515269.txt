I received this product free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review. I e been using this product for a week now and am very impressed by its claims. Even with first use I could see a big difference in my pores that are prominent on my nose and chin. It blurry pores beautifully. The product is very light weigh. It does have a Read more about review stating Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream Reviewlittle tackiness when applied until dries but is not sticky. It controls shine all day and did not notice any shine even in the T zone where I have issues. What I was most happy with is the evenness of my skin. I have redness and rosacea on my cheeks. This product has even calmed the redness and my face looks more even in color and texture. I am really enjoying this sample so far and look forward to seeing what it does under my makeup. Iâ€™m giving this product 4 stars from my results so far. Product is a little on the expensive side but using this makes me interested in trying more of their products. Love
