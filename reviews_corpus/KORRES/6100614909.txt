I received this product in exchange for my opinion. I have dry skin so this worked decently for me. I did have to add in other hydrating products since my skin is super dried out with winter. It blends in really well and doesnâ€™t leave a greasy look or feel to the skin. I get a slight tingle from it, but that is not uncommon for me with my sensitive skin. The smell is very nice - it is very light and not overpowering. Reminds me of that talc powder smell mixed with a fresh scent in a good way. nan
