I have had acne for as long as I can remember but my skin has NEVER been able to tolerate retinol products. Now that I’m 33 and have drier skin, I thought that ship had sailed. Enter Midnight Reboot! Upon a recommendation, I decided to bite the bullet and try it, figuring I can return it. I’m seeing great results with this product already and NO flaking or burning. My skin is looking clear and healthy! nan
