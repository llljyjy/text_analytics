Okay. Yes this is pricey, BUT let me just tell you I am absolutely shook. I have the craziest, most sensitive skin, and this is like a bottle of magic. My skin is so soft and so smooth OVER NIGHT. I’ve been using this for about 3 months now and honestly, I can’t live without it. I don’t know what kind of sorcery goes into making this stuff, but I’m here for it. Give it a try if you’re on the fence. I’m amazed and so thankful. magic in a bottle
