It takes a lot these days for a cleanser to truly impress me. I’ve tried so many, I practically have the perfect cleanser down to a science. This one ticks every single box!! The creamy + non-foaming texture is a true delight to use, & it gives my skin a thorough cleanse (no clogged pores, or breakouts happening here). My skin actually feels soft + hydrated after use, apposed to the more traditional “non-stripped” feeling (I’m 100% over stripping/drying cleansers, that’s a dealbreaker for me). The packaging looks stunning on my skincare shelf. It has such a clean + aesthetically pleasing design. I really appreciate the large 6.25oz size, since I’ve found a little does not go a long way with this cleanser. I’ll definitely be repurchasing when I run out. I really cannot get over how healthy this cleanser leaves my combination skin! I 100% recommended it for all skin types. Love at first use!
