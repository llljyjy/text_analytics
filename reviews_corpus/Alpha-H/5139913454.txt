I like to wait and write a review if I really like something until the second bottle.  I have so many half empty bottles of product in my cabinet where the product seemed to fizzle out and not work the same with my skin the first ten times....This however - will always be in my cabinet.  I apply at night and can feel it working instantly. I wake up and feel I have a new sleeve of skin on my face.  Skin feels smooth and full in the morning ready to accept my morning routine.  I also did not experience any of the harsh drying some may experience using glycolic acid but Iâ€™ve been using it in some shape or form for awhile.  My routine: this product at night with nothing else after that (easy!).  Morning -cleanser with exfoliating, micellar water, brightening cream, light moisturizer.  That is it and I feel it is because of this great product.  CONS:. I think the packaging is wasteful.  In this age of sustainability the company needs to figure out how to reduce their waste via better packaging.  Wasteful!  The cap offers no use other then frustration the first time getting it off only for me to immediately throw it away a second later with the box it came in. On my second bottle!
