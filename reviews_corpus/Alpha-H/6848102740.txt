I took a chance on this since the few reviews there were were all positive but sadly I was disappointed. First I want to point out that the Alpha-h website advertises this specifically as an oil control cleanser but Sephora doesn’t. If I had known this was an oil control cleanser I never would have purchased it. It was very drying on my combo skin, even in my oily t-zone. If you are not looking for an oil control cleanser do not buy this.When they say “non foaming” cleanser they mean it. There’s 0 suds to it, none, zilch, which isn’t in itself a bad thing but is definitely something to be aware of.I found it hard to rinse off my face. The directions say to remove it with a washcloth but washcloths are way too harsh on my skin and rinsing it off with water alone is a challenge. As a previous review said, it really is akin to rubbing lube on your face. I tried to think of another comparison but nothing describes it as well as that. The reason for my 2 star rating instead of 1 is because this cleanser did leave my face feeling soft and calmed my skin. I had minimal redness after cleansing and it didn’t irritate my skin or clog my pores. Beware- Actually an oil control cleanser
