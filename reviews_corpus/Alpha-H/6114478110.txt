Not really sure how I feel about this. It is very nice and smooth on the skin, leaving my face cleaned. I have dry skin and it did felt a little stripped after washing it off but not too much, could be on my part of having dry skin. It’s a clear liquid, doesn’t foam, and is really nice and gentle on my sensitive skin. I feel like there’s nothing special about it much but for reason at the same time, I really so like it (if that makes any sense, hahahha). What I didn’t like was the smell- I am a VERY picky person on smells so even though this was barely scented (it has like a clean smell), I really did not like it. I did like the product enough to ignore the smell, but it does get to me every single use. ** ONE STAR off because of the packaging. IT IS HORRIBLE. The lid screws off and because the product is a solid liquid, it just constantly oozes out. You don’t even have to squeeze the tube, it’ll just keep coming. A lot of the product sits in the cap of the lid- such a waste and a bit messy. I will probably have to buy a cosmetic pump to replace the packaging. Other than that, it’s great. Pricing is average so I’d give it a try, if you can =) nan
