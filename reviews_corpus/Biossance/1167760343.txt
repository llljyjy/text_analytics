Love! When I first tried it I wasn’t really sure how much I’d like it but it really moisturized my dry skin right away. I was so surprised. I love the color and the product! Color is the same as the pic and something about the pretty color makes me like it even more. It doesn’t smell bad and it’s very light. I am so happy I got this and everything I’ve tried from biossance has been sooooo good! Get it
