I absolutely love this lip balm and use it exclusively as my night time lip treatment. I have sensitive skin and have had horrible allergic reaction to other lip balms. This is my go-to. It has a great texture, the rose scent is light and lovely and their new packaging is definitely easier and more hygienic to their jars. My Go-To
