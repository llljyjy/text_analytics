This is the second product I’ve received from biossance, and I loved it.  I gradually added it into my skincare routine and it made a difference for me With my fine lines and wrinkles that are starting to show. I also loved this serum because it didn’t give me micro pimples like a tend to get with new serums. I have dry/combo skin that tends to run red.  I am starting to get wrinkles around my eyes and in my forehead. With continued use of this serum I saw a decrease in their appearance.  I would buy again Serum that works
