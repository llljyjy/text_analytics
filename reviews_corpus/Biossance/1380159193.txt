I popped into Sephora looking to restock on my usual lip balm, but they were out. The SA introduced me to this one and I immediately knew I’d like it. I’m really into skincare with squalane and prefer a tube vs pot for lip balm so I was sold on the spot. A little goes a long way, and it’s a slightly sticky consistency which I don’t mind because it feels weightless yet moisturizing on my lips. While it isn’t necessarily cheap compared to my usual under $10 lip balms, at just around $15, it’s also not unreasonable, plus it’s effective so to me this is a good purchase. The only downside is that it doesn’t have great lasting power, so it’s not a miracle product. nan
