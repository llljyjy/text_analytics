Iâ€™ve been using this moisturizer for probably 2 years now and I have no intention on trying any other moisturizer anytime soon. This is the only product that I have not swapped out of my regimen to try something new. I have oily/combination skin, and it leaves my skin feeling very soft, even on days when my skin feels dry in the winter. Thankfully, I have not had the experiences of some other reviewers; it does not feel sticky on my skin. I would definitely recommend. nan
