*gifted in exchange for review* I’m gonna be honest this product has a smell and it’s…pretty pungent. However it does go away really quickly after it starts absorbing so it’s definitely not a deal breaker for me, especially because it works really well for my skin type (extremely dry and sensitive). I had no allergic reaction, no breakouts, and my skin looks and feels hydrated for pretty much the whole day. Would probably buy again Great but smelly
