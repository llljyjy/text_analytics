I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. This is a nice general moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and it didn’t break me out at all. It has no smell and feels nice on the skin. It isn’t too heavy, but it is enough. I do love the clean ingredients! I personally like the oil better though. Pretty good
