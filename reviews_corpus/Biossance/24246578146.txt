I’ve always wanted to try copper peptides, and this product seemed perfect for me. I have redness in the cheeks and dry skin. So the squalane, camellia sinensis, and aloe really help with my soothing/moisture needs, along with the copper peptides—my skin immediately feels plumped. Really great product overall. This is a BUY!
