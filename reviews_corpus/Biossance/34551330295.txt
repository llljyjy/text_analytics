I love the hydration that it gives my lips, however the texture can be a bit gritty at times. I thought I would love this product, but then I tried the Laneige Glowy Balms and I like them a little more. One of the big deciding factors on which I plan to repurchase is price point. I just found out that this Biossance Lip Balm went up $2 since I purchased it which now makes it $1 less than Laneige. I rather spend the extra dollar on Laneige. Otherwise, it is a great product.
