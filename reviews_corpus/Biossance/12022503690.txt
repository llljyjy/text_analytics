This moisturizer is not here to mess around. You want hydration? YOU’VE GOT HYDRATION! The Squalene is a key ingredient that the package boasts their Squalene being made sustainably from sugarcane (which sounds pretty neat!) This honestly is great daily, if your face needs extra nourishment, but might be too much on oily skin. So, while using this product I use it only once a day or every few days to maintain moisture. Honestly, it’s great to have on hand to pamper your face! The scent is very light, almost like a weak tea, though if you are more  sensitive to scents, you may find it more harsh. I personally like the soft smell, and I love how my face looks and feels within moments of using this repair cream! nan
