This eye cream has a nice creamy, smooth texture, and it’s non-irritating. It’s pleasant and quick to apply, and you only need a little bit at a time, so a jar will last you a while. Unfortunately, I haven’t noticed any visible positive results from using this eye cream, and I’ve had it for months. My dark circles and very fine lines remain unimproved; I haven’t really noticed any firming or lifting. I’d say this could be a great product for you if you’re just starting off with skincare / if you’re looking for gentle preventative skincare (i.e., you have good skin now and you’re just focused on moisturizing to try to maintain that for the future), but it’s not a great option if you’re looking for a product that is going to help address any specific aesthetic concerns. Gentle eye cream—too gentle for my liking
