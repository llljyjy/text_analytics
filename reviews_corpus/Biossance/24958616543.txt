I love the way Biossance vitamin c rose cream makes my skin feel and look it has vitamin c and fermented lemon which is natural skin brighter and this antioxidant-packed cream help fight pollution while promoting collagen to help with the signs of aging. It is really simple to use and apply about a quarter size to clean the face and neck in the morning and at night. It leaves a beautiful rose smell on your face which is a plus. I love the results I have gotten. Recommend anyone looking to brighten and hydrate and protection against all this pollution try Biossance.#BrightByBiossance Loving my results
