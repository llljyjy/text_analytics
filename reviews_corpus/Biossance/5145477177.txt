This has a great formula and doesn’t leave a white cast.  It didn’t cause my skincare products to pill and I like that it is silicone free.  Unfortunately, the finish is so greasy and shiny I find it unpleasant to wear.  I have combination skin.  Maybe this is better suited to dry skin.  The search for my HG clean mineral sunscreen continues. Wanted to love this…
