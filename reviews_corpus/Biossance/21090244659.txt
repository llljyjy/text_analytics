I got sunburned all over my body while swimming except for where I applied this on my face and neck so it sure works! Absorbs well, lightweight, doesnâ€™t sting your eyes, layers well with makeup, and as hydrating as a moisturizer. I bought this specifically because it has squalane for my very dry skin, but I can see this being too slick if you have oily skin good for dry skin and effective!
