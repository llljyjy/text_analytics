I have very dry and sensitive skin, but am prone to clogged pores, so I decided to try squalane oil because I heard it’s great for soothing and hydrating skin without clogging pores. One of the things I heard most was that it sinks into your skin quickly without making you feel greasy, but this did the exact opposite for me. It sat on top of my skin and I even woke up feeling greasy and uncomfortably oily, something I’ve never experienced on my life. I tried applying in multiple ways: a couple drops on my hands and pressing into skin, skipping my moisturizer to lessen the barrier to my skin, using a cotton pad to apply less oil and then patting in, but no matter what I tried my face felt disgusting. It’s also really hard to control how much oil you’re dispensing since it’s a pump rather than a dropper and the pump itself is sensitive so you can accidentally get too much (hence why I tried the cotton pad so it could soak up some of the excess). Sad that it didn’t work for me and my thirsty skin, returned after a week and got a different and better oil from a different brand. 2 stars for no filler ingredients, just pure natural oil, which I appreciate especially for this size and price point. Do you like feeling greasy? Then you’ll love this!
