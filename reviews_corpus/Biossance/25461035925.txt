I gave this incentivized moisturizer 4 starsâ€™sSimply due to scent, a rose scent mixed with lemon Squalane & Vitamin CThis is a smooth consistency with a hydrating blend A little goes a long way. In my photo I applied a thin layer after my bedtime cleansing routine.I did not notice an immediate brightening( may come with longer routine use) as most products with Vitamin C. So far I am only approx 10 days in to using this moisturizer.Drys quickly if you plan to add a primer or other skin care product. Roses
