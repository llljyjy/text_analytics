Tried this because I like their toner. The most garbage product Iâ€™ve ever used. Sits on your face. Offers NO actual moisture. Like, a fascinating combination of visible on your face but keeping the skin dry. Shocked people are feeling this. Jumped back to Drunk Elephant peptide moisturizer. Sits on top of skin // poor absorption
