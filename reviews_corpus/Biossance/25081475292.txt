I love this lightweight whipped moisturizer. It used natural and clean products that keeps my skin feeling moisturizer but not heavy. I tend to breakout a lot and found my skin clear while using this product. The fragrance was light and stems from the natural ingredients. I would definitely by this again. I got this product complementary to review. Whipped cream
