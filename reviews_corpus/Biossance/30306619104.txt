I love this ingredient because it feels so natural on the skin. This doesn’t sit like a product, squalane almost feels like a natural extension of your face. Additionally, there are SO MANY uses for it. This might not be a “daily driver“ but If you have the money to spend on something like this, it’s a great everyday essential to have in your skincare collection similar to healing ointments or lotions. Here are some of the uses I’ve found for it so far:• AMAZING Beard oil. We all know the male beauty industry is... immature. Most dedicated beard products come in very small containers with a lot of fragrance, unnecessary ingredients, or worst of all potentially irritating ingredients like essential oils or vegetable oils that can really mess up your skin barrier. If you have a beard, or have a loved one with a beard, do their skin a huge favor and buy this instead. You get more product for your money, and it will get rid of itchy, flaky, or irritated skin under the beard. Simple, effective, and easy to spread.• Noncomedogenic body moisturizer! Ok, this one is great. I’ve been using lotions for years on the rougher patches of skin like my elbows or knees, and they only give hydration for so long. If you use something like a body oil, it tends to work at the cost of you slipping and sliding all over the place. This will give dry patches lasting hydration and moisture all day because instead of putting a bandaid on dryness you’re replenishing your skin with the natural tools it uses to fight water loss. • Locks in your skincare routine. Because Squalane is an oil, it is occlusive. That means you shouldn’t be using it before any active ingredients or moisturizers. It should really be the last step of your routine, but it does a great job of locking everything in and preventing water loss. Simply do your skincare routine as normal, and if you feel like you need a boost in the dry season pat this on at the very end after your sunscreen! Lock it in!
