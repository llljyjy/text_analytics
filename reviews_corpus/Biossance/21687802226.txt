The reviews on this product are very 50/50, as it seems people either love this product or absolutely hate it. So, with things like this I feel like I just have to try it for myself. I’ve been using this lip balm for a couple of days, and I can say that I do like it. It is VERY thick, and the fact that it comes in a tube makes me feel like it’s a hydrating lip gloss rather than a balm. But, I do enjoy using it. I find that I don’t have to apply it as often as I would a normal chapstick. Even though the title says Rose, I don’t smell anything with this product but I don’t mind. I also saw someone use it as a lip sleeping mask, which I think is a great use for this product as well! It’s like a thick glossy balm and the perfect size for carrying in your purse. I like it!
