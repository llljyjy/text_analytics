I’m very pleased with this cleanser! I had been using something else for a long time, which I realized may have been too drying/stripping. So I’ve been wanting to try some Biossance products for a while and this did not disappoint! I also have sensitive skin and I didn’t have any bad reactions. My skin feels clean, soft and hydrated after cleansing daily! So far so good!
