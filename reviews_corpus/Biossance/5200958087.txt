This is a fantastic set to try Biossance products. The eye cream is my holy grail, it’s thick and absorbs great into the skin. The deluxe sample size will also last you a long time - a little goes a long way! I also really love the lactic acid serum and omega cream. I use the lactic acid year round it’s effective but gentle, and the omega cream is my winter staple very thick and luxurious. I don’t use the oil on my face as my hair/skin are very oily already but I love using it on my chest or on my legs to give a gorgeous glow! Great starter set to introduce you to Biossance!
