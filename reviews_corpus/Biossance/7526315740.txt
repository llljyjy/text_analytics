This product is very hydrating and does a good job at minimizing pores. I use it during the day along with my moisturizer and sunscreen and I love it. Iâ€™ve been searching for a light weight toner that I can use every morning and this is it! I also use Paula choice 2% bha exfoliant at night and have not experienced excessive drying from using both(for me it really depended on the moisturizer I used). Overall, I like everything about this product. New Holy Grail??!
