Fantastic set. Really nice way to try out a skincare routine before committing $$$ to full sizes. Most in love with the eye cream - it really does help fine lines fill out. The lactic acid treatment is great, but a tad aggressive for my sensitive skin. The package rec is 1-2x weekly, Iâ€™m down to about once every ten days, but it has made a difference in my forehead lines. nan
