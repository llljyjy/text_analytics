I was really impressed with this cream. I have eczema prone skin so I wasn’t sure how my skin would react. This ended up being one of the best creams I’ve tried. It absorbs quickly while adding sufficient hydration. It soothes my skin and doesn’t have a scent which important for me. I haven’t had break outs with this cream either. I’m very happy and will purchase when my jar is done. Great for Eczema, dry skin.
