this and the tatcha oil are my favorite cleansers to remove makeup. i have not found ANYTHING else that removes makeup like this. i can use this over my eyes and my full coverage makeup and it melts it ALL. i LOVE this oil. it does have a strong fragrance but i love it and it doesnâ€™t bother me at all. will definitely be repurchasing. always. A MUST HAVE
