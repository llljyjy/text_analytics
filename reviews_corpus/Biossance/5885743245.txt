I paid out of pocket for this product. I have combo skin so I use different types of sunscreens depending on the weather or my skin condition. I have been using sunscreens for years and I tried products from various countries. This sunscreen does not have a white cast and does not have a strong scent of chemicals/fragrances.  However, this sunscreen is SOOOOO greasy! Definitely is not for summer or places with high humidity. I think it is for people with desert-like dry skin. I cant even use it on my body even in winter and thatâ€™s how greasy it is. WAY TOO GREASY
