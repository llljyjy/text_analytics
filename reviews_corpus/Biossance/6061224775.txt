I tried this because all stores were sold out of the Boscia Makeup Breakup Cool Cleansing Oil. I think it’s a good alternative, but I still prefer the Boscia. I don’t think the scent is overwhelming at all (and I’m sensitive to fragrance), but it is thin and it doesn’t last as long as the Makeup Breakup. Overall it works well for taking off makeup and for a deep but non-stripping cleanse. nan
