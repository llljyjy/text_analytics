I really really like this! It feels extremely moisturizing and sinks into skin quickly (I’ve tried some heavier creams like this that seems to sit on top of the skin forever and took lots of rubbing in to dissolve). My only reason for one less star is the price is pretty high for the amount you get, so I’m not sure I’d purchase in the future. The smell is also not great as others have mentioned. I don’t like scented products anyway, and I use a skinceuticals serum that smells like hot dogs, but I love that one so much/it’s so good for my skin that I can look past the smell. This one is a little harder to justify. nan
