I used this cream in the morning and at night. I like the scent, like that itâ€™s lightweight and goes on smoothly. I only need a little bit to cover my face. It does make my skin feel soft and smooth but I still need a heavier moisturizer for evening.  I can see me using this in summer but not winter as I get too dry. Soft & Hydrating
