All I have to say is that this retinol is a miracle worker. I’m 45 years old and finally made the decision to integrate retinol into my routine with this product. I use it 2 days a week with my skin cycling routine and am so pleased with my results. My skin texture was evened out, fine lines were minimized and dark spots were reduced. I’ll continue to use this product based on these fantastic results. Miracle worker
