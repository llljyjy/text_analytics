I received this product free in exchange for my honest review.I liked this product! I’m pretty picky with my moisturizer and this one passed in my book. I have pretty normal skin, and this worked well for me. Not too heavy feeling and I didn’t feel like it had an overly strong scent. Would definitely recommend trying it! nan
