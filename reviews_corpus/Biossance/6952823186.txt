It is a substantial amount of product, so the price point is not really overpriced. As a  mature person over 60, I feel that it is slowly showing results! Not like all the pep talk and marketing like The Ordinary/Deciem products; during which new wrinkles & creases appeared when I was bamboozled by their hype. Since I started also using a home microblading system, there is substantial plumping and erasure for which I cannot ascribe only to this Serum. I do like to try new products as the body can get used to only one product over time. But this will definitely be on my rotation list! Good Results!
