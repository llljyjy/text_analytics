I know itâ€™s expensive. but. it really does work miracles. I tried a serum that really dried my skin out which created intense smile lines and crows feet around the eyes, and this serum fixed it in about a week. really plumped my skin back up and helped even out any fine lines and texture, great for redness and irritation as well. absolutely do not regret paying the price because it really does make your skin look so much healthier and the bottle lasts a long time. amazing for skin repair!
