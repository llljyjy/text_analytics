I like the texture of the product on my face and it does the job of moisturizing my face but I can’t get over the smell. There are other moisturizers in the market that does the same thing without this awful smell. I won’t be repurchasing again. I bought this as a set Biossance offered with the face oil and eye cream. Going to have to use this as a body moisturizer to get rid of it. Love that it’s vegan and clean ingredients but the smell…no thank you So smelly I can’t get over it
