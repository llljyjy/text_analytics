Received this as a sample. I’ve been using for about two weeks before my moisturizer at night and I’ve noticed subtle increase in clarity and brightness. I was hesitant to use an oil due to my acne prone skin but this has not caused any breakouts so far. I love that it has squalene to help protect my skin barrier and vitamin c to brighten. Will continue to use. yes squalene!
