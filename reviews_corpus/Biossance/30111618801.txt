Love this serum- I have redness and sensitivity and didn’t notice a single side effect of using it. There is barley a scent and what you can smell isn’t fruity or floral or anything like that. I noticed reduced redness within a couple weeks and a noticeable overall change within a month. Worked well on my redness
