First, I love this brand - cruelty free, vegan, clean AND effective. It marks all my boxes. This product is thick so it might be a little heavy for the warmer season we are stepping into but it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling plump and hydrated. I have sensitive/normal skin and this worked great for me. A little goes a long way. Leaves my skin feeling velvety. Amazing
