I’m normally really weary when trying a new moisturizer because I have weird combo skin. I get oily super fast but when I put foundation on I notice a ton of extremely dry spots. It’s not heavily scented. It goes on very nice. It feels thicker than my other moisturizers when going on but doesn’t make me oily at all. I love this stuff. love
