This face cream saved my skin barrier. I’m a stay at home mom of 1, my skin was falling apart. I’m in my late 20s. I’ve never bought products anywhere but from the drug store - this was my first time and it changed my life. This product saved my skin barrier and my skin started retaining moisture again. I finished the mini size. Looking to repurchase the bigger size. Saved my dry skin
