This plumping serum instantly gave my face a boost back to hydration. I never knew the purpose of a plumping serum until I was sent this one to test and review and let’s just say that I am a FOREVER customer. When I first received it, I didn’t know what to expect. I was extremely hesitant because I thought it would break my face out so I waited a few days before giving it a try and my choice to use it was the best decision I could have ever made. It INSTANTLY rehydrate my face leaving it plump and shining. Everyone I came into contact with thought I had makeup on, but no, it was only this plumping serum. Here are a few pros and cons to this product:Pros:Instant hydrationAll day hydration Instant skin plumping Makeup look finishNot too heavy on skinExtremely easy to applyVery Inexpensive Cons:Sticky residue (but it goes away)Overall, this is a great product and it does EXACTLY what it was created to do. I would DEFINITELY recommend to others and will DEFINITELY purchase more. AMAZING HYDRATION
