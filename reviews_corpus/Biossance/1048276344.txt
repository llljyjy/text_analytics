My first impression was that the texture is heavenly- it feels so nourishing on your eyes. The scent is so light and not disruptive. My eye area looks brighter since using it and it moisturizer very well. I don’t have issues with firmness or wrinkles so I can’t comment on that but I want to prevent. I’ve been using the Banana Bright Eye Cream for a while, but this eye cream gives anti-aging benefits with the brightening benefits. I may transition to this one long-term. Beautiful texture and results
