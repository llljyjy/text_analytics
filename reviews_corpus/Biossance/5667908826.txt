There is a lot of hype around this face oil and I honestly did not have a good experience with it. I started to break out after using it and I found my skin looking dull and dry at the end of the bottle. I dont think its worth the price and there are much better options for Vitamin  C. I paid for this myself and Iâ€™m not an influencer. Nope not worth the  price
