I tried a mini set of this and Biossance’s lactic acid and fell in love. This serum is very light, it seeps well into my skin, before my spf and moisturizer. I saw a noticeable difference in my hyperpigmentation--not dramatically so (this stuff takes time!), but definitely noticeable, so I’ve purchased the full size bottle and now I use it everyday! Pricey, but it works!
