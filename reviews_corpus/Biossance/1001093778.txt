I received this product free to trial and leave my own experience.  This is myFirst bioessence product ever! I am surprised because it does meet all my skincare needs, natural, fragrance free, chemical free.  This lotion I was hesitant to try as I am with any new skincare product, but let me tell you, WOW! Did not irritate my super sensitive skin! After the first application my skin felt hydrated and plump.  It’s a nice thick texture like the other facial moisturizers is used (dream mask by youth to the people, and honey halo by farmacy) it’s great for use at night and during the day! The product is phenomenal, it also layers very well with your other products in your skincare routine! I hate products that pill or become a funky texture when layering- this did not! I love the natural scent it has as well! Scented skincare is so overrated and irritating to my skin.  I have used half the jar now and I am soo happy! The packaging is 1st class as well, the glass jar, the labeling the box it comes it is all top notch. I do wish it came with a spatula for no contamination, but I am using one I already had! yes! the hydration everyone needs
