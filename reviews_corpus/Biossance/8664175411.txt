I have been weary of eye creams in genera for a while because I’ve tried a few highly rated ones that either causes me milia or dried out my under eye completely. I’m someone who has combo skin but dry under eyes so i’m always on the lookout for an eye cream that hydrates without clogging up my pores or giving me milia. I gave this one a try after i got it for christmas in a set and oh my goodness it’s a dream! so silky smooth and absorbs intothe skin beautifully, it’s thick enough without being too heavy or greasy, i’m on my second jar! Thick enough without being heavy or clogging!
