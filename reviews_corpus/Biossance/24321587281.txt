I absolutely love this face cream! It is derived from plant products and is all natural. There isn’t really any scent at all which was a surprise because I expected to smell soft tones of rose or lemon. I love the weight and the texture of the cream. It reminds me of Clinique’s moisture surge, but a better feel. It is soft and silky and not watered down. My face feels fresh and nourished when I apply this. My skin has a nice glow after just a week of using and with the cold, dry weather right now, this is keeping my skin protected and moisturized all day. I highly recommend this product to both women and men. I received this product for free from @influenster and @biossance in exchange for my honest review. #BrightByBiossance #GlowByBiossance #complimentary @Biossance @Influenster Great for dry skin!
