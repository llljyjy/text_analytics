Horrible product! It feels good when applied, however, hydration lasts 10 minutes and after your lips feel like you’re dehydrated. At this rate i’d have to reapply every 10 minutes. Not a good lip balm. Definitely gonna stay with aquaphore. I love biossance but this was a huge miss. Not lasting hydration and dryer lips after
