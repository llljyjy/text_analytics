I received this product complimentary & I have to say this is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used. My face gets dry around my nose, lips, & in between my eyes. You usually have to apply moisturizer a few times a day because you can see the dry skin. With this I don’t have to. I apply it in the morning & it lasts all throughout the day. My husband borrowed some the other day & now he is also using it daily. He agrees that it works great. I would have given it 5 stars but I did find one thing I disliked. It is not the most pleasant smell & when you apply it you can smell it on your face for a few seconds. Thank God it goes away because it’s not good at all. Hopefully they can figure that out.
