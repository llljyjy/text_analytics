Very thick and creamy. it goes on well and my skin was always very moisturized, if not a little greasy without a powder on top. it did start to smell a little by the time I reached the bottom which weirded me out. but since its unscented maybe thatâ€™s normal.  Maybe I got an expired one? or maybe I should have kept it in a cooler location... generally ok
