My skin is dry/combo. Starting to show aging signs as well. My skin is definitely loving this moisturizer. It goes on smooth and hydrates my skin so much! Makeup goes on amazing now that my skin is much more hydrated and smooth. Not much of aSmell which is good for me. I hate strong scents in creams. Definitely recommend! nan
