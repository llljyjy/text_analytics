Although I didn’t see any major improvement of fine lines or wrinkles, I did love how light and moisturizing this product made my skin feel. It also did seem to give an overall bright and plump appearance to my skin which I enjoyed. The only thing I don’t love about this product is the smell… I know it is supposed to be fragrance free but it does have a strange subtle smell to it. Obviously once applied to the skin, I can’t smell it anymore. I received this product complementary from Influenster. nan
