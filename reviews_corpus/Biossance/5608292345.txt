I was very skeptical to try this because a few months ago I tried the 100% Sugarcane Squalene oil and it didn’t go well for me. I decided to start with the mini bottle and I kid you not within 2 months my skin texture is smoother, hydrated,  dark spots are gone, forehead fine lines has disappeared and my complexion is brighter/glowing! In addition, the oil is great for gua sha facials. I usually use a maximum of 2 drops. I also pair this with Ranavat’s Brightening Saffron Serum. The two paired together is magic! It’s not heavy and seeps through the skin barrier leaving it hydrated and plump. You have to try this! Perfection in a bottle!
