I can’t say enough good things about this oil. I have dry acne prone skin which can be difficult to treat. I apply this oil over my moisturizer as a last step in my nighttime skin care routine. I usually use 2-3 drops on my skin and it just drinks this up. It makes my skin glow and feel nourished without causing any breakouts! That being said, it’s an amazing all purpose product. I also use this over moisturizer on my body and on my hair at least once a day and my boyfriend uses it on his beard and loves it. A bottle lasts a long time and it’s a great price point for the product your getting. I really recommend this product! Biossance does it again!
