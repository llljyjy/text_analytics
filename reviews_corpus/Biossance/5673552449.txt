First time buying anything from this brand and It does what it says. It minimized the appearance of my pores and it was noticeable especially when i wore makeup. I will say it is a bit tacky after applying. I put moisturizer after to help get rid of that. Overall i will be buying again.  Btw i have oily dehydrated skin. It did not make my oiliness worse. minimized my poors
