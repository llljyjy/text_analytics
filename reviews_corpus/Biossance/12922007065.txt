Really wanted this to work out because of all the great reviews. I like the consistency of the cream and at first really liked how it felt, but over time I noticed it was actually drying my skin out more (then Iâ€™d put more on to moisturize and dry out again, etc.). Sad I spend so much money on it. Dried my skin out after a few weeks of use
