This one is a winner! I’m a skincare junkie so I’m constantly trying out new products, specifically the ones that will slow down time and wrinkles. I have determined that for my skin moisture is key, I tend to be dehydrated more often than not so I’m always overcompensating on my face. This stuff is amazing, it is SO moisturizing! It has a great texture, soft and creamy but not too heavy. It doesn’t leave an oily residue behind. And it smells wonderful. This has officially gone into the rotation for products I will continue to use. A new staple in my skin care routine
