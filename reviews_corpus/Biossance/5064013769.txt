If you’re looking for an eye cream that is thick but doesn’t sit on top of your skin, absorbing like a dream while smoothing out your fine lines, get this!! I’ve tested out so many eye creams, all the Estée Lauder ones, Kiehls, Ole Henrikson (great for dark circles if I used it as a nightly eye cream instead of the morning), Belief, and the list goes on. I saw this on a lot of people’s recommended list so I gave it a go and purchased it directly from the Biossance website last month and it is definitely working on my premature lines under my eyes, (100% lack of sleep & stress.) I am seeing my lines soften up and they will obviously not permanently disappear but they are looking much better than they did before I started using it. Great for AM & PM use, layers great underneath concealer, and does everything I wanted from an eye cream! Also, a little goes a long way, great bang for your buck! Just Buy It!
