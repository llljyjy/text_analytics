I’ve been using this product for a few weeks and can honestly say I’m impressed. I have sensitive skin and usually steer clear of heavy moisturizers, but this one is hydrating without being overly greasy and hasn’t caused any breakouts. My only complaint is the smell. It’s rough, but thankfully goes away pretty quickly once applied. Good product, horrible smell
