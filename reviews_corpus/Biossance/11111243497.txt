I adore this cream. I finally decided to make a big girl moisturizer purchase and this is what I decided on and I love it! I will be honest though, I does not smell good… at all. I know there’s no fragrance because that’s better for your skin but sheesh. I can get over it because it‘s great. Also, a little goes a long way! I’m in love
