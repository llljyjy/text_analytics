This moisturizer has an excellent texture, it’s like a creamy gel, melts right into the skin. It doesn’t particularly smell good, it kind of smells like, sweat. Haha but if you don’t care about scents, the product itself is really good. I noticed my skin brighter and smoother within the first few days. But after use for about two weeks, I started noticing little breakouts and this was the only thing I changed. I have extremely sensitive skin but there’s something in this that doesn’t agree. It sucks because I genuinely like this product. Thankful to influenster for sending it for me to try. It’s really nice!
