I bought this due to rave reviews and wasn’t too impressed by it. The lip balm feels sits a tacky layer on top of my lips and doesn’t feel like it is hydrating or moisturizing them. I live in a colder Canadian climate so I’m not sure that could be a factor. I wanted to love it, however it didn’t meet my lip care needs. Meh
