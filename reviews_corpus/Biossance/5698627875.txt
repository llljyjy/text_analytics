Really don’t like this but it’s a brand new bottle so I have to finish it now lol I have oily t-zone and normal everywhere else skin so I prefer a foaming cleanser, the lotion like cleansers are not for me. This one foams but not enough for my liking and what I dislike the most is the scent. It smells like rosemary, tea tree and lavender, very outdated ugly scent. I also don’t feel like it cleanses the skin well if you have layers of skincare and/or makeup. I haven’t tried to remove makeup with it but I tried it over sunscreen and it was literally like I had used air to remove the sunscreen because nothing happened. This is a good morning cleanser or night cleanser for people who use nothing but a moisturizer throughout the day. Definitely would not repurchase or recommend. not for me
