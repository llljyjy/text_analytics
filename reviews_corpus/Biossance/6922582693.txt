As a esthetician I do recommend this product. If you never used retinol and want to start this is a great product. This is a very gentle retinol not hash at all. No fragrance has no scent. Which I love because fragrance can irritate the skin. I love how it is light weight. Doesnâ€™t feel heavy on the face. My skin feels amazing after the first night using it . People have noticed a glow in my skin . Definitely helps with aging . I 100% recommend this product or any biossance products. Their products are amazing!! 100% recommend !
