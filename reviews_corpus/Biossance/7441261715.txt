i love this moisturizer for various reasons. on top of having amazing ingredients, this is one of two moisturizers that work perfectly with my combo skin-- providing sufficient hydration to moisturize the dry parts but also being light enough to not turn my t-zone into an oil slick. this is also an all-year-rounder for me, being perfect for all seasons. can’t really ask for much more than that. to address all the reviews that stated it burned, this product does contain lactic & citric acid which are AHAs and are meant to help exfoliate the skin for a soft & supple look, on top of helping to fade any pigmentation or scarring. if you are new to chemical exfoliants, i can imagine that you will feel this. for the aficionados, you likely won’t feel a thing. side note: even though i am constantly burning the skin on my face off, i do get some strange tingling/numbing sensation within the first minute of application if i haven’t used it for a while. i disregard this as it goes away and nothing bad has ever happened.
