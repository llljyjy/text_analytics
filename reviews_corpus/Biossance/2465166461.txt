I love this mositurizer! It leaves my dry, sensitive skin feeling smooth and hydrated - and doesn’t exacerbate my rosacea. My only issue with the product is the strong scent but it is only noticable when applying the product - the scent doesn’t transfer or linger on the skin. The product works so well I am 100% able to overlook the scent. Perfect for my dry, sensitive skin
