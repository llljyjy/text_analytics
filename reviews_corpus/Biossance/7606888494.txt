I love the texture of this face cream! Super Hydrating without feeling greasy or suffocating on my skin. The initial smell is a bit off-putting, however once applied the scent doesn’t stay, so I wouldn’t say that’s a deterrent in continued use. I definitely recommend to those with dry skin, although I do think that people with oily complexion would get great results with this cream as well. Thank You to Influenster for the complementary product! Creamy & Moisturizing
