I have combination sensitive skin and have to be careful when using active serums, including retinol. Luckily my skin has responded well so far. I haven’t seen huge results so far and have  only been using it for 3 weeks. It takes at least 8-12 weeks to see true results with retinol products and anyone claiming magic or there fine lines disappearing after two weeks is not being honest... My skin overall was not reactive and does feel softer. The texture is smooth and the product absorbs easily. There is no specific scent, which I appreciate and I haven’t broken out yet, which is a big win! I haven’t experience a negative reaction, as I have in the past with other retinol products. The ingredient list is promising and has a great ingredient profile. Outside of the encapsulated Retinol, the formula is gentle and non abrasive. The Allantoin, Evening Primrose Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract and Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract are responsible for this. It has skin identical ingredients Squalane and Glycerin, which is probably why the formula sinks into my skin, instead of sitting on top, like my prescription retinol did. Appreciate that the formula is actually clean and uses Tocopherol (which is vitamin E) and Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract as its preservatives. Overall, I think it’s a good product that needs more time to see big results. It provides gentle, soothing exfoliation and is good for sensitive skin types. I received this product complementary from Influenster for my honest review. Gentle Soothing Exfoliation w/ Dynamic Ingredients
