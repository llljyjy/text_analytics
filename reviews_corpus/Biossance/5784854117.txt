I’m fair complected and I was wary about spending this much on a sunscreen. But they’re honestly all expensive now. Plus the bigger bottle is worth it because a little goes a long way. This does not pill or interfere with your make up, plus I feel like my skin has been better since using this. If you’re oily I would try a sample because it may be too heavy. I have combination skin (oily in t zone) holy grail!!
