Full disclaimer, I received this item for free for review purposes but this review is totally based on my experience. Now, I have been using this serum for the last 1.5 months and I am absolutely loving it! I use it religiously twice a day and it really does provide instant hydration. Also over this period I have felt my skin feel considerable less dry, even during winters, which is a big deal.The serum is light and it isn’t sticky and on application is absorbed in a few seconds. Within minutes I feel like my skin is softer and moisturized even without my regular moisturizer. Also, when I use my regular mineral sunscreen, I use this with my moisturizer and have noticed my skin doesn’t crack and dry anymore. It definitely works! It works & is a lifesaver for people with dry skin
