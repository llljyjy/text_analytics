Great way to get an introduction to Biossance’s best sellers. My favorite ones from this set would be the serum and the eye cream. I am a huuuuge fan of Biossance’s serums (all of them might I add) and I think they are a great success. The marine algae eye cream is thick and creamy, my under eyes really feel it. I’ve only deducted one point because as great as the rose oil and omega cream are, I am simply just not a fan of rose scented things and the scent of omega cream is not for me. Great gift set to give someone or try out for yourself, I recommend it. great introduction to biossance
