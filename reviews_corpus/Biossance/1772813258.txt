Used twice daily but didnâ€™t notice a difference at all. Other than adding some hydration to my skin it did nothing to lighten my dark spots/acne scarring. The packaging was also extremely annoying, the pump started leaking product out the sides. Switched to a serum from The Ordinary a month later and within 2 weeks I noticed a difference. So yeah, there are way cheaper products out there that work better imo. Very disappointed in this product. Mediocre at best
