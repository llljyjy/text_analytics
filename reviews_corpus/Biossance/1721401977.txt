If you’re like me (middle aged trying to prevent more wrinkles, dark circles, etc) then do NOT get this! This cream is now my back up for when I am out of an eye cream (that works better and for much cheaper). It didn’t do anything for me to be honest except keep eye area moist for a few minutes. Don't waste your money on this
