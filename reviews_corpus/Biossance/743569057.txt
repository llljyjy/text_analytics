This is a really good solid product to have in your collection for non-irritating anti aging. I have really sensitive skin and was able to tolerate this product fairly well.  I did have an issue getting the cap off easily to reveal the pump (see image 2).  While this is a great product, I do think it is fairly expensive, and there are a lot of other retinols on the market for a much cheaper price. Overall good product and if you donâ€™t mind the price tag, then I recommend. Good, solid product
