I received this product complementary of Influenster and Biossance in exchange for an honest review. There is a light scent,  but it goes away almost immediately and is not bad. I’m not sure why there are so many harsh reviews on the scent. To each their own I guess. I my opinion this is what a lot of fragrance-free beauty products smell like. I really like this cream layered with a nice argan oil.  It contains a small amount of hyaluronic acid, which is great for hydration.  It’s a great barrier repair cream if used consistently. It made my skin feel supple and soft. I really enjoyed this, and I will strongly consider purchasing once I run lit. nan
