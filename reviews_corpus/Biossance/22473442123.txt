I don’t understand the negative reviews on this. This has become a necessary addition to my skincare. I usually stick to affordable options like Burt’s bees and aquaphor. But since I’ve tried this I have been obsessed. It’s so nourishing and similar consistency to aquaphor, which is what I was hoping for. Was initially only using as a night lip treatment but once I saw how luscious and plump my lips looked I started using all the time. Makes me feel beautiful without having to wear makeup. It’s also unscented. nan
