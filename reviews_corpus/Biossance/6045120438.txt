I received a free jar of this from Influenster for my HONEST feedback / review. I absolutely love this stuff! Especially for night time. Itâ€™s a little thicker so it is a little bit heavy for my skin during the day, but I use it at night and wake up with soft, plump skin. I feel like it hydrates my dry skin well. I have a lot of redness and I hope that over time some of that will go away. I would definitely recommend this and will buy some more when I run out! My skin is loving this stuff
