Clean gentle beauty.  I received this complementary from influenced her to try for my honest opinion. I found the serum to be lightweight with just a slight tacky finish that goes away when she put on my strays her and make up on. I found it to be gentle on my sensitive skin, however I was not blown away with the plumping and hydrating results. I suspect this may be a good product to use when micro needling for the copper peptides. I plan to use with my beauty bio to level up the results. nan
