I LOVE the way Biossance night serum leaves my skin, feeling so soft and hydrated. Due to my allergies, I can only use clean beauty  products on the largest organ of my body… My skin. Personally, I believe everyone should only use natural beauty products, without chemicals, dyes  and known skin irritants. Needless to say…I’m buying this night serum again! Buying this night serum again!
