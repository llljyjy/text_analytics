I’ve been trying this out for about a month now and I’ve been pretty impressed. It’s been really nice especially during these colder, more dry months. It helps to bump up the moisture and keep my skin more hydrated. Definitely an awesome product. I received this product free for testing but that is my 100% my own opinion! If you need more hydration, this is fantastic!
