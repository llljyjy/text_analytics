I wish I could love it. I mean itâ€™s supposed to help in older skin, since Iâ€™m naturally not producing as much. When shopping for squalane, look specifically for oils that are 100 percent plant-derived. Some skin care lines use squalane from plants, not sharks. Oil derived from plants is cruelty-free and sustainable. Which is GREAT, but the smell in this? Ugh. I hold my breath as long as I can, it seems to quickly disappear but itâ€™s not pleasant. I feel pretty dry after it soaks in. Iâ€™ll keep using it - finishing the jar but not really sure Iâ€™ll purchase another unless I notice a huge improvement. Itâ€™s plant based ðŸŒ±but not impressive
