lovely texture! i’ve actually bought this stuff twice & had to return it both times. something in this product’s ingredient list just clogs my pores like crazy & i found it to not actually be moisturizing enough for my dehydrated skin (especially in the winter :/) a better option for the same price would be the yttp adaptogen cream & you get a bit more product with that one at least! if this moisturizer works for you im incredibly jealous because the texture & smell of this cream are sooo divine & i would gladly use it for the rest of my life if my skin didn’t hate it so much! damn… nan
