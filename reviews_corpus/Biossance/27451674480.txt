I wasn’t expecting this moisturizer to help with my acne but it cured my blind pimples. I had managed to control 95% of my acne through other skincare products but still had some blemishes. This cream soothed my pimples and the natural redness of my skin (it’s sensitive). I also noticed that it made my skin brighter but I don’t know if I’m just seeing this because my skin is less red now. It also made my skin smooth and helped with the overall texture of my skin. I have oily skin and I find this moisturizer to be lightweight but it still takes some time to absorb into my skin after I have put it on.I’d say that this moisturizer is worth the price as it not only moisturizes your skin but also helps with soothing and healing your skin. Great for acne-prone, sensitive skin
