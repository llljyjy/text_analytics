I want to start off by saying that the smell is not for everyone . My husband one time got near me while I was applying it and he said it smelled like aged cotija Cheese ( it’s a Mexican cheese) . Which does kinda smell like that but for me is not an issue . I really like that it doesn’t have a overly fragrance in the product . I think sometimes it takes away from its benefits ( just my opinion) . My skin is sensitive and it didn’t cause any allergic reaction . It really moisturized the skin which I enjoy applying it mostly at night and sometimes during the day if I used an acid or a retinol the night before . It is a cross of drunk elephant and Kate Somerville moisturizer . I do wish that the one I got had a spatula to get it out of the jar . Still I’m being picky about it and it is still a great product . Loved it so much that I got a back up  . Seriously recommend for anyone who is serious about there skin care and that is allergic to fragrance like me . This product was send for free by influencer to give my full honest review . Hydrates the skin
