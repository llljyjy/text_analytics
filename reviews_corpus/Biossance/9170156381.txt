Pros-texture: I just loooove the way it feels on my skin-did not irritate my skin - faded some of my dark spots- good ingredients that actually work to target hyperpigmentation Cons- $62 for 1 ounce yikes! - minimal results with older dark spotsI have the sample size for this product and I believe it’ll last me at least another month which is great! However, I really wish it wasn’t so expensive otherwise I would purchase the full size. I’m pretty sure most of the cost goes to packaging. LOVE THIS PRODUCT. Wish it was more affordable tho
