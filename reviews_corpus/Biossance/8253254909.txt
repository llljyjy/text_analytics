I can’t get past the smell on Biossance squalane products. I’m usually okay with fragrance free clean natural products, but this is one the situations that I wish they added just a little bit of fragrance to mask that scent. Having said that, the cream is great. It worked phenomenally for my dry skin. I’ve been trying to be consistent about using it every day for the past couple of weeks despite the scent and it works well in keeping my skin hydrated and smooth. I just wish there was something that could be done about the scent. Great product, not so good scent
