It smells, not good, felt a overwhelming need to wash it off after applying, concerned it might be contaminated with, let’s just say, something that you wouldn’t want on your face, it’s is way too expensive to stink like this, there are better vegan options. I don’t know why some reviews are saying it doesn’t maybe those ppl can’t smell or maybe the issue is not consistent. Cursed with a good sense of smell
