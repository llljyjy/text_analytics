I like this product so much i would buy it again. I think this is the perfect first step in a double cleaning routine, better than a lot of makeup remover balms and washes I have tried. Gets all my mascara off and gently cleanses if . I think it is great for my combo skin. Gently removes eye makeup and doesnâ€™t sting
