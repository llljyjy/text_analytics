During the winter, my skin gets really dry and using this was a game changer! My skin felt great all day. It doesn’t leave a weird residue feel and it’s not thick like some skin care. A little bit goes a long way! I will be using this for my dry skin days no question. Just wish the smell was more noticeable but that’s just personal preference. Overall, this is great and I’ll be using it when needed! Great for the winter skin!
