As the title says, this is a really good serum. I have always loved Biossance and they are the of the few brands that actually have never irritated my skin with any of their products, this serum included. This serum really helped hydrate my skin especially during these dry winter. It made my skin look much more plump and healthy. With that being said, I gave this serum a 4 star because this serum is expensive. A little goes a long way however but still $68 is steep. I would wait til Sephora brings out their 20% coupon. Other than that, it is a great serum especially if you like Biossance. A Really Nice but Expensive Serum
