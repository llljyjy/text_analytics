It’s a solid luxurious feeling eye cream in a stupid open air container. Seriously Biossance: you’re so much better than this. I hate dipping my long nails (even tho clean) into this thing every night. It’s ignorant. Splurge for a pump! No top quality moisturizer with valuable ingredients should be packaged like this. It’s stupid & impractical. I can’t get the amount I want I have to dig it out of my fingernails and taint the rest of the product. Argh!!!! Would not rebuy based on this alone. They need to take a clue from drunk elephant who’s packaging is so thoughtful and smart. nan
