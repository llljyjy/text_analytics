I read all of the positive reviews and to be honest, I’m glad this was a short term commitment on my end.I did not find any of these products to deliver what they purport they can. The rose oil itself just sits on top of the skin. The eye cream is quite light, but after extended use (and I purchased the full size at the same time) no real difference in the appearance around the eye. The cream is the biggest trial (no pun intended)- it literally smells like dirty water from someone’s fish tank… or a pond.  Yuck.  I don’t expect all products to smell like roses, but this is another level. In the end, I have other oils, moisturizers, and serums that are hands down better - Babor, Biopelle, Clarins, Alteya, Starflower Essentials… I’m glad I went with this trial size (the full size eye cream the exception, which I now regret purchasing @$54). Not for me
