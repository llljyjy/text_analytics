just no!!!  i love this  brand & use their squalene oil for couple of years now but this one  is just a lot of heavy oil not a cleansing oil. it leaves my skin with thick layer of  oil after rinsing that i have to wash 2â€“3 times with a face wash to remove the oil & that process left  my skin dry & feeling thin like paper. dont bother!! just heavy oil!!
