I’ve been searching for a sunscreen with moisturizer that is clean and cruelty free, so I tried this one. It pilled up on me, which is no doubt b/c of the products I layer underneath. It also leaves somewhat of a whitecast, but that’s pretty typical, ya just gotta be careful not to use a ton. Certainly won’t buy again and will just use after I workout and am intending on washing my face again soon after. just okay
