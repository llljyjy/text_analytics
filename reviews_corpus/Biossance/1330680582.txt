I love this. I have very dry skin which started to have severely dry and bumpy patches after I started a retinol product in the winter in Minnesota. I bought this because I wanted to try the resurfacing serum and I like the rose oil. I used all 4 products and they worked amazingly after only 2 days! My skin feels normal again. It’s still dry, but the patchiness is gone. I’ll use the serum when I need to and the oil will last a while. The 2 creams I’ll probably use alternately with my other creams. nan
