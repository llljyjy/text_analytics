I have been using this oil for over a year, so I do not understand all the hyped reviews. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a lovely oil. I am very sensitive to fragrances and this does not irritate me. It has a lovely scent. The oil consistency is lightweight. Once applied to the skin, it leaves a slightly oily feeling, which eventually gets absorbed to your skin. Now, here is where I have an issue with this product. After months of using this every day, morning and night, I have not seen a difference in my skin complexion or texture. I have dry to normal skin, with a few minor hyperpigmentation spots. I have not seen an improvement in those spots using this vitamin c face oil alone. I would have to use a different serum to see better results. I don’t see a difference in firming or having a smoother texture. Again, I would have to use a different product to see better results. For this alone, I do not see the hype or why it costs so much money for this face oil. I will finish up what’s left in my bottle but I will not be repurchasing. nan
