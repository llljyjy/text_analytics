This was supposed to be the bright new thing to replace the Tea Tree + Squalane cleanser? In comparison: garbage, my skin still feels like it’s not fully cleansed after washing (double cleansed AND with a brush) but it’s irritating t-zone and giving me acne again in return?? If biossance had any sense, they’d bring back the tea tree. It’s a no, bring back the good stuff !!
