I tried this cleanser to compare it to the other biossance cleanser (the one in the pump) and this one does not compare. It doesn’t have a lather- and maybe it’s all in my head but the lack of lather just doesn’t make my skin feel clean at all. The packaging is annoying. The cap is cheap and doesn’t always completely close causing the product to leak and pool in the cap. I would usually roll my eyes at a complaint about packaging being cheap; but I did find this to be a flaw. Not a fan of the scent either. I’ll be going back to the other biossance cleanser which is a dream product along with other hard hitters. This one was just a miss for me. Not my favourite from biossance
