Honestly was hoping for more out of this products I’ve previously LOVED biossance products, but this was kind of a miss for me. My skin is extra dry in the winter, and slightly on the dry side the rest of the year. This serum lacked the hydration I’ve gotten from other biossance products, despite the squalane. Might be good for someone who is more oily, but didn’t work great for me. better for oily skin
