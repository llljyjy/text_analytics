I adore this product. It is very thick, but absorbs well. I have dry skin that is acne prone, and my skin really likes this product. I tend to use this at night in a thicker layer, but it does work well under makeup if you give it a few minutes to soak in. It does not leave my skin looking or feeling oily. I took a star off because of the smell. It is an earthy/yeasty smell that I don’t like, but on the bright side, it doesn’t last long/linger. I got this product for free from Influenster for my honest review. Great product, don’t like the smell.
