I always battle with dry skin during the Midwest winters and have been unsuccessful in trying to find a moisturizer that keeps my skin feeling hydrated for more than 10 minutes after I put it on - even when I’ve resorted to heavier creams. I’ve been using this biossance moisturizer for about a month now, morning and night, and I can tell that my skin feels and looks so much healthier and hydrated than it ever has before in mid-January. I will be using this regularly from now on. Some people remarked on the smell, but I don’t really think the smell is bad or even that strong. You don’t smell anything after putting it on your skin. My dry winter skin savior!
