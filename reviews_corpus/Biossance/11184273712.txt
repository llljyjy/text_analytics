I have been using this sunscreen for over a year and I have tried multiple techniques in hopes to minimize the blue/ ashy hue that it adds to my face. I have tried adding it after my serums and moisturizer has dried. I have tried adding it as layers to ensure coverage and absorption. But nothing really helped. Although this sunscreen made me feel psychologically that it was better because it was mineral it honestly decreased my self confidence because I did not want people to see or notice my dull face. Additionally I believe it mentions that it is not water proof. That is very true because I jumped in the pool once with it on and everyoneâ€™s noted that my face looked purple and was dripping. This sunscreen is not worth the money or the headache. Not Designed for Darker Skin Tones
