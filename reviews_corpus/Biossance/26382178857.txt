I’ve been using this product twice a week for a couple of weeks now. And, so far I didn’t experience any irritation. It also applies easily, absorbs quickly, and doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky. I haven’t seen any major changes in my fine lines yet. But, it does take a few months to see any improvements with retinol. A must-have in my Anti - Aging Routine
