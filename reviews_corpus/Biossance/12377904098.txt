Biossance repair cream is wonderful. It does have a thicker texture but it spreads evenly across this skin. It makes my skin look and feel so much better. My skin feels so hydrated and moisturized. It has helped with my dry and damaged skin. The only negative thing I can say is I don’t like the way it smells. It doesn’t have an actual scent but when it’s first applied it has a non pleasant odor, however I can easily look past this because of the amazing job it does. I would recommend this product. Awesome
