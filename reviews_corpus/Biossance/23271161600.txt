I swear I never write reviews but GUYS !! I got a little sample from the bazaar and tried a LOT of vitamin C serum and never found one I really liked expect the pixi one. Then I tried this one for one week and I love it ! It helped with a scaring of a pimple who was going down so no scar at all only a bit red ! The texture is pleasant and it doesn’t have any smell. Really worth to try but remember that every skin is different and it might not work for you so at the end it’s your own decision nan
