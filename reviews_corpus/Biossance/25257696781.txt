I wasn’t expecting a whole lot when I got this in the mail from Influenster because I’ve been using something similar for awhile and haven’t seen the results I was hoping for. I don’t know if the copper is helping a whole bunch but I can tell you that this is good squalane! When I skip this I can tell that my skin is thirsty and wanting just a little bit more. Great stuff and I’ll be getting it again as soon as I’m out. #biossance #complimentary @biossance @Influenster Super plumping!
