Skin broke out during first week of use but I persevered to see if it would eventually go away! And it did, this is after three weeks of use. Skin is overall smoother, softer and of a more even tone, I’m so excited to finish this bottle to see how good my results are from here on if this is what’s it’s done in just three weeks (note; my skin burned during the first week of usage but I think it was adjusting to the acid intake it so I was mixing my ordinary hyaluronic in with this to sheer it out a bit, but after the first week I felt no burning at all and started applying the serum on its own!) drastic change
