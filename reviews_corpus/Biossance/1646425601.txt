I have combo/dry skin, so I love anything with hyaluronic acid that boosts hydration. This serum has a thin liquidy consistency, a beautiful blue color, and not much of a scent. It absorbed quickly and didn’t leave my skin feeling sticky/tacky. After using this serum for the past several weeks, I have definitely noticed an improvement in the overall hydration of my skin. My skin is looking more smooth, even, and juiced up. It’s on the more expensive side, but you do get a decent amount of product, plus it’s pretty comparable in price to other high end hydrating serums. Overall I think this is a great serum and I would recommend it! Hydrating Hyaluronic Heaven
