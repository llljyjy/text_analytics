I was hesitant to purchase this because of the price, but I will say that it is a very nice cream. Pretty thick, without being paste like, and really is moisturizing. I haven’t noticed a major reduction in wrinkles, but my darkness had faded a bit. It stings a bit when applied, so maybe wait a few minutes after washing your face to apply, if you have sensitive skin. Still on the fence as to weather or not I’ll buy it again. Solid 7/10. pretty nice!!
