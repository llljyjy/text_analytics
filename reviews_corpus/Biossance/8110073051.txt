I loved this moisturiser! It absorbs faster into my skin than drunk elephant moisturiser and makes my skin dewy and soft. A little seems to go a very long way too. The texture seems thick when you scoop it out, but vanishes as soon as it touches your skin. It had a slight natural fragrance pre application but it goes away once applied too. I got this product for review purposes, for free from Influenster and biossance. Love it
