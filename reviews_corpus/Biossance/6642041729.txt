Love this eye cream. It’s very soothing and great for dry eyes. The consistency is thinner than most eye creams I’ve used in the past but I really like this one. Since the skin around my eyes get very dry, I’ve used some products where it actually stings or burns when using a moisturizer and this does not do it at all. I wish this eye cream did have some sort of brightening aspect to it though. Soothing Eye Cream!
