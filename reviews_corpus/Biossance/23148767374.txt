I’m a devout CEO oil user but have been curious with the popularity of this vitamin c face oil so when I ran out of my last ceo bottle I got this. It’s a very generous size imo and will last months (I use 2 drops every morning). This absorbs quicker than SR and has less scent (little to no scent in fact). Leaves the same lit from within glow and plays nicely under mineral spf and makeup. The lip balm is not that good, doesn’t last long at all, though I love that it’s unscented. If you’ve also been wanting to try their face oil this really is the perfect set! nan
