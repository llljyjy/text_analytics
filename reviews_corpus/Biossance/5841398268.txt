This feels great. My skin really likes the consistency and I definitely feel hydrated, nourishes, and glowing after use, but… the smell is off-putting and, unfortunately a bit overpowering for someone as sensitive to aromas as I am. I wanted to love LOVE it, but I’ll settle for liking it. Missed the 5th star by the nose
