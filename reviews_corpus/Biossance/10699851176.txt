This is a great oil. As a finish to your skincare routine or just for hydration, this oil is lightweight and has a low viscosity. Only a small amount of oil will cover your entire face making this bottle a long lasting one. I’ve only used this on my face and body so I don’t know its effectiveness on hair. Worthwhile Purchase
