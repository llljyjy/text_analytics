This zinc-only sunscreen is sheerer than most other zinc-only screens I’ve tried, but makes my equally if not more itchy than chemical screens I’ve struggled with in the past. Very emollient which I usually enjoy because I have dry skin, but does not mix well with a lot of makeup.It does not set and does not have a natural finish on the skin, so if you’re looking to wear this alone, I’d only recommend to people who don’t have sensitives and like a dewy finish. Not for sensitive
