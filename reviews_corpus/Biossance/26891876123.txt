I received this product 1 week ago I wanted to try it for several days before writing the review, I am delighted with this product, it is delicate, it has a very subtle rose scent, it is super moisturizing, I live in Utah, it is winter, and it has helped me a lot with the inclement weather. It totally hydrates. my skin is grateful It's definitely going to be part of my skin routin
