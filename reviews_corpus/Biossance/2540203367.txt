I have normal to dry skin. Being that I paid full price, I’m definitely being much more picky. Haha. It honestly did not do much for me. The hydration level was more essence/like, and not the “miracle” hydrating and plumping serum they claim this is. Perhaps for the summer this would be perfect! And the color is gorgeous. Like the serotonin from that alone almost made me keep it lol. But just not enough for my winter skin. Once my skin absorbed it, it was only slightly, and I mean slightly, better than when I started my routine. Not super similar per se, but the Youth To The People Cactus Oasis serum has more more lasting hydrating and plumping effects. However, definitely give this a try if it seems interesting to you! Quality is great, just not hydrating enough for me. meh?
