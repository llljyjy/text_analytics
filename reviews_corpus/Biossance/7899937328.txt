Wanted to try this product since I love Biossanceâ€™s squalane + vitamin C serum for my AM routine. But I can only use this product once a week because of how dry it makes my skin the next day, so unfortunately I think it will be awhile until I start to see results. For reference I have combination/dry, sensitive skin. nan
