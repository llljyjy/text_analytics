On my second jar, lasts FOREVER. Very hydrating & creamy, easy to pat under eyes with no tugging- I cant say I think it did anything for my under eye circles but it has helped my fine lines, plumpness & crepey-ness. I put a generous amount under my eyes Night & Morning after doing my skincare routine then top with my Dieux Reusable silicone eye masks and let it just sink in for 20 minutes before removing the silicone masks and my under eye looks plump, hydrated and my fine lines minimized. And most important for me: NO IRRITATION, there is not a single other eye cream out there so far that hasnt caused a reaction for me, just this one. So if you have very very sensitive under eyes that react to pretty much everything- try this. Very Hydrating & Sensitive Skin Friendly!
