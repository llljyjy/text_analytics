Does Biossance ever read reviews? People are complaining everywhere that this cream STINKS. It smells putrid and spoiled, like sour milk or feet. I was SO disappointed, as I loved the weight and feel of the cream. They either need to recall a huge bad batch, or reformulate the cream. It’s expensive and with the millions of other competitors out there that do NOT smell like gym socks, they are losing money. Until I find out it’s been reformulated, sadly they are losing mine. Fix this already!!!! Feels nice, but SMELLS AWFUL!!!!
