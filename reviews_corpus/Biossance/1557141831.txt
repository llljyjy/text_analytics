Been looking for a non-tinted mineral sunscreen that doesn’t cast, pill or hurt my wallet and finally found it! My skin goes on the drier side so perhaps that’s why other reviewers say it’s too oily - I also don’t use moisturizer under sunscreen to enhance protection, just a light gel since I do get try otherwise. I don’t normally wear makeup but when I do this gives me no issues. Holy grail of mineral sunscreens!
