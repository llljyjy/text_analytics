I received this sample in the May Skincare Animation and I had no expectations at first.I even noticed it was meant for the night after I opened it but I used it anyway and many hours later I found my skin was looking better. I am not the biggest fan of the lactic acid smell found in most serum, cream and lotions Iâ€™ve tried but this one is not the smelliest so I can live with it.I am considering trying it on a longer period to see if the effect last more than just a few days but overall I am really surprised and happy with the sample Considering to try it for a longer period.
