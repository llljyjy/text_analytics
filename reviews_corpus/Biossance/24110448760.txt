I been using this Biossance Squalane Omega Repair Cream for couple of weeks now. It really helped my skin tremendously. I’ve very dry skin, so ive to use serum/moisturizer/face oil to keep it hydrated. But this repair cream is great by itself! Im using it twice a day (morning and night) and my skin feels so hydrated and glowy. It has also helped with the uneven skin texture and dark spots. This moisturizing cream has a very thick creamy texture but it absorbs quickly on the skin. It doesn’t feel oily. It has very mild scent to it, came in a beautiful glass jar. I love using this product, definitely recommend and buying this again Great find for dry skin
