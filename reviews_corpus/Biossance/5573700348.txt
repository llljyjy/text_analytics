First impression: I think I finally found my forever cleanser. This cleanser feels like it has been engineered to perfection. It has a very gentle scent, refined and more spall like version of tea tree oil scent. It feels soft on the skin, gel like. It does not strip my already dry face. I am so surprised at how well it removes make up, and for those who do the Korean skin care routine like myself, this is an excellent double cleanser after you do the oil cleanse. It removes any oil residue from the oil cleanser, without compromising the moisture. I highly recommend this for dry skin, I am definitely going to be using this every day and again I don’t think I will be trying anything else, I finally found a cleanser that works with my skin.￼ JUST WOW! I finally found my forever cleanser!!
