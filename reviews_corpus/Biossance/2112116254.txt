I love this facial oil! When I first started to use it I would tab it on my skin and just massage it into the skin and leave it as is....I didnâ€™t like how this turned out. So I started to use a facial massager after applying the oil and this was a game changer! Soaked into the skin and left with a beautiful finish! I do this at night time and wake up with glowing skin, and no breakouts. Game changer.
