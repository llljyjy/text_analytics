Day 3 of Usage:Leaves skin feeling cleansed and fresh.No oily, dry or residue feeling after use. No irritation. Scent free. Absorbs ridiculously fast into the skin or makeup pad. My whiteheads and active zits have noticeably gone down a lot and no longer show as much since adding this product to my skincare routine. I recommend this product. Iâ€™ve used more expensive toners in the past and definitely think this is priced well for the quality. nan
