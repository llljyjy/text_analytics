This face moisturizer has been a favorite of mine for a long time. I love that it isnâ€™t sticky and that the product just sinks into my skin. The product does have a scent when first applied but it goes away. This moisturizer makes my skin feel soft and plump. My makeup goes on nicely with this moisturizer as a base. Great moisturizer!
