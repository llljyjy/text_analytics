I love this oil. It’s not super heavy and I mix it with my moisturizer (cera ve daily lotion) at night and it is a great combo for that overnight hydration. I’ve also used it on my body and it was amazing and not super greasy and I use it in my hair occasionally and looks so good!! The bottle is big and I’m surprised how long it’s lasted and the dispenser makes it super easy and doesn’t make a mess. Definitely will repurchase this Favorite oil of all time
