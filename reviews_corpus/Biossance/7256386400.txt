I received this product to test in exchange for a review.I was so happy to be able to test this because I have been looking into getting this but I just couldn’t decide which skin care like I wanted to try. I really loved this cream I definitely saw a change in my skin texture it was more smooth and soft. The only thing I didn’t like was the smell it has a really fishy smell to me but I will still use it. Loved
