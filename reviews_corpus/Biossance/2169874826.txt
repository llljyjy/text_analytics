I’d crawl to the ends of the earth to find this stuff if it came to that. It works that well! I have 45-year-old, easily congested, combo skin with melasma/uneven pigmentation that’s triggered by UV and heat. I initially tried a small sample of this stuff during a trip in Thailand and what I loved most about it compared to other Vit C serums I’ve tried (and, as a medical-aesthetician, I’ve tried many) is how this stuff seems to exfoliate my skin and keep it baby soft and smooth after each application. I started using it on my bare face at night - with nothing layered on top. Then, I used it under my moisturizer and sunblock during the day. I love that my skin is benefiting from the antioxidant properties of Vitamin C while the rest of the ingredients in this power serum keep my face as soft as a baby’s you know what! Phenomenal!
