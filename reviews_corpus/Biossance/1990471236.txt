I can not say enough good thinks about the Rapid Radiance Set! This set includes 4 of Biossance’s best products. It’s a great way to try their products. The Squalane + Algae Marine Eye Cream is very rich, but not heavy. The Squalane + Lactic Acid Resurfacing Night Serum, goes on smoothly, and really works quickly to help smooth my skins surface. The Squalane + Omega Repair Cream is very hydrating without feeling heavy. To top it all of the Squalane + Vitamin C Rose Oil is very hydrating. I put this on last. It doesn’t make my face feel heavy with oil. I also put this on my lips, and whatever is left on my hands I rub into the dry spots on the tops of my hands from over washing at work. I’ve only been using these products since January and I am very impressed! My skin looks more youthful, smooth, and is very well hydrated during these cold winter months. Very impressed!
