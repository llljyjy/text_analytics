I purchased this when my go to from Clinique was discontinued.  I have very dry skin and it works for that.  When I apply during the day, my face is greasy looking.  For me, will be a night time product, but not during the day.  It does have a bad smell but that doesnâ€™t bother me, it fades quickly. It's ok
