This set is the perfect size for travel or if you are on the fence about purchasing the full sizes. Biossance truly makes excellent products. They are cruelty-free (cruelty free kitty certified), vegan, and sustainable. The marine algae eye cream in this kit is my #1. It’s very hydrating and doesn’t cause milia. I use the lactic acid 2x a week to exfoliate my skin and even rub it on any pimples I get. The Omega repair cream is a lovely nightime moisturizer that provides extra hydration. I top it off with Vit C oil to lock in the hydration and rub the extra on my cuticles. Definitely worth the purchase. Worth the buy
