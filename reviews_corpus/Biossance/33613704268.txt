I have been using this for a little bit now. I received it completely to try and review. I already have retin-a but I find this is actually helping with the texture in my problem areas (around my nose, chin and jaw line)  the addition of the squalane seems to be the difference. My skin feels oft and seems to suck it in and I wake up feeling pretty soft and not that dry feeling like I have gotten with the retin-a. I will continue to use this. I had really bad hormonal acne. And the scars are lightening and my face is so smooth. Im super happy with this. It doesnâ€™t hurt that I like Biossance products anyways. New night time staple
