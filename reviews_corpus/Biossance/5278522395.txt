I really do enjoy this product it is a lighter weight moisturizer that really stinks in to the face. I do make up looks for a living and itâ€™s very important that my moisturizer works well with foundation and overall this one did not disappoint. I have very dry skin and this works well overall I would give this a 9/10 Lightweight and sinks in
