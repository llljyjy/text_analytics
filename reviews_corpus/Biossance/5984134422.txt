I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. My thoughts are my own based on my experience using this moisturizer on my sensitive skin. I’ve wanted to try this brand ever since JVN recommended it on Queer Eye! I’m super impressed by how moisturizing it is despite feeling light and airy on my face. This is definitely a product I can use day and night. product I can use day and night
