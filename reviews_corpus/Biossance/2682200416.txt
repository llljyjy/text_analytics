The best part about these products is that they are gentle and safe to use while breastfeeding, which I feel can be hard to find.I have normal to oily skin and these products work really well. I use the rose oil in the morning and it’s perfect. It doesn’t leave my skin too oily, but soft and smooth. I also love the eye cream and feel like I have noticed a difference since I started using it. I really want to try it with the peptide eye cream to see if it will help the dark circles under my eyes. nan
