I have dry skin that can get more textured and combo during the summer.  I still need a lot of moisturizing though and this cream is it!  It manages to be rich but light, nourishing but easily absorbed.  For me it is a great summer moisturizer for day and night.  Just a smidge in the morning wears well under makeup.  I can go a little heavier at night.  During the winter I would probably layer this up with an oil to combat dry winter skin.  So glad I tried this! A great daily moisturizer
