I was so excited to have the opportunity to try this new face cream from Biossance. Iâ€™ve always been a fan of their products and this is no exception. I live in a dry mountain climate and absolutely love the hydration that this moisturizer provides. Though it does have a richer texture, it does absorb very quickly. I love pairing this with my favorite vitamin C. Highly recommend! Ultimate balanced moisturizer!
