This serum has a creamy but lightweight texture. It is easy to spread out on my face, and it absorbs fairly quickly. Usually with retinol, I can only use it every other night, but I think because this serum is mixed with squalane, it seems minimizing the chance of getting irritation. I like it so far. nan
