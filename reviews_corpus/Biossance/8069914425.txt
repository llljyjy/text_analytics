I love using this product to give my skin a nice and natural looking glow. It absorbs into the skin very quickly, and does not make my oily-combo skin feel oilier. I also have quite sensitive skin and this product did not cause any redness or other reactions. The only negative to the product is the price! $95 for 30ml is A LOT for a product that only adds glow/ slightly hydrates the skin. Which is why I purchase this through value sets that Biossance offers so I at least get other products a long with it. Great for a subtle glow, but pricy!
