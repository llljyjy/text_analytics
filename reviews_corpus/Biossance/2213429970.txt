I love everything from this brand!! They kill it in packaging and formula. This product is so soothing and hydrating for my skin. My skin is sensitive and I enjoy this light fragrance formula. It doesn’t break me out. You barely need anything to cover your whole face. Pricey but worth it. Can’t go wrong with squalene! nan
