I get very dry, cracked lips in the winter. My $2 lipgloss from the beauty supply store works equally, if not better than this lip balm for the price. Depending on the humidity in my area it sometimes feel like it makes my lips even more chapped. Prob wonâ€™t buy again since the price is pretty high for a lip balm. nan
