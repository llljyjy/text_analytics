I really enjoy this as a gentle, first-step cleanse. I will often wash my face with just this in the morning, and in the evening I will use this then the Youth to the People Kale Cleanser. It removes my sunscreen and eye makeup with no issue. It has a pleasant, natural smell that I enjoy. My only complaint about this product is that mine looks nothing like the photos or even other reviewer’s photos. Mine has a clear, jelly consistency but I have basically no pink in mine. I figure this is probably just a different batch and it hasn’t affected my experience negatively, but I don’t like the inconsistency. Overall great cleanser and comparable to the Inkey List Oat Cleanser (the Biossance one is less greasy feeling) A Great Gentle Cleanser
