Holy grail for acne prone dry skin. I just bought my 3rd big jar of this cream, I’ve never stuck with a product this long. I have sensitive, acne prone skin. I’m currently pregnant and my skin is also super dry right now even during the summer - but this cream has been a lifesaver. I’ve been adding a couple drops of squalane oil from the ordinary to help with the dryness but that’s only been going on during my pregnancy Holy grail status - on my third jar
