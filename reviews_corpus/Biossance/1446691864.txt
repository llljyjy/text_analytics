This moisturizer smells rosy and feels nice going on. My skin feels soft when I apply it. I will say that after a couple weeks, the smell seems to have gone off a little, but maybe thatâ€™s just me. Though my son agreed the smell was part rosy and part not great, but I will continue to use it. I was given this product in exchange for an honest review. Rosy and light and soft moisturizer
