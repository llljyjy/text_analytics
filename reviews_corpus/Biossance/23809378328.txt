I was elated when I found this item in the mini size. I’m usually pretty nervous and skeptical with a moisturizer that is over $50. I’d have to really like the ingredient list and watch reviews for people that aren’t getting paid to say that they like the product. I am glad that I purchased this moisturizer because over the moon for it. The texture is lovely plus it absorbs into my skin so well even after I’ve layered my serums and tretinoin cream before it. It applies beautifully and thankfully has no fragrance. It has a wonderful plumping affect and it makes my skin incredibly soft the next day. The omegas certainly do what they’re supposed to. I will definitely buy this in the full size once my mini size runs out. Whoever gave this a two star rating just because they didn’t like the trial size they received is ridiculous the reviews are supposed to be about testing the actual product. To bring down the rating on a wonderful product just because you didn’t like the size is absurd. HOLY GRAIL!!!
