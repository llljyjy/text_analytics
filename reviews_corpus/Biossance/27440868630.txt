I liked that this cream wasnâ€™t too heavy but just thick enough to make my skin feel hydrated both day and night. It has a regular moisturizer scent, nothing heavily fragrant. It made my skin feel very smooth. I would highly recommend this to anyone suffering dry skin and much more. Super hydrating
