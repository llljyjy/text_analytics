A great foaming cleanser! Bottle was easy to use, closed up well when traveling. I loved how clean it made my oily skin feel but I wouldn’t recommend it to those with dry or sensitive skin because I can see how it could be stripping. It also had a lot of fragrance so I wouldn’t recommend to those with sensitivities. I would love this product more without the scent. Overall it worked well and did good for my skin type. Nice cleanser, fragrance warning
