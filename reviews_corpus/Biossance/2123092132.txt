This is a fantastic moisturizer. The most perfect consistency and not too light but also not too thick. No fragrance or irritants (and let me tell you, my skin gets easily irritated), great ingredients. I am pretty lazy, so going through a whole skincare routine isn’t enjoyable to me but I actually get excited when I put this on. Only thing that I could think of that’s missing is there is no spf in this. If there was, I’d prob start crying with joy. Really awesome
