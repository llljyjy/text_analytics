Got a new one from a trendmood box. Previously been using this cream. I have combination oily skin and this goes very well with my toner, treatment for hyperpigmentation, serums you name it. Layers well, not oily, does not break me out and best of all, does not leave my skin greasy! Well worth it. nan
