I had recently noticed some skin damage I chalked up to a combo of aging and being in the sun so I was referred to this serum and it was one of the few products that made a really healthy and sustained impact on my skin. It’s one of the best purchases I’ve made and recommend to anyone hoping to maintain healthy skin or improve their skin health in a sustainable fashion. No pain, easy to use and works incredibly well. Thanks Biossance and Sephora! Truly improved some light damage and aging for me!
