This a good thick moisturizer that absorbs pretty well. If you have dry skin it’s good all year round. If you run a. It oily, I’d save this for the winter/drier months mainly due to how thick it is. No noticeable fragrance, no skin irritations, doesn’t pill under makeup. Overall a good thick moisturizer. Good thick moisturizer
