This eye cream is incredibly moisturizing! I am really really obsessed with how nice it is. I have very sensitive eyes and it doesnâ€™t irritate me like some other eye creams have. I also use on my eyelids. After a month of use, I have realized this is best as a night eye cream or no makeup eye cream, as it did seem to make my under eye concealer and eyeshadow crease like crazy. Sad to see so many negative reviews for such a great product! Great Night Eye Cream
