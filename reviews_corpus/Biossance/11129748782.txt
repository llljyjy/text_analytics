Love the sensation of moisture this leaves on your face but im giving It three starts because 1 its way too thick the texture is more of a body cream so it doesnt run that smooth on the skin and second the smell, is smells a little weird to me, i will keep using it to see the results on my face tho. I received this products from Influenster and Biossance for free in exchange for my honest review Good moisturiser
