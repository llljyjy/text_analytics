This cream came into my life at the perfect time. I’m an esthetician and I have been using a pretty strong cream with hydroquinone and tretinoin asingredients and I have been using this on the days Idon’t use that. Before I was using this product Iwas peeling by the end of the week, which wasfine but annoying. With this my skin has beenpeeling far less and I have a radiant glow! It smells alittle like cocoa butter which I like. A little goes along way and it absorbs nicely. 10/10 wouldpurchase this again. I have been recommendingto clients as well if they have dry or normal skin. great for dry - dehydrated skin
