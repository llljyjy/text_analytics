I have been using this serum for about 2 weeks and I’m really enjoying it. It’s hydrating and makes my skin feel super soft. I also really like that it has copper peptides. I can’t see the effects yet, as it would probably take years to see the increased collagen production, but I always like to have a copper peptide serum in my night routine and this might be it. I have used other in the past that irritated my skin, and this is one is very gentle and I haven’t had any adverse reaction. Hydrating Copper Peptide serum
