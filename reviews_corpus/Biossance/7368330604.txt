I was very excited to try this new moisturizer as I’m a huge fan of Biossance. This was a let down. I received it today and when I opened it, I see this huge hole (see pic) in the middle and it looks like at least a third of the moisturizer is one. I don’t know if I received a used product or if there is poor quality control at Biossance but paying $56 for a moisturizer, I expect a full container. Get your act together! Returning for a refund. 1/3 of the container was missing
