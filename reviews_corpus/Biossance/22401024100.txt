I really wished I like it. It does plump your lips and makes it look nice. Not the wet look. It’s kinda sticky and weirdly it made my lips dry and the edges started to accumulate the products. If you ever had a powdered donut then you know what I’m talking about. good but only if you don’t have extra dry lips.
