I just started using this as my last step in my skincare routine. I was reluctant to the idea of an oil on my skin as I have combination skin, get oily in the t-zone and am sensitive in other areas. Well, I was wrong. This didnâ€™t make me more oily or break me out. This made my skin so smooth and firm and gives it just the right amount of nutrition it needs. A little goes a long way and I definitely will repurchase this when I run out. New holy grail
