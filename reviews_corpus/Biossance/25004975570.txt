I have combination/oily skin and this has been my favorite everyday moisturizer for the past year. Gives my skin a lovely glow without making me oily. I donâ€™t notice a huge improvement in my redness but I do notice an improvement in texture, this moisturizer really smooths out my skin. Perfect for combo/oily skin!
