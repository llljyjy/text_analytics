My eyes have been stinging from every sunscreen moisturizer i have boughtâ€¦except for this one. There IS a white cast AT FIRST bc it is mineral, but it rubs right in. If you want DEWY look this is for you. I have combo skin and chin acne. This worked rly well over my rx acne cream so i never dried out. Not once. Love it. New staple for me
