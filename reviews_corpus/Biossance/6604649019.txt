Product targeting the improvement of fine lines and wrinkles, discoloration, and texture is what I aim for since I have aging skin with melasma. Biossance Squalane + Retinol Night Serum is the brand’s latest creation, and I am happy to be selected to try. Being new to retinol can be irritating to the skin. In my night routine, for the first week, I applied the serum on cleanse skin every other evening. The lightly scented serum glides easily onto the skin. For retinol product, a little goes a long way. I applied it to the face and neck. After one week, I applied the serum nightly without experiencing any irritation. I’ve used this serum for about 2.5 weeks and noticed my skin feels smoother and looking a bit brighter. The melasma on my white cheek seems bit lighter in color as well. I’m excited to see more results over time. Gentle Retinol
