I received a sample of this recently and I’m actually very impressed with this product. I’ve been using kiehls eye cream, but this beats it for sure. It’s super creamy, hydrating, rich, but not greasy. My under eye is instantly hydrated and concealer goes over it smoothly. It just feels good around the eye. It is definitely expensive for an eye cream, but you don’t need to use a ton so I think it would last a bit. Very nice eye cream
