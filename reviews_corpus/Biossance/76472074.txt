This vitamin C moisturizer with rose is the prettiest pink color and has just a hint of rose fragrance to it - not overpowering at all! It is a thicker cream (not a lotion) but it absorbs perfectly so you can use it at night as your final step in your skincare routine or itâ€™s still light enough to use under your makeup. It leaves your skin feeling amazingly soft and supple with the most beautiful luminosity. Seriously, your skin will feel incredible after applying this and leave you with with the softest glow! Beautiful moisturizer
