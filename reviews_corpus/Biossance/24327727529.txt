I absolutely love how this product moisturizes my skin throughout the day and night with one single application. My skin feels soft and lustrous. The smell was unpleasant at first but you get used to it and it only last temporarily. The price is pretty expensive thatâ€™s why I gave it 4 stars, other than  that it well worth it. A must have in my skin care
