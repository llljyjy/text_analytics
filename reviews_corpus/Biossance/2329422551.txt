Look, to each their own right? Everything works differently for everyone. But I used to wake up with an oily face as of my poor face needed more moisture and I tried A LOT. I’m a VIB rouge. I’ve tried TOO many lol. But this, this stuff is a game changer. Yes.m, it’s pricey but you don’t need that much for your whole face. My skin feels so great. It’s normally combo but my oils will peak out more at night and over produce. But this had saved me. Oily face BE GONE. this saved me.
