I got this product in a biossance kit, the small sample lasted me a good few weeks.This stuff is magic, I honestly love using this before applying makeup. If you have dry/ combo skin you should invest in this product. I am a baddie on a budget so I only got the mini but I definitely will purchase the full size for the Sephora sale. nan
