I received this for a voxbox and my skin definitely had become noticeably smoother after 2 weeks of used. At first, my skin broke out in response to retinol at first BUT this is normal side effect due to skin turnover. Now my skin feels smoother, softer and the breakouts almost completely disappeared. Keep in mind I’m dry skin so typically I’m not the targeted demographic and even then this was REALLY nice on my skin. 4 stars for the amazing effect on skin but quite frankly it’s a lot of work at first to get the desired effect. If you’re struggling with the side effects, DONT GIVE UP I PROMISE YOU IT’LL GET BETTER IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS but do stop use if it lasts more than a week or 2 longer than that. I do recommend using lot of sunscreen and moisturizer over the serum to ease the side effects. More for skincare savvy! It works but needs time!
