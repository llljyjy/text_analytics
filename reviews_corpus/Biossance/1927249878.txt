Loved this serum but wish it had more noticeable effects. For someone with sensitive skin, it was def gentle on the skin so they delivered on that. I did notice some difference on fine lines but not as much as some other brands I’ve used. I’d recommend this product overall. Received complimentary for my honest review from Influenster. Great gentle retinol
