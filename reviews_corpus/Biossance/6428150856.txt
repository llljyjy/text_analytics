amazing product. super hydrating and plumps up the skin immediately. very pricey, but worth the money, if u don’t want to use regular squalane oil. keeps my skin dewy all day. I use it in the morning and at night. it makes you feel like you’re at the spa and it smells very nice. it’s light and a little goes a long way. just pat it into your skin. Love This Product
