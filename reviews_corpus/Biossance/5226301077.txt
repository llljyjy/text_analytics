On my third bottle. I ran to Sephora 5 min before closing because I genuinely can’t live without this product. Even the lady at Sephora asked if this was all I used because my skin looked amazing. I truly feel like this works but it takes some time. That’s with a lot of vitamin C products. Be patient and consistent and you’ll see results. Love the formula, scent free, and I only use one pump and it spreads evenly around my entire face. Third bottle!
