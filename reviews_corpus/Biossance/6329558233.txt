Really love the formula and consistency of this moisturizer BUT the smell is so bad! I thought other reviewers were being dramatic when they wrote how awful it smells, but it really does smell gross. It smells so bad/strong (like feet) that I actually hold my breath while applying. I would repurchase but the smell is so pungent that I wonâ€™t be buying again :( Great formula; Smells horrible
