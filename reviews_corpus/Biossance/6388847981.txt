I received this product free for review from Influenster and Biossance. First off, I love Biossance products and all I have tried to date have been fantastic. This product was a tad on the heavy side for me. Maybe because the weather is warming it didn’t agree with my skin but this may be a great dry/winter product. I will say I one night I concentrated this on a dry patch on my face and it felt fine. I think I’m just going to have to find the right balance with this one. Smell isn’t great either but it’s a natural skin care type smell Not bad, not amazing
