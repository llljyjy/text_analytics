I have Fitzpatrick type 5 skin and this sunscreen scared the sht out of me. There was a bad white cast at first but it went away after rubbing it in for quite a while. It’s great for my combo skin and my acne has actually improved since I started using this. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone darker than Fitzpatrick 5 or to someone with extremely dry skin. Great product but definitely won’t purchase again due to the time it takes to rub it in. nan
