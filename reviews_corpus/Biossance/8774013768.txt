I was browsing in store for a new moisturizer and I was convinced by the staff to purchase the gift set with the Omega Repair Cream and I’m glad they did! The cream is unscented (despite other reviews claiming it smells like feet) it absorbs quickly and works great under my tinted moisturizer. I wouldn’t say it’s revolutionary and life changing but it definitely keeps my skin soft and supple through the winter months. nan
