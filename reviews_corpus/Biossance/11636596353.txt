I was given the opportunity to test this product in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this moisturizer for about two weeks now and have been extremely pleased with it. It has a very light scent that isn’t overpowering, I feel a little product goes a long way. It left my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day. It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy on your skin. I would recommend this product to others. nan
