This sunscreen is completely sheer until you sweat or get wet. As soon as I went swimming I got a white cast. It feels more oily than it looks. It does not break out my skin which is nice. It seems a little pricey for how much you get. So overall it isn’t terrible, but it isn’t my favorite. Great for daily use. But does not have all that I want in a face sunscreen. Sheer but meh…
