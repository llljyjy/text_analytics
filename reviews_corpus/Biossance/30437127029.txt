I just love this Biosense squalene and Omega deep repair hydration moisturizer. It really moisturizes and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. It is very thick but absorbs quickly and does not leave your skin feeling oily. This doesnâ€™t have a strong scent,, I would describe it as earthy. Great for all skin types even sensitive. I will definitely recommend and buy this. I received this for free for my honest opinion. Best moisturizer
