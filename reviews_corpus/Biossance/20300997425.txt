I have fry sensitive skin and after using this product for a few days I noticed that my skin broke out. It also felt heavy when you first put it on but after an hour or so it doesn’t feel as heavy. I also didn’t enjoy the smell of the product. I did receive this product for free from Influenster for testing. Was okay
