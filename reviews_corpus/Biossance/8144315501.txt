Love this moisturizer - I received it free in exchange for my review from Influenster.  I have normal skin.  This was very hydrating and didn’t feel greasy at all on my skin.  I think the price is a little high and the scent is a little off, but it doesn’t irritate my eyes like some moisturizers do. nan
