This is my favorite moisturizer now, I live in west Texas desert and my skin is combination/dry. I usually get rosacea and dry matches and this has literally saved and rescued my skin. Is a lightweight formula that melts on the skin, the squalane helps retains moisture and is beautiful under make up. Is a bit on the pricey side but a little goes a long way, I definitely recommend this and will be buying it.*disclaimer I received this product free of charge as part of influenster, all opinions are my own* Repairs skin barrier!
