I have combination skin and sensitivities to most sources of fragrance but the rose oil did not irritate my skin. I use it every night on top of my water based serums at night and I can tell I have a lower oil production. Sometimes I even use it as a base when I donâ€™t feel like wearing foundation during the day. Some people with fragrance allergies, please patch test before use. Even naturally present fragrance in products can cause irritation. A little goes a long way.
