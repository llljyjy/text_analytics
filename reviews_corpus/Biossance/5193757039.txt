I actually really love this serum! It definitely has brightened my dark spots and hyperpigmentation. I’ve had new spots come up and they aren’t as pronounced as they once were. I’ve also been using witch hazel, the biossance night serum, and Glow Recipes Pink Juice moisturizer. I would highly recommend this serum. It’s pricey but worth it. Doesn’t break me out or leave a weird residue. The photos are before and after from Feb - April. Hyperpigmentation holy grail!
