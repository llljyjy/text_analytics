This is an amazing serum. It’s very plumping and moisturizing, so this has been perfect for winter. I’ve used this for over a month, and I’ve really seen an improvement in how my skin is looking. I tend to get dry patches during the winter and my skin just looks a bit lifeless as well. This has really helped me fight the winter skin blues. I love that it’s full of some of my favorite actives—copper peptide, squalane, and hyaluronic acid. Polyglutamic acid is something I have less experience with, but I’ve tried a few products with it that I’ve really loved. It might become a holy grail! Incredible for juicy skin
