This product works as a moisturizing eye gel but nothing else. I was guided to this product by a Sephora employee when I requested help finding an eye cream. My eyes are just as puffy and my dark circles are pretty prominent. I tried other eye creams and saw more instant results than this one had in 6-8 months of usage. Honestly wouldn’t recommend it, especially for the price. Clinique’s pep start eye gel is the same thing and cheaper. decent product, hefty price
