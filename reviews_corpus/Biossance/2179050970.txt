This stuff is my holy grail.  To be fair, I have SUPER dry skin, and this is the very first mineral sunscreen that wonâ€™t flake or break up on my after a few hours.  On me there is no white cast at all, but I am also very pale.  Beautiful finish, not greasy, makes my skin feel great. The BEST mineral sunscreen for dry skin
