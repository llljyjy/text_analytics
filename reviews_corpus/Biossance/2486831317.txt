This has a nice luxurious feel to it. It’s really moisturizing which is nice to use over a strong retinol that I’m using now. This isn’t hydrating to me. Those two aren’t the same. Why this is three stars: 1) I don’t think it’s worth its price and 2) the reason for this review, it smells like feet. Like funky af at first. Moisturizing but not hydrating
