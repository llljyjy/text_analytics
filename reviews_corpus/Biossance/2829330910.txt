I was sent this moisturizer to review, and these are my first impressions: nice scent, extremely hydrating, and a small white sheen that goes away very fast. Texture-wise, it is thicker than the moisturizers I am used to, but it felt rich and luxurious. It is likely that itâ€™s better for drier skins than mine, but it was a great moisturizer nonetheless. Nice moisturizer for drier skin
