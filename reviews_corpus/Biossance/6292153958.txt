I received this product complimentary via influenster in exchange for an honest review. Beyond the smell, I enjoyed this product. It says it’s fragrance free but it’s not. It’s very moisturizing, so much so I avoid my chin after the first use because I had a pimple the next day. Despite those things it makes my skin feel amazing and I’d probably recommend it. Not fragrance free
