I have been a huge fan of Biossance, love the eye gel and gel moisturizer, so I was very excited to try the Squalane + Omega Repair Cream. The texture is lovely, rich & creamy, glides on to the skin and absorbs nicely. Delivers deep hydration and minimized fine lines. I prefer it as my nighttime moisturizer, but it can be used in the day as well. I will definitely invest in this once I run out! nan
