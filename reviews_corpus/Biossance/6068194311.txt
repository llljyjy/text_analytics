I like that this cream is both vegan and fragrance free. I use this at night as part of my brightening routine. So after my acids to moisturize my skin. I was up with soft glowing skin. I received this for my review from Influenster. I had no idea it was coming but I was so excited. It came right on time because the vitamin c moisturizer I purchase for myself was breaking me out. I haven’t used it since receiving this. Purchase but be smart about it. You see it’s thick and creamy, maybe you shouldn’t use it under makeup. And if it’s too heavy for daytime, use it at night . Great night cream
