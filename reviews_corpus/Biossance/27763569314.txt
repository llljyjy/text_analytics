I really like this Biossance, Squalane + Copper Peptide Rapid Plumping Serum. It has a lightweight formula, adsorbs pretty quick into the skin and doesn’t leave the sticky feeling. This product is perfect to be used during the winter time, because it’s very hydrating. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin at all. I highly recommend this product. Great for winter!
