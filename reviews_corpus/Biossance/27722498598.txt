Iâ€™m still on the fence of whether I love this product or would do without... The cream is thick and definitely moisturizing, but it might be too thick. I do find that this is a bit greasy, however, it layers really well with other products. I find that I have to let the scream absorb for about a minute or two before I apply my SPF and any makeup products. I have been using for about 3 weeks, and it is winter, so I will wait to see if I see any major differences or if the season change affects my opinion. Right now, I would recommend to anyone with severe dryness or as a good cold weather protectant. Not sure about this one yet.
