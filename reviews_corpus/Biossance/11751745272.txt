I received this as a sample, it’s very moisturizing but I find it better to put a facial oil on top because it’s quite thick I use the good molecule squalane oil on top and it feels amazing so far no breakouts I wouldn’t buy the full size mainly because I’ve had better and cheaper and yes it smells really bad but if you can get pass the smell give it a try as a sample first Much better with a facial oil
