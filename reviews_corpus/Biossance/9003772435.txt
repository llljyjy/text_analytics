I really like Biossance as a brand since it’s actually EWG verified. I had such a great experience with the Biossance Squalane + Tea Tree Cleansing Gel, but I guess it’s been discontinued by Biossance, so I decided to give this a try. It’s a shame they discontinued the Tea Tree cleanser because this one missed the mark with me. I rarely break out with cleansers, but this cleanser managed to do just that. I found the scent pretty strong, which normally I can get over, but this one lingers on the skin for longer than I’d like. Personally I didn’t like the scent, however smell is super subjective, which is why I tend to gravitate towards fragrance-free products when it comes to my skincare. I have combo skin which leans on the sensitive side; I did find it was a little more drying that I am used to, but it didn’t leave that “squeaky“ clean feeling harsher cleansers can. Not a fan of the scent
