Better than Needle-less serum from DRMTLGY.  Yeah, I said it. The combo of squalane and copper plus the HA just does it for my skin. I’m on high percentage prescription Tretinoin and I use hydroquinone for melasma. Those ingredients are drying and can leave my skin flaky at times. This fixes all that and imparts a nice plumping glow  as with any HA product apply it to damp face so you don’t become dry and irritated. HA binds to other moisture as opposed to adding it  hydroquinone Better than other copper peptide products!
