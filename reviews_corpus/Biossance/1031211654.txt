Actually works. I tried the sample and liked it enough to buy the full size. I have tried tons of eye creams as I have circles, fine lines and bags. I am 49 year old. I have seen improvement in all of my concerns since trying this eye cream. Yay!My eyes are very sensitive and amazingly enough this cream does not bother them. Try i t- it works!
