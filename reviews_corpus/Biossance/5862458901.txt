Absolutely useless if you’re looking for hydration. Useless in all its other claims too. Not even sure why I bought it anymore. Didn’t help with dryness is any way, just burned and stung my face upon application. Then it did nothing! It’s probably only good for perfect skin with zero issues. Wish I had returned when I had the chance.
