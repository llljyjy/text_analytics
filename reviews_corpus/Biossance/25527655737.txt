This is not my first time using Biossance brand but it is my first time trying this cream. All I can say is WOW! This repair cream is so thick and moisturizing, my skin just drinks it up! It’s perfect to use as a night cream. My face seems so much more hydrated in the mornings. I’ve only been using this a little over a week but I’ve already seen some improvements. It’s best improvements are after 28 days, so I’m looking forward to seeing how it helps with a couple fine lines. So Hydrating!
