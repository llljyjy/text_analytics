I was worried when I first tried this product it would be too much oil for my skin. However, with the constant needs for masking during this pandemic, it has helped with the dryness in the mask area. A little goes a long way. Also, when using it, I have noticed how it can soften the hands after I have completed using on my face. Just massaging the hands together gas helped keep my hands from becoming dry during the winter months. highly recommend
