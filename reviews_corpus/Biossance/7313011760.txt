Absolutely love this! I have very sensitive lips and they are constantly peeling. I have used Jack Black, Laneige, Sunday Riley, etc, and this Biossance balm is the best so far. It doesn’t feel too thick/sticky. Makes my lips look plump. There’s not really any scent. The tube is also cute and aesthetic. Good for sensitive lips
