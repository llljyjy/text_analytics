Best sunscreen I’ve ever tried! Definitely leaves you glowy, but so thin and easy to apply compared to other mineral sunscreens. I have very fair skin so I’m not sure how the white cast would be if you have a deeper skin tone. It’s definitely expensive, but the quality is worth it to me. I wish this came in larger sizes! amazing for fair skin!
