This is a great spf. Itâ€™s lite, moisturizing and does not leave a white cast. Also no harsh spf smell. I also wear it under my foundation and it works great. It does not clog my pores as I struggle with milia. The only negative is the shine, it does leave your face pretty shinny if you wear it by itself. When I put my foundation over it fixes this problem. Great SPF
