All are great products! It’s hard to say which I love the most. I have noticed a huge difference in my complexion since starting the vitamin C rose oil; the eye cream is the only cream I’ve actually been able to wear day and night, under makeup even without any issues and without any eye irritation; the moisturizer is the most hydrating product I have ever used without getting breakouts. The only product I am still on the fence about is the lactic acid serum with my sensitive and acne-prone skin, but I plan to continue experimenting with it, as it does what it is supposed to; I’m just not sure it is the product for me. Overall, this kit is well worth the price; I highly recommend it. Highly recommend!
