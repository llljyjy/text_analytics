The rose oil is soooo hydrating and doesn’t make me break out. I wasn’t a face oil gal before but I’m sold. Similarly, I can’t get enough of the eye cream. So silky, goes on like a dream. I knocked off one star because the lactic acid refinement hurts my sensitive skin a little are the rich moisture cream smells so bad to me (it’s just my reaction to aqua lane). I did buy the full rose oil after though. Some new holy grails items, others not so much
