I received this product complementary from influenster and Biossance for my honest review. I recieved the Squalane copper peptide rapid plumping serum. You put this product on with a clean face. It instantly hydrates with Hyaluronic acid . After applying this serum you can continue with your normal skin care routine. It leaves your skin dewy and perky. This formula instantly creates visibly healthy and resilient skin. I would definitely recommend this product. Skin Goals
