This sunscreen feels lovely on the skin, it’s very hydrating and blends out pretty well. I am pretty pale and this leaves no white cast for me. My only issue is how greasy and shiny this is. It claims to be “non-greasy” but it’s very greasy and leaves my face looking very oily. I wouldn’t repurchase this personally. leaves skin looking very oily
