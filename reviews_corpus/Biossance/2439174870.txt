This is my favorite sunscreen and I have tried many! The sunscreens with chemicals irritate my skin. The mineral sunscreens that I have tried leave a white cast so noticeable. This sunscreen does not irritate my skin and itâ€™s only a slight white cast depending on how much I use and how well I rub it in. I use like a jelly bean sized amount. I have ordered twice already. The best thus far
