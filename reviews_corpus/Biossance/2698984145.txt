Let’s be honest - finding a good sunscreen is HARD WORK! Will it work under your makeup, is it too greasy, too difficult to rub in, are the SPF ingredients toxic to yourself or the environment? AGH. So many different considerations to make for a product you should wear (and reapply) each day. Well let me tell you, this one absorbs quickly, feels hydrating (hello - plant based squalane) and wears really nicely under makeup. Please do yourself a favor and pick this up if you’ve been on the fence! SPF Superstar
