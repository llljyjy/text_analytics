I received this free from Influenster and Biossance for my honest review. The texture is wonderful, creamy and thick without feeling heavy. It’s perfect for nighttime and also during the day when my skin needs extra hydration. My skin looks and feels much healthier and smooth. The one and only problem is the fragrance when I first am spreading it on. It has a hoppy/wheat smell which isn’t terrible but it also isn’t pleasant. That is the reason for taking off 1 star. This will not keep me from purchasing it in the future as the benefits far outshine the fragrance issue that goes away after literally a second. Love this cream! Excellent!
