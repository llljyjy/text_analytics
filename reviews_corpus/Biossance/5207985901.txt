I got this in my Trendmood box. I have very sensitive skin, and recently diagnosed with rosacea, so my hopes were not high for this moisturizer, since everything seems to irritate my skin now. I was very pleasantly surprised. This moisturized well and it did not cause my rosacea to flare at all. Iâ€™m very happy with it, and will repurchase for sure. nice surprise
