This is a very nice night time retinol & retinal serum. The squalene they use is sugarcane derived rather than from sharks, thus helping to save about 2 million sharks each year. Itâ€™s supposed to help with fine lines, wrinkles, blemishes, and dark spots... and I must say it has helped with my fine lines, wrinkles, and blemishes (no dark spots yet ðŸ¤ž). My only real issue was that it made my skin more sensitive, to the point that I couldnâ€™t apply my moisturizer after it without my face stinging a bit. The stinging feeling wouldnâ€™t last long, but it was uncomfortable in the moment. Glad it's only at night
