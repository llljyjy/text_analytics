I received this product for free by Influenster and Biossance in exchange for my honest review. Skincare products are usually my favorite products to receive for free from Influenster. This Plumping Serum from Biossance is something I have never used before, but I’m so happy that I got to try it. This Squalane and Copper Peptide Rapid Plumping Serum provides instant hydration with just a couple drops. Plus, as someone who has sensitive skin, I’m happy to say that this product worked with my skin. My skin is glowing and it is thanks to Biossance and this serum! Good stuff, worth a try!
