I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. The moisturizer has a slightly earthy scent that I don’t love, but once I got past it, the product is quite nice. I haven’t tried squalene as an ingredient before and my skin seems to like it! My face feels softer and more hydrated than before. I definitely needed to use morning and night in order to get the best results. nan
