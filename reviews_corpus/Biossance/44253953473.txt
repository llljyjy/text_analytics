I received this moisturizer to give my honest review of it. I have extremely dry skin (especially in the winter). I replaced both my morning and evening lotion for one month. I noticed a more even skin tone after my first 7 days. The rose smell is fragrant upon application but disappears quickly. The moisturizer itself is smooth, creamy and extremely hydrating. I will continue to use this product. Hydrating
