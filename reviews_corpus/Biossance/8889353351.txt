I suggest smelling this product before you decide to purchase. To me the smell is a dealbreaker. But if it is not for you then you may love this product! For me I feel that there are plenty of moisturizers out there that are thick and for dry skin that don’t smell, not necessarily have a good smell but are at least neutral. How I use this product. I use this moisturizer day and night. I apply after washing my face, toner, and a serum. Now when I apply this product I take in a deep breath, pat and it into my face, close the jar, step outside of the bathroom, breathe in, and the smell is mostly gone by this point.The benefits of this moisturizer are getting rid of my dry flaky skin, being really sensitive I’ve never had the this moisturizer sting my face even after skiing, and a calming effect of the skin.I won’t repurchase because of the smell. I will use the entire tub. if you can get oat the smell its good one
