I think this is a great product if you use heavy make up every day. It dissolves even waterproof make up which is great! But you still have to wash your face after, I like that my skin feels super soft and not greasy after I use it, but is one of those products that I liked but I’m not buying again, I’m using other eye make up remover and washing my face as I used to. Good product though. nan
