It was time for me to buy my third bottle of Biossance Squalane & Vitamin C Rose oil, instead I bought this and I’m so glad I did. Fine lines & wrinkles bother me now. Specifically the ones between my brows. This stuff has already reduced the lines within days. Seriously can hardly believe it. Been using it for about 12 days now.I do very simple skincare, I don’t wash my face every day, exception if I sweat or get dirty. I use this after washing my face and after it sinks in, I use a simple oat moisturizer (krave beauty). I think I have malassezia so I try to avoid ingredients that would make it worse & also avoid comedogenic ingredients. I look up ingredients on skincarisma dot com.So the before pic is the one in front of the bricks the after is the awkward closeup. Look between my brows and maybe my forehead?  There is a difference I stg. Amazing
