I got this product in a gift set and wanted to love it for the skin benefits but was just so turned off by the smell - it’s really off putting and granted you probably only smell it for about 5 seconds as you’re applying it but for that price I would expect a more luxurious or pampering experience - the texture of product is good but the smell makes it something I would not buy again - will stick to my Drunk Elephant Protini moisturizer Want to love but the smell!
