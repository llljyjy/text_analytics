absolutely love this! I’ve been using it every night and most mornings for about a month. I had a few dry patches when I started using it and now my skin looks so happy and beautiful. Combined with my other products my fine lines are reduced. it’s great. Reading other reviews, the scent is what bothers most.. while there is a slight scent, it doesn’t bother me. it’s not strong enough to be bothering, unless you are extra sensitive to scents. it isn’t added perfume, so that’s a plus. anyway, I love it. will buy again. thirsty skin, drink it up!
