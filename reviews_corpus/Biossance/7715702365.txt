I was iffy about trying a new moisturizer. I have very dry and sensitive skin, but historically, I’ve responded well to squalene, so I figured this was worth a try. I absolutely love this stuff! The texture melts into my skin, but doesn’t leave a thick residue. I use this both morning and night. Makeup doesn’t pill on it when I use it in the day. The scent isn’t the best, but I don’t care if it gives my skin the hydration it needs. No break out with this or patches of irritated skin! 10/10 for me. Will be repurchasing and adding it to my normal routine. nan
