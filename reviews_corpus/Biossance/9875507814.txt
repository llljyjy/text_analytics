I love everything about this product. The packaging first is super cute with the green and gold touches. The cream has a very minor odor which I appreciated so you didn’t have to get past a scent you weren’t a fan of. The cream is very thick but rubs in well, only need a little bit to cover . I liked the way my face felt even the next morning after sleeping overnight with it on. Love this cream
