I am pretty sure this is drying out my skin. Within a week I I became very flakey in spots where I had no trouble before and flakey in spots I have had trouble before. Too bad because I think it was helping my redness and hormonal acne. Most of Biosssnce products work great (as long as I gravitate to moisture and sensitive products). This is not one of them for me. Dried out instead of moisturize.
