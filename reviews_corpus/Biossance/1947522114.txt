While I appreciate all natural products for my skin, if the ingredients go bad quickly without preservatives, its time to reformulate.  This cream was in a starter set that a Sephora employee talked me into trying.  While the other products are ok, this one has a HORRIBLE odor...like dirty feet or something.  Iâ€™m not sure what I can do since it was a set. Yucky Smell
