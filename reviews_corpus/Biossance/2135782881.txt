I was very happy with the packaging when I received this product. It feels very luxe and heavy and looks nice on your counter top. I was worried about the scent before using the product as I had read some reviews that said it was unpleasant. Unfortunately my worries were confirmed, as it definitely has a weird smell to it. Iâ€™m also very sensitive to smells so that could just be me. The actual formula feels nice and thick. It definitely felt soothing on the skin. I wish I could get over the smell and continue using! nan
