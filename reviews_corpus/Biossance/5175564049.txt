I love this stuff. My skin is not extremely dry, but it is constantly dry. This moisturizer is really nice and thick but it soaks right in and doesn’t leave my skin feeling heavy or greasy. My skin feels so soft while using this and also a little bit plumper. I’m not sure about the claim of helping with fine lines, but my fine lines are not very pronounced, so I might not be the best judge of that. Overall I love this moisturizer and how it makes my skin feel. Soft skin
