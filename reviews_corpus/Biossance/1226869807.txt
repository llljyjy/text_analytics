This is easy rub in -- feels almost like a light moisturizer.  I have oily skin, so i do not like heavy moisturizers, and this feels fine (and is sufficient for me to use on its own to function as a moisturizer as well).  It doesn’t look very white on me (although I am light, so this may differ for darker complexions).  I think it’s doing at good job a protecting me too. Easy to Use/Feels nice
