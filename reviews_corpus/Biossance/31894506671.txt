I received the Biossance Squalane + Omega repair cream from Bioassance and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. It is a heavy duty cream that provides a lots of hydration but I prefer a cream that has more of a scent to it. I do like that this was non-comedogenic so itâ€™s great for acne prone or oily skin. It also helps to seal in the skins moisture barrier. nan
