I’ve been using for two months as my morning cleanser after the gym. I really enjoy it, as it gets the grime off my face and helps me feel clean. It foams nicely, and the dry parts of my face don’t feel stripped. The light scent is lovely! Overall, it does its job on the days I don’t need to fight a breakout with a medicated wash. a solid cleanser option
