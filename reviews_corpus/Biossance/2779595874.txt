I enjoy using this wash EXCEPT I feel like I have to pump mad times in order to get it nice & lathered up to where I feel like it’s actually cleansing my face. It’s so light and gentle I would recommend using it with a facial brush, foreo etc I use it with my foreo to help remove sunscreen and all of my products I had on throughout the day and it helps make my skin feel super clean without any dryness. Even without my foreo I just like to use it to ensure everything is removed. But yeah I actually kinda love it. You just have to use like 3 pumps lol Super nice GENTLE face wash
