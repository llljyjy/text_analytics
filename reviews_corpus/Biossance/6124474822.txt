I’ve tried the Biossance squalane oil and wasn’t very impressed, so I wasn’t sure what to expect with this moisturizer. I’m actually pleasantly surprised with the level of hydration it provides. I’ve been using it for about a week now and my skin feels supple and hydrated. My only complaint is that there is a very faint unpleasant smell when the product emulsifies in your hands as it absorbs on your face. I can’t describe it, but it’s very odd. Other than that, I’ve been enjoying it! Thanks, Influenster for providing this product complimentary to try! Pleasantly surprised
