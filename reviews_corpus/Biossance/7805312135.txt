This moisturizer is amazing. So hydrating and lasting. Not heavy but also not so light that it dissipates into nothing. There’s not much of s smell,which I prefer and enjoy. It’s honestly very affordable considering how long it lasts you and I love that it’s made with clean sustainability in mind. Highly recommend this one. Sooo good
