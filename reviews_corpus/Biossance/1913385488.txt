this is a pretty solid product, esp if you have acne prone skin. as with most retinol/retinoid products, it can be drying and not ideal for sensitive skin. this was less harsh for me, and I’m used to using tretinoin. that being said, if you have more severe acne, this won’t be as effective as what a dermatologist can prescribe you. also, as with most retinols/retinoids, this will make you more photosensitive. so definitely use SPF (which you should be using regardless). my skin also looks fresher, dewy, and is softer from using this. while it’s not magic in a bottle, it def has helped with giving me an even more youthful appearance. i do recommend using a good, fragrance-free moisturizer. my skin gets really red and dry with products like this. Solid product for the average person
