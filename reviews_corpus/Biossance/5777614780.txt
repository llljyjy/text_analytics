I have finally found my holy grail hydrating product!!! My skin has been dry for as long as I can remember and over the past two years I have added tretinoin into the mix, which has made it worse. The most recent hyaluronic acid I purchased was $83 for 1oz and it didnâ€™t help. I decided to give this a try (since I have liked their other products) and my skin has never been happier. I use this morning and night now. I use a hydrating mist, then apply this serum and lock it in with a moisturizer. My fine lines from my skin being dehydrated have started to disappear. My skin tone has even started to even and I have a lot less redness, to the point where I feel okay wearing tinted SPF and nothing else during the day. I will continue to purchase this product through and through to anyone who will listen!!! nan
