I absolutely loved the way this product felt on my skin and I could see a noticeable difference after 7 days of continuous use. The only problem I have with it is the smell. I know one of the product features is clean unscented beauty, but putting something on your face that smells like wet dog is a bit distracting from that key feature. It doesnâ€™t last, but it does have a strong initial scent. Feels great, smells terrible
