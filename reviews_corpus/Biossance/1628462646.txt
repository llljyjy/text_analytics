An incredible eye cream for my (extremely) sensitive eyes. I have eyelid dermatitis and if I’m not using this eye cream it’s redness, swelling, and overall unpleasantness where I can’t where sunscreen or makeup without making it worse. To the point I look like I’m having an allergic reaction and my eyes will swell shut. Biossance is a blessing! Will always be my go to for everything skincare. My holy grail eye cream
