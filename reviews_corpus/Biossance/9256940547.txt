Love the face oil as always.  The problem is with the lip balm.  There is nothing wrong with the formulation itself.  It is the plastic container because plastic flavour invades the lip balm.  I know specifically because I had a glass container of the lip balm that had no strange plastic flavour but worked beautifully.  Iâ€™ve since tried the plastic housed version twice and had the same situation occur both times. nan
