This serum works great for me! I have a combination to oily skin, which easily becomes dehydrated, especially during winter, when the weather is freezing and the heating is on. The formula is moderately thick and viscous, but it’s lightweight and very hydrating. The application is effortless. I love using the dropper applicator to measure the required amount of the product. As it glides smoothly on the skin, you do not need a lot of it. The serum is not sticky, nor greasy. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving a bit dewy finish. Yet, it doesn’t make the skin overly shiny. I use it after the toner and before the moisturizer. It doesn’t clash with any products. When my skin feels tight after the cleanser, the serum gives it instant relief. I’ve been using it for around three weeks now and I love the way my skin feels and looks as a result. It’s hydrated, plump and supple. The fine lines and wrinkles have become less visible and I haven’t noticed any flaking or dryness since I started to use it.I also love that the ingredients are clean and pretty natural. It hasn’t caused irritation or allergic reaction. Also, it doesn’t have a strong scent. The packaging is nice too. It’s convenient and eye-pleasing. Besides, it’s recyclable, which is important to me. To sum up, I find this serum amazing, as it is effective and lives up to its name. And I’m really happy that I had a chance to try it out. It’s now an integral part of my skincare routine. Love it to the drop!
