I wish I’d come across this cleanser sooner than I did!  I have very red, reactive, combination skin, and when it’s in flux, it can really overproduce oil.  This cleanser has helped balance my skin nicely.  A little goes a long way, and it rinses easily, leaving my skin feeling perfectly balanced and soft.  I’ve also been using it as a cleanser for my chest and arms, because of how well it works and how soft my skin feels after using it.  I’m definitely going to purchase this again. A Truly Gentle Foaming Cleanser!
