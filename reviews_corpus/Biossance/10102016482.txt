I have combo oily skin and this moisturizer works really well with my skin it is a bit thick so I opt to use it as a night cream and I absolutely love it I don’t get too oily throughout the night so I wake up feeling balanced and moisturized I love the ingredients and how it’s a clean product definitely recommend Great
