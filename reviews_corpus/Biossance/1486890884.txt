I’m obsessed with this toner!! I have slightly oily skin and I am prone to blackheads. I’ve found that a lot of exfoliating toners burn a bit, but this doesn’t at all! It’s so gentle yet effective! It’s gentle enough to use every night. It’s also moisturizing because of the squalane. Some nights when I’m lazy i just wash my face then just use this toner, and my skin looks great in the morning. holy grail
