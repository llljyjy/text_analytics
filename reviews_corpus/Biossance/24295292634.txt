I was looking for something similar to The Ordinary 100% squalene that was less heavy and more lotion-like and this came into my life! I have been happy with it so far, however it has an off-putting odor that is hard to describe (and I am not very sensitive to smells), so that has caused me to only reach for it every few days. nan
