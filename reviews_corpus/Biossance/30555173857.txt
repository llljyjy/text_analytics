I have extremely dry, acne prone skin. My skin is also very sensitive to new products, but this product didn’t cause any type of negative reaction. Yay! It was a little heavier on my face than I would have liked, but if you use it as an overnight masque, it’s not bad. Moisturized my skin & I felt great the next day! nan
