Is this set hydrating? Yes. Does it do anything else? No. To top it off, my husband said my side of the bed smelled like a towel that had been used too long- that smell of mold or mildew. When he got really close to me, he said, oh that’s your face that smells like that. Sorry- wouldn’t care if this product did everything it says….if my husband tells me my face smells like a moldy towel, I’m not using the product. The only part of this set that doesn’t smell horrible is the pink serum. The actual lotion- wow. I’d avoid this unless you a) don’t care about real results or are only looking for hydration, or b) don’t care about the nasty, nasty smell. Look anywhere else
