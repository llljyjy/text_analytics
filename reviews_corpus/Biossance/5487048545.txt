This is a nice moisturizer it’s not my all time favorite but it is nice. I use mostly at night. My biggest complaint is the scent. I’m not a huge fan of it. It’s not strong but it’s not my favorite however this product does what it claims so if your in the market for something new I would give this a try nan
