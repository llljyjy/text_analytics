I love this cream! I don’t notice the scent that everyone else is saying… it does have some sort of a scent but not in a way that’s overpowering or off putting in my opinion. I only use this cream at night as it’s a little too heavy for me in the morning with the make up I like to wear but it puts the moisture right back into my skin on these dry winter nights! I wake up with soft skin and no dry patches. Will be buying again :) great night time moisturizer
