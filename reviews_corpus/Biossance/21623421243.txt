This is a wonderful moisturizer for dry skin! It actually makes my skin feel hydrated. It has a nice thick consistency and the packaging is appealing. However, the scent is very bad (almost rotten smelling). The smell is not noticeable as soon as it is rubbed in. I also noticed more breakouts after beginning this. nan
