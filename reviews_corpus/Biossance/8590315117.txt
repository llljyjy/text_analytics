Really love this repair moisturizer. Since it’s the summer time I only use it at night to hydrating and lock in moisture. I have notice my skin is very plumped the next day. Maybe in the winter time I’ll try using this under my make-up during the day. I have combination skin type and I like it a lot! nan
