I was lucky enough to recieve this for free from influenster. So far I like it and it has worked great with my skin which can be a gamble sometimes. My skin is combination and likes to breakout especially if it’s that “hormonal“ time of the month. I get really oily on my nose and chin area and dry patches everywhere else but this stuff has really came through. I am constantly having to either use face wipes or wash my face the second i get home to get makeup off so i dont break out cause if you live in the florida humidity like I do you can just look outside and start to sweat, this has helped alot keeping my skin moisturized and not all rough and dry feeling, only thing I can complain about is the smell which has a very “natural“ smell to it if you know what I mean. But if you can get past that this stuff is golden. May smell funky but is pretty awesome!
