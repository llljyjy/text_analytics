Keeping up with my skincare routine is always a priority and as I get older, I’ve been using more products to start targeting fine lines. I have recently incorporated the Squalane + Retinol Night Serum, which I received complimentary, into my nighttime routine. This vegan, cruelty-free & non-toxic serum features hydrating squalane along with a blend of retinol & retinal to improve the appearance of fine lines & boost radiance. I have sensitive skin and this is not irritating on my skin. I love that it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth, it is not drying or tight feeling. I apply it at night after cleansing and before applying moisturizer. It’s a high-quality product with good-for-skin ingredients & is definitely a good retinol product to add to your skincare routine! Quality, clean ingredients!
