I received complimentary from Biossance! The Lactic Acid Night Resurfacing Serum is white lotion texture! I can feel my skin is soft touching after applying! This serum can use at the night time routine only! The eye cream is peach color! The Omega Repair Cream base on the ingredients has Squalane, I can feel my skin is very moisturizing, hydrating! Very good for the winter season use! I like the face oil, the bottle is pick so pretty, it has a little bit rose smell, So comforting! So sweet! It is not greasy! I apply it at the last step of my skin care routine! For brighten I believe that it will be better if I continue to use it for a long term! Great travel set
