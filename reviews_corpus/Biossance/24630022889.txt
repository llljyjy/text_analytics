I am very happy with this product. I received this product complimentary of Influenster and was super excited. The product is full size and bigger than other moisturizers. I love the ingredients and that it’s vegan, cruelty free and non toxic. It feels really good on my skin, it absorbs well and leaves me feeling super soft. A little bit of a weird smell but I don’t mind at all. I definitely recommend and will be trying more products from this brand! Very satisfied. Love
