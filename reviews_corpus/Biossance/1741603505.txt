I received this as a sample from my points. I honestly think it has made a difference in the dark circles I have and fine lines, my under eyes look smoother and lighter. I use this at night only since I don’t think it would work well with my makeup during the day just because it moves around a lot. I’m going to buy the full size once I finish this sample. nan
