A really good moisturizer for me. I’m combination, but struggle with the dryer parts of my face. Not really prone to acne as much, but I think on skin barrier level or perspective, this may be good for any skin type. I use it as a final step to my regimen, after my chemical spf (daytime) or any acid treatment I use (nighttime). It’s pairs so well with most of my skin treatments (serums, etc). Smells funny upon applying but goes away pretty quick too. Good product! Loving it!
