This is a nice moisturizer and does a really good job of hydrating but it also felt a little heavy and it may have been better for them to introduce this in the winter months instead. I’m only using it at night as well because it does tend to feel a little oily. Other than that it’s a nice product for chronic dry skin. I received this product complimentary from Influenster in order to write an honest review. nan
