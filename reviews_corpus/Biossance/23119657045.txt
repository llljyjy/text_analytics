I love this moisturizer. My skin is combination but I love the dewy finish. It also seats well under my supergoop glow spf, which is my go to for everything. Usually other moisturizers make it peel off. This is my second bottle. You donâ€™t need too much of the product, especially if you are using it under dump skin. It lasts long and I use a small spatula to apply it to my face. Also used during the night as a heavier part of my skincare, but changed for the morning. loooovee it
