I was looking for a product with squalane, I’m really happy about it! The moisture is very easy and nice to apply, it is a gel kind of moisture which is fresh and leaves no fat or oily/shiny glow on the skin. It penetrates quickly and is pleasant, so it’s easy to put other products or makeup after it. It is also very effective, I noticed a difference right in the following morning, after having applied it before going to bed and slept. My skin, which is usually always a bit red on the cheeks, was more uniformed and less reddish than usual. The first time I put this on, I immediately noticed my skin was glowing. Love this! Love it
