I reveived this item free from influenster for an honest review. Any time I test out skincare products I’m very judgmental because I know what I like and what works and switching from that is a big deal. This has minimal smell to it. My first impression when using this was that it was going to make my skin very greasy. It goes on very thick and a little goes a long way. It sits on my skin heavy. But, after time, it dries down and feels light and leaves your skin soft. You really do need to give this time to work the way it needs to. I don’t think I would make this a permanent part of my skincare routine, however it’s nice to know I have a reliable backup option when needed. Use it a while before making an assessment
