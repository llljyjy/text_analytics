Very thick texture but immediately melts like butter and absorbs nicely into skin. Smells like a loaf of bread, not a great smell but not an unpleasant one either. I have combination skin with oily T zone and this worked great with my skin. It hydrated my dry areas and balanced my T zone. I received this product for Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I highly recommend for combination skin types and if you donâ€™t mind the smell of bread Melts like butter, smells like bread
