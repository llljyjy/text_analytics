Iâ€™m in my thirties and have tried numerous eye creams to fix my issue of having dry under eyes, really showed with makeup, but when putting the smallest dab of eye cream on it caused milia the very next morning. This eye gel is a life saver and works amazingly under makeup. Dries almost instantly. Love love love it. Life saver for milia issues under your eyes!
