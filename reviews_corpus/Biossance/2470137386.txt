This cream is amazing. I’ve had two samples and finally bought the big boy but omg what is up with this smell? It literally smells like someone walked around in slip on vans all summer without socks. It’s so stinky but I use it because it works so so so well for my super dry skin. Bummer the smell makes it so icky. why does it smell like sweaty feet?
