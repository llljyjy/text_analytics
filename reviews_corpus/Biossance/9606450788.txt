I’m giving this two stars because it’s reef safe. If it wasn’t I’d put it at a one. This sunscreen doesn’t absorb well and sits on the skin to sweat off later… (children scream in unison “ewwwww”) For me that is a deal breaker. I wanted to like this but I guess that’s how the cookie crumbles… It’s a No For Me :/
