I was so excited to get to try this complimentary but was disappointed, I thought this was unscented but just opening the top and it smells horrible. I thought maybe it was the package but then tried it on my skin and had to immediately wash it off.The packaging is super cute though and love a vegan product. Just not for me this time. Terrible Smell
