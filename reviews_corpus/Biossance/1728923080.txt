Just purchased and used a couple days now and so far it’s very luxurious feeling. Really loving it. Many e owes say it smells, I don’t think this has a scent at all, which I prefer in skincare. Very neutral scent if at all. Sounds like maybe there was a bad batch that went out or something luxurious, very moisturizing
