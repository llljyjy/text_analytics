I seriously donâ€™t even know where to begin! this has exceeded all expectations I had for it! I love the rose oil for its light but super rich properties and somehow this cream has topped that!! It is surprisingly lightweight on the skin but still so rich and moisturizing! It is the softest cream and makes my skin silky smooth and oh so glowing without making me look oily! I am literally OBSESSED!! It smells like the softest smell of rose mixed with their omega repair cream, not overpowering at all and super subtle! Also 3 little finger dabs covers my whole face so a little goes a long way! This is sooo worth every penny! I will definitely buy it after I run out! Exceeded my expectations!
