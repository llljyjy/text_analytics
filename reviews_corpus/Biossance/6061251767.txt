I was excited about this but honestly didnt see much of a difference. The serum itself was okay, a little bit sticky but lightweight. I used it for a couple of weeks and really didnt notice any difference in my skin as far as plumping. It didnt feel like it did much of anything for me, i wouldnt say it was very hydrating either. Iâ€™m going to continue to use it for a couple more weeks and hopefully I see some changes. Nothing special
