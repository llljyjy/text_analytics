I received this complimentary from influencer for review purposes.  I really like this moisturizer. It’s great for my dry sensitive skin. No break outs or irritation. The only thing I didn’t love was the scent. It’s not fragranced but it has kind of a vitamin smell, but it doesn’t linger so it’s not a big deal. Great for dry skin.
