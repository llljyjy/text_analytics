This was sent to me from Biossance and Influenster for my honest review. Overall, the consistency of this product is really nice. It’s light cream that gets into (very slightly) oily consistency as you rub it in. It sinks in pretty quickly. Originally, I was using it 2-3 times a week, over a moisturizer, but now I use it every other day under my moisturizer. The first 3 weeks or so, I did experience some peeling, which is normal since I hadn’t been using a retinol prior to using this product. I’ve been using this since mid-to-late Aug, and in all honestly, wasn’t very consistent through September. I can’t say I’ve seen any significant improvements but I think my fine lines have been getting softer. The packaging is somewhat unwieldy. The pump sometimes will give a nice pea sized amount, and other times it spits kinds of everywhere. Not sure if mine is defected, or if it’s a thing. I’d say this is a good starter retinol for newbies like myself. Good starter retinol
