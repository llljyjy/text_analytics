I received this for free and didn’t know what to expect at first. After using this for several weeks, I can confidently say I love this! The applicator is easy and clean, and the serum absorbs into your skin almost immediately without that greasy feeling. It’s kept me super hydrated this winter and my skin seems to love this. Definitely worth looking into if you need a hydrating and plumping serum. Pleasantly surprised
