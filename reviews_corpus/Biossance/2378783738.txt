I was given this complimentary for my opinion from influenster. It’s a thick and creamy formula which is great for when your skin is dry especially during winter weather. I like to use at night so it has time to soak in since it is on the thicker side and helps feel hydrated and refreshed in the morning. Love the fact that the box is made out of sugarcane which is very innovative and great for the environment. Works well on sensitive skin since it’s very natural not my favorite but is still a pretty good product! nan
