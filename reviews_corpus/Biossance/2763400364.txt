I have been using this moisturizer, along with a whole Biossance regime twice a day, since October 2021 (so its been 6 months!) and I absolutely love it. I have combo/oily skin and it isnâ€™t too heavy for me at all. Feels lovely under makeup. Any redness from healing blemishes are basically gone. I also do a microdermabrasion treatment at home once a week and it really calms things down after. I love this brand! Worked great for me!
