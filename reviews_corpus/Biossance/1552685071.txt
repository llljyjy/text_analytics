I love skincare companies that really research high performance clean ingredients. Previously I didn’t care what I put on my skin but these days I have educated myself.  Biossance has been recommended regularly during my research on products. Biossance Squalane + Omega Repair Cream has important omega fatty acids that fortify, restore and plump the skin. In addition to skin identifying ingredients that are found naturally in our skin dermis. This moisturizer has a whipped texture that glides on very easily. This will be good for all skin types; especially oily. No heavy residue feeling on my skin after using, and it didn’t irritate or break me out. Unfortunately; I suffer from hormonal breakouts but this actually calmed my skin down and imitated the healing process. Definitely recommend 100% High performance & clean
