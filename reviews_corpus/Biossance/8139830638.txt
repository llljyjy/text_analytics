I bought this oil because I had been using The Ordinary’s Rose Hip Oil and was recommended this one as a “better version” if you will. I must say this product is beautiful. I apply three drops at night and the next morning my skin is so bouncy and hydrated. I have even noticed that if I do end up skipping it, the colour of my face is not as bright and uniform, so it even does that too. Again comparing it to the ordinary, this oil is much more soft, easy to spread about the face and is nowhere near as greasy. Smells great, not too much fragrance. A bit pricey, definitely bought the mini before going for the full size. Great Replacement
