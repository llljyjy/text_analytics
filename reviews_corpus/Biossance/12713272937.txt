The first thing you notice is the packaging. The box is carefully and uniquely crafted. You feel like you’re opening up a present. The container is also very heavy duty and you feel the quality. The moisturizer is rich and not too heavy when applied. You don’t need a lot but I find myself wanting to use more than I probably should. Leaves my skin very hydrated. Luxurious
