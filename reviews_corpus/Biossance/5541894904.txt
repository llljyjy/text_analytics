I love a deeply hydrating cream for night time, year round and I found this a nice addition to my routine. It’s thick and nourishing without feeling heavy or sticky. I also found it to absorb easily. It seems to play well with my other skincare as well. When I wake up my skin is plump and hydrated. I don’t notice any real scent and it has been gentle on my sensitive skin. If you are oily this might be too much for you, or only for winter. soft supple skin
