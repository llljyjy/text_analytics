I received this product as a free sample. I donâ€™t love the smell but I love the moisture it gives my skin. Since moving from NYC to FL I noticed that when I wash my face, my skin gets very dry. My neighbor said it could have something to do with the higher levels of calcium in the water. But this ruins the way my skin feels. Once I tried this I noticed a huge difference. My skin stays hydrated and happy for longer. The smell is meh but thankfully it doest linger. Once the moisturizer melts into my skin, I feel sooo much better. I recommend trying. I just wish it smelled nicer Dry skin?
