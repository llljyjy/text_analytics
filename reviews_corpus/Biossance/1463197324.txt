I received this via Influenster and let me tell you, I am glad I did. I’ve been using it every other night as part of my night time routine. The squalane makes my skin feel hydrated and nourished. The copper peptide has really provided a noticeable plump and bounce to my skin. I’ve also used this as a day time serum with my moisturizer and it’s light enough to wear under makeup.  I’m still on the fence as if I’d repurchase, and this is solely on the fact that I like a couple things more. I’d definitely recommend to a friend. nan
