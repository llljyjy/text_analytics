I received this product for free from Influenster to try in exchange for an honest review. I love Biossance, so I was super excited to try this out. I’ve been using it for a few weeks and have noticed my skin feeling a lot more hydrated. I have combination dry and oily skin, this time of year I was a little bit on the drier side and this helped me tremendously! This moisturizer feels lightweight and doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy, even under makeup. I also like that it doesn’t fragrance. I love this brand for what they stand for and this is a really great moisturizer. I definitely recommend it for anyone looking to try a new moisturizer. my skin feels great!!
