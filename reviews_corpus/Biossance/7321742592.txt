I’m in my mid-thirties so my skin is starting to dry out, I’v had very oily skin in the past, but this does a wonderful job of hydrating my skin! It’s a little  heavier of a cream so it’s great for dry skin. It doesn’t feel too greasy and absorbs nicely. I do have mild acne and  and blackhead but this this doesn’t make it worse at all.  The only problem is there is a pungent smell when you first put it on. It dissipates almost right away after application but is still is off putting. I did receive this free from for testing purposes but all opinions are my own. Great moisturizer!
