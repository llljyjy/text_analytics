It’s not too bad. Made me break out a bit about 3 days after using it so I’m hoping it doesn’t keep doing that.. it did hydrate my skin a bit but I’m not 100% sure on full effects of the product since I’ve only been using it for a week and a half so far. My skin is pretty sensitive so I was expecting some breakouts just sucks it actually happened. It’s okay
