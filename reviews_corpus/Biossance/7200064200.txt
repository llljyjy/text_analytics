I received the products for free from Influenster, Moroccanoil, and Biossance.I received a 50 mL jar to sample for my honest opinion. The texture is thick but soaks in quickly and left my skin feeling moisturized all night/day (I use it every morning and night). I’m not sure on the long term use, as I’ve only had it for a week but my husband said my face feels softer to him already. My only complaint is, I don’t like the smell but it absorbs quickly and then I add my daily products over it so it’s only really an issue for a few minutes. Will be buying once I run out of this jar! Highly recommend
