The package if made of glass, it feels luxurious and elegant.The cream is white, it has a rich consistency. It is very hydrating. If this will not hydrate your skin, I donâ€™t know what will. It does take some time to absorb into the skin and leaves the skin supple and smooth. It has no fragrance, just a natural smell. Overall a great moisturizer for dry, mature or normal skin. Great for dry skin
