This moisturizer is amazing!! I have pretty sensitive skin since I’m currently using topicals for my acne. This cream is nice and slightly thick, and feels very milky over the skin. When I wake up in the morning, my face always feels very soft, supple, and moisturized. My only con with this cream is the smell--it has quite a strong “musty“ smell which kind of makes the experience a but unpleasant. However, the smell does eventually die off. Overall, a wonderful cream that hydrates the skin!! nan
