I was a little skeptical of this one, but I’m honestly not sure why. This is a RICH face cream that helps my skin feel moisturized, plump and renewed. I’m always struggling to find products when I’m pregnant that are safe and effective but this one is it. I love it and undoubtedly will finish the whole jar. It does have a “natural, herbal” type fragrance - I do enjoy but I know some people are more sensitive. We love effective, pregnancy safe skincare
