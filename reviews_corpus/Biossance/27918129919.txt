I’m on my 3rd or 4th jar of this. I have combo oily skin and redness I can’t speak as to if this has helped acne I’m in my early 30s and don’t get much acne anymore and I use this in conjunction with the ordinary hyaluronic acid, drunk elephants b hyrda, and yttp cactus serum and the fresh rose toner...def not in the order I just mentioned I do my ordinary drunk elephant yttp concoction after toner and wait a couple minutes for it to sink in (I live in a dry climate rn aput 3600ft above sea level) and then put this moisturizer on and my face loves it. highly recommend this to fellow combo oily people and people with redness combo oily and redness will love this
