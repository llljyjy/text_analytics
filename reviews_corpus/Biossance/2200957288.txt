This serum is like no other I’ve tried. I love the texture as it’s not too thick nor too thin and blends seamlessly into the skin. I know this serum is geared towards someone with loss of firmness. Being that I’m in my 20’s, I don’t struggle with that as of yet, but I will say it is amazing for hydrating your skin, which in turn will improve the appearance of skin with a loss of firmness. I can definitely see the plumping effect that you get with this serum, so overall I love the texture and skin feel. I think it’s worth it! nan
