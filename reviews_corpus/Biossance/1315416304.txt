In the store I explained that I have a tendency to perspire a lot on my face. I was told that this was light and fast-absorbing, and it seemed so on my hand.  However after applying to freshly washed skin and walking my dog in NY in about 85 degrees and low humidity, I found it did not absorb much at all.  It seemed to linger on skin surface, and remained sticky to the touch.  I could not wait to get home and wash it off.  I tried once more at about 78 with more humidity and the result was similar.  It seems to block all pores for zero “breathing.“  I like the benefits of squalene but I’ll get skin care elsewhere.  So as not to waste, I’m using this on arms and shoulders but not face.  Also, I know scent is subjective but this has an odd scent - reminds me a bit of modeling clay - which bothers me on my face as well. Unless you’re one of the lucky ones with a non-sweaty face, I would avoid this. Doesn't seem to absorb - sticky face.
