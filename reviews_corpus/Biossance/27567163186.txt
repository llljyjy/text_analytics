Okay so the name “Jelly Cleanser” is a little confusing, I have to admit. It’s not a gel cleanser, it’s a true jelly. But if you use it as directed, it really does remove most of your makeup and leaves your skin nice and soft. I love this as my first cleanse, my skin feels amazing after using i! Doesn’t make you feel like your skin is too tight or stripped. Will definitely be repurchasing! Love it!
