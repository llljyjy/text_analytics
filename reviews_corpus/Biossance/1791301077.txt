This brand & their products sounded right up my alley. My skin loves squalene & their line is supposed to be super hydrating. This was the exact opposite in my experience. This dried my skin out terribly, uncomfortably so. Obviously this didn’t work for me, but we’re all different. I’m sure some will enjoy it. Glad I tried this set to know this line just isn’t for me. Not Hydrating In My Opinion
