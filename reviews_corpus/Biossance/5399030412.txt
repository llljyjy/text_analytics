I revived this product for testing purposes by influenster. Genuinely surprised by this product. I have extremely sensitive acne prone skin so I’m always very afraid of trying new products because I’ll either have some kind of reaction or it will make me break out like crazy. This product however has done neither of these things and my skin is no longer dry as the Sahara. I will absolutely continue using this product. I definitely recommend to people who otherwise have major sensitivities because this product has been life changing for me. nan
