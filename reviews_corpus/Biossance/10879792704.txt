the cream has a super buttery, but at the same time lightweight texture. I would suggest this cream to dry, combo & normal skin types. The formula of the cream is so satisfying that its so easy to apply more than the required amount of a moisturizer. The cream doesn’t have a scent at all. it also comes in a quite heavy glass jar. it doesn’t come with a spatula, but there is a plastic protective cover under the cap. it contains my favourite skin barrier protective ingredients like squalene, shea butter and ceramide np. This cream can definitely suffice alone without other skincare products. there might be a slight greasiness due to shea butter content in the cream Lightweight & nourishing
