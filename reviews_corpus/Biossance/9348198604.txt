So when I got this moisturizer I didn’t really expect anything since I thought it will just be another moisturizer that will not work on my acne prone skin since it might be too thick and oily for me. But to my surprise it’s the best moisturizer that  I didn’t know I need! And I am so thankful to have found it. It works great, I can see the difference overnight and it didn’t break my skin out! Also I have a sensitive skin that I developed after giving birth so I am really careful of what I  putting on my skin. This is great and I don’t think I can live without it. It also doesn’t have fragrance so it’s a plus. I love it and recommend it to everyone to give it a try please! The best of the best
