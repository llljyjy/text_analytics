Love how lightweight this serum is! It sinks in easily and quickly on my dry and dehydrated skin and provides a nice extra boost of moisture through the dry winter months. My skin has been sensitive lately and this helped out along with making my complexion feel soft and bouncy. I didnâ€™t see big effects on fine lines but overall a nice serum Pretty good!
