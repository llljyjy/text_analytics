Preface, I was sent this bottle to try and review!I’ve been using this serum for about a month now after washing ny face at night. It goes on after my toner but before my second serum and moisturizer. Honestly, I’m not sure how much plumping occurs. However, this serum is hydrating!! I have naturally dry skin and I like in an arid area. It also smells really nice. Overall, I’d say get it if you can afford it and want hydration. nan
