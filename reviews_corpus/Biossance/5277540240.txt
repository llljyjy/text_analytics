I really liked this moisturizer. I haven’t been using it that long to notice a huge difference but I can tell that overall the texture of my skin feels better. I like that it doesn’t really have a scent to it. It absorbs quickly and I haven’t noticed that it leaves behind any residue. I will definitely continue to use it. I wish it wasn’t so expensive but if it continues to improve my skin I wouldn’t mind splurging on it. Great moisturizer
