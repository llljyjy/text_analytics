This Squalane + Omega Repair Cream is a simple and no frills moisturizer. It is not scented/ fragranced, but rather  just smells like like the “natural” ingredients. This moisturizer deeply moisturizes my skin. I love the key ingredients of squalane, fatty acids and ceramides to deeply moisturize, and protect  and maintain a healthy skin barrier. I use this at night and always wake up to such soft and radiant skin! nan
