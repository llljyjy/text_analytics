I have been using this for some weeks now and I love this moisturizer.  I have combination skin and this moisturizes my dry areas without making my skin oily.  I love that it helps with fine lines and wrinkles.  My only issue is the smell.  It doesn’t have a fragrance but I feel like I could be smelling the squalene, just not a nice scent.  It’s not strong and only lasts about 5 min or less after applying. Moisturizing
