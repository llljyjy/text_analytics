My skin is improving. Finally. When I first started this product I was a tad bit worried because omg my skin was going through it. It was dry and flaking and looking rough but it has gotten better. My hyperpigmentation has started to get lighter and my skin texture has improved. I have only used this serum for a month so I can only imagine whatâ€™s to come. Say What Now!!!
