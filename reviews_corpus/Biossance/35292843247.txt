I usually like Biossance products, but not a fan of this one. The texture of the balm is very thick cream, it feels good right after we apply it on lips. But I did not find it hydrating, it doesnâ€™tsink in. It smells good but I feel that this is very much similar to a chapstick. feels good as soon as we apply but goes away in next few minutes. Okay okay
