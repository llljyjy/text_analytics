The smell..... is not it. To be fair if you’re like me and have a giant jar that you’re using to not let it go to waste you do kind of get used to it over time, but it’s not something I would ever want to spend money on again. I mean maaaaaayyybe if it had amazing results I could get past it, but it’s just so... average. I’ve bought drugstore products for cheaper that are better. nan
