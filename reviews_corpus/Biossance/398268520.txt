After having a horrible experience with another popular “hydrating“ moisturizer, I’ve come back to this amazing moisturizer.  The smell can be off putting but I rather smell this than the overly fragranced one that broke me out in a few place twice and my face felt dehydrated and tight.  This moisture keeps my skin hydrated through a windy winter and drying heat. Its worth every penny. nan
