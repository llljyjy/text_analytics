I grew up with using Vaseline my whole life , then moved into lip smacker then Blistex . All of these were just okay, it just glazed over my lip not breaking down the chap flaky bits. Plus I kept having to reapply through out the day. Then My 30’s hit and my lips just became even more dry. If you have extreme dry lips. Give this try because it soothes , deeply moisturize and hydrates your lips. It does have a bit of shine. I only have 2 favourite lip balms and this is one of them. I did a video on it if you wanna learn more Melly BE YouTube Have a great day ! I’m living that chap lip free life!
