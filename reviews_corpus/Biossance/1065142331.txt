I have actually had this product for a couple of months and had been using it prior to being sent one to try in exchange for a review. Thrilled to get an extra jar as I love this stuff and my skin loves it.  It is always very sensitive and red and this cream calms it down and helps a lot when I use actives.  It does stay a little heavy, so not great for day but a good night cream. Appreciate no fragrance. Would absolutely rebuy. Comparing it to a similar purpose $200+  cream I recently tried, I would repurchase this over that one. Does just as much without the price tag shock. Great repair cream! Great soothing night cream! Love it!
