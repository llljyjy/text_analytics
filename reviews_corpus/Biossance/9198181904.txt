Absolutely love the Biossance brand and this serum. It is nothing short of amazing. It is a very clean formula, feathery and light weight texture. It’s excellent for all skin types and I have combination skin. I’ve noticed a significant difference in my skin using this copper peptide serum. I only use it at night. In the morning my face always seems much softer, even toned and skin feels smooth. I will be purchasing another bottle soon as my first one was sent complimentary in a voxbox. Significant difference felt right away
