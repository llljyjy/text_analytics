This is a richand decadent moisturizing repair cream with all the good fats (lipids) your skin needs to deeply moisturize without leaving a greasy after feel. This moisturizing face repair cream is formulated with lipids that mimic and support skin’s natural moisture barrier which include squalane, omega fatty acids, ceramides and plant sterols which help nourish, plump, hydrate and feed your skin. I have combination skin and this worked great as my nighttime moisturizer, as I like to apply more of a rich cream at night. It leaves my skin super hydrated and plump the next morning. What I really like is that there isn’t any synthetic fragrance or essential oils that are added, so it is completely fragrance free, but the ingredients themselves do emit a mild scent that should dissipate a minute or two after application. Sometimes my skin can tend to be a little sensitive and I didn’t have any issues with this. I’m loving the Biossance line so far and will definitely be trying out more of their products in the future. Love This Company!
