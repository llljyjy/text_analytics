I’m very happy with the hydration this provides my skin. It has a bit of an odd scent that’s not great but the moisturizer itself feels really good. I like the thickness and consistency. Not a lot is needed to achieve moisturized skin. Overall, I’m very happy with it and I would recommend it to others. Great Feel
