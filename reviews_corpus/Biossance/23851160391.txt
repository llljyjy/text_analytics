This is a beautiful nighttime moisturizer for me. Itâ€™s too heavy for my combo/oily skin during the day but I enjoy using it at night, and will likely enjoy it more again in the fall. I think someone with dry skin would probably enjoy this during the day as well. Nighttime moisturizer for combo skin
