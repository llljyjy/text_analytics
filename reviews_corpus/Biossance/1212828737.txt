I have incorporated this retinol into my routine and I am impressed. I started out slowly by using a couple times a week and really notice the changes in a short period of time. It hasn’t caused any redness or flaking so I would highly recommend to people with sensitive skin. This retinol is nice and I enjoy its not strongly scented. I really dig the companies values with creating their products without harming animals etc. They have a great variety of products that I’d like to try more in the future. nan
