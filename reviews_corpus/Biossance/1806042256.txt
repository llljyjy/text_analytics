Recommended by friends and pushed by Sephora staff - had to finally try but it’s super disappointing. Bought it bc I have pretty red skin due to dryness and break down of my skin barrier due to city living, not rosacea. This did not reduce the redness and is not hydrating enough for me at all. Waste of money. not hydrating and didn’t reduce my redness
