Ok, this makes my face feel so hydrated! The texture is phenomenal! I will say there is a slight scent that is slightly off putting but it goes away quickly. It’s definitely one of my favorite moisturizers and I plan on buying another when I run out! It’s hard to explain but my face will feel dry & kind of tight & after using this my skin soaks it up and my face feels refreshed, soft and I enjoy using it! If your skin needs a little refresher give this a try! My new favorite moisturizer
