I’m actually so shocked at how much of an improvement this product has made on my skin. Only downside is it does smell like collagen powder but it’s a very mild scent, not bad at all. Actually makes me  feel more confident about the clean ingredients going into it. It calms any redness in my skin, feels so good going on and I woke up after ONE NIGHT of using it with noticeably softer skin. It has become a staple in my routine. Perfect for summer nights after spending all day in the sun. I have found it to be non-comedogenic  and a few times even layered a retinol over it. Try this!!!!
