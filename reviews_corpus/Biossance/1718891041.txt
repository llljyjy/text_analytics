A little does go a long way with this one. I can see this being my new moisturizer for the winter months! I’ve also starting using lactic acid in my skincare routine that gives me slight tingly feelings which I find a bit irritating but this cream is thick, moisturizing and soothing, keeps my skin comfortable! It really does make me feel like it’s repairing my skin. Super hydrating!!!
