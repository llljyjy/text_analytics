I love this serum for hydration, it has replaced my moisturizer morning and night‘s however nothing totally crazy will change with your skin from the serum, that’s why I give it four stars there’s nothing instant. I received this product complementary as a sample to test. But I do love it! Doesn’t leave your face sticky and has a nice formula. Great hydration
