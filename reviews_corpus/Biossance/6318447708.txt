I LOVE this little set!! Completely worth the price to try some great products. I don’t mind the smell of the moisturizer I don’t think it really smells like anything. The serum is a nice moisturizing squalane oil that doesn’t clog pores and works really well with my oily skin, especially as I’ve increased my use with acids. The lactic acid does burn a bit if you use it without putting on a moisturizer first, but after a while your skin gets used to it, or you can use a hyaluronic acid prior to using it and it helps. I normally think eye creams are a scam but this is the first one I’ve really considered buying full size. I wish full sizes of each product were just a little bit cheaper because I feel like I can only buy one at a time, but overall, a great little set!! great intro to biossance!!
