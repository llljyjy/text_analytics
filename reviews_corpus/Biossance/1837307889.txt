If I had to just pick a few favorites from Biossance, these totally would be it. I have combination skin, but the heavier Omega repair cream does not give me any issues when used all over my face and does not cause me any breakouts. The lactic acid serum is perfect for my laziness because it slap it on at night and wake up with smooth skin. I rather to this than spend time doing a mask. The marine algae eye cream I have to use every other day and can’t use every day or I’ll get milia underneath my eyes, but I still love it because it feels very luxurious. Then I top everything off with the vitamin C rose oil when I feel extra dry. THIS KIT IS  A WIN! THIS KIT IS  A WIN!
