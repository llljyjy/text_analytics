This my holy grail in my skin care routine! I still remember getting a sample of this and actually seeing my skin transform in a matter of days. I always struggled with moisturizers since I have combination skin where it can be very dry but also acne prone. Creams were always too heavy and would make me break out. And nothing really provided enough moisture. But this moisturizer did everything! It isn’t heavy so it doesn’t break me out, it truly helps with my dryness, it has reduced the appearance of my fine lines - especially my smile lines. And helps with my rosacea. Every time I even try something else for fun I always go back to this! It’s truly chef’s kiss! My Holy Grail!
