I received this product complimentary from influencer so I can try itoutand write an honestreview. I’ve been using this product for a coupleof weeks and I have noticed a slight difference in hydration on my face. I’m not a big fan of the way it feels when I first apply it but after a couple of minutes I don’t even feel it on. I don’t see the harm in trying it yourself but I also wouldn’t run to the store to buy it. I’m going to keep using it until the bottle is empty to see if I notice more of a difference on my face. Not much of a difference
