I have normal or dry skin in the winter but I’m on a medication that makes my face sweat in any hot/humid weather. This moisturizer is a white cream that isn’t too thin/watery and isn’t too thick. There really isn’t much of a smell.. maybe a light typical moisturizer scent but you have to try to smell it to notice. It’s very hydrating on the skin. I don’t feel like I have to reapply and I don’t feel like it’s too thick and will never absorb either. However, a little goes a long way. I noticed if I apply too much, there’s a light oily feeling that sits on top of the skin.. which I don’t love. I would recommend this product to my dry skin people.. not really my oily skin people. Even for dry skin people, remember a little goes a long way and you can always build on it if you feel like you need more. Very hydrating!
