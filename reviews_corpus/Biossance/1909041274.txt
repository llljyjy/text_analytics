I received this product for free from Influenster, in exchange for my honest review. This is a nice light gel moisturizer. Itâ€™s extremely hydrating and feels great on the skin. It does have a faint weird smell, but it goes away almost instantly after applying; it may be due to the fermented lemon peel. I hope this helps brighten my dark spots. Overall, o would recommend this moisturizer. Hydrating!
