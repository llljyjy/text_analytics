This is a nice little kit to try several biossance products! I love biossance and the Vitamin C oil and the Omega cream are 2 of my favorites. I personally don’t love the Lactic Acid serum because I didn’t notice much difference. I may not have given it enough of a chance due to the strong smell. I know a lot of people swear by it. I’m not a huge fan of eye cream in general, but this eye cream does feel nice. If you are interested in trying biossance, this would be a good place to start! Great starter kit to sample multiple biossance pro
