Nice fine mist and it absorbs into my skin easily. Not as hydrating as I’d like. My skin is on the drier side but it’s summer so I thought this should suffice (the mist I normally use is out of stock). It soothes my skin but It doesn’t plump my skin up like other mists I’ve tried. I think this is probably more suitable for oily/combo skin types. I’ll give it four stars if the fragrance is not so strong. I don’t hate the smell but it’s so strong I have to hold my breath when I spray my face. And I’m not even super sensitive to fragrance. So maybe go to the store and give it a sniff before you hit the checkout button. Soothing mist, not hydrating and heavy fragrance
