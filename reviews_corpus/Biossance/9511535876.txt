This is very thick and moisturizing and I was so excited to try this product but the smell was terrible and smelt like wet dog. Every time i applied i held my breath and just hated putting it on. I also am worried it was clogging my pores and causing me to break out. Not using this product pretty disappointed. Bad smell
