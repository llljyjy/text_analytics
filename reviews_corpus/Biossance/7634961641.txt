Amazing product that really does help with acne scarring. I’ve only been using it for three weeks and already see a night and day difference. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that when I’ve used other Vitamin C serums, I saw my skin brighten. I was a bit disappointed that this one doesn’t do a ton of that, but if you’re in the market for an acne scar eraser, this one is it. *Note, the After photo may look like I have more dark spots, but it’s just my freckles that come out this time of year Bye-Bye Acne Scars
