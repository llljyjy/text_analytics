this was a really good jelly cleanser! the only problem is that it didn’t glide so well like I thought over my face. It pulled my skin as I spread it over, and since I’m 30 the least I want to do is cause more tension to the skin. Otherwise, it removed makeup very very well and left my skin so smooth. nan
