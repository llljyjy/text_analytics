I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review and picked this Biossance Squalane + Copper Peptide Rapid Plumping Serum. Now for a bit of background I am currently pregnant and although my skin has been good; I do struggle with dryness, especially during colder months. I was looking for a serum that would absorb quickly and wouldn’t leave me with a sticky feeling afterwards. This was it! However, I do want to share that during my first week using it I noticed some clogged pores around my cheekbones. As I mentioned before I am pregnant and very hormonal (which could also have caused the flare) so I decided to continue to test the product but I reduced usage to night time, and my skin thrived! My complexion looks more toned and hydrated and the dry  patches I get between my eyebrows disappeared! This is a product I would continue to use as It absorbs so quickly and because I’ll become a new mom soon, time is going to be limited in my routine. I would definitely recommend this product to people who want to take care of their skin but don’t have hours to spend layering products and still wish to pamper themselves. I would suggest to introduce this serum slowly as you would with any other skincare product. Perfect Serum for moms to be!
