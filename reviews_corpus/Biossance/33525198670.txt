BLUF (Bottom line up front), this is just another thick jelly lip balm.It’s thick, it’s instantly moisturizing… it lasts for 5 minutes tops. In my constant search for a really good lip treatment I tried this out. The seem to have the logistical making (aka, it’s so thick it SHOULD stay put), but the benefits are lackluster and short lived. Lip hydration and plumpness longevity did not increase with use, and overall just felt like a brand-name rip off. nan
