I’m giving this product five stars even though I don’t exactly love it. I was hoping it would have a rose smell like the Aerin lip conditioner which I use as a lip mask at night - unfortunately it has no rose smell. But the results of this Biossance product are totally undeniable and I now think that Squalene is the best ingredient for dry lips. If you want the softest lips this is a great product. But it only works if you exfoliate your lips with a lip scrub and wear a lip mask at night - then you will literally see results immediately. Positive result is undeniable
