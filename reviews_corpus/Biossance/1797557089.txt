I started using this product about 3 weeks ago and I have to say that the results are quite beyond my expectations. I had some redness and breakouts around my nose and mouth and after just three uses I saw a huge difference! Now 3 weeks in I can tell that itâ€™s helping immensely! The only downfall is the pump can be wonky but otherwise I love it! Works for redness and hormonal acne
