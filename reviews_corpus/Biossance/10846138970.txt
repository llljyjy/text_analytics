I have to say this product is seriously so amazing! I love how thick it is, but also how quickly my skin absorbed it. A little goes a LONG way! The jar is a substantial size, and will definitely last! My skin is combination, but during the summer months I tend to be more oily. This has been perfect for a day cream AND night cream. The price point is steep, but for the quality ingredients, I feel that it is worth it! GLOWING
