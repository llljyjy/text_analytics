This moisturizing repair cream is luxurious! Ok, when you first open it the scent is pretty overpowering, and its not a good scent, but once you put it on your skin it fades very quickly and you don’t smell it anymore. I’ve been using this for about a month now and I will say the scent doesn’t even bother me anymore so you DO get used to it! Its worth it, stick with it!This goes on so smoothly and doesn’t leave me feeling greasy. Its great for use in the summer! Loving it! nan
