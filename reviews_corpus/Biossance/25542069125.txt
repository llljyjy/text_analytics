I can’t really say much about plumping as I don’t have wrinkles yet, but I was expecting it to be a little more moisturizing! I do like that it’s hydrating on my combination skin, but I think it dries down really quickly to a matte finish and that takes away some of the hydrated feeling for me. Nevertheless I do like it for regular days when my skin doesn’t need a ton of hydration or moisture! nan
