I was so excited to get this! I’m a big fan of the brand and this was my first product to try. This cream is absolutely amazing! This rich texture hydrates my skins so well. It doesn’t sit on top of it like some creams it obsorbs and feels so silky. It also made some of my wrinkles or lines less depth and made them look smoother. I love how it make me more satisfied with my natural skin and not wanting to throw a bunch of makeup on. Hydrating and smooths
