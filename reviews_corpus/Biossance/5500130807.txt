I like to keep a variety of sunscreen depending on weather and ocassion. Tried a small sample tube of this Biossance from Amazon and I liked it enough to purchase the biggest tube from Sephora. Leaves a dewy finish. No scent, does not burn my eyes, does not leave a white cast on my light medium skin tone, and doesn’t pill applying immediately after moisturizer. Throughout the day on non-makeup days, the reapplication doesn’t add the white cast effect from the high zinc percentage. A winning sunscreen in my books! 4 stars because I prefer a matte look. nan
