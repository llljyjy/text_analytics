Really lovely product and a great value. I love when Sephora has this mini sampler sets. Everything has been working for the past week. The only thing is that if you have oily skin, this may leave your skin a little oiler than normal. I have combination skin and I find I can’t use this for my morning routine or my face is too oily. But it’s great for my nighttime one. Moisturizer to the max!
