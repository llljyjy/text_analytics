What everyone says about the smell is true. When I first play it to my freeze I thought that I had let water run on it because it almost smelled like wet dog. Now, if you can get past this and your skin is dry this is an excellent moisturizer. I have dry, cracked skin, patches and rosacea. Ever since I started used in this my skin has calmed down immensely. All of the dry patches have disappeared and I feel like even some of the redness went down. It has a very rich texture however once applied and spread into the skin it melts into it. Iâ€™m really hoping they can get rid of the smell. Love the product, hate to smell
