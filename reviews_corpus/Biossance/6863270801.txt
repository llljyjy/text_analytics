I have combination skin, typically dryer in the winter months. Regardless of the season I still experience dryness all year round due to daily cleansing. That’s why I’m thankful I have Biossance Squalane + Omega Repair Cream to replenish moisture and hydrate my skin after cleansing my face. This super rich and buttery cream feels heavenly on my skin, just like silk! My skin looks and feels deeply hydrated and moisturized. I noticed much firmer skin and more even skin tone after continued use. Heavenly moisturizer
