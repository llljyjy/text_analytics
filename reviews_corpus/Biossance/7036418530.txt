I’ve been using this for about a month only at nighttime. It is unscented which I prefer when I sleep. It is a heavier moisturizer. It sets quickly and isn’t sticky. The website says it is good for dry, Combo, or normal Skin. I wouldn’t use if your skin is oily since it has oils in it. I definitely will continue to use this and probably purchase another jar. 10/10 would recommend. Great for dry skin
