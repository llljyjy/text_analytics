I used this in the summer and didn’t mind it as much. I didn’t think it really did much of anything and was not worth the price but it was fine. Now as it gets colder I realized it is not at all hydrating and it just sits on top of my skin leaving a film that makes my concealer look super cakey on top of it. Would not recommend. Meh
