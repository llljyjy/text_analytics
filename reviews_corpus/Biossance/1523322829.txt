Very impressed!  I got this in a kit because I wanted to test the Rose Oil. The oil was meh, but the Omega Repair knocked it out of the park. If you have combo to dry skin and especially mature skin, this is an HG. It has beautifully hydrated and plumped my skin for 4 weeks now.I noted reviews about its smell.  I didnâ€™t not notice it until I applied the cream without a serum.I use a serum before any moisturizer, but in a hurry recently I just used the Omega without serum.  That is when i noted the smell.  No biggie really, but I can understand the criticism.Apply a serum, any serum, before applying the Omega Repair Creme and it will not smell. Wow!
