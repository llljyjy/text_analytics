This is a great product. It’s super moisturizing, thick, and smells good. It makes my skin feel soft and subtle without making it greasy. It’s like the CT magic cream a little. I like this product and a little goes a long way. It definitely feels rich and luxurious, as it should for the price point. My skin looks soft and it helps with my dry patches. I recommend this product! The packaging is nice too. I love products that come in glass so that’s a bonus. Good
