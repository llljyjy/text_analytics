So far I’m liking this product. I received it free for review but I have been happy enough with the results so far to recommend it. It’s very hydrating and didn’t cause any harsh skin interactions. Some hydrating products cause me to beak out but this one didn’t. I like the dropper application as it allows for more control over how much product I use. It had a very light scent, nothing too harsh. I will continue to use it to see if I start seeing more benefits! nan
