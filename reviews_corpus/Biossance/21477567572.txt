I cut makeup wipes out of my routine 4 years ago when I discovered this product. For context I am 29, with fair, normal / combo skin, not sensitive, I donâ€™t wear foundation everyday, but I do use SPF daily. This Cleansing Oil is the perfect start to my skincare routine, it effortlessly dissolves makeup, excess oil, SPF, and helps dislodge sebaceous filaments / blackheads / dead skin. As an oil, it is ideal to use in combination with facial massage / gua sha, to aid in manual lymphatic drainage. I use this to remove mascara and heavy eye makeup, while it might make my vision a little cloudy, it does not burn my eyeballs the way other oil cleansers have. I have KP (keratosis pilaris) and because I use this everyday, I feel as though I am gently removing built up dead skin cells, and therefore do not have to use abrasive physical exfoliants as often as I did in the past. I love Biossance and would absolutely recommend this product to anyone, especially if you wear makeup, SPF, or skincare products daily, that contain dimethicone of any kind of silicone-like ingredients. In a routine:I use this at nighttime, before a gentle cleanser, and follow with a hydrating gel, eye cream (love the Peptide Eye Gel), alternating treatment (retinol or AHA / BHA), and finish with a gentle hydrating moisturizer. Perfect for Removing Makeup & Facial Massage
