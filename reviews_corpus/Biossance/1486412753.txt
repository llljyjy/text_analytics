OK, I will admit, the smell threw me off at first. Iguess I am so used to fragranced skin care that Ijust needed to get used to it.But as far as functionâ€¦ Holy moly. This productpacks a punch. The texture of my skin isdrastically improved after two weeks ofconsistent use. I received this product for freefrom Influenster in exchange for my review, but Ialways review honestly. I will continue to purchase this product when I run out. Obsessed.
