I had been using the First Aid Beauty ultra repair cream for years and in the last month my skin was dull, dry and not absorbing the cr√®me.  I decided to give this a try with the small 30ml container and it changed my skin! All my dry patches were gone and my redness from my pre existing acne scars are starting to fade. This has been a miracle worker. The smell is strong but goes unnoticed once you rub in! Worth every penny a miracle
