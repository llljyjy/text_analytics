Excellent texture, gives long-lasting moisture for my very dry skin. I ignored the reviews about half-empty jars as I understand how selling by fluid oz works, but when people say it smells like feet, they’re right. It 100% smells like feet. I’ll keep using it for winter skin but won’t be rebuying. Great Moisturizer, Bad Smell
