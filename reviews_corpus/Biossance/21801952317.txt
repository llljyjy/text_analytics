Best sunscreen I’ve tried yet. It is sticky on the face which is t a issue for me but I can see how others might not like it (my face sometimes sticks to my face). But it sits really well under makeup- I used Milk Makeup so the creamy textures works well on my skin at least. There’s not really any scent either which I like. It is more of a liquid than traditional face sunscreen formulas but I do prefer liquid sunscreen over cream. nan
