I actually thought my product was expired because it smells like when my husky is wet. Think of stinky feet mixed with wet dog and that’s what this smells like. The ingredients felt nice and creamy. Good hydration. But the smell is so bad, it feels gross putting it on clean skin. Had really high expectations but this is a hard pass. Please change this smell and you’ve got a customer. Great ingredients but nasty smell
