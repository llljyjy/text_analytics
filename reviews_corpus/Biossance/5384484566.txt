I used this product for probably about a year and loved it but it is a little bit expensive so I decided to try a less expensive alternative. I tried a couple others but they weren’t as good as I remembered this Biossance Gel moisturizer being. So I reordered the Probiotic Gel Moisturizer and have used it twice now and it piles. I have switched a couple other face products since I last used it, so it seems they just don’t mix well with this moisturizer. Sadly I won’t be repurchasing now, but I did love it when I first tried it. Piles when used with some products
