I heard about this brand on YouTube from the channel doctorly where they spoke about this having great products for dry skin. I got this to test out all these products and I’m not sure which was did the job or if it’s a combination of all of them but I have always struggled with dry skin and because I live in a really cold country my skin was visibly pealing and dry and cracked and after only 4 days of using these products my skin is very hydrated and has no visible dry signs anymore. I will recommend this to anyone with dry skin. Never had such amazing results from any product. Buy this product!!!!! best results I’ve ever had
