My face felt a little dry when I began using this product but I may have sensitive skin. I haven’t been using long enough to notice a drastic difference but I feel like I am starting to see a little difference in fine lines. It also feels like it’s not to harsh for beginners in retinol so I would recommend to friends Starting to see some results
