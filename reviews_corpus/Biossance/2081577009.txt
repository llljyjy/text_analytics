I received this complimentary from influenster for my honest review. I have used the squalane & omega repair cream from this brand before so I had high hopes for this cream as well! Overall it is a nice lightweight moisturizer and leaves your skin soft, but if rose scent isn’t your thing, I would go for one of their other moisturizers! They’re both wonderful however I give this 4 stars because the rose scent to me is a bit much. I wouldn’t buy this exact product again but I would buy from this company again! If you don’t mind rose scent this is a great cream
