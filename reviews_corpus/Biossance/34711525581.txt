I have pretty normal skin, not oily, and not really dry either, however I use a face moisturizer every day/night.  It doesn’t have much of a smell, which I like for a face cream/moisturizer, but it does have a slight chemically smell to me, which doesn’t linger so it doesn’t bother me and wouldn’t keep me from buying this because it’s barely there. My skin is so soft after just a few uses with this product. This also doesn’t make my skin oily, it just moisturizes my skin and leave it baby smooth/soft. My skin is also a little sensitive and this has caused 0 break outs!! Below I have submitted a photo of before, when I received the product, and a photo from right now, after a few days of using it. I received this product free Freom Influenster & biossance for my honest opinion/review. Absolutely awesome.
