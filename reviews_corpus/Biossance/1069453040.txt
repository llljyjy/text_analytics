I have combination skin and a regular user of Tretinoin cream (0.05%). The texture was interesting - the cream feels thick and rich but light at the same time. It spreads very easily and doesn’t leave a sticky residue. It kept my skin moist until next morning and I don’t have any complaints. The only thing that is not worthy to those who are sensitive to smell - the cream is unscented and you can smell the actual scent of the product. It is not strong but noticeable. I would try it first before make the purchase. Great moisturizing cream though. Loved it but be warned about the smell
