I got a small sample size a while back that I never tried.  So I decided to give it a whirl. I used it two nights in a row and not only did it dry out my skin, it had an a bearable amount of fragrance, and it caused whiteheads to start popping up. Now, I feel as though I’m doing damage control with my skin. I’m never using these products again. I wanted to like it but i just can’t recommend. Drying, too much fragrance & white heads
