I received this product complimentary to test & review. I was first of all very impressed with the ingredients of this product! It is claimed to be a squalane moisturizer & squalane is one of the first ingredients. I have oily/combo skin & this moisturizer wasn’t too heavy & didn’t leave me oily. I haven’t been able to notice any big changes in my skin but I am still overall impressed with this product. Very satisfied
