So I’ve had a bad cold, and my nose has been super red/raw/peeling (ew, and, painful). This moisturizer has been AMAZING in soothing/adding moisture/correcting the situation! I’ve been using it on the rest of my face too, morning and night, and have not had any breakouts. Just soft, moisturized skin - and I live in a super dry environment. I have combo skin so sometimes the “overly” moisturizing creams don’t work for me - but this one has been great. I really enjoy that it’s not artificially scented, as well. Super moisturizing without breakouts
