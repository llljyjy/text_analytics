I really wanted to love this product but for me it was just ok. The consistency of the cream was great, I loved the packaging. It just didn’t work for my skin, instead of leaving me glory and fresh feeling I actually wound up with skin that felt dry. This could just be me because weather is colder where I live right now, if you have oily or normal skin still may be worth a try. I also wasn’t a fan of the scent. nan
