My skin type is varies, in the winter it’s very dry. The other seasons it’s completely fine. Something I really liked about this product that there was no scent! This product looks like it would apply very thick but takes no time to absorb on the skin, leaving the skin feeling very hydrated. Definitely would recommend to others with dry skin! Works great! Great for dry skin!
