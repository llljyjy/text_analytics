I was gifted the all new Vitamin C Rose Moisturizer from @influenster in exchange for my honest thoughts and review. This cream is lightweight and sinks right into the skin with a finish that leaves your skin clear and glowing ðŸŒŸ it plays well under makeup and the plant derived squalane helps pack additional hydrating properties. I have been using this for a week now as a part of my morning routine and my skin is so smooth. It has a light, natural rose scent that dissipates shortly after application. Over time, vitamin C will increase skin cell turnover which enhances brightness and evens tone and texture. I love Biossance products and many are a staple in other parts of my routine, such as the Omega night cream and the Lactic Acid serum. They made with clean ingredients so you can feel good from the first application! #BrightByBiossance #GlowByBiossance That Rose Glow!
