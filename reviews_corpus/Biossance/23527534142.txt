This is beautiful oil. I use it every morning and occasionally at night. I noticed a difference in my skin after day one. More even toned and smoother texture. My face glows, yet isnâ€™t oily. I only use 3 small drops and that does my entire face and neck. I take whatever is left on my hands and rub a bit across my chest and always the tops of my hands. Love it and have just purchased my second bottle. love it!!
