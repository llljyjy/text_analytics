This sunscreen is not for everyone. It takes awhile to absorb and leaves a luminous sheen, even with foundation over it. I liked it enough to repurchase it because of the quality ingredients and the fact that it’s a physical sunscreen..which I prefer. I wait 10 min before applying foundation over it but I still get lots of breakthrough shine. I like it though because it’s a very good comfortable sunscreen to wear and hasn’t caused any breakouts. Also, I’ll take a dewy look over acquiring new sun damage. nan
