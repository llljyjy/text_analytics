I really wanted to love this product as it sounded clean and luxurious, however, it truly did NOT meet expectations. It is mild, however, it does NOT remove makeup and the cloth is not a pleasant feel. It also, while not altogether unpleasant, has a peculiar smell. I would not repurchase this item. did not meet expectations
