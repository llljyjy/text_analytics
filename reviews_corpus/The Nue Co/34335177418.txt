I prefer unisex scents and this is that, but it is lacking sweetness and is very strong. I’ve decided that it’s not what I’d like to smell like in the summer months. Will try it again in the winter to be sure. The scent matches the description and is nice so I’m giving it 4/5 stars. I’m just not sure it’s for me. nan
