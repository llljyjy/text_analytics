You want a photorealistic representation of walking in a forest?  This is it.  You want to wear it?  Get this.  I tried and after several minutes realized I did not want to wear the smell.  To my nose this leans masculine.  It’s strong and has good sillage, so kudos for good performance.  I was just in the mood for something lighter, less masculine and bracing.  This is not your standard department store perfume!  Despite returning, I gave this 5 stars because of the good performance and nice packaging (love the magnetic cap).  Taste in perfume doesn’t seem a fair reason to deduct from the rating for something that’s so subjective.  Performance, packaging, and uniqueness were my objective measures here. nan
