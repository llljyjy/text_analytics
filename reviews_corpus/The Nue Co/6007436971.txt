After reading the description I was highly intrigued! I love fragrances and suffer with anxiety and thought the idea of having a fragrance that would help me destress and remind me of the outdoors while I’m stuck at home would be amazing. From the description I thought it would be a fresh woody fragrance with a bit of smoke and it would smell like camping in the forest. This is not that… it’s a very strong masculine musk and smoke heavy fragrance. It has a very strong Oud or Palo Santo base with an almost Tom ford Cologne. Maybe even a little soapy feel to it. It actually makes me feel more anxious while wearing it because it’s so heavy and strong. While that being said although it was terrible for me I think if you love strong oud, incense, palo santo type Cologne that will last all day you’d probably love this! STRONG and SMOKY
