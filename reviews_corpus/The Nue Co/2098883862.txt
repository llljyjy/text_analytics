I had a good experience with the debloat pwder from this brand so I had high hopes, but honestly I had one of my worst nights after taking this alongside my typical routine. I don’t feel heartburn, but I’m vomiting up small amounts of acidic liquid and regardless if this product would help in the long run I’m not sure I’m up for knowingly reliving that experience. I now notice how many of the reviews were incentivized. Just don’t bank on this helping at first I guess. Pretty Sure This Made Matters Worse…
