I like this fragrance. It does lean a bit masculine but it is warm and cosy and snuggly. I used this and did not shower the next day and I could still smell it the next evening. It is incredibly long lasting on me. I took off a star for stress relief since I did not feel it totally relieves stress but it definitely helps and I do enjoy the scent so still four stars. It does begin to verge on setting off my sensitivities so if perfumes set your allergies off you might want to consider that. Warm and Snuggly
