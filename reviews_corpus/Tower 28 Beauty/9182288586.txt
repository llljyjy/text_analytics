This serum feels super good on my skin -- it never left a sticky or weird residue after applying it on. I after a few days of wearing it, I did notice an improvement of the texture of my skin. Out of all the serums that promise the same results as this Intensive Rescue serum, I feel like Iâ€™ve seen the fastest results with this product! Product complimentary from Tower 28 Beauty! nan
