Loved this product and what it did for my skin. However, if you take a look at the ingredients, there’s much cheaper options for hypochlorus acid facial sprays! This bottle is very cute and if money isn’t a concern for you then I say go for it! Great at helping maskne/ fungal acne on my forehead. Does smell a bit strong tho but leaves when it’s dried down. Love this but look at ingredients!
