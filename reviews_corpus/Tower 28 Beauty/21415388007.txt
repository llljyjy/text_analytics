(For anyone curious, there is 0.015% Hypochlorous Acid in this). I’m very impressed with this spray! Since it is antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory, I’ve been using it as a spot treatment for the blind (cystic) pimples i get which are big, red, and hurt since they are under my skin. I put it on overnight and the next day there is a drastic reduction in the size and redness. This is amazing! I also have KP on my arms and this helps with the redness. Love this product nan
