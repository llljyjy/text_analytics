WOW. My new holy grail product! I was gifted by Tower 28 Beauty in exchange to receive my honest opinion, and I have to say I fell in love! The formula leaves my skin feeling so smooth and soft. At first I didn’t see much of a difference other than the way it made my skin feel, but over the course of the next few days my skin went from rough, bumpy, and uneven, to glowy, clear, and radiant. You have to give this a try! I’m an esthetician and I approve!! Redness is no longer an issue!
