I purchased the serum after liking but not loving the SOS Daily Rescue Facial Spray and I like this better, but I’m still not in love. I don’t really think the product lives up to its claims and I haven’t noticed a difference at all. Unfortunately, you need a good two or three pumps it cover your entire face so you can go through a bottle pretty quickly. Unlike other serums, I have to apply this directly to my face (rather than my hands) because it soaks up SO fast. I also don’t love that it doesn’t tell you the concentration of Hypochlorous Acid. Will not order again. Doesn't live up to the hype
