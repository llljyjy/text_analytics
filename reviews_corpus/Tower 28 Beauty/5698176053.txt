I really wanted to love this product but the smell was just too strong for me. It has hypochlorous acid in it so it smells like chlorine pool water and just ruins the experience for me. However I think this and the spray are great products if you have acne prone skin or get maskne! This helps settle down your skin and doesnâ€™t sing but be prepared for the smell! nan
