I have been using the product for about a month and have seen slight improvement. The serum has a nice consistency and feels hydrating on the skin. I have rosacea and was hopeful for this serum. I feel like maybe those with more general redness may see a more immediate effect but my rosacea redness only slightly decreased. I cannot say it cleared my skin. I agree with others that the pump is too aggressive. However, since it feels good before I apply moisturizer and my serum or makeup, I can see myself buying it again or trying the toner version of this product. I love that the brand caters to those with sensitive skin. nan
