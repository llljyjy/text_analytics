This spray is perfect for when your summer moisturizer isn’t cutting it or when you just got in bed and you don’t feel like slathering on another layer. I use it as a final step in my skincare routine to make sure I have enough moisture if my skin is craving more that day. Sometimes we don’t have time or energy to slather on another entire layer of product but a quick spray works! Using this before skincare does the same for me as well, but I’m trying to go through quite a few “this just needs A TINY BIT more moisture” moisturizers and this helps a ton! Perfect for that EXTRA oomf!
