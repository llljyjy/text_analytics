Does it smell like pool water? Yes.Is the bottle terrible and sprays the product everywhere? Yes. But it works! My skin was so dry, red, irritated and flakey but after using this plus biossance cream my skin has never been softer. Even with the bad bottle design Iâ€™d still buy this again!It dries really quickly and must be put on the face right away so just keep that in mind if you are spraying it on your hands and then applying to face. nan
