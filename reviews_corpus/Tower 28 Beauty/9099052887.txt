Bought the sample size of this and I honestly didnâ€™t notice any improvement in my skin. I have oily, acne prone skin and it actually made me break out more. This stuff has sodium chloride as one of the ingredients which is a level 5 comprehensive ingredient, meaning it is a very bad pore clogger. Happy I only bought the $12 sample size and not the full $28 size. Has sodium chloride
