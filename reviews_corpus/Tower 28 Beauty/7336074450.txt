This product caused my skin to break out and continually break out for over a month before I gave up and stopped using it. I understand HCIO (the 3rd of all 3 ingredients in this spray: water, salt and HCIO) has acne and bacterial killing properties. And is said to be good for sensitive skin - but my skin is fair/slightly sensitive and this product wrecked my complexion. This product essentially made my skin dry out and which caused too much dead skin that trapped all the dirty bacteria under my skin. Once I stopped using this spray as my daily toner and just started using a $5-found-at-TJ Maxx toner with aloe and rose water, my face started clearing up in just a couple days. Save your money - dried out skin
