I was gifted by Tower 28 Beauty for my honest opinions. This serum is definitely not like any others… for all the iffy reasons. I was so excited to try out this serum that would heal and protect my skin and I couldn’t get past the scent of this serum.  I was able to use this up for a week until I said “no more”. This scent is so unique for the wrong reason. Once poured into hand a heavy scent of rain jungle water just goes right up your nose and the second you apply this serum it smells like a pool that’s been left out in the winter and spring. It’s not the best scent. With very little ingredients I can tell most ingredients are water based and I don’t know if I got a bad one or what but I cannot stand the smell. Second, the spritz on this bottle has got to be one of the worst things in the world. It sprays out like a water gun and it gets everywhere so I suggest not applying it straight to the face. This application bottle is not the best of something like and would have liked to see a pump as the consistency is a watery-gel. It applies just like water and absorbs like water AND SMELLS like rain water. I will have to check out of this product and give it to someone who will enjoy it more than I did. Pool water for your face
