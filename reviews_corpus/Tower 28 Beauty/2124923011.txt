I bought this to use after IPL and CO2 laser treatments to try to keep the breakouts from the occlusive salves at bay. It worked really well. I’ve shifted to using it daily, on face, décolleté, and a few spots on my arms and legs where I get eczema. It’s great and will remain part of my routine! Great for after laser, IPL, or everyday
