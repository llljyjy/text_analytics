I bought the mini size of this product as part of a sampler set, and it is by far my breakout favorite of the bag. I have irregular redness issues and I’m never quite sure what sets it off, or when. This spray is a fantastic quick fix in the moment! I’m also noticing a reduction in redness long-term. With this spray, my regular skincare routine, and daily sunscreen, I don’t need to wear makeup. When I buy this product again, I will be buying the bigger size ($7 per oz, instead of $12) but I NEED to have this in my bag, so I’ll be saving the mini bottle in order to refill and have a travel size.For comparison: Previous facial mists I’ve tried have included Honest Beauty and Dr Jart Cicapair, the latter of which is super expensive and specifically targeted at redness relief. SOS performed better than both. I think it hits that sweet spot of being just targeted enough that it can address a variety of skin issues; since I still don’t know the exact cause of my redness, this was a great product for me. The ONLY facial spray you need.
