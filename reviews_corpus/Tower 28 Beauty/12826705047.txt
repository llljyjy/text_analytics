I have purchased a mini version to try it out before committing. It’s been five days, and so far, not so good. I got a slight rash (small pimples here and there), face and neck mostly. But the worse part is the smell. To me, it smells like chlorine, like water in the pool. Or even bleach if you take it to the extreme. I will see how my skin gonna do in a few more days. But for now I don’t believe I’ll repurchase it. smells like chlorine to me
