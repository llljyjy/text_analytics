I have angry skin. My skin reacts to new skincare, weather, stress, allergies, makeup, I have rosacea hence I am always battling something. This product calms it. It works best when my skin is angrier. Itâ€™s not the kind of product that gives you overnight results but when I am not using it I can tell the difference. It just makes my skin calmer. I use it as a first step before anything else. Let it dry and continue with my morning and night routine. Works on my angry skin
