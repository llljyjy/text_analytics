I have dry skin with minimal texture and redness. I am surprised at how well this water-based serum is performing. My redness has decreased and my skin feels so much more plumped and nourished. I love using this serum right after my toner and sealing it in with a moisturizer! This serum was gifted by Tower 28 beauty, but I am genuinely impressed by this product. nan
