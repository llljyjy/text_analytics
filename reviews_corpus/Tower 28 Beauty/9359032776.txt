Gifted by Tower 28 Beauty, So, this is actually my first tower 28 product! I have tried their spray multiple times but never owned one, so here’s the deal, first off, this product is really liquidy, I was definitely expecting a different formula/texture but I mean this one works too, it’s fragrance free and dye free as well which is probably my favorite part about it, it does not contain any irritants, is this formula soothing? Yes! It is soothing! It’s definitely the same acid they also use in their spray product and yeah I’m I’m definitely not mad at it, I have sensitive skin so this product definitely helps me with my skin barrier, I will say this one little thing though, my bottle specifically did not come with any kind of packaging, and I know they are probably trying to go for an eco-friendly product all around, but it felt a little bit cheap, they could’ve used recycled paper or something of that nature but instead they opted for nothing, I would just probably change that and actually include some kind of packaging, as long as it’s eco-friendly of course :-) nan
