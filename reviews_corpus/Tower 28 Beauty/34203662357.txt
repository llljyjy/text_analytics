I honestly don’t think this is worth the money. I was so excited to try this, because I had seen such great reviews from others. But, personally I didn’t see any sort of difference in my skin and the ingredients were pretty much just water, so I would much rather just stick to normal water as it is much cheaper. It's Just Overpriced Salt-Water
