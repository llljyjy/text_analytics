I was skeptical because people said it’s just like using thermal water sprays and it smells like chlorine . I find the smell very gentle and non offensive and this is definitely nothing like my thermal water sprays . This balances my skin after cleansing and has now replaced my very expensive toner! I have active breakouts, very red prone sensitive skin that gets aggravated easily, and this has really calmed my skin down after cleansing and balances it and also hydrates a little . I’m Very happy I tried it. ItDoesn’t work over makeup though , best on cleansed skin before other products In your routine.  I use am and pm, before vitamin c serum , sunscreen and moisturizers. It doesn’t interfere with any of them . Calms and balances my fussy sensitive skin!
