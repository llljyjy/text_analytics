Not sure which was worse, the fact that it smelled like chlorinated pool water or the way the aggressive splatter of comes of of the pump. This smells like strong chlorine which in all honesty makes me nervous to use on my face. But the scent is also strong & lasting. The component is small & poorly assembled. Mine came half empty due to leaking. The product shoots of out the pump so aggressively that it makes a mess and sprays everywhere. The product is a mostly water based consistency & I didnâ€™t feel was hydrating at all. This product was nothing short of disappointing. This was gifted by tower 28 beauty Pool water for your face
