I love Tower 28 so I really wanted to love this product but this just didn’t work for my skin. I have extremely sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin. When I first applied the product, I was surprised that it was so watery. It felt nice on my skin but as I used it throughout the 7 days, I found that each day, it made skin more and more irritated. My skin felt tight and very itchy. The chlorine smell was also off putting, but I appreciate that this product did not contain strong added scents to it. I continued to use the product despite the irritation but found no major improvement in my skin after the 7 days. Once I stopped using this product, the irritation stopped so I’m assuming an ingredient in this product just didn’t sit right with my skin. This was gifted by Tower 28 Beauty. Not for me
