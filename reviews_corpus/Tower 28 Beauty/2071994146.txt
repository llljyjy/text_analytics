I have an immune disorder that causes my eczema, dermatitis, and rosacea to severely flare up from time to time. My skin is left raw, cracked, and burning. This is the ONLY product I’ve ever used that soothed my ultra sensitive skin without burning it! As someone whose skin is so sensitive that even water burns, this is such a lifesaver. I initially asked for a sample at my local Sephora, but I’m so obsessed, I might just have to go back and buy every bottle in the store!! A Lifesaver for Extremely Sensitive Skin!
