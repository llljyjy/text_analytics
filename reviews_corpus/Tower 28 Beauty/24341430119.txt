I was reluctant to try a serum due to the fact that they can be so hit or miss (for me, personally). However, I have tried all of Tower 28’s other products and loved every single one, so I happily took the plunge. All I can say is: I’m so glad I did! The SOS Serum has smoothed and soothed my skin out quite a bit since I started using it. My dryness and redness have noticeably decreased, and my skin stays hydrated much longer. The lightweight formula is another bonus that makes it a dream for layering skincare and makeup, too! Tower 28, you’ve done it again; another holy grail for my collection. Smoothing, Soothing Serum!
