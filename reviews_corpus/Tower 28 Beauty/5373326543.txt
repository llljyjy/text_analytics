Love this! I have redness and sensitivity on my skin and I’ve tried different facial sprays and nothing has helped. I love this one because it doesn’t have a scent that I’m aware of. I use it during work because masks rub on my face making it red and it lasts all through 12 hours and I apply it before I go to bed right before I put on my moisturizer! It doesn’t take much. I highly recommend for redness and rosacea skin. awesome for redness!
