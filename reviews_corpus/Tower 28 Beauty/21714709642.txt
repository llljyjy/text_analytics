This has ticked every mark that the research on hypochlorous acid has shown is possible for it to help with for the skin: my active acne is fading after only using this 4 times in 3 days, I was able to deescalate my skin from getting red and irritated after going too heavy handed with piling on actives the day after I my last straggling pimple dried out after 2 days with this spray, and my skin has no complaints using this. As an added bonus, my skin is glowing healthily again like it should after MONTHS and it feels more plump but slightly more mattified when using this before applying moisturizer. I have the kind of sensitive skin where waking up on the wrong side of the bed can make it inflamed and angry for the whole day, so hearing about this product really got me curious due to hypochlorous acid being scientifically well researched and I am so pleased that I can see immediate results and there’s no purging of any kind, so you don’t have to sit and hope you haven’t wasted my money like many much more expensive topical actives require you to go through.I decided to test this out in both the morning and the evening between by serum and moisturizing step (as it directed to use this before moisturizer), and was particularly checking on if this required topping up throughout the day if used AM or PM (if my face got irritated at all while this was on my skin), and seeing if it helped with my ongoing acne eruptions that have been non stop on my face for about 8 years with only a few weeks of freedom max in between at any point.I have had such problematic and reactive skin for my entire adult life, plus with IBS I really have to prioritize eating to not have GI flare ups over any treatment for hormola acne, and is simply something I have to deal with as I can have the exact products my skin normally loves suddenly feel like it’s all tingly and making my skin flush and heat up.I believe this will keep my skin happy, and I will be telling everyone I know GET IT NOW Hypochlorous Acid for skin is a GODSEND
