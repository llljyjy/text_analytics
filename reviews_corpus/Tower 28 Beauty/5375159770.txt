Tower28 gifted me this serum in exchange for my opinion. I already use the SOS spray and love it for my acne and sensitive skin. I feel like if I don’t spray my face with SOS throughout the day then I’ll still break out, but the serum keeps my skin really clear just using it twice a day. I had a few cystic breakouts forming and the SOS serum shrank them almost completely over night. I like the texture too, it’s gel like and sinks in easily. I just use a really good moisturizer after because it can be a bit drying but I live in a dry area too. Hope they’ll come out with a larger sized bottle eventually. A hit
