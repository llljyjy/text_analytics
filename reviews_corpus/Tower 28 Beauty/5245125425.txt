Gifted by Tower 28 Beauty. This serum claims to best for a compromised skin barrier. I try to keep my barrier healthy, so this serum is designed to help me maintain that. It is a light gel texture that smells a bit like sea water, which is actually very pleasant. It doesn’t really feel soothing, but it isn’t irritating. I think this is best for barrier repair. Best for repair
