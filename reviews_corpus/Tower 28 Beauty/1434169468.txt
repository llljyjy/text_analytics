I have been using this as a primer/base layer after my skin had a weird reaction to something and it is a miracle! Also love to use it after shaving, as does my husband after shaving his face, to prevent razor burn and ingrown hairs/irritation. Literally spray anywhere you have angry skin, or on scars, and wait for the magic to happen. Use after shaving and as a primer
