I use a lot of harsh products on my skin for acne and at times my face will be incredibly irritated, red, etc. I kept hearing about this product and I decided to give it a try and I absolutely glad I did.  While it didnâ€™t completely get rid of my rednesses it did help lessen it and along with the FBA Ultra Repair Cream my face is calm. I do go through this quickly and I honestly wish Sephora sold the refill bottle for this product. Zero Regrets
