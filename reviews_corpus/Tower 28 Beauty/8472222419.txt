I love this spray. I use it mainly after my cleanser and post-workout to prevent breakouts. The product is refreshing and cooling. My skin is very sensitive and very prone to eczema so it calms everything down. The only downside is the scent which i find strong and poolside bleach. I can bare with the scent because of the results that it has on my skin to feeling smooth and not flared up! love love love!
