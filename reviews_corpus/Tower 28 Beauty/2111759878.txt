This spray really works. Like in the pictures provided, it reduces flare-ups and redness for me. It does have a chlorine-like smell, and that is because it is a saltwater spray. It is literally 3 ingredients (one being hypochlorous acid, hence the smell) and I think it may be its simplicity that does the trick. Saltwater can do wonders to skin, especially acne, and so does hypochloruous acid. The only reason it loses a star is because for what it is, it is still $36 for a salt and chlorine solution. Overall, I still love it as my toner because it calms my skin and it’s become an important part of my skincare routine. When my skin is clearer, I feel more confident, so it’s a win.
