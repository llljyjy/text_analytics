I’ve been pleasantly surprised by this product! It has a very unique texture and it dries/gets tacky quickly on the skin, and I love layering other heavier moisturizers over it. My skin is SO sensitive and this hasn’t irritated it at all, just made it very calm and healthy! It does smell like chlorine, as other reviews stated. I’m definitely able to look past that smell for the benefits of the product, though. Definitely loving the glow it’s bringing to my skin! nan
