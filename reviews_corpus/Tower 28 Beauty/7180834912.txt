I am so grateful to this product I would give it one thousand stars if I could! I have eczema and lately my skin has become so sensitive that I often had eczema rashes on my face and this helped to heal them and prevent my skin from being itchy and inflamed. The most important was helping the red bumps from the rash though. I have also stopped using anything like exfoliants, retinols etc. and I use a super gentle cleanser, this spray and a simple moisturizer and my skin is finally clear again thank goodness.  The painful itching is almost entirely gone. Please continue to carry and stock this SEPHORA. nan
