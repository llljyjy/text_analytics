I’m not going to lie this feels like plain old water on your skin but it SAVED my severely sunburned skin and lips. Within 2 days, my skin felt relived and hydrated again. I do appreciate the product itself. The packaging is not easy to work with, it tends to shoot out of the nozzle everywhere. It’s frustrating. nan
