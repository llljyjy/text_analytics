I tried out this product based on the hype from TikTok and I am actually shocked how much it has helped my skin. For a fair test, I just applied this product in addition to my normal routine (so not in conjunction with any other new products) and WOW. My normal routine is salicylic acid cleanser + hyaluronic serum + moisturizer + sunscreen (retinol every 3 days and PHA mask once every 2 weeks at nighttime). So I just added before my moisturizer and it works great. I feel like my skin has never looked better 🥹. For context, I have had acne since age 13 and have combo skin with large pores and texture. I am also prone to cystic acne with my PCOS. But I haven’t noticed any new cystic acne and my little comedones/acne scarring look much better. This is definitely a must in my skincare routine from here out, and I immediately purchased the full size after 4 days and put my friends and family on 🤪! Thank you Tower28!!!
