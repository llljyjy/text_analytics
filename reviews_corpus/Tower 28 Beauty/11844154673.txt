This serum is nice! As someone who already loves SOS mist, itâ€™s nice to have a version that can be more targeted and used along my jawline where I get the most breakouts. Hypochlorous acid is such a superstar product for any skin wounds and this definitely speeds up the healing of any pimples I have! nan
