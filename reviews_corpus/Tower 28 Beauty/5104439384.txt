I have sensitive skin with noticeable redness so I was super excited to try out this serum. To start off, I found the pump was hard to work with, you have to push down on it hard which in turn ends up causing the serum to shoot out. I personally didn’t find an issue with the scent, it was barely noticeable for me so I liked that. Unfortunately, I was let down by the performance of this product. The serum did not help my redness at all (included is a picture of my skin when using the serum) and even worse my skin did not react well to the serum. A few days after I started using it, my skin began to feel sensitive to the touch and I broke out near my chin. When I stopped using this in my routine, my skin started going back to normal, such a bummer it didn’t work for my skin. This product was gifted by Tower 28 Beauty. nan
