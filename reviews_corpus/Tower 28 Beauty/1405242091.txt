i was expecting a hydrating serum that calms skin but i have seen no difference in my redness. this serum is very tacky and hard to apply, also dries my skin out. the pump is very aggressive. you need at least three pumps to cover the face. i prefer the spray. but overall both products feel like overpriced water. doesn't live up to hype
