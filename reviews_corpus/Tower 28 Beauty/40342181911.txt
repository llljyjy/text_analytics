I wanted to love this and I desperately wanted this to work because I have been having such bad acne flares and can’t find a cause or anything to soothe. I didn’t notice a difference in redness, inflammation, irritation, or anything other than $$$$ sprayed away. If it works for you, I am sooo happy!!! If you haven’t tried this yet, definitely get the travel size first. Zero difference after a mini and a full size
