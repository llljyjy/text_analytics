I got this thinking it was a mini SOS spray, but that wound up being the best mistake I made because this has helped my skin SO much. I have eczema and sensitive skin that is textured, and I swear my skin has never looked better recently. I’ve been using this for almost 3 weeks now, and it’s the only thing I’ve changed in my skincare routine. 0 breakouts (even through traveling for 2 weeks to a completely different climate), 0 eczema flare ups, and 0 tiny little bumps on my face that are emphasized with makeup. I’m not even out yet, and I have already repurchased. Has helped my sensitive skin & eczema SO much!
