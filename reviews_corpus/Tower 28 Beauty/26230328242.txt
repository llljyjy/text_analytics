This product is unbelievable! I can’t believe how quickly this worked to reduce my redness. In just 3 days I saw a huge difference in the look of my skin when using both morning and night. I definitely will consider repurchasing this and I think it’s just such an interesting formula and idea that they made this. I don’t know any product like this on the market with these ingredients to help calm the skin and help the skin barrier. So, it’s definitely one everyone should give a try and see if it can help your skin too. The price is a bit high though. So, it’s a tough decision to make for sure. *Gifted by Tower 28 Beauty Amazing redness reducing results, but a bit pricey
