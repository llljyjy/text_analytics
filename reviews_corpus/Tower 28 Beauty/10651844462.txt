As someone who doesn’t have excessive redness, I was excited to see what secondary benefits I’d get from the serum.  After four weeks, I have seen a slow but sure improvement in my overall skin.  Without a change in moisturizer, I have noticed less peeling in dry areas, and has generally made any typical dullness go away.  It’s like getting the benefits of a moisturizing and rejuvenating mask, long-term.  It also has sped up healing from stress-picking.  My skin is softer to the touch, and it’s so lightweight to apply (don’t apply too much, it can leave a bit of residue!  A bit goes farther than it seems!), it’s a real treat for my routine.  It’s a great product, just give it a chance to work its magic!(Product gifted in exchange for review.) Consistency is Key
