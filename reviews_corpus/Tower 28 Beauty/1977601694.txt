I’ve been using this new serum for a couple of weeks now and love it! It’s similar to the spray which has also been a game changer for my skin but I love having the serum as more of a permanent step in my morning and night routine and I now use the spray as a more on the go refresher. This serum really calms my redness and irritation and instantly feels amazing when I put it on. Instant relief
