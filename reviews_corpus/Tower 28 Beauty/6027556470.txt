This was gifted by Tower 28 Beauty. I already love the SOS spray it’s been life changing on my ezcema so I knew I’d love the SOS serum. I’ve used this consistently over the past few weeks and I’ve noticed such a difference in my skin, especially around my chin. My chin is constantly red and irritated and this has done wonders for it! It has really helped to calm down my skin and make it look/feel better. This definitely works best when it’s used alone with just moisturizer on top I’ve found. My only gripe with it is the bottle - every time I try and squeeze some out it flies everywhere. I’ve just started twisting off the top of the bottle and pouring a little bit out so I don’t waste any of the product. Besides that it’s a perfect product! The Best for redness!!
