Absolute miracle in a bottle! I purchased the mini size of this product during the Spring savings event because of the positive reviews I saw about it. Before the event was over, I found myself going back to Sephora to grab the 4oz size. This stuff really works! I have been looking for a staple product to combat some blemishes on my face, and so far this product has done just that. I saw a difference (overnight) from using this product once. It seems to dry up hyperpigmentation resulting in a more even tone. If they ever come up with a body wash Iâ€™m buying it!! nan
