LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE. This product is absolutely amazing. I started adapalene about a month ago and my skin has been freaking out, and the masks don’t make it any better. This spray literally “saved my skin”. I rarely write reviews, so this means I absolutely adore this product. I also have very acne prone skin, and this did not break me out. I saw some reviews about a smell, but the smell is actually fine. It smells like a fresh scent,not artificial though, like a clean smell. The smell also dissipates within seconds so it wouldn’t be an issue even if I didn’t like it. If you struggle with redness, GET THIS! This spray does every single thing it advertises. You won’t be disappointed licensed esti here and let me just say…
