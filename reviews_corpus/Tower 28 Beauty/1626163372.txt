This serum has that I was gifted by Tower 28 Beauty been amazing. I deal with a lot of redness and minimal breakouts. Since using this for now about 27 days, I haven’t had a breakout and my redness has been a lot better! This has allowed me to use sunscreen and not look as splotchy. I’d recommend this to anyone with sensitive, red skin, and breakouts. nan
