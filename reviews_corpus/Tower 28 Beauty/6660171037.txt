Okay I’ve bought lots of things from Sephora — I’ve never left a review before. I really believe this has helped my skin so much. My main skin concern is texture. I’ve been using this spray day and night for about 2 weeks and my skin looks more smooth than usual and my acne is almost nonexistent. As for the smell that everyone is talking about, it’s not a gross smell and it’s very, very faint. I can only smell it if I literally hold the bottle right up to my nose and inhale super hard. Of course if you’re sensitive to smells that’s different, but if not it’s no reason to not buy. I’m looking to buy the full size soon. Highly recommend this product! it’s a yes!!!!
