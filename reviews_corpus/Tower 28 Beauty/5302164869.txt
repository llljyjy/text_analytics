I was gifted by Tower 28 Beauty this new SOS Intensive Redness Relief Serum and my rosacea and eczema prone skin has never been so happy! I have struggled finding products that actually visibly reduce the redness in my cheeks from rosacea and I’m so happy to say that this intensive serum has actually worked for me! I use this serum of the last step in my skin prep before putting on makeup and it greatly reduces the redness in my cheeks so that it doesn’t show through my foundation! The hypochlorous acid has anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties that don’t irritate my eczema either! I highly recommend! Great for rosacea and eczema!
