Gifted by Tower 28 Beauty, all thoughts are my own. First off I really enjoy the lightweight texture of this serum. It sinks in completely within seconds and has played really well with the rest of my routine. I am acne prone so I was really excited to try this serum. I already am a lover of the SOS Facial Spray and I knew I had to give this a try. Iâ€™ve been using this 2x daily and have seen differences in my skin. While this did not completely prevent breakouts, it did help new breakouts to heal quickly. I also noticed a reduction in redness in my skin overall. Quick healing after breakouts is super important to me and this is something I would definitely look into purchasing on my own once I am out! nan
