While I love the pretty glass bottle, the texture of the face oil, and that it’s non-greasy and light. I found that it does not keep my face moisturized enough even when placed over my typical moisturizer. Additionally, I believe it causes some acne as I always seem to get some pimples when I use it. It if didn’t seem to dry out my face or give me acne though, this stuff would be really great. nan
