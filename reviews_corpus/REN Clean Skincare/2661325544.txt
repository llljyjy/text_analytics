I’ve been using this as my morning serum for a few weeks now. I generally like the product, I need a good brightening AM serum that absorbs fast, and isn’t sticky or greasy and this one seems to do the trick! My only complains is it has a certain smell to it that is really unpleasant for me. Gifted by REN skincare nan
