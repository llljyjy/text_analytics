I’m a huge fan of Ren Skincare’s Evercalm Day Cream but sadly I’m not a fan of their vitamin C glow serum. It comes in a nice glass bottle with a pump. The texture is a thick but slightly watery serum but the biggest drawback for using this serum is the smell. It’s so unpleasant and smells lightly citrusy but also chemically? It’s so bad that it deters me from using it so I can’t say if it’s effective in reducing dark spots sadly. nan
