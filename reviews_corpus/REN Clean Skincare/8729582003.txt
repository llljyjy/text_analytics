Love this serum! It is light and absorbs quickly. It is non-sticky as well. It leaves my skin smooth and hydrated. I have sensitive skin and this product did not cause any irritation or breakouts. The smell is interesting. It’s not off-putting or chemical, but it’s definitely there. This serum was sent to me complimentary from REN Skincare. nan
