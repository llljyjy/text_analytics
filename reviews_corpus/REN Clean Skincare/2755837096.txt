I have oily skin already, and I live in Florida, so I usually stay away from facial oils. If I do use them I like to add them to my nighttime skin routine which is what I did with this one! I even used my gua shua with it and my skin drank it all up! Left me feeling hydrated and smooth! Great on oily skin too!
