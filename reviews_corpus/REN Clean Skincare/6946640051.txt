I have always loved Ren skincare for their amazing sensitive skin line. This oil is perfect for healing sensitive skin and I love to use it whenever my skin needs some extra TLC. It instantly calms the skin and helps repair the skin barrier. I recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin, acne prone skin, and after overexfoliation. It is amazing! Ren gifted me this facial oil, all opinions are my own. Perfect for sensitive skin
