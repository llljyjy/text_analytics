Things that are sensitive 1. Me 2. My skin While I’m still working on protecting my energy and not letting outside energy affect me as much, @renskincare works while I sleep to protect and soothe any signs of sensitivity from my skin. A quick look at this overnight recovery balm hand me thinking, she thicc but she’s actually pretty lightweight and not greasy at all. My skin is pretty thirsty 24/7 and with my recent rebrand I’ve been shooting a lot so it’s been nice to see how moisturized my skin feels when I have to wake up and head to a shoot. Nothing says moisturize your face girl like flaky skin. Fun fact, the ingredients are 100% clean and the cap is recyclable! Def recommend! Sensitive skin
