This is a miracle product!!! I have an autoimmune disease that causes dry, flaky, inflamed skin. I have searched far and wide and spent beaucoups of money on so many different brands that claim to have skincare lines for sensitive skin, only to find my skin more inflamed and irritated (looking at you, Murad and Kiehl’s). When you put this on, you feel instant relief from dry skin. It says to leave it on for 15 minutes; I leave mine on for closer to an hour. I use it before bed and when I wake up, my skin still feels as soft as a baby’s bottom. I am so grateful to finally have a product that soothes instead of irritates!!! Holy grail for dry, flaky skin!
