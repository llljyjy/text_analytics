I love skincare products with vitamin c, so I was very eager and excited to try this. This serum has a pretty thin liquidy consistency and fresh scent. It absorbs quickly and layers well with my other skincare products. I’ve been using this serum in my nighttime skincare routine for the past 2 weeks and I am loving it! It has made my skin so soft, smooth, even, and glowy. I now want to check out more products from Ren. It’s a fantastic serum that I would definitely recommend. I received this product complimentary from Ren in exchange for my honest review. Ren Radiance Serum
