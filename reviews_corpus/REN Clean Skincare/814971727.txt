I love this vitamin c serum! It does more than just brighten - it also firms, hydrates, protects and smooths texture. I learned that photoaging is responsible for 90% of the visible changes to the skin and this is clinically proven to visibly reduce the signs of photoaging in 14 days. This is a very lightweight serum with a lotion texture that blends and absorbs like a dream. It leaves my skin clear and bright and itâ€™s effective in delivering hydration with a dewy finish. The ingredients are like a dream! It includes three types of vitamin C to brighten and antioxidant-rich pomegranate, kakadu plum and dragon fruit help protect skin from free radical damage. It also contains moisture-boosting glycogen and hyaluronic acid. GLOWY & DEWY SKIN
