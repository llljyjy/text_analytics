When I went into this BzzAgent campaign I had never heard of REN but I’m always willing to try a new moisturizer.In general, it did seem to have a calming effect on my redness. It was good as a day moisturizer - exactly what it advertises itself to be - but I did try it in the evening as well. If you’re someone who doesn’t need a ton of moisture overnight it would work well for this but I found my skin still wanted more since it’s winter.As a day cream, though, it was a solid option. It’s not my favorite, and it’s a bit pricey for what you get, but I wasn’t unhappy with it and my skin enjoyed it as much as others I’ve tried. I was also pleasantly surprised to find it had no fragrance which is great in a product that’s supposed to reduce redness rather than irritate.Overall, if you have skin that’s prone to redness but not overly dry, this is a great product to give a try. Overall a good moisturizer
