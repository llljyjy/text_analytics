Recommended by Susan at Mixed Makeup and not only is this a holy grail that I’ve repurchased two times now, I’ve also gifted for XMAS. Before I was using this AM and PM but just recently switched to just PM. It made a dramatic difference in my texture and appearance of pores. My skin is SO smooth now. The only issue is that a regular cotton round is not good for this type of product because it will absorb and waste this liquid gold. Also, I preferred the pump, not sure why they got rid of it? I will also admit that at first it would make my face sting at first contact, but it was my first time using a chemical exfoliant so my skin was not used to some of the ingredients. Now my skin cannot live with out it. Give it a shot! Liquid Gold
