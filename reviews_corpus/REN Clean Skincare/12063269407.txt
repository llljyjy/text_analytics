I’ve become a huge advocate for REN’s overnight recovery balm ever since i was first introduced to it through influenster. While i received this one for complimentary, I’ve already purchased another one for my mom who shares my skin concerns. We both have dry skin that visibly lacks moisture retention every morning. Thos is to a point that on ceryain cold days, you could legit see dry patches of skin. The REN overnight recovery balm is a true elixir in that it has been able to supplement my skin with the right quantity of moisturizer and has done a good job at even retaining it overnight. I don’t wake up with those dry patches and strained skin anymore which is an incredible feeling. This balm also fits my clean beauty requirements, so I’m definitely going to be sticking around to this brand. Also, great gifting option to close family and friends that have similar skin concerns. Definitely recommend investing on this balm
