To be honest I used to be a little afraid of Toners. I tend to have dry skin so I was afraid that the alcohol which back in the day is what toners were notorious for kept me from using them. No stripping and drying out the skin for this girl. That being said toners are formulated now with more skin-friendly ingredients and offer many amazing benefits that do not dry the skin out. Instead they restore skin’s pH, minimize pores and hydrate or exfoliate, creating a complexion that’s more radiant and improving your skin’s overall texture. REN Clean Skincare Ready Steady Glow Daily AHA Tonic delivers brighter skin with a gentle toner that won’t irritate even sensitive skin with daily use. I was super excited when I heard that this toner didn’t have alcohol in it. REN is formulated with lactic acid and salicin from willow bark extract, which are gentle but still powerful with their exfoliating agents that brighten tired skin, break down buildup and minimize the appearance of pores. My overall thoughts: I loved the light citrus scent. It is not overpowering and dissipates quickly. After a couple weeks of using this product I have noticed my complexion looks clearer and brighter overall. I also have been using this on my daughters back and have noticed improvement in her to acne scars. I also believe my hyperpigmentation is a little lighter and overall my skin seemed to look plumper and more hydrated.
