Love this vitamin c serum!! My skin looks so glowy and youthful after using this serum despite the dry weather (I added after photos). This has a creamy yet lightweight texture that absorbs nicely in to the skin even though I have combination skin. I personally have sensitive skin and this vitamin c serum did not irritate my skin like some other vitamin c topicals. Also, I really appreciate the zero waste sustainable packaging. Complimentary from Red Beauty. nan
