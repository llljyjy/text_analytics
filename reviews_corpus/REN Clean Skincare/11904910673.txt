Gifted by REN Skincare. This vitamin c glow serum was just alright. It’s a nice, lightweight cream consistency that absorbs easily. Didn’t see any particularly brightening skin benefits, but it does leave my skin with a hydrated, healthy appearance. Not a fan of the artificially citrus scent, but it didn’t cause any skin irritation. Honestly quite expensive for the benefits it offered. Just alright..
