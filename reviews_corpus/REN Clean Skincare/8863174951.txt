Gifted by Ren skincare; review is my honest thoughts Ren has a very nice all-in-one, aptly named serum here that I suspect will work for most skin types.This is a formula that highlights vitamin c, antioxidants, and naturally occurring oils. The formula utilizes both vitamin c derivatives and plant ingredients that are naturally high in vitamin c. As such, it does not sting on contact nor require a low pH, making it suitable for even those who struggle with L-AAI appreciate that it smells pleasant but light. The texture is beautiful: light and creamy and rapidly sinks into skin.I have been using this for a couple of weeks now, and I am very pleased to say it has not been irritating on my somewhat more sensitive skin (whew!) The lovely packaging and cosmetic elegance has made this a product that I look forward to using. I prefer to pair vitamin c with sunscreen thus I have enjoyed this as a morning serum.As for my personal results: Upon application, my skin instantly looks more plump, and indeed more glowy. Over time, I have watched a mark on my chin fade before my eyes. This makes sense for me as vitamin c is a personal favorite on my skin for fighting hyperpigmentation.Overall, Iâ€™m very pleased with this serum! Great vitamin c serum!
