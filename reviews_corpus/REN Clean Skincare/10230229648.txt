This face oil is one of my favorites, a lot of other face oils I’ve tried are overly scented or have added fragrances and this one does not which I love. It has really great ingredients, and I pay it on I’ve my moisturizer to lock in the moisture. I am really enjoying it. I also love that it is sustainably packaged. nan
