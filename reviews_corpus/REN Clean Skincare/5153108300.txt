This is a great cleanser! Been wanting to try it for a while and after my old oil cleanser ran out, decided to finally give it a go. Takes makeup off no problem and I love the smell. I use this as a first cleanse. I follow up with something else lighter or just the REN Ready Steady Glow and my skin looks great. nan
