Delivers hydration and soothing for sensitive or irritated skin. It’s perfect to use after at-home peels. Very lightweight and no heavy scent. A little goes a long way. I received the sample free and I’ve purchased another jar already.The container is small but the product is concentrated. Literally melts easily into the skin. Highly recommend! Hydrating and Soothing Balm
