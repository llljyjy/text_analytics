I recieved this product complimetary from beautytap in exchange for my honest review and feedback. I would never let this impact ,y thoughts or my review of the brand or product.I have used this product for a while now and I really do enjoy it. The brand REN has been a favorite of mine for a while now, ever since I needed an effective skincare brand to use when I was pregnant over 11 years ago. It is a very no-frills, yet effective skincare product that fits beautifully into my routine. It’s a nice gentle, daily exfoliator thats not abrasive or too strong. On me, it doesn’t sting or burn but also keep in mind I don’t use it if I have broken skin or any dry irritated patches. I also like to use it on my neck to prep for my skicare products. If you use too much it can be a LITTLE sticky tho, so be mindful of that. nan
