I alternate between this product and Tretinoin 0.05% for my pm routine. This product has seriously helped give me the best skin I have had in a long time! Definitely a staple. Just don’t forget your SPF (as always) as this product will make you more sensitive to the sun since it’s an exfoliant. Great Staple!
