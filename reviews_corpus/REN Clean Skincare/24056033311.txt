This was gifted by REN Skincare to me for review, but my opinions are my own. I love Vitamin C products, and this is no exception! I’ve been using this serum for close to 2 weeks now and I’m already starting to notice a difference. My skin has a lovely glow to it and feels more hydrated. I personally use it in the mornings and make sure to follow up with spf. Definitely worth trying out if you’re interested in Vitamin C products! nan
