I loved the Radiance Vitamin C Glow Serum gifted by REN Skincare. Itâ€™s certainly a staple in my skin care regimen. It provides a really nice glow to your skin and helps remove dullness. It contains some interesting ingredients like kakadu plum, dragon fruit, and pomegranate to even skin tone and protect skin barrier. With sustainable packaging, all REN products are wonderful to use. I use it during night time because vitamin C tends to oxidize and turn brown. Glow serum
