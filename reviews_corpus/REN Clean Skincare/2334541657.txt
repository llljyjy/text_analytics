I have recently gotten into using facial oils into my daily routine; mainly at night. At first, I didn’t like it because I felt like it wasn’t adding anything. However, I have noticed that it does give me a nice glow without looking oily. It is very lightweight so it doesn’t feel like there’s too much sitting on your face either. I did notice a few bumps forming on my forehead. I’m not sure if it is due to the product or stress though. nan
