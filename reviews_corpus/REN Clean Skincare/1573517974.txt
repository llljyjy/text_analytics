Evercalm Barrier Support Facial Oil Is such a needed addition to my skincare routine. I started a stringer retinol treatment that is causing slight skin peeling. I use this after retinol, and noticed the flaky  skin is very much smoothed out and makeup applies beautifully without caking on top! It doesnâ€™t feel heavy, absorbs quickly and the scent is refreshing and light. nan
