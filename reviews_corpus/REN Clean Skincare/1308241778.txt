So this was gifted to me by Ren Skincare. So thank you! First off, smells so good lol. I know random, but the dragon fruit and pomegranate gives it a delightful aroma. Second is suitable for sensitive skin which I have due to allergies. Plus vitamin c is absolutely amazing for evening out your skin tone. Great
