I love this day cream! I have such dry and sensitive skin and this cream is the perfect moisturizer and is packed with soothing ingredients to provide hydration for my skin and also protect it from environmental stress, while minimizing irritation for my skin. Not only is this product great for the skin, but it is also vegan, cruelty-free, and gluten-free, and comes in recyclable packaging. Overall, a great product for sensitive or dull looking skin. Would definitely recommend! great day cream!
