I have been struggling with hormonal acne and I was running left right and centre to try so many products on my skin but it was only making it worse. A friend suggested that maybe my skin barrier is compromised and I landed on REN. This has been a game changer. The oil is super light weight and gets absorbed by the skin in lightening speed. This has really healed my skin from the inside. I feel any makeup that I apply now versus before using REN - it is so much more better. The skin feels healthy, not itchy or sensitive or burning. THANKS REN! LIFE SAVIOUR! Best Buy for troubled SKin barrier!
