This product has a very unique texture. It feels very moisture when I touch it but then it feels a little bit oily when I apply some to the skin. However it absorbs quickly so that you won’t feel it any more. It can keep my skin hydrated for a long time. Given the size of the product, I guess it’s not supposed to be used for the whole face but only on the extremely dry area. It doesn’t have strong fragrance. I would buy it if my skin gets very dry in the winter. nan
