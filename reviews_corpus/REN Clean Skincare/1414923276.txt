Post pregnancy and my skin is crazy! This day cream helps calm my skin when it starts to get irritated. I love that it’s unscented so it doesn’t bother my baby. I already use their aha toner and so I wanted to expand into their line since it worked so well for me. Love the pump so it’s sanitary and easy to use. Not as hydrating as I would like but a good day cream for sensitive skin. nan
