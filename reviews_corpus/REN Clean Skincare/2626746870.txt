This product is amazing! For several weeks I have been trying to get rid of my maskne scars all over my cheek and chin areas, I never struggled with acne before so it’s really been bringing me down. I tried several expensive and inexpensive brands of face masks, peels and niacinamide and tranexamic acid treatments, with minimal changes to these scars. I recently bought this on sale because I remembered how clear it left my skin once when a makeup artist used this on me back when Sephora did makeup appointments. Last night I put it on, I have sensitive skin and it did sting for the first 10 minutes and then looked a bit sticky, but I followed the instructions of using a cream and then I  added a few drops of Inkey list niacinamide drops on the scars. I woke up today and my scars (which again I’ve been struggling with and haven’t seen major improvement on) were visibly faded! Within ONE treatment! I’m so glad I have this product now, the amount of money I spend at Sephora I promise you this is one of the best items I have invested in. I hope this review helps anyone who has been going through this struggle, I know how defeating it can feel at times, and if you are on the fence about this one just try the mini and see if it works for you too. Worth the money I paid
