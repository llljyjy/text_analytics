This day cream works decently well. It’s easy to use--I really like the packaging. It stays clean after each use. It has a scent that’s a little stronger than I expected; it’s not bad, but it’s noticeable. I do notice that I need to use more than the suggested amount in order to feel somewhat moisturized. I haven’t noticed a huge improvement in my skin after using it for a few weeks, but my skin hasn’t gotten any worse! Overall, I think it’s a decent product. nan
