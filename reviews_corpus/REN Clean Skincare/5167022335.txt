I like the creamy texture of this serum- vitamin C serums are usually more watery in my experience and this is a little thicker and more hydrating. My skin is easily bothered by vitamin C serums, but I havenâ€™t had any issues with this bothering my skin. I like to pair my vitamin C with antioxidants, so I love that this is formula is chock-full of antioxidants too. I appreciate that Ren has a commitment to zero-waste packaging as well. I received this serum complimentary from Ren skincare, and it has surpassed my expectations thus far. nan
