This product is complimentary from REN Skincare. I use this vitamin C on my morning routine and sometimes I just followed it with my sunscreen and I’m good for the day. I love how easy it’s to spread on the skin and how fast it absorbs. It’s not heavy at all and leaves my skin with a subtle glow after the application. Haven’t seen any drastic changes but so far is my go to am serum nan
