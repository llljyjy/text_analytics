Absolutely loveeee this Vitamin C serum and i have used over 15 other brands and this is one of the best ones out there. The texture is great, not sticky or oily on the skin. I can wear it under my makeup without it getting oily during the day. I have seen a great improvement in my sun spots as well as old acne scars from the past. I love how bright and even my skin looks. I will continue using this. This was gifted by REN skincare, but the opinion is my own. Great for correcting dark spots
