I received this product complimentary from REN Skincare and love! It has a really nice subtle smell, but not too overpowering. It is very thin and feels great on my skin without being too sticky or leaving a bad residue. I’ve tried a number of Vitamin C products and this is one of my favorites. I’ve already noticed my skin starting to glow! Nice smell
