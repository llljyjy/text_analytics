Immediately YES! Used it right away & it absorbs beautifully. I don’t mind a bit of an oily oil since I have dry skin, but this was dry to the touch & it still felt like it was working hard. I’ve been working in the office again & my skin has been super dry from it. I needed this boost! My skin feels comforted, hydrated & less itchy than it did before this oil.  A nice glow & soft soothed skin. Immediately a fan!!!! Bottle of CALM.
