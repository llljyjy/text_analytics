I received a sample of this product and I really like it so far. I put a small amount over my face in the night after my skincare routine. This product goes on very smoothly and feels so soft on my skin. When I get up in the morning my skin feels hydrated and has a nice rich glow. I can see myself buying this balm to use again in the near future. nan
