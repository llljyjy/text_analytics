With my “rosy” complexion, I have long been a fan of the Ren Evercalm line.  The new Barrier Support Elixir is a welcome addition to the family.  I do have dry skin, made more sensitive with Tretinoin use.  I love this light, dry oil as the second to last step in my skincare routine, right before sunscreen.  It supports my barrier and microbiome to prevent flakes through the day, and also reduces redness within minutes.  The results speak for themselves! Healthy Skin is IN!
