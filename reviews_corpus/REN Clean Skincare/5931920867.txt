Can’t really recommend this one. Its a good moisturizer, texture is nice and creamy and seems to soak in just fine if you use sparingly. However, it really seemed to make the shadows under my eyes look much worse. I’m not sure why but it did the opposite of brightening and made me look ill. I stopped using and my under eye area looks better. So, not really a good product for me for the intended purpose, but others may have a different experience Makes dark shadows under eyes look worse
