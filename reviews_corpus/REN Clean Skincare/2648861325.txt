I received this product complimentary from REN Skincare. Vitamin C serums are a staple in my morning skincare routine and this one from Ren is a good one. It has a gentle formula so it doesn’t irritate my skin when I apply it. And although I can’t really see any significant improvement on my skin from one week of using, my skin stays smooth and glowing. It has pretty a good consistency and absorbs pretty fast into my skin, which I like. Great Vitamin C Serum
