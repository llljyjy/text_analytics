Ok so I’m not going to lie, my skin looks amazing. I’ll be the first to admit, I’m very new to the whole AHA/BHA acid life. And I’m the interest of being totally honest, I can feel most acids on my skin because of the ingredients and my skin is not at all used to acids. Other estheticians have told me it takes some getting used to if it wasn’t already in the routine. I was someone using regular toner but I can say that my skin is requiring more due to aging. Off rip, the toner kind of burned the first couple of times I put it on with one of those times being right after I exfoliated which the bottle said not to do but I didn’t read it until afterwards so reading is fundamental. This product is already an exfoliant so using one prior to putting this on will burn. I can’t stress that enough. It definitely gives an instant glow which I thought was very unique as most toners I’ve used mattify the skin. It also didn’t leave my skin feeling so dry after application. I tried the toner by itself and underneath my makeup and loved both. I can definitely see all the praise worthy claims and the improvements in my skin from using this product. My only issue getting my skin used to acids so it doesn’t burn so much.**This review was created through an educational promotional event hosted between the brand and beauty experts.** Im new to AHA's
