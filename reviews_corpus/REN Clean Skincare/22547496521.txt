Evercalm Overnight Recovery Balm had my skin feeling amazing! I get dry patches in the cold winter months, and this really soothed my skin. It soaks in easily and has a sheen to it, but easily washes off during your morning routine. My skin felt smooth and silky; it didnâ€™t feel sticky. For $50, this is an occasional treat, but definitely worth it. Winter is Coming!!
