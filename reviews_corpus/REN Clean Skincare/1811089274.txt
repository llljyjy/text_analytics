I usually love Ren products and the Ren Ready Steady Glow AHA Tonic is a new must have for me. I used the product a couple of times a week for a few weeks and I am happy with the results. Definitely helped brighten my skin and smooth out my fine lines without causing any irritation. I have dry skin and due to environmental allergies itâ€™s also been very sensitive as of late. However the skin on my face has stayed healthy and I really attribute it to using the Ren glow tonic. So many nice ingredients that work well together to provide results. My only complaint is the packaging, it would be nice if there was a stopper. glow tonic
