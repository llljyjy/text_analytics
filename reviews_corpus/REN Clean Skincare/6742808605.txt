I haven’t tried many REN  Skincare products, but I was gifted by REN Skincare this Vitamin C Serum. I love that this is super fruit powered with Kakadu Plum( + Vitamin C to help brighten the skin) Dragon Fruit(prebiotics & minerals to strengthen skin barrier) and Pomegranate(Omega 5 to help soothe & protect). It has a nice scent, a little goes a long way and it is fast absorbing on the skin. I’ all for a good brightening serum. My skin can’t get enough Vitamin C. nan
