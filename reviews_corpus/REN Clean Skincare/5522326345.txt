I am loving this oil. I used it before going to sleep and woke up with such smooth skin. I think this is such a good product for restoring your skins barrier and was extremely soothing when applied. It gave me a really nice glow and I even applied before makeup for a smooth base. Overall really good face oil that doesnt feel heavy on the skin at all. Really nice oil
