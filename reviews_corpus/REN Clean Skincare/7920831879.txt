I use a hydrating toner daily so I was excited to try this REN Ready Set Glow Daily AHA toner. The packaging of this toner is super simple and I love that the bottle and cap are designed for recycling! This toner claims to exfoliate, brighten, tighten and hydrate for a smooth, even and energized complexion. After washing my face with a cleanser I will get a cotton round and apply the toner on it and then apply to my face. This product has a very subtle exfoliation in my opinion and that’s what it states. That it is gentle enough to use daily. The toner contains azelaic acid and that helps even skin tone, reduce pigmentation as well as brighten your complexion. After using this daily, my face does seem brighter but I don’t feel that it hydrates like it claims. This toner also contains sugar cane and that is the exfoliating acid. If you’re using this you have to make sure you apply SPF afterwards! nan
