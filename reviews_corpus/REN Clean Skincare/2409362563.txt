I received this product complimentary from REN Skincare. I have hyperpigmentation and blemish scars, so I always look for a good vitamin C serum. This serum is pretty good! I love the scent, very pleasant. It is lightweight, and absorbs well into my skin. No sticky residue. I love the healthy glow it gives me! The main ingredients are superfruits, Kakadu Plum, Dragon Fruit, and Pomegranate, very nourishing. The package is completely recycleable, glad to see this brand that is environmental friendly. nan
