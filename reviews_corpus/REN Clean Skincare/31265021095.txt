Complimentary from Ren Skincare but opinions are my own! This is new brand for me but it is safe to say that I am a big fan of this brand. This vit c cream is so effective. Lately, I have been trying a lot of various vitamin C products. So far I have tried couple vit c moisturizers so I think I have a pretty good idea when it comes to effectiveness of this product. Letâ€™s talk about the product itself.It applies beautifully. It almost glides on like a butter which I adore. It has very smooth texture. It absorbs fairly quickly without any greasy feel which is absolutely perfect. After application my skin has healthy glow which is so amazing . My skin feels soft, supple and well nourished. This moisturizer did not cause irritation on my face. No breakouts and no rashes thankfully. After 1 week of use, my face has been brightened and evened up. My dark spots became lighter and less visible. I am loving it so so much. I would highly reccomend. Amazing
