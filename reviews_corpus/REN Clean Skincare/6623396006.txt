I received this product complimentary from REN Skincare for the purposes of trying it out and providing my honest opinion.  I am 37 years old, have used anti-aging products for a couple of years, and wear sunscreen daily. I’ve been using this product for a bit under two weeks so it is still new to my skincare routine but I find that it makes my skin look smoother and softer. I didn’t observe much in the way of glowing or brightness but maybe that’s because I am in my late 30’s and need a little longer for that effect to pull through. However, even in the amount of time I’ve been using it, my skin is looking lovely and makeup has been laying beautifully. I’ve limited the usage of other skincare products with actives in my skincare routine so I know the results I see are of this product. nan
