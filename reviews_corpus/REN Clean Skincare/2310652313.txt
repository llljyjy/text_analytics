My skin looks SO good. It’s the dreary colder months in Boston, and often in addition to dryness my skin is just dull throughout the winter. This serum brightened me up after just a few uses and also improved my skin tone. It comes with a lot in the bottle, has a nice consistency and smell, and absorbs quickly so you can layer your other products and even makeup over it. I used this multiple days as my base layer skincare for skiing, and by the end of the day when I took my mask and goggles off I felt like my skin was glowing. I credit the superfruit ingredients for transformation, and the packaging is zero waste so not only do you look good, you’ll feel good. I received his product complimentary from REN Skincare. You Glow, Girl
