I have very sensitive/oily/acne prone skin w/rosacea and it’s difficult for me to find products that work and also don’t make my skin worse.  I’ve tried marula oil in the past and I loved how my skin felt but ended up w/clogged pores.  So I decided to give the Barrier Support oil a try, and I really love it.  I’m halfway through the bottle and will repurchase.  I mix 4-5 drops in with my moisturizer at night, either alone or after my retinol, warm it in my hands and pat onto my face, chest, and neck.  It feels so soothing, there’s no irritation or break outs from this.  I also feel like it calms my skin and I’m less oily the next day.  Highly recommend. Great for sensitive/acne prone skin
