This is a very lightweight serum that easily layer with the rest of my skincare routine. It feels smooth when applied and provide a healthy glow. I don’t see a huge improvements yet on my recent hyperpigmentation but my skin sure is looking so radiant and alive. The only downside for me is the fragrance. I have sensitive skin although it hasn’t broken me out yet. I would be very cautious if you have extreme sensitivity to fragrance. This is gifted by REN Skincare. Good option!
