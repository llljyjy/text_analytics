I have been using this product for about a week now and I’m noticing more of a glow in my complexion! However, I haven’t noticed a change in my hyperpigmentation and discoloration.  Also, the fragrance/scent is a bit much for me. It’s great that this product is sustainable and has superfood ingredients! I’m going to continue using this in hopes I see even more improvement in my complexion!I was gifted by REN Skincare! Get that glowww
