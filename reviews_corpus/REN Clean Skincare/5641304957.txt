I have extremely dry and dehydrated skin during the winter. When I try to apply makeup it sticks to the dry patches and truthfully it looks so bad that I generally take it back off. I miss wearing makeup. I miss not being embarrassed about my skin. I went in the store and explained my situation to the staff. Upon her recommendation I bought this, and for me this is not a cheap price tag. It is ok. It make any skin feel soft but itâ€™s still very dry, I still get flakes. If you need occasional hydration and it is more of a surface problem then this should work just fine. There is a very mild natural scent, and the company being certified leaping bunny is huge for me. I just wish that it would have made a bigger difference. Sad and Dehydrated
