okay, I’ve never used a Ren product before but I bought this for my baby sister, who has super oily combination skin and chronic acne (since childhood). she used it for the first time last night and we noticed some immediate results! her forehead was smooth, her skin was softer, and some of the redness from her recent flare up had already died down. it was a 4/5 right then and there. she didn’t LOVE it, but she was definitely happy with the results and probably would have repurchased just for that. here’s the thing: she went to sleep. well, I woke her up a few minutes ago and her acne is all but GONE. It’s like she’s weeks out from a breakout instead of hours. my mom and I could not believe our eyes. she is SO happy and her skin is baby soft.  after ONE application. 10/5 will be purchasing again and we will absolutely be trying the rest of this line.
