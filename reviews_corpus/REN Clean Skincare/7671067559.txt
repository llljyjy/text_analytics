This is my favorite toner. I have been faithfully using it since 2019. I’ve repurchased it at least four times now. However, within the last year REN redesigned the bottle to remove the pump dispenser for the product. This is upsetting because the pump allowed me to get the right amount of product every time. With the new bottle set up, I get too much product on my cotton pad which leaves me with a lot more wasted product and a sticky residual feeling on the skin. The old pump was perfect and I hope REN reconsiders bringing it back. Otherwise this formula is wonderful. I have oily skin with more noticeable pores. When I use this product I feel that my skin is lightly exfoliated and tightens. It has never caused my skin to become dry. I recently implemented a retinol into my morning routine within the last month, along with using this product and my skin has not dried out. Considering the issues I have with getting too much product on the cotton pad, that says something. I think that the product is wonderful and recommend it. I don’t plan on ever purchasing other toners as a result of how well it works for me even though I dislike the new dispenser. It’s the only reason this product is getting four stars instead of five.Formula is five stars easilyDispenser is a three. Favorite Toner - Miss the Pump Dispenser
