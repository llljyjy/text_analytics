I’ve tried quite a few Vitamins C serums and this has to be my favorite one ! The texture of this is light weight and  watery consistency so it absorbs into the skin. It also mixes well with other products so this is a plus ! My skin is left with such a nice glow. This serum has really helped the appearance of my skin, it’s doesn’t leave my skin sticky. Love that it contains super fruits like dragon fruit, pomegranate and kakadu plum also their sustainable packaging. Over all I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a vitamin C serum. This was gifted by REN skinacare Best vitamin C serum I’ve tried !
