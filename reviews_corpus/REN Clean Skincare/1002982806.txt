I love this product, the smell and texture and glow is all worth it. Iâ€™ve always loved Ren products and never had any irritating or sensitivity to their products the sustainability and formulation and packaging has always been amazing and thoughtful! I use two pumps of this serum every morning after another serum and the glow and hydrating feel it gives without being thick is everything! The smell is beautiful and citrus but soft and not strong and goes away within seconds, the texture is lightweight not a gel, not a cream but amazing!! I would definitely recommend and re purchase! This was gifted by REN skincare to try and I love it! Love this serum
