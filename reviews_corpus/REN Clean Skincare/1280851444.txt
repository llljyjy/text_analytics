This is a great lightweight day cream but it misses the mark on some level’s I probably wouldn’t use this in the winter bc my face needs something heavier. But with someone with acne prone and sensitive skin, I do this this moisturizer works. There is just nothing spectacular about it. great lightweight moisturizer but a bit basic
