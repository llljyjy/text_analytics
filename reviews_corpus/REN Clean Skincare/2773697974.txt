I’m a big fan of the Ren Evercalm line, and was so excited to try this oil. It lived up to my hopes and expectations! This isn’t scented which is really nice because those sensitive to fragrance can use it. It’s packed full of really great moisturizing ingredients. It sank into my skin so nicely after application and didn’t disrupt any of my other skincare. My boyfriend has some dry spots and this oil has really been helping with them! Love the Evercalm oil!
