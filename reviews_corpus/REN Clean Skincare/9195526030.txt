This is a really good facial oil. I have always tried to say away from using oils on my face because they broke me out but this one is different. This didnâ€™t irritate my skin or break it out. I love using it under my makeup to give it a nice glow from within look. Its very nourishing and hydrating on the skin. Such good quality product and the price is right. Hydrating
