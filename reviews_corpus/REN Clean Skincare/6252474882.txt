I am so happy with this oil! It’s lightweight and doesn’t clog my pores, but as an addition to my skincare routine it’s ridiculously hydrating. I like to apply right after serum and moisturizer to seal everything in at night. If you’re buying this, keep in mind that it is an oil, so it’s an occlusive— it’ll keep everything under it in, and everything over it out. The hydration comes from whatever you apply before it!
