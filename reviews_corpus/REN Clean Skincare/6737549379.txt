This serum sinks in very quickly and has a very lightweight texture. It rubs into my skin almost instantly and doesn’t leave behind a sticky residue. I wish the bottle wasn’t clear glass since Vit C is known to my photo sensitive. This was gifted by REN Skincare. Great product, wish it had better packaging
