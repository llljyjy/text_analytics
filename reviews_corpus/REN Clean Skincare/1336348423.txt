I am so excited about the Radiance Vitamin C Glow Serum that REN Skincare gifted me! The Radiance Vitamin C Glow Serum is a nice light weight moisturizer that is perfect for a morning skincare routine. It has a light refreshing scent that dissipates quickly while the serum absorbs into the skin just as quickly without any residue or tackiness. I love that it is made with super fruits such as dragon fruit, Kakadu plum, and pomegranate seed oil! My skin feels so soft and hydrated after using the REN Skincare Radiance Vitamin C Glow Serum.I would definitely recommend this product to anyone including people with sensitive skin. Nice light weight moisturizer for AM routines
