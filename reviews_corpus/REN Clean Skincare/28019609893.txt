First of all, I love the glass pump packaging, and the fact that they made it lockable so an outer lid is not needed. It has a refreshing citrus scent. This has the consistency of a lightweight moisturizer. It absorbs fast and gives a natural glow. I canâ€™t attest to long term claims but I am loving how it feels on my skin so far.
