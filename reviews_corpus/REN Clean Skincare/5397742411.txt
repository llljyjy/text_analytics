REN’s Vitamin C serum makes my skin look and feel super glowy and healthy. I love the super fruit ingredients that it’s made with like Kakadu Blu, Dragon Fruit, and Pomegranate since these aren’t ingredients usually included in many skincare products. The antioxidants really do help protect your skin and help even out your skin tone, which is something I tend to struggle with during the dry winter months! This was gifted by REN Skincare. nan
