I was gifted this product by REN in exchange for my honest review. I really love this product! It’s a no-nonsense, fragrance free facial oil rich in fatty acids to support the skin barrier. I think the marketing here can be a little bit confusing I’m not sure what an ’elixir’ is supposed to mean but just know it’s a facial oil. Love this facial oil
