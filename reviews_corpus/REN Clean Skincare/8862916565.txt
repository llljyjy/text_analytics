Let’s start with my skin type to help understand how this product worked for me. I have combination/oily skin for the most part but there are certain spots on my face around the chin that would dry pretty bad, causing flakiness/redness. I’m typically not sensitive to any products but there are times when over exfoliating my face caused too much dryness for me. I have recently also shifting my focus towards clean beauty and value skincare companies that believe in clean, naturally derived ingredients, backed by science. I have used a Ren cleanser before and loved it so I was willing to try their moisturizer, and I have to say, I am a big fan of Ren Skincare. This moisturizer goes on so smooth without feeling heavy or greasy on my face, and absorbs beautifully into my skin. The scent is very mild and I love it because I don’t like any heavy fragrances other than the natural ingredients. The blackcurrant seed and the camellia oil is indeed very calming to the skin especially during the dry winter days and helps to fortify the skin barrier without feeling too heavy on the skin. I absolutely love this moisturizer and would definitely incorporate it in my skincare routine. I typically use it after my Drunk Elephant or Kiehl’s serum and/or a face oil (depending on the weather) and followed up with a sunscreen; yet it’s never felt too heavy or greasy for me. I would highly recommend this moisturizer to anyone looking for clean beauty and a nice, creamy moisturizer to calm and soothe their skin. nan
