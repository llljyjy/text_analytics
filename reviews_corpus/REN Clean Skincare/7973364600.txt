Honestly never write reviews, but want to warn others!! The first time I used this oil I loved it so I bought the whole skin care line… but then after using it for one week everyday it made my skin dry and has completely ruined my skin barrier. My skin is dry, especially around the mouth area and cannot retain moisture that well and am now prone to breakouts. It’s been a month and half later and my skin is still messed up. I have some skin sensitivities but now it’s like most skin products I used to use before are sensitive to my face. Ruined my skin barrier!!
