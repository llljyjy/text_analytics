I’m someone who has to have vitamin c serums in my daily skin care routine and I’m always looking for better ones. This glow and protect serum gifted by REN Skincare is one of the best ones Iv used. It’s not watery/runny and is more like a serum consistency which I really like. It’s also not sticky on my oily skin which is another thing that I look for in a vitamin c serum. I have yet to see the brightening effect from it but so far I’m loving this product Feels great on the skin
