The superpower ingredients are what really got me excited about thIs Radiance Vitamin C Serum.  Including kakadu plum, dragon fruit, and pomegranate! I was also really pleased to see that the pump was made with 50% post-consumer recycled plastic and the glass bottle is recyclable as well. The serum is lightweight and applies nicely.
