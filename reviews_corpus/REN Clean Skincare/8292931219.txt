I was apprehensive about trying Ren Clean Evercalm Overnight Recovery Balm once I opened it and felt it for the first time. I just knew it would clog my pores leading to a breakout because of it’s consistency. I applied it for the first time and was impressed with the results the following morning. My face appeared hydrated, soft and smooth. I’ve received compliments saying I look well rested and that I’m glowing. I didn’t realize I wasn’t looking my best before use of REN. I’ve included a pic of myself after use, Not too bad for being almost 50 years young! I’m so thankful that BzzAgent chose me to try this stuff in exchange for my honest review, as I usually just stick with my “go to brand” since it’s tried & true. I may go out of my comfort zone and experiment with other skincare products. I recommend trying REN if your face is in need of some TLC. Magic in a Jar
