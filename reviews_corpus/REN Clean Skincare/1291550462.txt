I’ve been searching for my HG for my sensitive, combo, acne-prone, scarred and textured skin ever since TO alpha lipoic acid was discontinued. I’ve tried various AHA formulations but was never super impressed, but I thought I’d give the mini bottle a try during rouge sale. I’M SO GLAD I DID! Started with 3x a week and now I use it daily. My skin is looking incredible. All of my old acne scars are gone. Pores? What pores? Fine lines are barely visible. Clears acne fast and treats those little bumps under the skin before it turns into acne. Wears well under makeup (with high spf of course). Beat part? A little goes a looong way. I only use a few drops, so the price isn’t terrible. Don’t even hesitate. Just buy it now. INCREDIBLE OMG
