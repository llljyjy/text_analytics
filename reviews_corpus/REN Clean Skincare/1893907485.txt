This serum is very light and fast absorbing with a subtle sheen. Iâ€™m not crazy about the clay-like fragrance, but it quickly goes away after the product is fully absorbed in the skin. I love the sustainable packaging with a recyclable glass bottle and pump made with 50% post consumer recycled plastic. Gifted by REN. nan
