Oh such a good one! Itâ€™s my first time trying this serum - gifted by REK Skincare. Lightweight and gentle, no harsh ingredients or perfumes, leaves my skin feeling moisturised and glowing. I love that it has clean ingredients and earth-friendly packaging. The price is super affordable which is a big yes too! :) Good one!
