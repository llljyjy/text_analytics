I have never been a lover for face oils because I have oily skin â€” but I was so wrong!! My face feels so hydrated, smooth, and calm. I love how it absorbs and sinks into my skin. I use this as the last step of my routine to lock in all the goodness on my face. My face looks and feels so refreshed in the morning. Love this oil!
