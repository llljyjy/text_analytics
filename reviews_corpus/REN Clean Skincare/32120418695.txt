One of the best things about this product is how clean it is and the ingredients. I ran it in the Yuka app and it came back 100/100 which is super rare for makeup products! So that was great. I use after cleaning my face at night and then applied a few drops to my hands and rubbed it in. It feels very light on the face and is not greasy at all. I get some irritation and redness to my face and this has helped calm and soothe my skin. I wish it added a bit more hydration though. Overall I would definitely recommend and am eager to try other REN products. I was gifted this for my honest review. nan
