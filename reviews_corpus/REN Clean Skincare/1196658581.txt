This is a beautiful, luxurious, and moisturizing serum. It didn’t break me out or dry my skin. I noticed slight brightness/glowing in my face in one week which is really amazing! I’ve used other Vitamin C serum before (SF and Klairs) and this one is my favorite. It’s also different from other Vitamin C serum because it doesn’t have that runny liquidy feel, it has more of a creamy texture to it. Not to mention the super fruit infused ingredients that is used! All in all, this is such a beautiful serum and I highly recommend it! PS. Double win for sustainability and sustainably packaged! This was kindly gifted by REN Skincare, all opinions are my own. Beautiful, luxurious, and moisturizing serum
