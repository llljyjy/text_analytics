i got this gifted by REN Skincare but i have to be honest and say this is one of the first vitamin C serums i’ve tried and absolutely LOVE. i have no complaints for this. i noticed brightening, glossiness, hydration, and evening of my dark spots. i’m really so impressed with the formula and the texture of the serum being lightweight too. my favorite daily product now!!! 10/10 INSANE
