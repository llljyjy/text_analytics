It’s nice and I like the lightweight non greasiness for a good day cream. Scent isn’t too heavy and it works well enough to even out skin tone. It’s just not as much of a luxury product as the price would lead you to believe. It’s not much more than a couple of drug store of health food store products but priced at least $10-15 more. I think it’s a good product but the price is above average Nice lotion overall but costly for what it is
