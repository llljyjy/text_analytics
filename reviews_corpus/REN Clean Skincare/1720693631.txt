I was gifted by Ren Skincare this serum. I love a vitamin C serum for how well they work against dark circles. This one has some nice ingredients. I don’t necessarily care for the smell. It’s not heavy or anything, but it’s got a naturalness to it that I’m not keen on. I like the packaging being recyclable. The serum itself dries down nicely without being tacky or sticky. nan
