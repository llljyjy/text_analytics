Alright. I’ve used this product multiple times, and my skin does NOT like it at all. I’m fair skinned, and it does have a white cast, and after wearing it for a while, the white cast goes away, but the oily smell to it kind of puts me off. Also. I wear my face mask when I’m out in public, and this SPF completely greases up my mask like no other! Lol anyway. I age extremely oily skin, and this claims to be “mattifying”. I mean sure it does kind of mattify my skin, but then within an hour my oily skin dissolves this. It does work under the sun, don’t get me wrong. It does protect the skin from UV damage. Would I purchase this again? Nope. I prefer something that’s not as heavy as this. OH! And this clogs my pores a lot! Beware!!!! nan
