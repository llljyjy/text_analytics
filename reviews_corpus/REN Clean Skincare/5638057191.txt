The last few years I have been the beauty retail industry, I’ve been introduced to more and more acid based skincare. Anyone who has seen my other reviews knows I don’t hold back in my honesty. And this time I have to say the smell of the product just was not my favorite, so it is losing a star for that reason. This toner does do as advertised though, it leaves your skin feeling tight and looking less dull. It has not only an AHA, but also a BHA to fight dead skin cells even more. As someone with skin that runs on the dry side that is not always my favorite sensation, so I moisturize as soon as the product is absorbed to help ease that sensation. I also only use acid based skincare like this a couple of times a week. I do have to say that one of my favorite features of this product was the packaging. Particularly how easy it was to apply this toner to a reusable cotton round. No pumping mechanism means easier recycling once you are done with this toner, but it is also less messy application in my experience. I also have to give the brand kudos for their care of the environment, being a zero waste company. A unique experience.
