I am loving this serum! It has a thicker consistency than most other vitamin C serums and absorbs quickly. She gives a nice glow to the skin. Works well underneath makeup. The scent is delightfully fresh without added fragrance. The ingredients are clean and right up my alley. This comes in a gorgeous glass bottle and the pump is made from recycled plastic. Love sustainable packaging! Product gifted by REN skincare. nan
