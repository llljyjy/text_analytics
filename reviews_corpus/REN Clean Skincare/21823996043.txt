Iâ€™m honestly floored by how gorgeous my skin looks and feels when I put this on. It is a heavy cream but my skin instantly absorbes it leaving absolutely no greasy feel. It actually smooths the texture of my skin leaving it with a mattified look. I almost want to use it in the morning before applying make-up but I understand it is for night use. Amazing
