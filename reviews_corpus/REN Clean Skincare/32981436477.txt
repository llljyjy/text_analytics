This was gifted by REN skincare and I have been using this glow serum after washing my face in the morning, the night, and underneath my makeup. This stuff is SO beautiful, it gives such a natural glow to the skin and has really made it feel amazing. If you donâ€™t like scented products this might now be right for you, but I love the citrusy smell. The zero waste packaging is also a HUGE plus for me personally. If you can afford to treat yourself with this, I highly recommend. Great Serum:)
