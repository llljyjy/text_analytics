This was given to me complimentary from REN skincare, in exchange for my honest opinion. I have tried a few vitamin C serums before, and can truly say that this one has worked the best for my skin - I have fair, sensitive skin with a lot of hyperpigmentation to it. This serum has not caused any issues with my skin, and has it looking brighter and smoother already (daily use ~2 weeks in). I am excited to keep using it and seeing how much my skin improves. I would recommend it to anyone looking to add Vitamin C to their routine. nan
