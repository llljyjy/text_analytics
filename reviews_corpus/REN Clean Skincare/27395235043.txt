*Complimentary from REN Skincare.* This is a super gentle antioxidant serum. I love that Kakadu plum, dragon fruit and pomegranate seed oil are included in the formula. All of these are amazing antioxidants to help protect my skin from the sun. The texture is a very light lotion texture and I use about 3-4 pumps for my face and neck. It does my skin look more radiant, but I don’t like the scent of this serum. There is added fragrance and it’s somewhere between citrus and plastic that is pretty off-putting. I also don’t love that it’s sometimes marketed as a vitamin C serum since ascorbyl phosphate is very low on the ingredients list which is very deceiving. nan
