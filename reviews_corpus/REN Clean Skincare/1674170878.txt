The texture of this product is so unique, it’s thick but melts on contact so you only need a little. I was a bit miffed seeing that REN made this only 1.02oz but it will last a very good while. It’s perfect for winter and my skin feels plump and supple the next morning. Really enjoying! Cold Weather Savior!
