This is a very lightweight, fast absorbing product with virtually no fragrance. My husband and I have been really enjoying it so far. I am use to a heavier oil so this is definitely a different kind of oil for me. I have dry skin so I feel like I could easily use this as part of my morning routine and/or like an oil primer. Two thumbs up for me! Lightweight, non greasy oil with no fragrance!
