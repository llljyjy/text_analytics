Loved this product! During the winter my skin dries out and it’s difficult for me to find a product that helps me retain moisture. I put this on at night and in the morning my skin still feels moisturized. I would definitely recommend it to family and friends! It does have an interesting smell but that doesn’t bother me. Love it!
