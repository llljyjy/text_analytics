I’m obsessed with this facial oil. First of all, it comes in a beautiful package and glass bottle, and looks super nice on my counter. No need to tuck it away. In terms of the product itself, I’ve been using it for a few days and it’s amazing. It locks in moisture super well and keeps my skin feeling firm yet soft. Absolutely will be buying again!
