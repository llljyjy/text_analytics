I received this product complimentary from REN Skincare. Love the scent and texture (though the scent could be a deterrent for some). Absorbs well into the skin and is so hydrating and makes my skin feel amazing. Not sure how this would work for me in the warmer months as it does feel like it could add to my oils, but for right now itâ€™s great. Still too soon to see true brightening effects, but overall I would recommend this! Hydrating vitamin c serum, smells great!
