Not sure why this has so many negative reviews. I am Italian and my skin tans fast going from super pale - lighter shades of deep tone foundations For a mineral sunscreen I did not experience a white cast. Maybe a slight lightening of my skin tone but my color still glowed through. It’s the best mineral sunscreen I’ve used so far! I would note it gave a matte finish, but with a sticky texture making it perfect for grabbing makeup. I mostly wear it without make up and I forget I have it on. I can not speak for brown skin tones, but for those who tan like me, definitely recommend giving it a try. Also, note apply this in sections and rub in, it’s easier than just applying whole face at once. Hope this helps! nan
