This serum has been really good for my acne prone dry skin. I’ve really enjoyed how it hydrates my skin while seeing a great improvement on my acne scars. I haven’t seen my actual acne go down but I have noticed some of my larger scars getting lighter. I like that the bottle is a pump bottle but it does say to keep out of the sun yet it’s in a clear bottle. So maybe an opaque bottle might have been a little better. This was gifted by REN Skincare. Loved!
