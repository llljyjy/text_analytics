I can never pass on a good Vitamin C product, so I was excited to be sent this one complimentary from REN skincare. I’m so sad I can’t use it under makeup because of my combination skin type. I just want to bathe in it. It has this very natural soft earthy scent to it. It is lightweight and makes my skin look and feel so healthy. Pump packaging also gets an A+ from me. Like I said it’s the kind of serum that I can’t wear under makeup due to my combination skin. My makeup wears off so easily with it, so I can only use it at night since I do wear makeup almost every day. That’s why I won’t be seeing benefits as soon as I’d hope, but I just love a good serum that makes me want to be generous when applying. This formula resembles a very lightweight moisturizer. It sinks into the skin leaving it soft and bright. So far I love it! Lovely serum for softer, luminous skin
