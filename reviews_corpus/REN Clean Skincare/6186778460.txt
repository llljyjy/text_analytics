Wow this oil is amazing!!! I suffer from rosacea so my cheeks can get sensitive, red, dry, and patchy. I’m happy to say incorporating this oil has been great for my rosacea. It has really helped with the redness. Overall my skin is moisturized, healthy, and not itchy.  My complaints about oils are that they clog my pores and can be greasy, but not this one it is so light and I love incorporating it in my skincare. Wonderful oil to help bring your skin back to healthy. Very much recommend it! Improvement in my skins health…
