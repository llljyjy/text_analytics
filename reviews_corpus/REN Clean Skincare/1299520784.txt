I’ve been on the hunt for a good Vit C serum that didn’t pill under my makeup and FOUND IT after this was gifted by REN skincare. I used 2 pumps on clean skin, followed by moisturizer, SPF and a full face of makeup. It applied beautifully. I love the REN line in general, so I was really excited to see this added to the lineup. The serum has a nice feel to it and absorbs well into the skin. Bonus points that it’s clean for your skin and the environment! Doesn’t pill under makeup!
