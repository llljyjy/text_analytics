This is a CRUELTY FREE serum. I thought it had a mild fruit smell and 4 pumps was enough to cover my face and neck. The box it comes in and glass bottle are recyclable, but the pump is NOT, however the company said they are working on it. I thought the dragonfruit and pomegranate ingredients worked nicely on my combo skin, and my skin felt smoother and hydrated. It also felt “light” and absorbed well so I had no issues putting on makeup. Gifted by REN Skincare in exchange for my honest review. Great addition to my skincare routine
