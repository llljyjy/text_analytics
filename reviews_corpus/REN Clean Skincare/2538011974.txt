I have been using this cream once a day in the morning, while using my regular moisturizer at night. It has a pleasant, light smell and the texture is nice and smooth. I have hyperpigmentation around my eyes and a lot of acne scars. I have noticed somewhat of a reduction, but they are not completely gone, yet. Overall, I would recommend. nan
