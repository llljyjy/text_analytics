I really enjoyed this product. It is very lightweight and didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy. Does well to combat irritants while providing a boost of moisture. There is a pretty heavy scent, but it isn’t an unpleasant scent, so I wasn’t bothered by it too badly. I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin for a daily moisturizer. nan
