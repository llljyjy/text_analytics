I have a combination / sensitive skin and I very cautious in trying out products with actives but surely a sucker for anything with willow bark. As a beauty enthusiast for more than a decade, I surely can say that I had my share of hit and miss and with my age and profession, I definitely am aiming for just hit! I cannot afford to deal eith unncessary breakouts as they bo longer heal as fast as they used and sometimes would leave a nasty marks. Talking about my experience with this beautiful bottle that REN sent me, it is just AMAZING! It is so gentle to the skin without any sting at all. And since I started using it - it surely gives a visible result as my skin looks a lot more hydrated, glowy, free from uneven tones, spotless and brighter! I will surely repurchase! Always thankful for opportunities to try amazing products! My AHA Tonic Holy Grail for Lasting Glow
