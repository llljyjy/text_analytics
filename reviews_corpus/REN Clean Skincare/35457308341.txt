My skin is sensitive especially after removing the makeup on my face. The skin on my cheeks, my forehead and the two sides near my mouth became patchy red, itchy and tinging. I was desperately looking for something that can relieve the redness on my face. I found this product - Evercalm one day at Sephora, though it is expensive for the size of the product, I still want to give it a try.  IT WORKS! It calms my skinâ€™s redness within a day and now I use it everyday. No more sensitive reaction on my face, no more redness, so far so good!  I will definitely recommend this to people who have the same skin issue as mine hypersensitive skin - this can calm your skin
