I have been using this mask on and off for the last 10 years. Every time my skin starts getting dull again, I realize I had run out of the Ren AHA mask and needed to resupply. This truly clears my texture, evens my skin tone to the point where I don’t have to wear makeup, and keeps my skin radiant and smooth. The only AHA that doesn’t burn my face or make it flaky after use. I will never stop using this product! STAPLE SKINCARE
