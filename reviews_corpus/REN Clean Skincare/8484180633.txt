I used this in my am skin routine after being gifted by Reb Skincare . Please remember to use sunscreen you all!  It has a light scent. Application is smooth and pleasant. One pump covers my face and neck.  I have a dewy but not oily look.  I have a few more days but I notice a little lightening of recent acne scars - probably compliments of the vitamin C. nan
