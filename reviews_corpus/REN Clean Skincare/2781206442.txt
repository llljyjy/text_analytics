I’ve always had a little bit of a problem with my skin: I tend to get dry patches and redness on my cheeks, and it’s always been hard for me to find products that would help me combat that.When I first tried REN’s Ready Steady Glow AHA Tonic I wasn’t sure what to expect. I’ve tried other toners before, but they were never really effective—and they were always so harsh! But Ready Steady Glow AHA Tonic was different. It’s gentle enough that it didn’t make me feel like it was burning off my face, but still effective enough to actually do what it says it does. I noticed results within a week: my pores were smaller, my skin was softer and more hydrated, and my complexion looked brighter overall. I would definitely recommend this product!All in all, this is definitely a product I’ll keep using! nan
