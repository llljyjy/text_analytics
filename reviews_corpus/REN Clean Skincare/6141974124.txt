I was gifted by REN Skincare. This vitamin c serum smells delightful and feels great on my skin. I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks and can tell it’s made a difference with my dark spots. I don’t think it’s as strong as some of the serums I’ve tried in still past, but I do think this one is still worth a purchase! nan
