Why did the change the dispenser? I love the cleanser, but now that it is in the squeeze tube instead of the pump, it is a pain to get out without making a mess! I end up using more than I should, and the cover has a clumps of this on it that keeps getting bigger! Please bring back the pump!!! why did they change the dispenser?!?!
