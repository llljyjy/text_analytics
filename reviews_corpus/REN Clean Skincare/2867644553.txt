This toner is so SO good! I have been using this gentle formula every night and my skin has never looked brighter, smoother or healthier. It also softened my skin’s texture and improved its overall tone, eliminating the redness and pinker tones that usually take over. It’s gentle while still being powerful enough to get the job done! I love the mix of ingredients - pore-minimizing willow bark, refreshing organic cucumber, glow-boosting azelaic acid and exfoliating sugar beet. Who wouldn’t want to drench their skin in that?! Everyone needs a good toner, and this is the perfect addition to any skincare routine. The scent is refreshing and uplifting, while the HUGE SIZE makes this last quite a long time - total bonus! Skin-Smoothing Wonder!
