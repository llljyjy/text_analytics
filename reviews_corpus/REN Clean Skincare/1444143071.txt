[Gifted by REN Skincare] My first REN Skincare product and I was thrilled that it was a serum meant to help the skin glow and protect. The scent of the product isn’t my favorite - I described it as a plasticky ginger like scent - but it doesn’t linger on the skin once it’s on. It has a very creamy looking yet thin texture and absorbs well into the skin. I haven’t seen much of the effects yet, but I have enjoyed including it in my routine so far. nan
