Would definitely not recommend on sensitive skin. I received this as a mini trio with my purchase at Sephora and I have to say, the creams that came with this mini trio leave my skin glows & smooth for days!!!! But this toner, the minute I put it on, my skin started getting super red. The redness subsided after 3hrs but stayed irritated. Unfortunately, I will not be using this again. Not for sensitive skin!!!!
