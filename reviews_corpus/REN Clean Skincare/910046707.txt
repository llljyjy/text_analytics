I have been in the beauty industry for over 25 years and I have been familiar with Ren since the beginning when they started back in 2000. They’re the pioneers to clean beauty and I have always love their products and been a Ren fan. It is not surprising that Ren has come out with their version of AHA toner and this product was super gentle on my finicky skin and yet, it did its job on exfoliating and brightening my skin. I am a person who suffers from keratosis pilaris - I suddenly got this skin condition after getting a tattoo and I hate how it looks and especially on a lighter skin. Super red and bumpy - I use this product to help and it has visibility made a difference and using it in conjunction with my AHA lotion.I really love Ren’s mantra - Clean to Skin. Clean to Planet. All companies should move towards this ideal. nan
