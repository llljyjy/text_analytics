I’ve really enjoyed using this in my routine. My skin feels really nice after application and with consistent use it’s given my skin a nice glow, and evened my skin tone overall. I love the sustainable packaging as well, it’s nice to see brands doing what they can for the environment. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a gentle vitamin c serum. Awesome
