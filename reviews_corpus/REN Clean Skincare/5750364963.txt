I truly enjoy using this face oil.  It has such a lightweight texture.  No scent that I could detect.   I use it as a last step of my skincare routine after the moisturizer.  I use it during the day before sunscreen application as well.  Doesnâ€™t make me look greasy and absorbs so quickly into my skin.   Feels very nice and soothing. nan
