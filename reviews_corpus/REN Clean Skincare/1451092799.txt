I see a lot of people got this product to test abs review- I did not.  I purchased this through a different site on sale, I love REN and their mission, I love their magnesium body wash most- this cream is a close second.  It really helps my skin feel moisturized, not greasy, soaks in very well and makeup looks great over top of it.  I wish it came in a jar through not a pump, I feel like I will waste some product but itâ€™s not worth removing the star. Great Moisturizer!
