This product was gifted to me by REN Skincare. The product has come great ingredients like Vitamin C, glycogen and hyaluronic acid and is designed to brighten the skin, even our skin tone and hydrate the skin. I’ve been using the product for the past 3 weeks and have not seen much of a difference in my hyperpigmentation because it takes a very long time and a very consistent routine to manage and lighten hyperpigmentation. What I can say is that my skin did feel instantly more hydrated and glowy after using this product. I am looking forward to seeing king-term results after extended use of this product. I will also say that if your skin barrier is compromised or sensitized in any way, do not use this product! It was on exacerbate the sensitivity and irritation. Other than that, it’s a solid product but I do need more time to use it for longer before I can formulate a more firm opinion. nan
