This is not your typical Vitamin C serum. On top of  Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (a water-soluble deritive of Vitamic C) it aslo contains Kakadu plum which is a natural source of vit C. I heard of benefits of Kakadu plum, such as protecting skin barrier and skin brightening, so was really excited to try a serum with its extract in it. I have been only using it for a few days, so canâ€™t speak  about long-term results, but so far so good. It has a bit funky frangrance (in my opinion, someone might actually like it), but the texture and feel are quite pleasant. it absorbs very quickly without greasy feel. Sensitive, combination skin approved. This product was gifted by REN Skincare in exchange for an honest review. Sensitive skin approved
