This facial oil is AMAZING!! My skin is so sensitive and always red and I have seen a very visible change in that redness in just a few days. My skin feels so hydrated and smoother and so much calmer after using this. I love how quickly the oil dries down and it never leaves my skin feeling greasy. It’s already helped with my dryness and redness a lot with consistent use for a few days in a row. I am thrilled to have found this and never want to be without it again. It’s just what my skin needed during the transition to spring when all of my skin sensitivities really act up. Also a little goes a long way so this will definitely last for a long time! And the packaging is great too, so easy to use and I love that I can recycle the bottle. LOVE!!!
