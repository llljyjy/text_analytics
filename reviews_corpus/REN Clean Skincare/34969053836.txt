I received this serum complimentary from Ren Skincare for my honest review. This is such a lovely serum! When I saw it was creamy, I was afraid it would be greasy, but it’s not at all. It sinks right into the skin & leaves a lovely silky finish. I love the smoothing effects it gives & I do believe it brightens your tone over time. This is perhaps not the strongest vitamin C serum I’ve used (I’ve tried all kinds from cheap to most expensive), but I believe it’s more effective in the long run because I’ll actually use it every day, unlike the “stronger“ ones that are either sticky, smelly, or make my skin “tingle“, which I don’t enjoy. I really like this and would repurchase. I also love the citrus smell & pump packaging! Excellent everyday serum!
