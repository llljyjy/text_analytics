Amazing!!!!! I am a makeup artist of 25 years and my skin is constantly needing exfoliation and deep cleansing products because I wear makeup almost on a daily basis. This product does everything I need! It is an amazing toner and exfoliatior. It smells amazing and gives your skin a very refreshed citrus deep clean feeling. I cleansed my skin with my usual makeup melt balm and followed by a cleanser. I rinsed and dried my face and then followed with REN. I applied it with my hands and just pressed it into my skin. You can also use a cotton pad if you want but I liked the feeling of just pressing it directly into my skin with my hands. It is suggested to not use it on days that you have used another exfoliatior. It did tingle on certain spots of my skin but I liked that because it made me feel as if it was working itâ€™s magic. My skin felt tight and bright after use and I followed with a moisturizer. I would rate this a 10/10 Yes! REN
