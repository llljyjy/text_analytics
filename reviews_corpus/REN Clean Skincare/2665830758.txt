Firstly I love the stamp on their packaging showcasing “clean to skin and clean to planet”. Clean effective skincare that does it’s part for the environment is a must for me. This serum is packed with tons of super fruit and overall good ingredients to really make you feel like you’re doing some good for your skin without the chemicals. It’s a lotion-consistency type serum that instantly absorbs and adds a nice glow to your skin. Has a very slight citrusy scent too but nothing overbearing. So far it hasn’t broken me out which is good and I’ve been using for a week! Will continue usage to track any improvement in my skin. A bonus: it’s in glass packaging and not plastic. Gifted by REN skincare. Love!
