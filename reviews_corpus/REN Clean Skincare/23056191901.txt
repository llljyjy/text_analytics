This is very hydrating and quick absorbing. After a few mins it seems to help some of the red calm down on my face. I love that it has a pump so I don’t have to dig my fingers into a jar. Also I really love that there isn’t an over powering smell. It hasn’t caused any break outs or irritation to my face like some creams do. I would recommend! It’s great
