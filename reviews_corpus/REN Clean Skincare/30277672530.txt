I have been loving this serum! I’ve been using it for about a week now and I feel like my skin looks more glowy! I like that this serum doesn’t feel as sticky when layered with my moisturizer but also that it doesn’t break me out. I also love fruit based skincare and this serum has kakadu plum, dragon fruit, AND pomegranate. Not only do I love all of the fruits for eating but my skin seems to love them too! Plus, the glass bottle and post-consumer recycled plastic pump make this super eco friendly packaging! nan
