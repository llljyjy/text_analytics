I’ve been using this really great cleanser (dry, sensitive skin & takes off makeup well) for many, many years- thru price increases, small ingredient changes, some time when it wasn’t available & now bottle changes. The older cool pump was PERFECT! It was a very good pump style. PLEASE bring back your pump bottle! Took a star off for this. Fav cleansing product- but miss old pump bottle
