My skin has never felt and looked so soothed and soft! Iâ€™ve tried so many moisturizers but none has given me the results for my issues. In just 2 weeks, applying twice a day, REN Clean Skincare Evercalm Global Protection Day Cream has given my skin a beautiful transformation. Having acne-prone, combination skin, I tended to have that red color and very dry skin, but this moisturizer has given me soft, hydrated skin, with a soothing feeling, and not to mention, a beautiful glow. No greasy heavy feeling, no heavy perfume scent...just a nice subtle scent. It absorbs quickly, with the perfect consistency, leaving my skin with that perfect glow and day protection, and calming the redness...so soothing! I absolutely recommend REN Clean Skincare Evercalm Global Protection Day Cream to everyone experiencing similar issues. This moisturizer will give you a very dramatic change...not to mention, so soothing. "So Soothing"
