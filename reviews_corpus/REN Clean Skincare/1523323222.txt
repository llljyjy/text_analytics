I have been using this product and have noticed my skin already has a brighter appearance. I have been using it in the morning and at night after I cleanse my face.  It is very refreshing it smells just like an orange. The texture is light and absorbs into my skin easily. I have been using this as my first serum/cream in my face routine. I am loving the results so far I look forward to seeing what it does for me in the long term. My skin is usually full and dry in the winter and this serum has my face bright and fresh looking!
