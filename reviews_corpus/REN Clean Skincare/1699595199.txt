I really like this product, with some caveats…Pros: This does provide a mattifying effect without making me breakout. I can use this product every day on my sensitive skin. I feel like I’m getting good sun protection when i use it. Plays well with some other products (see notes below). Cons: I’m pale and even I experience a little bit of white cast when using this. There seems to be a bit of a learning curve to figure out how to best make this work. This is good for every day, but NOT for workouts or high heat/humidity settings. If you’re unfortunate enough to have this mix with sweat and get in your eyes, I’m sorry - it STINGS.Notes/Tips: I’ve used this two ways, 1) make up free, lounge on a beach blanket type day, and 2) every day office type environment. If this is all you’re planning on putting on your face, you can rub a small amounts into your palms and then pat it on your face (it will feel a little tacky at first), or just go for it with a bit more and really rub it into your face. Don’t let it sit on your skin and try to gently blend it in - that’s a recipe for frustration and white cast. Unless you want to look like you stuck your face in a bag of flour, don’t try to put powder on top! If you want to work this into a daily routine, play around with it a bit. I blend it with a little Huda Beauty Glowish (one shade darker than I would normally wear). This makes it less tacky and easier to apply and still makes me feel like I’m getting sun protection. It also addresses the white cast. Be sure to let it set for a minute before moving on with applying other powders. Part Of My Daily Routine
