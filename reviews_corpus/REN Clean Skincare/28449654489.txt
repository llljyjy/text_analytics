First of all I am really big into zero waste eco friendly packaging. I really appreciate the effort that Ren Skincare put towards choosing a glass bottle. The product is really easy to use and I love the application so far. The smell is a little funky at first but you get used to the smell after a few uses. gifted by REN Skincare nan
