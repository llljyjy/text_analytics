I have been an aesthetician for over 30 years and I cannot live without a toner. Needless to say, I have tried, tested and used dozens of toners of every brand there is.  When I used the REN Ready Steady Glow AHA Tonic, I was in for a surprise! It contains 3 super exfoliants: lactic acid, salicylic acid and azelaic acid to exfoliate, brighten and maintain pores clear. I  FELT IT!!! It gives you a nice little sting on the skin to let you know the product is working.  For dryer skins, I would recommend using it once or twice per week. Oilier skins can tolerate daily use.  It is a clean product and the packaging (bottle) is from recycled plastic and is recyclable as well.  The product is vegan and it is only good for 9 months after you open it for the first time.  It has an extremely mild scent.  I love this product and I will continue using it. best toner
