I think this product does provide a glow to your face and itâ€™s lightweight. I do love the sustainable packaging. However, the bottle is in a clear bottle and I thought any Vitamin C products have to be in dark or opaque bottles. Not sure if that would be a concern or not. This product was gifted by REN Skincare. nan
