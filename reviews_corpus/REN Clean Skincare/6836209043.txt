This vitamin C serum gives me an instantaneous glow.  It definitely makes my skin brighter right after applying it. I totally love it and I can totally see the difference with my skin; it looks way healthier, more hydrated and fuller. It’s has a lightweight formula and it absorbs quick. For me, It had a strong scent, However, it was not overwhelming and dissipated quickly. Overall a super serum with amazing ingredients and results! I’ve been kindly gifted by REN Skincare in exchange for my honest review. Super serum with amazing ingredients and results!
