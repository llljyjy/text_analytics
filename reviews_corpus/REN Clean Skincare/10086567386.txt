I really liked this. I was looking for something to help calm the drying effects of the wintertime, and this really worked. It goes on smoothly, feels light, and absorbed pretty quickly. My face has some VERY dry patches that are new to me, and I actually put double the amount on those because it did absorb so fast. Overall it was light and non greasy, and didn’t leave behind any feeling that I had applied anything. Great option for year round, I can see this being really nice in the summer when you want everything to be as light as can be. The only thing off putting was the strength of the smell, but I am very sensitive to scent. It was a a bad smell, but it stuck along well after the product already felt like it was absorbed and “gone”. I didn’t have a problem with it, but others might. Overall I loved this! Lightweight and non greasy
