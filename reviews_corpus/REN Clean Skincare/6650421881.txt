Im absolutely obsessed with my free sample of Ren Overnight recovery balm. I recieved it free in exchange for my honest review. Being winter time my skin gets insanely dry and anything that brushes my arms legs or hands leave a mark. I also have sensitive skin. Using this balm at night makes my skin so much more hydrated and healthier looking. I use it everywhere Id usually apply a moisturizer. This tiny jar will last for so long so the cost pays for itself. Jsut take a fingertip amount and melt it in your hands and rub where needed. It applies like a thinner petroleum jelly and has the same feeling once it dries. Its smells clean and organic. Its vegan/cruelty free also!! Main ingredients are Zinc Oxide, yellow passion fruit seed extract, rice starch. Its even helped my boyfriend with the cracks on his hands! I recommend this to anyone whose skin needs a pick me up and wants to support their skins outter layer. OBSESSED
