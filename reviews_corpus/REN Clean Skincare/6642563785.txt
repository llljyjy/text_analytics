Loved this so much more than I expected to!! I have combination skin that tends to lean more oily in the summer months so finding a good balance of hydrating products that balance my moisture barrier but don’t make into an oil slick is difficult. Thankfully I got to try this product and it really is the perfect balancing formula! Using a drop or two of this at night really helps to balance my skin for the day ahead— and never broke me out!! 10/10 I def recommend this your oily skin’s best friend!!!
