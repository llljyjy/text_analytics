I picked up a sample of this with my rewards points and I had to order a full size after a few days of trying it out. I have combination skin that is blemish prone (nose blackheads and hormonal acne) and super reactive. I’ve tried tons of creams and moisturizers that claim to address all those issues, but never found anything that truly made a difference. I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks and I wake up every day with calm and balanced skin. I actually feel confident in my own skin now. Where has this been my whole life?!
