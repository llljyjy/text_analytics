Wait...an anti-pigmentation cream WITHOUT Vitamin C, Retinol, Hydroxy acids or anything at all that you’d normally expect to find in such a product? Well that’s enough to pique my interest, especially considering all the publicity around this product. The cream itself has an almost gel-like texture and although it feels rich is actually quite lightweight in terms of hydration which works well for me as my skin is not overly dehydrated at the moment. It sinks in quite well and has a light citrusy fragrance which quickly disappears. Although I have noticed a gradual brightening effect whilst using this, it’s not been to the extent that similar products have worked for me in the same time-span and virtually no difference on a stubborn dark spot that’s appeared on my upper cheek very recently. Considering there are only two brightening ingredients in here (Phytoglycogen and Algae) I can’t say I’m really all that surprised at the results, but for the price ($55 USD for a 50ml jar) and all the hype, I guess I expected better.  ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
