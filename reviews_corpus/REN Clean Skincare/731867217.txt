I have hypersensitive acne-prone oily skin. I have tried countless brands and formulations in search of ones that don’t break me out. This does have limited spreadability but mattifies and does not break me out, which far outweigh the cons for someone that breaks out from most products. I like to wear it under my tinted Tower28 spf, which is excellent as well! Also works beautifully, does not pill under my Kosas tinted oil. I am into high-end niche skincare (Biologique Recherche, May Lindstrom, Vintner’s Daughter, Shu Uemura, etc) and this is a holy grail. Holy grail for high-end skincare lover
