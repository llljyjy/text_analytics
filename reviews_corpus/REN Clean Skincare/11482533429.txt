This smells so weird, I don’t even know how to describe it. It won’t make you gag or anything, but it’s not pleasant either. The texture is also very sticky which isn’t the greatest. It does work though: it exfoliates dead skin, it makes your skin glowy. I like that’s packaging too, it’s in a pump so it’s more hygienic. But I find one pump dispenses too much for my face (my face is on the small side) so I usually use half a pump. It also comes with a piece of cloth to help physically exfoliate too which is nice. You can’t really use it without a cloth though because it’s just much easier to remove it with one. I’ve been using it for a year and it does work, but I’m not repurchasing. I’m going to look for another chemical exfoliating mask that smells better, but works just as well. If I can’t find one I’ll definitely come back for this one. Smells weird, but works
