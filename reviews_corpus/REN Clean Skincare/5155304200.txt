I liked how this serum made my skin feel and look, it took a couple days to start seeing skin even from minor acne marks. The consistency is good, blends right into the skin and I follow with a moisturizer. The only callout I have for this product is that it has a particular scent that I don’t necessarily love. It’s not terrible but there is a heavier scent. Overall, nice product. Nice product, scented.
