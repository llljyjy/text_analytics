I received this product complimentary from REN Skincare, however my review is honest and based on my experience using it. Lately my skin has been feeling very dry and despite the fact that I did offer her support with a series of products I would just see short term results. This Barrier Support Elixir has become a regular on my daily skincare routine because in a short amount of time has made a difference in my skinâ€™s texture. This is not your typical face oil, it has a lightweight consistency that goes into the skin right away, leaving it nourished and hydrated. This product has a multitude of natural and nourishing ingredients that helped my skin recover from its dryness phase and now I am back to my healthy and radiant looking complexion. I highly recommend this product
