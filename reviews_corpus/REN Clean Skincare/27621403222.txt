I received this product complimentary from REN Cosmetics. I adore this lightweight and gentle serum. It’s not sticky at all and absorbs beautifully into my skin. I’ve been using it morning and night for two weeks now and I’ve noticed that my complexion is much more radiant after using this serum. I’ve been using it as a spot treatment to target blemishes too, which it does really well! It has a mild citrus fragrance, which I love. Lightweight and gentle serum
