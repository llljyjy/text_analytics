I’ve been trying out all these different moisturizers from these well known brands, and finally decided this is truly the best one out there.  It’s the perfect consistency, not oily or greasy, and it settles into my skin vs sitting on top of it.  With the past moisturizers I tried, there was always something not right, but this one is no fuss and does exactly what it claims to. The real deal moisturizer!
