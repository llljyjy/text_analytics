There’s a good reason this cleanser is so popular - it lives up to the hype! My skin is very acne-prone and combination, so I have to be careful when shopping for cleansers to find one that isn’t stripping and this one is perfect! My skin still felt moisturized and supple after drying my face and the texture is a nice, gel texture that foams up. I appreciate that it has no scent, as fragrance can sometimes cause my skin to break out. Thumbs up from me! Perfect all around cleanser
