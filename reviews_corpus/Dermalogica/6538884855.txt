I have fairly sensitive skin so I was slightly hesitant to use a retinol. But after some research and truly wanting to see the benefits of retinol on my own skin, I tried this product. I like the sleek packaging and how it applies. It absorbs into the skin easily and after a few days my skin looks brighter, more plump and has less fine lines. Great for sensitive skin and rids of fine lines
