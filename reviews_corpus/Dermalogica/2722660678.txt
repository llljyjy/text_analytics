Gifted by Dermatologica. Iâ€™m a big fan of retinol serums and have appreciated everything I have tried from Dermatologica in the past, so I was thrilled when I saw this and snagged it. This is such a beautiful light yellow creamy serum. I noticed a slight lemon fresh scent, and not irritating which I have experienced on some retinols in the past. I do use heavy creams afterwards to help with this as well. Lovely Retinoids serum
