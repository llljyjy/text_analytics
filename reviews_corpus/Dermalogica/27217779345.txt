Complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling.The powder is very gentle, it contains small scrub particles that gently cleanse the skin.  Allergies, irritations and nothing bad caused me, moreover, the skin after application was more tender and smooth.  The product lathers well and rinses off the face well. Great product!
