I received this product was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for my honest opinion. I really appreciate the scent.  It’s not overwhelming, and doesn’t smell bad. The texture is so soothing and you can feel it working. After using it for 7 days, I noticed a few problem spots are gone and I have a more youthful glow! I highly recommend this product! Must Try!
