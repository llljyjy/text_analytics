I’ve used this Dermalogica daily microfoliant for a few days now and my skin already feels softer, smoother, and has better texture to it. It has taken away some of my dead skin that other cleansers can’t touch (like around my nose). It was really easy to mix and apply/use. It’s a powdered mix and you just have to have wet hands (I mean wet) to mix the powder around in and it makes a paste. My skin feels great after using! I didn’t know I needed this in my life!!
