I received this exfoliator complimentary from Dermalogica for testing purposes and to be objective with my review I decided to not use moisturizer cream after exfoliation. I loved it and it was pretty interesting to make a creamy product out of powder. It has a  neutral smell and when you leather it in between palms it becomes  soft with a little foamy creamy texture.  Not aggressive to skin at all. And here is my “but“.  it left a few dry patches on my forehead and chin that gave me overstretched feeling.  But then in the morning I applied my daily creamy and it all went away.  I’m now using it once a week and apply moisturizer right after. No issues and love clean feeling. nan
