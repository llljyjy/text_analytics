I was gifted by Dermalogica. While I’m not a huge fan of the gel texture, it is very light and has a nice finish. Personally I like richer creams but I think this is great for someone looking for a lightweight eye cream! It’s also nice for me when i want something lighter weight and it has an energizing feel. Too soon to comment on the results but so far so good. nan
