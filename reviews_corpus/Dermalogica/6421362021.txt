i tried this for the first time as a complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling, i was confused at the powder at first but i was pleasantly surprised. Definitely read the instructions first! i love how once you get the product wet it turns into a foam. i love how it exfoliated my skin with out being too rough! i never really exfoliate my skin but im thrilled how i can used this a ton wowowowo
