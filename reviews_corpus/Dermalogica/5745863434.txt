I have young skin but I wanted to start incorporating retinol in my skincare routine to even out my skin tone and reduce texture. Obviously those results take time but the benefits I’ve already noticed from using this serum is a brighter complexion and lots of hydration (which is uncommon for retinol)! It’s a thinner texture so you have to use a generous amount. I’ve been using it in the morning because I’m using a stronger retinol at night, but it’s definitely something you could use twice a day if you’d like. Overall I think this is a great serum and I will continue to use it in my routine. This was gifted to me by Dermalogica - Sephora in exchange for my honest review. Impressed!
