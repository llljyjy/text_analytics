I received this complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling for my honest opinion. This stuff is fantastic!! I have tried so many different ones and they’ve all been very rough on my skin. This isn’t rough on my skin at all, and it works extremely well! It left my skin so much brighter and smoother! One packet is more than enough, and they’re very easy to open. I just pour it into my hands, add a little water and apply to my face in circular motions. Overall, I’m really impressed at how smooth and bright my face is after a few uses. If you’re looking for a really good microfoliant, I highly recommend this one!! Excellent Daily Microfoliant!!
