I love this moisturizer so much! I was intrigued when I heard that Dermalogica reformulated this product and it is now reef-safe with more hydrating ingredients. The texture is truly an “in-between.” It’s a medium weight cream that absorbs efficiently in to the skin. I like to apply this as the last step in my AM skin care routine, and I always be sure to apply at least 30 minutes before going outside into the sun. After application my skin feels hydrated and appears vibrant and glowy. I have seen a slight improvement in my crows feet as well since starting to use this moisturizer! The last step in my AM routine, must have!
