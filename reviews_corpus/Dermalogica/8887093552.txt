I am so happy to receive this sample before I buy. I always heard so much good things about it. After trying, I like it very much, it gently exfoliate my skin, leave it clean, fresh, bright and smooth, make my uneven skin tone looks healthy.  Because it is rice-based powder exfoliate, has papaya enzymes, salicylic acid, all of these help to polish the skin. Highly recommend! This is gifted by Dermalohica sampling. Highly recommended
