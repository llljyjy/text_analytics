This was an interesting product, I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. I’ve never used a lather for my face that started as a powder. The powder was scent-free which I actually enjoyed because it’s supposed to be better for your skin. Once used correctly it turns into a regular foamy texture and left my face feeling tight but not in a bad way. Interesting product
