Another wonder Dermalogica product! Put this in on the mornings when my skin needs a little extra hydration or looking duller than usual. My skin is sensitive and do notice a slight tingling when first applying but it doesn’t cause any irritation, redness or breakouts. This goes on like a thick gel moisturizer and will absorb into the skin the more you massage in but won’t disappear completely. Really does a great job at combating dryness, brightening and plumping!
