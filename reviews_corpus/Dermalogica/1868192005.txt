I received this product for testing purposes.I was surprised at how much I liked this serum. I’ve tried a few different HA serums, and I really liked this one in comparison. It had a lovely texture to it, and I did see the texture of my skin improve over the week I was testing it. My skin really loved this serum, but I’m not sure if I’m ready to commit to spending $79 each time for the serum. Works well and saw results
