I received a sampling pack of the DermalogicaDaily Mierefoliant complimentary from DermalogigaSampling in exchange for my honest review. I reallylove the Dermalogica Daily Migrofoliant formula.This is a rice based powder that when mixed withwater it turns into a foamy paste. This paste is thenapplied to your face using circular motions, whichin turn gently exfoliates your skin. You can reallyfeel the little tiny particles in the paste getting allthe dirt. oil. and dead skin off vour face. It is reallv cleansing and yet still very gentle to your skin. Thisproduct is not over drying at all. My skin felt sosmooth and clean, and my complexion wasdefinitely brighter and more balanced lookingwithin the 7 days. I would definitely recommendthis product. A must have for gentle exfoliating & radiant skin
