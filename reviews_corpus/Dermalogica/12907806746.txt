I was really excited that i got the opportunity to  dermalogica daily microfoliant!I’ve been using this as a night time scrub and really liked the consistency once mixed with water. It’s gives a clay like texture, but definitely like the way my face looked after using it - it’s even tone and looked visually brighter. I definitely will keep using this product as a weekly basis regimen to see further results. Very happy to receive these complimentary from dermatologica sampling. nan
