Gifted by Dermalogica. This retinol serum is not irritating and is gentle enough for me to use. I like that it’s not heavy, greasy, or sticky. It feels very natural on my face. I have no issues with sensitivity or with this drying out my face. I notice a difference in decreased texture after use. I’m hoping with long term use this will help with signs of aging as well, but I’m very happy with the texture reduction results so far. Comfortable on skin and great for texture
