This serum has been in my routine for a few weeks now and it has been impressive! I have been using it AM and PM before putting on moisturizer. A couple of drops will do! It has a lightweight, watery texturethat applies so easily and feels silkysmooth upon application. My skin drinks this serum in and my skin is left feeling hydrated without the stickiness that other serums leave behind. My dry skin feels much more comfortable for longer when I use this serum so it has been beneficial for me. I love this serum! This will always have a spot on my vanity! Amazing Hydrating Serum!
