After using this product over the last few days, I’m not impressed.I don’t tend to have sensitive skin, but this product made my skin itchy and red.Along with that, it also leaves a very tacky/sticky feeling on the face.Considering the product is a gel form, it should feel light but I can’t get past the heavy/sticky feeling. Not a must have in my routine
