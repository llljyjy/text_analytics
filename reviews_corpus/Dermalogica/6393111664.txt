I received a few samples of this wash and immediately was shocked by the texture.  I opened it thinking there would be a liquid and a powder popped out and went everywhere,  lol. I washed my face with it and all I could think was that this feels and smells like they took a bar of ivory soap and turned it into a powder. My face feels tight and my hands feel like squeaky clean and super dry. I do not like this at all. I received this sample complimentary from dermalogica Not for me
