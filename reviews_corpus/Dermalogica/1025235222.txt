This product was a gifted by Dermalogica Sampling for my honest review.Unfortunately I didn’t realize this was a micro-exfoliant. I’m not a fan of most physical exfoliants and this is no exception. I like the lotion-like feel this has, but that’s where it stops. It literally feels like I’m washing with sand or sandpaper. It’s incredibly unpleasantly scratchy. Usually when I’m sent physical exfoliants I use them on my legs. But this one I won’t. It’s too abrasive. I’m also not a fan of the powder formula. I would love to experience the lotion-like side of this without the scratchy particles and preferably in an already liquid or cream formula. That would interest me. Much too abrasive
