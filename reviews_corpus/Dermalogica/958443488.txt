I love Dermatologica and was excited to try this gel. Usually I find gels to dry down to a texture that doesn’t do well under makeup, this one doesn’t do that as much. I still prefer to use at night, but I layer it with my other eye creams too. The ingredient list is great in this gel and I do think my eyes look more awake since I’ve been using. This was gifted by Dermalogica but opinion is my own. Nice and awake
