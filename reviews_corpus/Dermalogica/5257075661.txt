I have pretty sensitive and red skin. After using it, it doesn’t make my skin feel raw or more red than usual like a lot of exfoliators do for me. I enjoy that it has a pretty long life, as I don’t exfoliate often so I won’t be throwing lots of it away because if it’s shelf life. The product itself is great, and more then likely will be a repurchase. I do wish that the packaging was different. Whenever i open it some product does tend to spill out. #giftedbydermalogica @dermolgicacanada @sephoracanada nan
