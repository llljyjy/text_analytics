I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review. My go to cleanser is La Roche and I haven’t used anything different in almost 2 years, so I was hesitant about this but I’ve heard great things so I went for it! I absolutely love it, my skin wasn’t irritated- I had no issues. It felt clean but not stripped, very happy! nan
