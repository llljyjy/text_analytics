This new @dermalogicacanada Circular Hydration Serum is powered with Hyaluronic Acid, Algae Extract and Polyglutamic Acid. This lightweight serum sinks beautifully into the skin leaving it soft and smooth. It provides immediate hydration and prevents moisture loss for several hours perfect for Canadian dry weather.  2-3 drops are enough for my face and neck. It layers well with other serums as well. I mainly use it in my morning routine, and it works well under SPF and makeup. This serum is definitely a winner and will become a staple in my routine. Thanks @dermalogicacanada for sending me this amazing serum to try and review. #gifted#gotitfree @sephoracanada Great product
