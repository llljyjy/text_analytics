I really love this moisturizer for my dehydrated, acne prone skin, especially in the winter! Haven’t tried it in the warmer months yet. I’ve been switching between this and Kiehl’s ultra facial cream. I wish sephora sold the mini (0.5 oz) version because its a perfect size  to carry around. Hydrating & good for sensitive skin
