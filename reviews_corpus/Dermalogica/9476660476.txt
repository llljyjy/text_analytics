I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica. I really enjoy their original microfoliant. I love that the amount of exfoliation is customizable and you can pretty much change any cleanser into an exfoliating product. This is a more gentle version of their original. The lather is more creamy and milky - which I like. I can’t say I’ve noticed significant differences between this and their daily microfoliant, but it’s a good product. nan
