Compared to the Microfoliant Exfoliant, the Milkfoliant Exfoliant is less gritty and more gentle which makes it perfect for everyday use.I use the exfoliant on my freshly cleansed face but you could also mix the powder into a cleanser to save the extra step. The powder instantly transforms into a creamy lather once it is mixed with water. It did take me a few days to get used to a powder exfoliant when I first starting using it. Milkfoliant gently exfoliates the skin but at the same time protects the skin‘s moisture barrier and helps to calm the skin. I usually prefer using chemical exfoliants since a lot of physical exfoliants are too harsh and abrasive for my skin. I’ve been using Milkfoliant daily for about a week without any issues. No irritation or redness after use just smoother and healthier looking skin! [Gifted by Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review] nan
