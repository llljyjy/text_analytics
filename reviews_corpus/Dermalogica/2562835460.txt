First, I was really happy to receive samples complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling for their Daily Microfoliant.  The product comes as a sort of grainy powder that you add water to make a paste to use.  The key to me was getting the perfect blend for the product to make the paste to use.  I felt that it was a gentle and amazing cleansing of my skin.  My skin looked and felt smoother, softer, and brighter after one use and it improved over the remaining days.  Also, I liked that it rinsed off well.  Overall, great product that I will want to use again in the future. Great product!
