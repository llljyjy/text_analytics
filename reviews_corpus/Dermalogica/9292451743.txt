I have been gifted a sample of Daily Microfoliant complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. I think it is super cool how the sample comes in a powder, and you add water to create the paste! I tried this for the first time and it is awesome! As I kept rubbing it into my skin, I could feel my face getting softer and softer. After I rinsed my face, my skin was glowing. It was the softest itâ€™s ever been and it looked flawless. It literally looked like I had a filter on my face. Thank you so much Dermalogica! I love this product! A must have!
