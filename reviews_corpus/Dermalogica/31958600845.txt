Wow. I’ve struggled with “adult/exiting teen” acne for over a year (I took Accutane in high school and for 2-3 years my skin was clear as day and I could put anything on it). I have tried so many different products.   Absolutely NOTHING worked. But THIS. This is liquid gold.    I have no other words except, thank you Dermalogica. From a licensed Esthetician, this is a staple product in my routine forever.I was nervous that because of how sensitive my skin is, that it was going to burn or strip my skin….    It does neither of those things. I’ll attach pictures if I can figure out how, but seriously… Buy this if you’re suffering from breakouts.    Of course MAKE SURE YOU WEAR SUNSCREEN WITH IT, but try this product out.   I’m in love.     [I’ve only been using it for less than a week and these are my results already] Licensed Esthetician here!
