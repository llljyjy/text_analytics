Iâ€™m amazed at how well this exfoliates yet how gentle it is. I love how soft, smooth, and hydrated my skin feels after using it. My skin is also prone to break outs so I like that it contains salicylic acid. Will continue to use for brighter more even skin. Effective but gentle enough for daily use
