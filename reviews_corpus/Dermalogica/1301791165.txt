This serum is packed with Hyaluronic Acid, a moisturizing complex infused with algae extract, and polyglutamic acid that really helps to provide deep and long lasting hydration. It has a runny lightweight texture with a very slight viscosity that glides across your skin. Because of the lightweight texture, it’s one that will work well for most skin types. As I have dry skin, in the drier winter months, it’s perfect for layering and it would also be compatible in the spring and summer when the temperatures rise due to lightweight formula. nan
