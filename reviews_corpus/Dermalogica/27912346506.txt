This serum is instantly hydrating! One of my favourite products to use in the morning, to brighten and refresh my face especially since my face gets very dry after showers. Itâ€™s long lasting and keeps my face moisturised throughout the day. No reactions and love all the clean ingredients as I have sensitive skin. Highly recommend this serum! Instantly hydrates my sensitive skin!
