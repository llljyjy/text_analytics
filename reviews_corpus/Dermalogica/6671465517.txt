Revived this product, complimentary from dermalogica sampling and it’s amazing!! I’m a licensed esthetician and i love the product, line and the ingredients. it leaves my skin feeling well exfoliated but not over exfoliated, and it’s a product that i can use every day. my skin is normal to oily and it does a great job at cutting through the build up i get on my face from any makeup or products i wear. Great Product
