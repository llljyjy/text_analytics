I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. I have used it for 7 days straight. My skin got brighter! I have sensitive skin and it’s very gentle to my skin. it does help to exfoliate the dead skin and there’s skin peeling. But I can’t apply the foundation during the peeling process since it causes caking. I recommend doing a facial every other day during the process because it dries off my skin. But I love that it’s able to clear my dead skin Helps skin brightening
