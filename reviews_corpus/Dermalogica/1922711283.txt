One of the most important parts of my self care routine is taking great care of my skin. I was really excited to try out Daily Microfoliant complimentary from Dermologica, in exchange for my honest review. There are so many products on the market that use harsh ingredients to exfoliate and smooth the skin. When I learned that this is a rice-based powder that activates when wet, I couldn’t wait to try it. Once activated by water, Daily Microfoliant releases Salicylic Acid, Papain and Rice Enzymes to exfoliate and polish, while Colloidal Oatmeal and Allantoin helps to sooth and keep the skin calm. They say it’s gentle enough to use daily, but I don’t use it everyday. I’ve used it every 2-3 days, which was perfect for me! Once my hands are very wet, I empty the packet into my hands and rub them together to make a thicker, creamy paste. I apply in soft, circular motions for about a minute and then rinse and pat my face dry. I’ve definitely noticed a brighter complexion after only a few uses. This is definitely a product I will purchase and continue to use, especially since Dermologica is cruelty free. The Daily Microfoliant is vegan, silicone free, and free of parabens, dyes, artificial fragrance and gluten. It also comes in a sustainable package, which can be recycled. I love brands that not only care about our skin, but also the planet and our furry friends. This is a keeper and I look forward to trying more products from Dermologica!!!
