I remember hearing about this product from a coworker who described it as being “just baking soda“  Boy was she wrong!  This gentle exfoliator is pretty awesome and a little goes a long way so it’s actually a pretty good value.  In my experience my skin appeared to get worse as far as peeling and dryness after I started using it, but this was nothing a good moisturizer couldn’t help.  Soon after I started noticing how soft and supple my skin felt.  I also really like how such a small amount really works once you mix in a little bit of water.  It’s really easy to use and does produce great results!  I can see why it gets so many awards and accolades! I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. Worked pretty good
