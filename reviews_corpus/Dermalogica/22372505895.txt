Dermalogica is honestly my favorite skincare brand. I use their liquid cleanser regularly and I love this microfoliant. It’s so perfect for traveling because it is not a liquid so it’s a must have in every bag! Leaves your skin feeling great and a game changer for traveling with skincare. This was gifted by Dermalogica. Great for traveling
