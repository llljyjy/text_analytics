I was very excited to use this complimentary from Detmalogica sampling as I had recent purchased the oat milk exfoliate. This product too starts out as a white powder that you add water to activate it. It lathers and goes on like a paste. It does have the consistency of microbeads that help to exfoliate the skin. However, after leaving it on a few minutes and rinsing it off. My face was left extremely dry and tight. So, because I have naturally oily skin I was a bit surprised at how dry my skin got. It did seem to brighten my dark under eye circles slightly. I would recommend using a good moisturizer and face oil  to put that moisture back into your skin. I donâ€™t know if I would recommend this product for someone who already has dry skin. Surprisingly Drying
