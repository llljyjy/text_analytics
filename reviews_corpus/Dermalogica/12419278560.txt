I have been looking for a good powder cleanser for a while now. And finally, I found it. Dermatologica Daily Microfoliant is a unique product that is gentle enough for my sensitive skin and, at the same time, does the job! It removes dead skin, events tone and texture, and brightens skin color. After cleansing and exfoliating with Dermatologica Daily Microfoliant, my skin feels smoother and appears brighter and fresh. I love that this exfoliating powder is gentle enough so I can use it every day for better results. The ingredients are also clean and safe for all skin types. The product also comes in a refill pouch to help reduce single-use plastic. I love this product, and I hope you will try it and fall in love with it. Great exfoliating powder!
