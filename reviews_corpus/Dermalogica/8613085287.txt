I use a hydrating serum in both my morning and night routine, so this was win for me. It layers well with other serums, moisturizer and SPF ☀️ It made my skin feel more hydrated than some of my regular Hyaluronic acid serums. It also left my skin glowing and smooth! The only reason it’s not 5 stars is because the price tag- in my opinion, there are more affordable options out there but if you have the money it’s worth the splurge!
