Winter is over and the windy spring will surely dry up my skin. I’m so happy to receive this New Circular Hydration Serum from #dermalogica as part of their #giftedbydermalogica program.I like the serum’s consistency as it is not sticky and it smoothens right after application. I also like the fact that I only needed to apply this twice a day to achieve long lasting hydration. Plus, it has Hyaluronic Acid which is a must for me in every serum product that I purchase. Definetely, a must-have this spring and summer season! I love it!
