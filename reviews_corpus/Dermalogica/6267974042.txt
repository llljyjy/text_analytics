So far I have used this Dermalogica Microfoliant twice. I absolutely love it. I really enjoy using it, I mix it in the palm of my hands. I donâ€™t find it messy and it washes off very easily. I feel it exfoliating my skin but in a super gentle way. It gets creamy and slightly lathers as I massage it on my skin. When I wash it off it feels like a creamy cleanser and leaves my skin feeling super smooth and moisturized.  GIFTED by Dermalogica. DAILY
