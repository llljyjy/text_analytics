Really works! when I wake up with puffy eyes or after crying, I use this and it actually depuffs within minutes. It’s not claiming to be anti aging or anything else so for what it is I’m happy. The one down side for me is that it pulls heavily under makeup. So if I’m using it in the morning I’d have to wash it off after it does it’s job before applying makeup. While that is a bummer I still felt it was 5 stars bc I’ve tried so many different eye products and most are useless. This one really delivers. If you have actually genetic or structural puffiness or sagging skin i don’t think this is the product for you. works for periodic puffiness
