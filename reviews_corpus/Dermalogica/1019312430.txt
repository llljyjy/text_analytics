I am in love with this ingenious and magic cleanser. First off, it’s gentle and effective! By adding this into my routine, my skin is noticeably smoother, brighter, clearer. The ingredients are aimed to both calm and clear your skin, packed with salicylic acid, papain enzymes, and colloidal oatmeal. I use this after my initial cleanse and before any toner, essence, or other serums. My favorite part about this product is the format. I love that is a powder before being activated with water. This keeps it fresh for longer and the ingredient activity higher for longer. Add some powder, add some water, mix until it’s a light and foamy paste— voila, magic! I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica sampling, but I was a loyal user beforehand and I will remain a continuous user if this great product. nan
