Gifted by Demalogica-Sephora. I was a bit hesitant to try this product out because I have sensitive skin so I tend to get irritated easily, however this eye serum was not drying or stripping which I appreciate. the texture is gel-like and absorbs quickly. I don’t think I’ve seen any extraordinary results so far but there were no negative side effects. It is hydrating and moisturizing, not sure if it can get rid of wrinkles and fine lines nan
