Gifted by Dermalogica.  Love how gentle and effective this retinol serum has been.  The key with retinol is to make sure your skin is dry prior to applying and also give it time to dry after before applying your night cream.  I feel that I wake up glowy and hydrated in the morning in comparison to other retinol serums that left my skin dry and flaky.  Iâ€™ve tried a lot of retinols and this has to be my favorite! Love this serum!
