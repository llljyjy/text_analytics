I was a little apprehensive at first because of this being a “physical” exfoliant, because I tend to lean toward chemical (acids, peels etc) but WOW I am in love! Usually if I use something kind of gritty, my skin is very red afterward but this somehow brightens and makes it so luminous! My makeup goes on incredibly, dry patches are gone, doesn’t cause me any breakouts! I will buy this for as long as Dermalogica keeps making it! Best exfoliant I’ve ever tried
