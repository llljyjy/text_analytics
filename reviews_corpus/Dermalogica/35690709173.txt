My poor skin was acting up ever since I was struck down with covid, my usually clear skin was breaking out in cystic acne on my chin and jawline and nothing was helping. It was really getting me down, then my beauty therapist gave me a sample of this to try. After one use my acne looked and felt less inflamed so I bought the full size and only one week later I haven’t looked back. My skin is now totally calm and acne scars from my teens have visibly evened out. It probably sounds too good to be true but this has honestly been a game changer for me. Usually, when I wake up in the morning my skin feels oily - not since using this. It just feels smooth and even. There was no bedding in period either, my skin just took to it no problem so it’s strong yet gentle. I’ll be moving up to 6 once I’m finished 3. If there’s one skincare item I couldn’t live without; this is definitely it. A game changer
