I received this product from Dermalogica Sampling to try for my honest review and I’m so impressed! Finally a exfoliate that is gentle enough to use daily. I have never tried this type of exfoliate and I find it very unique. It’s actually a rice powder that when wet, turns into a paste. Then you massage on your face for amazing results. My skin instantly felt smoother, brighter, and my nose pores were gone! It is kinda pricey but so worth it to have a daily exfoliate that works! Gentle!!!
