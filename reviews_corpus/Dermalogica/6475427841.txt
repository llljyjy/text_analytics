I purchased this because I LOVE the daily microfoliant, it’s one of my holy grails and I figured this would be just as great! I wouldn’t call this an exfoliator, it’s turns into a creamy consistency as soon as you get it wet and it doesn’t really do much to my skin. I don’t notice any difference when I do or don’t use it. It doesn’t break me out though so it could be worse! buy the microfoliant instead
