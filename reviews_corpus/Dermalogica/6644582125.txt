Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. I really enjoyed how fragrant free and easy to use the product was. The emulsion was not too tough on my skin and it did not dry to quickly which is a plus. My only negative comment is that my skin felt a little dry after the wash but thatâ€™s normal given that it is an exfoliator so I followed up with a toner. Overall a good product! Great product! Straight to the point
