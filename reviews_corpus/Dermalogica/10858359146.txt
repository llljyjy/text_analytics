I was gifted by dermalogica in exchange for my honest review. Their products are simply the best and this is no exception. Absolutely a gorgeous retinol, I have a extremely sensitive acne prone skin and my skin loves this retinol. I can see a brightness in my face; visibly less bumps and redness with each use. Love it and love dermalogica. Awesome Retinol
