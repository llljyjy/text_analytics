It is a complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. I didn’t really like this product. The first is its consistency. It is very inconvenient to dilute the powder with water. The second is its smell. I don’t know why I don’t like the smell, there doesn’t seem to be anything special, but there’s something I don’t like about it. nan
