Honestly I think the microfoliant made my skin 100% smoothed and loved it! But one thing that didnâ€™t fully work was the brightening :(, my face just stayed the same and just went darker!! Plus the powder is really messy, it goes on clothes quickly and dries up on your arm really quick but if I had to rate it out of 10 it would be a 8.5/10 but besides them they were amazing! Again this was gifted by Dermalogica Use if you want soft skin!
