This is a nice, gentle physical exfoliator. Similar to the Amore Pacific one but without the fragrance. Skin feels smooth and soft after using but not totally stripped of moisture. I’m not sure it’s an everyday product for me, but definitely one I’ll keep in my collection for whenever I feel like I have extra texture. Not for everyday— but nice to keep around
