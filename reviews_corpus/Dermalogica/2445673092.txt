This is the first hyaluronic acid serum that I’ve tried that wasn’t absurdly sticky and actually did a good job at hydrating instead of just leaving what felt like a film on my skin. Dermalogica fails to disappoint me -- I’ve had their products in my skincare routine for well over six years now and see no signs of stopping. I’ve been using this serum morning and night for nearly two weeks while the weather shifts from warm to cold back to warm again which has been driving my skin wild. My skin is generally normal with a couple of oily spots and I’m acne prone as well. This makes my skin feel plump and well hydrated, pairs nicely with the rest of my skincare routine, and like I said, the fact that it doesn’t make my skin feel sticky or tacky is a rarity for hyaluronic acid serums in my book. nan
