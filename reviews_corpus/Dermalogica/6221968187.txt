I am really trying to get myself in the habit of wearing spf. I know how important it is and really hope this works in the long run!I love Dermalogica and am excited to try this one out. It is light weight and blends in well on my complexion, and does not leave a white cast. I let it set for about  5 mins before continuing on with my makeup. I’m excited to continue using this product and really see how well it pairs with the rest of my makeup. I’m enjoying it so far. The only downside I can see is the price, which is steep for an spf! Very nice but pricey!
