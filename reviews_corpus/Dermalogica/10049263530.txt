I received this complimentary from Dermalogica for my honest feedback. I honesty wasn’t to sure how I’d like this daily microfoliant, being that it’s in powder form. But, it works so incredibly well!! It left my face so smooth and a lot brighter! It wasn’t rough on my skin at all, and was very easy to use. The tear open packets were very easy to open which I liked as well. There is just enough in each packet to do your face, neck, and chest. I can already see a slight difference just in one use! Definitely will be adding this into my skin care routine, it’s amazing!!!! Definitely adding into my skin care routine!!
