I’ve been using this retinol as the only serum in my nighttime skincare routine for the past two weeks, and I have been LOVING my results. I struggled with light acne and discoloration/hyperpigmentation from the healing spots, and this has increased my cell turnover rate so much, that each day I can see they’ve significantly progressed. From zit to a clear patch of skin, I had a turnover rate of 10 days! Not only that, my skin is so bright, clear, and supple. This is my new holy grail serum! nan
