I am a huge long time fan of the original Daily Microfoliant so I was skeptic of this new version.  I donâ€™t have sensitive or sensitized skin but I can say that this new Milkfoliant is so incredibly gentle on the skin! The texture is soft and creamy and felt incredible on the skin. If you do suffer from skin sensitivity I would recommend this as your weekly exfoliant. super gentle and effective
