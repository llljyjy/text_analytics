I was excited for this product because I have used the daily microfoliant for years. I am constantly reaching for the milkfoliant now because I tend to have dry spots after using retinol. Since this is so gentle it doesnâ€™t irritate my skin and it helps remove the dead skin on those patches. This was gifted by Dermalogica. nan
