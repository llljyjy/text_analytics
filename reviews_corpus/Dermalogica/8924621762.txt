I received  this product complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest opinion. Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant Exfoliating powder that helps achieve brighter , smoother skin. Calms and balances uneven skin. Gentle enough for daily use. Dispense 1/2 teaspoon into wet hands and rub together creating a creamy paste then apply in a circular motions. Make sure to avoid eye area. Ingredients-Colloidal oatmeal helps sooth skin.-Papaya helps to remove dull skin cells. -Rice bran gently exfoliates the skin. It works really well.
