Overall, I really like Dermologica Daily Microfoliant. Its convenient and easy to use. I like that its a powder you mix with water right before use. This makes the product itself very lightweight and portable (travel friendly). This product provided me with gentle exfoliation that worked well for my skin. I had a good experience with this product and would repurchase. This worked great for me and I do recommend it! I received this complimentary from Demalogica Sampling. All opinions are my own. Excellent!
