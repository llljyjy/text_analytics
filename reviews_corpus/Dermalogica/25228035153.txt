I am happy to be reviewing this product honestly. I received this item sample in exchange for my honest review.  The dermologica microfoliant was interesting at first but as the days passed I noticed my skin had become extremely sensitive. Almost like a light burn. I liked. That the product is easy to use and my roommate loved it and even bought more. Not for me with sensitive skin but we are all so different. This item was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. Try it
