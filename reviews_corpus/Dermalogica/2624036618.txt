If you’re looking for a one stop shop exfoliate for dry or oily skin then you have to get this product. It’s better for mature skin types but I love using it on my daughter as well. Just add a little bit into your hands in lather rinse your face with it and that’s it! So glad it was gifted by Dermalogica A must have!
