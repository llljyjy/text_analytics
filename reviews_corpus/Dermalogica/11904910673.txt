Gifted by Dermalogica. This milkfoliant has been great for providing gentle exfoliation. It’s a finely milled, powder-like exfoliant with AHA + BHA. Lightly lathers with some water and doesn’t feel abrasive on the skin. Smells delicious- like oats! Skin felt a bit smoother after with no irritation (but wouldn’t use daily). A bit pricey. Gentle exfoliant!
