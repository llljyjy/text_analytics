I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.If there is one aspect I demand from my serum, it’s hydration, as there is nothing worse than a serum drying out the skin (raise a hand if you have been there). But I didn’t have to worry about the Circular Hydration Serum. Its gel-like consistency is easy to apply all over the face, with a feel that is smooth, not sticky.There is hyaluronic acid as an ingredient, which is one of the keys for the skin to retain moisture. I usually apply this over my face and than wait a few minutes before adding a moisturizer, but I think for some users, it may even be possible to skin the moisturizer or cream if they feel this serum provides all the hydration they needThere is a slight scent to the serum, so those with scent sensitivities may wish to take heed. Otherwise, I didn’t observe any negative effects from using this product. I feel its texture is one suitable for layering skin care products, if that is your routine.@dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica nan
