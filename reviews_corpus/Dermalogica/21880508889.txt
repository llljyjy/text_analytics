Iâ€™ve used this daily for a year - one bottle lasts a long time! But over that year my skin got VERY dry and flaky. I also bought their exfoliating scrub and it smells gross and too small to do any real exfoliating. After cleansing and exfoliating and moisturizing my skin would still shed and appear very dry. I went for a recent facial and was told to stop using whichever brand of cleanser and exfoliate I was using because my skin was much more hydrated at my previous facial. Would not buy again and cannot recommend. Makes my skin incredibly dry
