this is my favorite day time moisturizer. i have a really sensitive, acne prone skin and this honestly gives me the right amount hydration without breaking me out or making my skin feel heavy. i stopped using this to try out another product only because of how much this moisturizer costs and i broke out instantly and it’s been a week since i used the last moisturizer and i’m still trying to heal my breakouts. so this is definitely a staple. fave
