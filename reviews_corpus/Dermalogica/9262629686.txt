I’ve been using Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant and Daily Superfoliant for the longest time however I have received a few sample sachets complimentary from Dermalogica for my honest review. For reference, I have dry, dehydrated, ageing skin. I keep repurchasing this product because it’s so gentle and effective at exfoliating, I could use it every day. I don’t, but I could if I wanted to. I find that incorporating Daily Microfoliant into my skincare routine 3 times a week is the perfect balance for me. This product may seem a little intimidating at first - you have to ’freshly’ prepare it each time by pouring about a half tablespoon of powder in the palm of your hand and adding water til you get a nice paste consistency. Apply this paste all over face and neck area (or anywhere else you wish), rinse off and pat dry. Follow up with a moisturizer. Will leave your skin feeling not only squeaky clean but also super soft.I find this Daily Microfoliant to be great value for money as the full-sized product generally lasts me a full calendar year. Outstanding
