This product makes my skin feel AMAZING after just one use and I love the application of skin care and make up afterwards. The only gripe I have is that I personally hate powder skincare products like this cause I find them messy and I feel like I end up wasting a lot of product. Still don’t think it’s a deal breaker for me though since I love the results. 4.5 Stars
