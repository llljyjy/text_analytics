This product was gifted by dermalogica in exchange of my honest review. I’ve used the samples a few times. This contains salicylic acid and tea tree in it. Which is the best fir acne or acne prone skin. I have been using it in circular motion on my facial acne and it has shown some good signs. My skin feels soft than before. I’d definitely recommend this product and buy me a full size. My acne skin loves it.
