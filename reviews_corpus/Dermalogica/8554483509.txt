This was complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. I used this as directed but found it to be a little too harsh for my skin. Afterwards I could feel my skin sting a bit when putting on my moisturizer. My skin felt soft but I think I would use this sparingly and less time on the skin. Strong but effective
