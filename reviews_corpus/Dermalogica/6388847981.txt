Love using the microfoliant that I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling, as an added step in my skin care when I feel like I need a little extra exfoliation. The particles are super fine so it’s not uncomfortable at all to use. There really isn’t much scent either. My skin felt buttery smooth after just one use Nice exfoliant
