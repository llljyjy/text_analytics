Love it. Just what I needed in our dry and sunny high elevation area. Great sun protection while giving my skin long lasting hydration. I can easily apply make up. Great layer of moisturizing sun protection for the whole day. Easy to apply, I try doing it at least 20 mins before leaving house (but normally 30+) to be sure it completely working. nan
