I have occasional hormonal acne on my jawline. After 7 days I was able to notice a huge difference. There were no new breakouts thus far. Im very content with my purchase. I have really sensitive skin and oily. I use it twice a day due to having really bad breakouts when I started. No irritation whatsoever. 7day amazing results
