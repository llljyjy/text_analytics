This is a daily cleanser/microexfoliant that does not leave my skin dry, tight or stripped. It’s rice based & activates upon contact with water. The tiny granules exfoliate the skin removing dulling surface debris, revealing brighter smoother skin. This evens out my skin tone and it’s gentle enough to use every day. I’ve been using this a couple times a week and it is gentle. My skin type is dry.  Colloidal Oatmeal, Salicylic acid, Gingko. A great gentle exfoliator!
