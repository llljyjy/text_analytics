I think that this product is amazing ! I have struggled with sunscreens, as I have sensitive, acne prone skin and many sunscreens can break me out or make my face greasy. I have been using this moisturizer every morning after my skincare routine and it has been great! no greasy feeling or odd smell and it keeps my skin hydrated and fresh. There is also no pilling effect when applying my makeup afterwards! My foundations till goes on as smooth as ever nan
