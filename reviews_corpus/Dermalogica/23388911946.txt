I was gifted by Dermalogica sampling this Dermalogica Daily microfoliant in exchange for my honest opinion. My opinions are my own. With that said I absolutely love it. I find it super easy to use.  I had no irritation using.  My skin looks and feels a lot smoother since I been using. I really like this daily microfoliant and do recommend it. Love it
