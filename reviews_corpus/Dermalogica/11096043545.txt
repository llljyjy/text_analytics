I was gifted the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant Exfoliator in exchange to try it out. I love how soft my skin felt after the first application! I have been working on getting an even toned, smooth textured face and this daily exfoliant is definitely helping me achieve that. I ’m even applying less makeup for my everyday look. Also, the soft texture of this exfoliant powder once it’s mixed with water makes me feel so secure about using it everyday. I didn’t feel any harshness when smoothing the milky mixture on my skin. This for sure is going to stay a part of my morning routine. Achieving the even toned glowy skin I wanted!
