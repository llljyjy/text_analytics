I was gifted this complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. I used to use a powder exfoliant back in the day and loved it so I was excited to try this-plus I already love a few Dermalogica products. My skin isn’t super sensitive but I have always needed to be careful with physical scrubs. This one is extremely gentle but I can still feel it doing its job. It also leaves my skin feeling moisturized. I’ve really enjoyed using it and my skin looks and feels great. Really enjoy this scrub
