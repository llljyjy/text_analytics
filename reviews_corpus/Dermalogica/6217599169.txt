I do this it’s a little pricey but I am enjoying the serum ! Retinol has been such a game changer for me. I like the ingredients in this one because it’s very hydrating with ingredients like squalane and beta glucan. It’s gentle and hasn’t irritated my skin but I’ve been going slow. gifted by Dermalogica nan
