I like how this exfoliatior is infused with natural ingredient rice. It is a powder exfoliatior at the beginning. As per instructions, I rubbed it on my palms with a drop of water and it immediately turned into a paste. I really enjoyed applying it on my face and rubbing it for a minute to let the ingredients soak in and do itâ€™s work. It does not have fragrance which is pleasing. I kept it for a minute and rinsed it. I like how smooth my skin feels. I definitely see how soft my skin feels to touch. Too early to notice a brightening effect though. I received this complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. Nice exfoliatior
