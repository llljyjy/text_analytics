I am a fan of Dermalogica’s products so was excited to be receive this daily exfoliant complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. I found the piercer to be a bit messy, and had to experiment a few times to get the right consistency as it’s easy to use too much water & have it really runny vs. a paste. However the exfoliation wasn’t too harsh on my face and I woke up with really soft and smooth feeling skin after using before bed. I was impressed! While I’d prefer this to come as a pre mixed paste in a tube, the effects are worth the extra hassle of the powder. Soft & smooth skin!
