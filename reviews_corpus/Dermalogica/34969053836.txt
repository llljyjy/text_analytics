As a long-time user of the Biolumin-C gel cream, I was super excited to try this serum. It combines a stable form of Vitamin C with lactic acid for a boosted effect that’s still very gentle on the skin. I did not have any irritation or sensitivity from using this, & I do feel like it has a brightening effect. I like that it’s not oily or strong-smelling (some Vita C combined with acid smells very pungently of metal or hot dogs), & the light creamy texture sinks in quickly. I love combining this with the gel cream & feel like it protects my skin during the day (combined with SPF of course). Gentle but effective
