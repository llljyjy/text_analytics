The powder is gritty, does not foam up.  Great size for travel and also because itâ€™s not liquid, no need to put it in a ziplock bag if you are bringing it on your carry on.  I had anticipated better results because of the high ratings, but I was a bit disappointed.  I have tried many other powder cleansers from other brands, and I like this the least.  Seems a bit more harsh on your skin, with less result than others.   Try a few brands before committing to a full size. Great for traveling, but try other powder cleanser
