Honestly, this is the best skin care product Iâ€™ve ever used. It is a game changer. I never though that I will get so much benefits from exfoliant. My skin feels super soft, the bumps on my forehead gone, shines. I have sensitive skin, gets red easily. This product did not cause any sensitivity like other exfoliants, yet made me feel its calming effect by supporting my skin barrier. I almost use daily by adding on my sensitive clenaser. It worths the price and looks like last long. I recommend everybody to give this a try, then it will become essential. I found my forever exfoliant! @dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica THE BEST SKINCARE PRODUCT
