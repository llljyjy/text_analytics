Is this good? Yes. Does it melt all my makeup away without scrubbing? Yes. But I don’t get the hype for the size and price tag, you can use a cheaper cleansing oil or micellar water and obtain the same result in my opinion. It’s definitely a splurge item and I did like it, but I know of a few other oils I can use and obtain the same result. nan
