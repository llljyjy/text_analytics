This is a really agreeable SPF. It doesn’t leave a white cast, feels really hydrating, comes in an airless pump (which I love because it helps the product not go bad prematurely), and has a lot of sun protection. The only thing is that it definitely has a fragrance, and while it goes away rather quickly, I know that’s not everyone’s preference. Nice, Agreeable, Simple!
