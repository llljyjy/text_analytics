This product was gifted by Dermalogica and Sephora in exchange for my honest review.Here are the good and the bad from my experience: I love this texture! It is a milky, thin gel texture that spreads easily. It is so lightweight! A few minutes after applying this, there is a refreshing and cooling sensation! There is no stickiness or greasiness at all. It completely dries and is absorbed. This is perfect to wear during the daytime as it wears nicely under makeup and does not have that greasy shine. I’ve noticed that after using this, the skin around my eyes do feel a little firmer but it also feels “stiff”.  I was able to alleviate the stiffness by applying a layer of cream on top. I don’t notice any significant visible progress in depuffing. The stiffness bothers me, to the point where I feel like it’s drying my skin! The cap to the tube is tiny and I keep dropping it! However, I do like that this is a squeeze tube so that you aren’t touching the unused portion. Overall, the cool refreshing sensation is nice for the eye area and I love the easily spreadable thin gel texture  but I don’t see significant results in improving the puffiness and dark circles and I worry that the resulting stiffness could mean dryness.
