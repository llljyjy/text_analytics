I was gifted this complimentary from Dermalogica for my honest review.I gave Sensitive Skin, and this had worked wonders keeping my skin polished and smooth. Itâ€™s a Vegan, Cruelty Free formula that does not contain any Artificial Fragrances or Dyes! I have to be careful with what I use, as many ingredients result in breakouts. This Water activated powder includes Coconut, Oat, Papaya and Grape Extract to gently exfoliate dead skin cells to leave our skin bright and feeling fresh! I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone MUST HAVE FOR SENSITIVE SKIN!
