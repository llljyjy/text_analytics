I love this product so much! My skin feels smoother (without ever being peeled) and seems somewhat more radiant right away after rinsing. I’d like to think that my 10-step skin-care regimen, which includes the Microfoliant, is working, but I also like to give it credit to the other steps. I will note, however, that my sensitive skin (and my broken capillaries) are doing just fine—possibly even better—after faithfully using the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant every other day.
