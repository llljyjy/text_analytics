Usually I have issues with retinol being too irritating for my skin.Not this one! The Dermalogica Skin Retinol Serum is so gentle to my skin. I can use it nightly, without any issues. My skin is smoother,  more radiant, my pores around my cheeks are smaller and it diminished the discoloration I had on my forehead.The squalane, natural oils and ceramides help a great deal in calming my skin and keeping it hydrated. Side note: I love that this serum does not contain Dimethicone. That ingredient causes me breakouts and it’s hard to find face products without it, so I’m super happy it does not contain it. Overall I’m extremely happy and recommend trying it!Complimentary from Dermalogica - Sephora Radiant skin, smaller pores!
