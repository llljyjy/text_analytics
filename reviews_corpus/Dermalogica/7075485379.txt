I love this product way more than I even expected to. Felt incredible on my skin, and had zero white cast at all. Iâ€™m not wearing any make up so you can see here. The ingredients are incredible as well. This is definitely my new sunscreen on no make up days (but I would guess it would be great under make up too) Love it!
