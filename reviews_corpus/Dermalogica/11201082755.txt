I really enjoyed this product, I have sensitive skin andexfoliants usually make my face red and irritated for along time. This was gentle enough to use withoutmaking my face red or irritated and it didnâ€™t burn myskin at all. I noticed a difference in my skinsappearance just two days after using this product. Myskin is brighter and all of the texture on my cheeks iscompletely gone. So excited to have found a productthat works for my skin and delivers real results.Definitely will repurchase. I received this productgifted by Dermalogica sampling for my honest review. Great for my oily sensitive skin
