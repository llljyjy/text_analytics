There is a lot of product in the packets, which is nice, but feels as though they could have multiple uses from one packet (according to the amount listed for use on the directions.) Which I think is great to not skimp, but feels a bit wasteful and unnecessary. I find other exfoliants to be a bit easier to use and control amounts, as well as sometimes gentler. The product works and does well, but I have found other options that I found to be better for my skin and more affordable as well. I received thiscomplimentary from Dermalogica Sampling Gets the job done but not much else
