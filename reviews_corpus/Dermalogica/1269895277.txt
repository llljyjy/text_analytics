This is it for me. It’s the holy grail of make up removers. I don’t know why I ever try to use anything else. This is so moisturizing and refreshing. The tiniest pump takes everything off with ease. When I’m feeling lazy, I don’t even bother doing a regular face washing after this, and my skin is fine with it. nan
