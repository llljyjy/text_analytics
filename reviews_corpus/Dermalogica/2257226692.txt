Been trying this retinol for over a week and have been able to see some results with my dark spots and laugh lines. I had been searching for a retinol that was gentle on my sensitive skin and this one hasnâ€™t given me any bad reactions! Excited to continue using it! I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica. Gentle retinol for sensitive skin!
