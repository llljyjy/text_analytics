I love how I can control the amount of product depending on how clogged my skin feels. It lathers really well and feels great on my skin especially after a long day at the beach with sunscreen, sweat, and ocean water clogging my pores. It leaves me feeling really clean and fresh without striping my skin like some other salicylic products can do. And I love that thereâ€™s no strong fragrance. I received this complimentary from Dermatological Sampling in exchange for my honest review: A+. Gentle yet effective! Summer must have!
