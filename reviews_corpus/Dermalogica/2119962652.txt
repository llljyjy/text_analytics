The serum is light weight and very hydrating! It’s applies very smooth, a silk-like texture,  and it doesn’t leave a heavy, stick or greasy feeling.  It gets absorbed and leaves my skin smooth and moisturized! When I use it, I noticed a soft glow in the morning and I love the refreshed look it gives me. Dermalogica products are absolutely top notch and in all honesty, I’ve never been disappointed with any product.   This was gifted by Dermalogica, but this is my opinion.  I’m a long time user of the brand. Light-Weight - Luminous Glow in Morning
