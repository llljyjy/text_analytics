I could not be a bigger fan of this circular hydration serum! It has a watery yet slightly viscous formula that absorbs into skin like a dream. I like that I can use it during my morning or evening skin care routine, and it adds such a nice layer of hydration while making the skin look plump and happy. I have dry skin so a hydration serum is a needed staple in my collection. Complimentary from Dermalogica â€” but I will absolutely be purchasing when I run out! Excellent hydration serum!
