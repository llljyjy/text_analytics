I recieved a sample of this complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling and I am enjoying this alot. This mircofoliant reminds me of AMOREPACIFIC Treatment Enzyme Peel Cleansing Powder that I had years ago and loved but stopped purchasing because of price. Sad to see this isn’t cheap as well. I like it, works well, exfoliating and leaves my face not dry or irritated and you don’t need much! However even though I personally love, I won’t buy due to price unless it’s on sale! : Very good
