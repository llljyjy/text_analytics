I was super excited to receive a complimentary from Dermalogica. I really impressed with this Dermalogica Circular Hydration Serum. I really like the formula of this serum, very lightweight and easy to adsorbs into the skin. It feels so hydrating and it doesnâ€™t irritate my sensitive dry skin at all. I love to use this serum at the AM or PM skincare routine. I can feel that my skin is getting smoother, soft and plumpier. I highly recommend it. Great serum!
