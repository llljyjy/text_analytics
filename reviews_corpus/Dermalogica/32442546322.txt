I put this vitamin c serum on right after washing my face, before using face lotion. It goes on smooth isn’t oily or anything and does not have an overpowering smell. It does leave a nice glow but I’ll need to use it for longer to see if the vitamin c has any affects. Gifted by dermalogica - Sephora nan
