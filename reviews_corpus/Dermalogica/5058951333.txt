I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling this great cleanser. Honestly, I was a bit unsure of a powder. It seemed rather odd to me to be using. However, it actually worked way better than I expected it to. It was easy to mix up and apply. It lathered wonderfully. My face felt clean and soft. I was pleasantly surprised. I didnâ€™t really notice any fragrance to it. I quite enjoyed it for a change. I would recommend others try it out. A Must Try Cleanser
