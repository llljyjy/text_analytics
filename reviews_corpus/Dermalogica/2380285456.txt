I was recently. this product complimentary from Dermalogica.  I have tried many products from Dermalogica the past year  & have come to really love the brand.  Iâ€™ve only had a short time with this product & am already an advanced retinol user but like to switch around with otc & rx, especially this time of year when skin feels tight & dry.  This has a great gel cream texture & seems very gentle.  The squalane & other ingredients have helped keep my skin feeling smooth & hydrated.  Definitely recommend Love it!
