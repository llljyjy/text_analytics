HA at its best. The most pleasant experience this serum. It coats skin in a cozy blanket, plumps and replenishes. My skin felt so good healthy and dewy after first few times. It blended well with my other creams and serums, and is my AM and PM staple now. I use lots of acids in my skincare and this is a great topper for all of them to keep skin soothed. The only issue that I ran into with this, is scuffing under certain foundations. Which is unfortunately almost normal for Hyaluronic Acid. I’m still pleased with results of it, so it’s a five stars.
