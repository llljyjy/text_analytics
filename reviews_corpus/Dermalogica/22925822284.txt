OBSESSED! This provides great hydration for my under eyes in the morning that has them prepped & ready to go for my makeup routine! I also love that the packaging is a squeeze tube, it’s no mess. This product is lightly scented but I had to really sniff to smell it & it wasn’t strong enough for me to notice a scent when it was on my under eyes. This product was gifted by dermalogica, opinions are my own. So good!
