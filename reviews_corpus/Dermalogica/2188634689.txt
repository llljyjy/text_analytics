Dermalogica gifted me samples of their dailymicrofoliant. It is a brightening rice-based powderexfoliant that has shown to smooth and brightenskin in 7 days. The formula is a loose powder thatyou mix with water to create a paste which thenfoams and lathers. I felt the grittiness at first and itquickly disappeared once it started to lather. Theinstructions are to apply in circular motions for oneminute, then rinse. After 7 days of use, I can saythat the texture of my skin does feel smoother and appears to have more of a glow. I love this productand will be adding it to my skincare routine. It is agreat gentle facial exfoliator. Adding to my skincare routine
