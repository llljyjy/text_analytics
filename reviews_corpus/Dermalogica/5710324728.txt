The texture of this eye gel is perfectly lightweight and feels slightly cooling. It absorbs fairly quickly into the skin. And it definitely does de-puff. After using morning and night for 10 days I noticed my right eye had some little bumps under it. I stopped using for two days and they went away. I now use this eye gel every other morning with no issues. But maybe itâ€™s a bit strong for sensitive skin. I love the cool refreshing feeling it gives my eyes on early work mornings. Overall I like it just not for twice a day use Gifted by dermalogica nan
