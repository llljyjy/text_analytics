I love this sunscreen! I have somewhat fair skin so I do not find that this leaves a white cast on my face. I have super oily skin and this is the only sunscreen I have found that doesnâ€™t make me look like a greasy mess at the end of the day, instead it looks like I have a healthy glow. This also looks great under makeup and helps keep me shine free. nan
