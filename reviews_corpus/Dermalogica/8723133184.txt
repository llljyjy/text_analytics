There is a bubbling sensation when you first put it on.  Overall, it is effective, but for my skin (combo/quite dry) I find that a more moisturizing toner suits me better.  Pros: very convenient and even the mini size lasts.Cons: Slight burning sensation at some of the more sensitive areas on my face Works well, but for dry skin not as soothing
