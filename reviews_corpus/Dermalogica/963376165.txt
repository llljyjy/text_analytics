Always been a firm believer that you shouldn’t have to spend much on a simple hydrating serum (certainly no higher than $40) and therefore skeptical/dismissive of those that cost more, but I have to admit that this new one from dermalogica is pretty fantastic!It’s said to be formulated to work with a daily moisturizer and/or other treatments for optimal skin hydration - while I can’t yet say whether or not it actually enhances a moisturizer’s effect, it certainly works well with other products as it sinks immediately either before or after other serums! Furthermore, despite being so lightweight, it does make my skin feel noticably more hydrated right away!My one note: the product info says that 1 bottle = 122 uses, so each application is meant to only be 0.25 ml (product size is 1 oz / 30 ml), but I seriously doubt anyone can or would use it so sparingly, especially if you’re covering your entire face and neck. I’d estimate one bottle to yield roughly 60-70 uses, which means it should still last about 2 months (or 1 month if applied twice a day) so that definitely makes the $60 price tag feel less unreasonable!Gifted by dermalogica but opinions are entirely my own nan
