I was instantly impressed with the gorgeous silky texture of this product. I have dry skin and it soaked this in gladly. There is hardly any blending needed for the whitecast and it leaves a great glow on the skin. The hydration lasts all day. I really like how this looks under my make up because of the extra glow. Highly recommend!
