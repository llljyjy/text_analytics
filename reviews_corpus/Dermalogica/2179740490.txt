It’s a nice refreshing toner that doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I do feel it’s hydrating and it dries flat, meaning my skin isn’t left feeling sticky. My only wish is that the spray was finer, like a mist. The product is 5 stars, but the bottle brought my rating down to a four. Solid purchase!
