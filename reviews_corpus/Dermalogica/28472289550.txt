I have always wanted to try the brand Dermalogica, so I was very excited to see the sample packet in the mail. I have used exfoliate or three times in two weeks, and I can safely say it makes my skin baby soft, and very glowy. I feel it just buffs all the nasties away. It’s slightly more intense than I am used to with exfoliators, but I’m really digging it! Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling A great exfoliator that gets things done!
