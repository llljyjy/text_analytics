My skin is the worst, plain and simple. I’m 32 with incredibly sensitive skin that breaks out with cystic pustules at the slightest hint of a comedogenic ingredient in a product. I recently started using Retina-A, which makes your skin peel terribly in effort to resurface. This moisturizer is my saving grace to combat the retinoid “uglies“. It’s pleasantly thick & creamy with an underwhelming, pleasant “baby-powder“ type of scent. It really gets down and infuses moisture into your skin. My skin can literally be flaking off and if I apply this before bed, it’s smooth and the flakes are gone by morning. I truly can’t recommend it enough! Where has this been all my life?!
