I was looking for a new makeup remover so I bought the mini size to try it out and I’m really glad I didn’t get the full size. Doesn’t remove mascara, it actually makes it more difficult to remove so I ended up having to use a different makeup remover. Strongly scented and overall just doesn’t remove makeup very well. Super disappointing product. Doesn’t “melt” makeup
