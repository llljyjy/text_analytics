I was drawn to ’Active Moist’ due to its many fantastic plant-derived ingredients. My first attempt at applying it was on a morning. Bad idea! I found it did not sink into my skin at all and just sat there, making any sunblock applied over it an impossible task, let alone makeup. I found this unusual as the product is supposed to be oil-free. Thinking I had perhaps applied too much product, I removed it with a makeup wipe and applied even less this time around, but the effect was the same, albeit less pronounced. The next time I applied it was on an evening, at the end of my cleansing routine. This for me was more ideal as I had no other products to apply over this and could let it sink in (or so I thought) overnight. Unfortunately it didn’t really sink in. What I liked about Active Moist the most, apart from ingredients, was the fact that it did not cause any adverse reactions - breakout, itchiness etc. It hydrated fairly well too, but I feel a lot more could be done to improve the formulation so that it doesn’t sit on the skin and absorbs more easily.~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
