I’m very impressed by this microfoliant I received complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. After washing I put some of the powder in my wet hand and rubbed it around to form a paste. I applied to my face in circular motion for a minute and rinsed. My face hasn’t felt so smooth, clean and my pores look amazing.  My face feels and looks so good. Omg, love this!!
