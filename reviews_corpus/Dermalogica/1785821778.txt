I have dry and sensitive skin. If you have skin like me, I would not use it every day. It could leave your skin dry. Iâ€™ve been using it when I use makeup and at night. I have to say it takes all my makeup off and leave skin nice and soft and you get the feel of super clean skin. I was scare to use at first, but now I actually really like it. Gifted  by Dermalogica.
