I have been using this product for the past few weeks and have been noticing a difference in my skin. This serum is thick in texture but is super lightweight on the skin. It does not make my skin feel sticky in the slightest. I apply about two drops on my skin after applying toner and cleansing my skin. Immediately after applying the serum, my skin looks very bright and hydrated. It leaves your skin feeling very silky. I like to top it off with a hydrating moisturizer and my skin after this routine always looks and feels very hydrated and soft. I typically use this product during nighttime and my skin in the morning looks way brighter and has no flaky spots due to the intense hydration it provides. Due to this, I have noticed a difference in my skin elasticity which is great. #Giftedbydermalogica Best Hydrating Serum
