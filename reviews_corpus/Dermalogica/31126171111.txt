I loved this exfoliator. When I first opened it I was a little unsure of it. I’ve never used a power based exfoliator. It comes as a rice based powder that you use wet hands to rub into a paste. I found it to be very gentle due to the fine granular nature if the paste. I did find it didn’t leave my skin feeling overly exfoliated so I added less water the second time which made it a bit grainier. I didn’t find it to have a very strong scent that some tea tree products have and I found it very pleasant and natural. I’ve used this product for 4 days so far and my skin feels and looks brighter and smoother. This exfoliant has not caused any irritation and is gentle enough to use everyday. I did receive this product complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for my review but when I researched the price, it is on the higher end. But after using to product, I think it’s worth the higher end price tag. Gentle Exfoliator
