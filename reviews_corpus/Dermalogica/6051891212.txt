I literally never write reviews but I have painful hormonal acne all over my chin/jaw and this is the only product that helps without making it hurt even more. My skin looks smoother and acne is calmer after just using it once. I’ve now been using the larger size for over a year and still have plenty left. If you have acne or sensitive skin you NEED THIS. I’m cheap and this is still worth every penny
