I was gifted by Dermalogica their retinol serum. The retinol serum from Dermalogica is proving out to be so good for my skin. I love how it evens my skin tone. That makes such a difference for me. I love that it helps with the wrinkles around my eyes as well. I have been really enjoying to use this twice a week in my routine. nan
