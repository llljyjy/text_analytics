I’ve received this product complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest opinion. Dermalogica Circular Hydration Serum works great! My skin is very dry and gets so tight right after washing my face. I apply this serum right after washing my face, and my skin is very soft and moisturized after use. Then I use my usual moisturizer over the serum and my skin is supple all day! This serum wears great under my moisturizer and makeup, no issues with pilling either. I’m happy with this product! Left is before, right is after use. Great serum!
