First: this product contains chemical sunscreen ingredients Avobenzone (3.0%) and Octinoxate (7.5%) - so if you prefer a physical barrier sunscreen this one isn’t for you! If that is not a concern then read on! This product is a silky smooth cream that applies smoothly and spreads and absorbs easily, making it very easy to use. Because it does not use physical sunscreen ingredients, it leaves no white cast on the skin. I really love the feel of this formula and have found that it works well under makeup. It leaves my skin with a dewy finish but doesn’t make me feel greasy. The scent is light and really pleasant; the main note I detect is clove. I like that this is a one-and-done moisturizer with great anti-aging actives and a high SPF.  Many moisturizers with SPF contain so little that they’re basically useless for sun protection. For me, this one offers enough protection for everyday use. I would use a standalone sunscreen in addition or in place of this product for extended sun exposure. Overall I think this is another winner from Dermalogica! Good for everyday use
