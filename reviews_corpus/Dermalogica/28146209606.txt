I have used a lot of eye creams, serums, and gels in the past trying to find one with the right active ingredients that will help the early signs of aging as I just turned 31. I used this in the morning for the first time and after one use, I literally knew I found my new holy grail eye gel. I put this in the refrigerator for a cooling effect and it feels amazing when applying. My tired eyes were less puffy and my dark circles were less noticeable. It was as if my eyes instantly firmed and smoothed. I noticed my skin feels brighter and more awake. I pat it onto my skin in my under eye area, in a gentle circular motion with my ring finger. Its overall formula is so gentle and absorbs seamlessly around my eyes and they look and feel more hydrated. With makeup, I wait one minute so it fully absorbs. My makeup then goes on flawlessly without any pilling because my eye is smooth. A little product goes a long way so the pump really helps with applying too much! Ultimately, this has given me a brighter, healthier, energized, looking glow under my eyes and I am enthusiastic about continuing to use this to see ongoing results! Best Depuffing Eye Gel!
