I received this complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. Dermalogica Microfoliant is such a convenient yet very effective exfoliant product. I love being able to add it to my face wash or choose to use it alone. I have sensitive/dry skin and this works wonders on my skin. The granules aren’t too harsh either, they are consistent and do not hurt your skin like I have experienced with other exfoliants. I feel like it’s hard to over do it with Microfoliant! The result is extremely baby soft skin. It’s a treat to use this product I highly recommend. Top Grade Exfoliant
