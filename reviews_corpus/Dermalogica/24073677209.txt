After using this product for a few weeks I have noticed a big difference in my skin.  For me, the exfoliator is very important because after using makeup, even if we wash our faces every day, simple makeup remains on the skin and that accumulates and that is when the pores of the skin are covered.  I loved this Dermalogica product because it leaves the skin soft.  and it is not as aggressive as other exfoliates.  I recommend it and it will be on my shopping list.  Thank you this is a gifted by Dermalogica sampling I love it
