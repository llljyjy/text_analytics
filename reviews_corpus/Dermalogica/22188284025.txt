I kinda love a lot of  Dermalogica product I have tried so far. Everything worked for my sensitive skinâ€”even their exfoliating products are gentle enough for my skin, . When I got Cleansing Gel, i was so excited to try it. Light and clean,this  is exactly how my skin felt after using this product. Another Dermalogica product that i am obsessed with! It was gifted by Dermalogica. Yes yes and yes
