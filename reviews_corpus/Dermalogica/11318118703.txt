Now I love the microfoliant. I’ve used it for years. So when I tried this one I was skeptical. The feel is much more delicate; at first, I wasn’t into it. But now I use it every day in the shower. I don’t love the smell, but I love how it feels and how soft it makes my skin. @dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica A surprising new fave.
