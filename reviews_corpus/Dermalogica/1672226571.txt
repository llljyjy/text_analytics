I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling a 7 day trial of the Daily Microfoliant. The powder is white an not too course. The scent was fairly subtle, but it did remind me of cake batter. The exfoliant was gentle on my skin. A little does go a long way. I did spend some time trying to figure out the best consistency of mixing the microfoliant with water. Skin feels smooth
