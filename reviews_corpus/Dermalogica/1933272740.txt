My skin is all sorts of crazy. Some days it’s oily while others super dry and breakout prone. I’ve been loving this Hydration serum from dermalogica because it seems to be balancing out my skin. How I use it is , I most my face with rose water and add this on top. It sinks into the skin fairly quickly without being sticky (only if you use a lot). After 3 weeks my skin is bouncing back to normal. Every skin type needs !
