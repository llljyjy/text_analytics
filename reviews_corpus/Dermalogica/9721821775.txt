I received a 7 day sample of this product complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for my review. I have super super dry skin so in general I try not to exfoliate too much, but this exfoliator wasnâ€™t too harsh for me at all! It left my skin super soft and dry every day, and my skin does feel noticeably smoother and softer, and it did help with my acne! My skin also looks more glowy, which is hard to get with super dry skin! I would definitely recommend this product. Makes my skin super soft & it's not too harsh
