initially bought this on a whim bc i liked how it came in a spray bottle. after using it for several months, i kinda really like it. when i first put it on, it stung a little but i got used to it. i like how it bubbles on your skin for a bit bc it feels like it’s really doing smth. then when it’s semi absorbed in, i follow with my essence and i noticed that it absorbed the essence so much better! i’m going to be ordering a second bottle nan
