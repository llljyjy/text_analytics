I’m so happy with this exfoliant. As someone who dislikes rough exfoliators, I’m so happy that this one by Dermalogica is super gentle on my skin. It’s actually very soothing to my skin . Although it starts off as a powder, once you add the water it emulsifies into a creamy, soothing chemical exfoliator.  I love that it has both AHA’s and BHA’s along with other great ingredients to gently exfoliate and hydrate my skin. I actually use about 1/4 teaspoon instead of 1/2 a teaspoon which I find is enough and will make it last longer. After massaging my skin for one minute (sometimes longer), my skin is unbelievably soft. After using it for over 2 weeks now, my skin is brighter, smoother, and clearer.  There is zero irritation from this product and my skin can be reactive with some products.  I love that I can also mix it in with my cleanser when I’m in a rush and don’t have time for 2 steps (cleaning then polishing). Awesome product and will repurchase when I run out. I received free for testing purposes. @dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica Very gentle but effective!
