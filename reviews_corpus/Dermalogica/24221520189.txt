Iâ€™ve been using this product for almost a month now, and wow! It made such a difference on my dehydrated skin. Powered with Hyaluronic Acid, Algae Extract and Polyglutamic Acid, this lightweight serum sinks beautifully into the skin leaving it soft and smooth. It provides immediate hydration and prevents moisture loss for several hours. No more tight sensation mid-day on my cheeks!The texture is slightly viscous and 2-3 drops are enough for my face and neck. Upon application I can feel a bit of tacky sensation, which however goes away within a couple of minutes. I mainly use it in my morning routine, and it works well under SPF and makeup. I would have said it is unscented, but if I really sniff my hands then I can detect a subtle scent. This serum is definitely a winner and will become a staple in my routine #giftedbydermalogica Love this serum!
