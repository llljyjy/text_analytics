Gifted by Dermalogica. One of my favorite daytime eye creams.  It’s very hydrating. This gel helps reduce puffiness and leaves my under eye area looking much better. Almost as if I had a good nights sleep even when I haven’t. I really like to use this to prep my under eye area before applying concealer. The moisture helps plump out fine lines reducing creasing. Gives the appearance of a good nights sleep
