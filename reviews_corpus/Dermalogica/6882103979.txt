First time to try Demalogica product which gifted by Dermatology sampling. The power is fine and easy to foaming. Gentle cleansing for dry and sensitive skin. I just use half of the sample bag per wash. Feel a little itchy on sensitive zone. I wonâ€™t use it everyday, probably one a week for oily zone.  No smell and easy to risen. nan
