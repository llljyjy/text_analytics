I love this stuff so much! It’s a wonderful exfoliant that is just the right texture to wash my face without making me feel like I’m tearing up my skin. I combine this in my cleansers so I don’t have to add another step in my routine, but it lathers up a bit so it can be used on its own as well! Definitely get the mini sizes and the small ones from the Rewards Bazaar to keep your bottle filled. perfect exfoliant!!
