2021 was the year I began to actually be diligent about wearing sunscreen, and it’s already made a huge difference in my skin. Now that I’ve become more of a sunscreen everyday user, I’ve been looking to move more into higher spfs than my standard spf 30. With that being said, I love how easy this spf is to blend! It leaves no white cast and is quite dewy. nan
