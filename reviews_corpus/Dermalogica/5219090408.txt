I really enjoy this product - it depuffs my undereye in the morning, as well as moisturizes and smooths out the crepiness in that area. It plays well under makeup, and I really appreciate the gel texture as it isnâ€™t overly emollient - it just leaves my skin feeling hydrated. Lovely! This product was gifted by Dermalogica for review. Very nice under makeup!
