If you’ve tried the microfoliant, this is MUCH more gentle. The “beads” in it dissolve instantly and they don’t really give physical exfoliation. They claim it has glycolics like AHA acids to offer chemical exfoliation for the skin.I would not purchase it again because of that reason. It’s also way too pricey to not offer an instant exfoliation like the microfoliant. Smells great though and feels good in the skin. Way too gentle and way too pricey
