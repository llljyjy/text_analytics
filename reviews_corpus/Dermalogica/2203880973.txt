This is one of the best SPF’s out there. It is perfect for very dry skin like mine and I love how it has SPF 50. It goes on smoothly so you don’t have to wear anything on top of it and it leaves no white cast. It loses one star for the price, but I cannot rave about this sunscreen enough. Try it, you’ll fall in love too! The best SPF
