Love this spf! I’ve used it before but avoided buying it again because of the price point. It layers well with my other skincare, and causes no irritation. There is a slight white cast (I have fair skin), but it soaks in pretty quickly. It’s moisturizing and doesn’t pill under makeup. If they could offer this at a lower price point, it would be a regular in my routine. So good but so expensive
