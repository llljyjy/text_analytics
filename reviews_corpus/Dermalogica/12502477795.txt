On a trip to Santa Fe, I treated my beautiful Mom to a spa day where we got facials and massages. The aesthetician used Dermalogica products on both of us. Mom is in her 70’s and has chronically dry skin. This is the first cream she felt actually moisturized her skin—and provided lasting moisture. I’ve since purchased it for her as a gift because she loves it so much. Considering how much you can spend for products that don’t works, this one is worth the cost because it actually works! A repeat gift for my beautiful Mom
