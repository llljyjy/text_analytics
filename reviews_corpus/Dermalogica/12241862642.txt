I was gifted this by Dermalogica sampling. I was a little hesitant to use this product at first because of my sensitive skin, but I’m glad I did, because I love it. It’s a powder exfoliant that activates once mixed with water, it’s cruelty-free, vegan and clean. The first day I used it, it made my skin smoother and softer. After using it for a couple days, I noticed a big difference in my pores, they were tighter looking than normal and I had fewer blemishes. My skin also felt great and the product was great for my combo/oily, sensitive + acne prone skin. I would highly recommend this product. Complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling love this exfoliant!!
