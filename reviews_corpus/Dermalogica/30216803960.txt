I received this serum complimentary from  dermalogica. This is a solid hydrating serum. Itâ€™s not tacky or sticky and absorbs well. It layers well with other products too, and helps my skin look plump, glowy, and healthy. I would love if it also had peptides or niacinamide or something other than *just* hydrating ingredients because I love a multitasking serum. However, this is a really solid hydrating serum and everyone needs hydrated skin! Great hydrating serum for plump skin!
