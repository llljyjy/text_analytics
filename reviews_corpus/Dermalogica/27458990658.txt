I thoroughly  enjoyed using this product gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. The smell of bran in the morning while applying this product was like breakfast for my skin, the smell was awakening. I love how it felt on my skin. The powder turned into a gentle scrub and surprisingly lathered. Really wasnâ€™t expecting that, The smoothness came after the wash and my face was visibly lighter than when I first started. I was so confident that I decided to show up at the DMV for my car inspection all bare faced with no makeup at all. This is a rarity for me since I always wear makeup. I saw a friend while there and complimented me on my face and how it looked beautiful. Will definitely purchase a full size of this item. I love this!!
