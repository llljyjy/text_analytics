NOT SPONSORED! I absolutely love this cleanser. A little goes a LONG ways so the price may be steep but you will be able to use it for months. I have oily skin and this has been great at helping tame my skin. It doesnâ€™t really dry me out but my skin definitely feels clean and when used consistently, it helps my acne a lot. My esthetician uses Dermalogica products and recommended this one to me. I have been using it for over 6 months and I love it. I will continue to purchase again and again. nan
