I was so excited to try this product #giftedbydermalogica and it held up to the brandâ€™s quality standards. I have been using the daily microfoliant since 5 years and have loved that one but since I have sensitive skin I am so glad Dermalogica launched the Milkfoliant which is much gentle and fine milled powder that easily turns into a smooth paste when mixed with a drop or two of water. This can also be applied as a 2 minute face mask mixed with rose water or mixed with your water based facial cleanser. I have used it multiple ways and it has performed each and every time, my skin looks visibly brighter and smoother and I can see the small white dots on my nose get cleared up. Make sure to massage it on your skin in circular motions for 60 seconds as that really helps reach all spots and clean the skin effectively. Plus the amount of product that comes in this huge bottle is amazing, it will last me for more than a year. Sensitive skin dream product
