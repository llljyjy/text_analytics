This product was gifted. As someone who has sensitive and reactive skin, due to rosacea, I am always looking for products that don’t cause irritation. Though I can’t use this product every day, once or twice a week is perfect. If you’re looking for a product to help with texture and dullness, this is great! Just a little too abrasive for everyday use. All in all, 9/10. Great for texture!
