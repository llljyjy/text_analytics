*Gifted by Dermalogica - Sephora* Really decent eye serum! I didn’t see a dramatic difference with my under eye circles - like the brightness didn’t last. But overall felt great! Left my skin feeling very hydrated. Also works great under my makeup. It left my under eye area super smooth for a perfect base for concealer. nan
