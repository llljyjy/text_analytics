I just tried the daily micro exfoliator gifted by Dermalogica Sampling and I must say it is hands down one of my favorite physical exfoliators. It was gentle enough not to give me micro tears and left my skin feeling super soft. The fact that it is a powder that you have to apply water to makes it travel friendly and allows you to decide how you want to apply the exfoliator on. nan
