My skin is combo oily and breakout prone and sensitive at times. I’m also over 50 and this exfoliator makes my delicate skin feel so clean but not dry! It feels smooth and all traces of my sunscreen are gone. It does have a slight spoilt milk smell but I don’t care as it works so well. If you don’t want to smell this you can pair it up with your gentle cleanser at the same time and you won’t smell it as much.  It had its meal for redness relief and I like this too. works and isn’t drying.
