I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica sampling. I received their daily microfoliant to try and I have both good and bad things to say about it. I really like that their product is portable. Another great feature is the size. I love that no matter where you are, you will be able to stick to your routine. Also, you would be able to fly with this due to the lack of liquid. If you donâ€™t have a small bowl etc readily available to dump it in,it can be difficult to use. However; it does exfoliate your skin very nicely. It also helps to get some of the flaky buildup off. I broke out a bit after the first use so I would not recommend doing it before an event. Pretty Good
