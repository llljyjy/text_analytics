This microexfoliant from Dermalogica really does leave you feeling refreshed. While my first time using it resulted in a bit of powder spillage, I quickly learned and found a good ratio of water to add to this product. Why I havenâ€™t seen any visible changes in a week when it comes to my whiteheads, it does seem to even out my skin and leaves me feeling very clean and fresh. I received this complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. Refreshing but not life-changing for me
