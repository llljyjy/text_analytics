Dermalogicas microfoliant is very effective if you know how to use it well . I usually add little droplets of water and massage the beads on my palms before applying on my face . This is a great exfoliator it leaves my skin looking soft and removes dead skin ! My face looks vibrant the following day ! Great exfoliator for acne-Prone skin
