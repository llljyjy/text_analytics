Dermalogica just can’t go wrong in my eyes. This moisturizer has been great to help balance out the redness on my skin as well as provide long wearing SPF. It has a very lightweight formula and a very light natural scent. It feels so good applying to the skin, and it melts right in leaving no white cast. I love that it’s SPF 50 and it’s easy to reapply! nan
