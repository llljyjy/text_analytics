I’m always trying out sunscreens and this one is great! I love how lightweight it feels and absolutely no white cast. My skin feels hydrated after use which is great as we head into winter. It layers well under makeup and on top of my skincare routine. It does have a soft smell, which isn’t too overpowering. A bit pricey but well worth it! A wonderful sunscreen!
