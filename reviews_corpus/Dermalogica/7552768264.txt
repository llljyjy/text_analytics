I received this complimentary from Dermalogica, but all opinions are my own.  I love Dermalogica, and overall this serum is really great, however itâ€™s very pricey and I believe you could achieve similar results for a much lower price point. The packaging is nice as always, and the dropper dispenses the perfect amount of product. The texture is a slightly viscous liquid that absorbs quickly. With use the skin is instantly hydrated and a gorgeous dewy glow is delivered. nan
