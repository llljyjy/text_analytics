I have dry, sensitive skin that is often rough textured and dull. I live in the mountains in a very dry and cold environment and I desperately need moisture and protection from the elements, especially on the winter. I have been using this every morning under my sunscreen and every night before moisturizer. I feel like it is an extra layer of protection for my skin. Since starting this I’ve had no redness or flaky skin, just smooth, plump skin that feels balanced. I love that this serum is so easy to incorporate in my routine with other products. The almost water like texture sinks right in without any greasiness or stickiness and it layers so well with everything I’ve tried layering with it. I would recommend this to anyone who feels their skin is tight and dry especially those with sensitive skin.  @dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica Easy to use and perfect for sensitive, dry skin
