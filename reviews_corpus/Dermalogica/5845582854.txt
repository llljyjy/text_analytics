Retinol is my favorite skincare ingredient so I was super excited to try out this product gifted by Dermalogica-Sephora. I loved that it contain squalane which soothes the skin and Beta-glucan which also restores skin.  This serum targets fine lines, wrinkles, texture, uneven skin tone and more! I can say that it helped a lot with my dark spots so I can definitely recommend. Favorite ingredient
