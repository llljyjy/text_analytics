This product is a very gentle exfoliator that can be used daily. This productâ€™s formula is very unique. It is a very fine white powder. To activate the powder, you add it to wet hands and rub your hands together, creating a paste. The paste is then massaged in circular motions over a freshly cleansed face. Unlike classic microdermabrasion and exfoliating products that contain exfoliating beads that feel rough and gritty on the skin, this product has very small and fine exfoliating granules that feel very soft, smooth, and gentle on the skin. You can adjust the strength of exfoliation by adding more powder and less water when mixing the paste. After using this product, my skin was mildly exfoliated. It was slightly smoother and softer, but the results were minimal. After using it consistently for a week, I only saw a slight difference in my skin. I think that with further consistent use, my skin will continue to become more smooth and bright. This product does fulfill it claims. It is a very mild and gentle exfoliator. With daily use, this product will ensure that my skin is always free of dead skin cells. This will create smooth, soft, and radiant skin consistently. My biggest complaint about this product is that it adds an extra step to my daily skin care regime. I would prefer to use a single product that both cleanses and gently exfoliates the skin, instead of using two separate products. I prefer to use a more intense exfoliator once a week instead of using a gentle one daily. This product is very expensive, so it also makes my daily skincare regime more expensive. I personally find it to be an unnecessary extra step and expense. gifted by Dermalogica Sampling love this!!
