this is a great exfoliant if you’re oily/combo & don’t have sensitive skin. i have dry, sensitive skin & the physical exfoliants are too abrasive & the salicylic acid isn’t beneficial as I don’t have acne prone skin. I prefer the milkfoliant as it’s a gentler formula. [dermalogica gifted me] not for sensitive skin
