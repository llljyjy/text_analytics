This product was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling and I would definitely purchase it! I love how soft and smooth my skin feels after using it and how it isn’t too dry after using it. I enjoy how small the little exfoliant pieces are to really get into the small crevices of your face! You also don’t have to put much pressure when rubbing your face to get a good exfoliation!
