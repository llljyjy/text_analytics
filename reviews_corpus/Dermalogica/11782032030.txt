I know this says “daily,” but personally I wouldn’t use it more than 2-3 times per week. It is great for what it does and leaves my skin glowing! I just like giving my skin barrier some time to heal. However, this is a very gentle, yet effective exfoliant and if you don’t have sensitive skin, using it daily is probably okay! Gifted by demalogica sampling Gentle Microfoliant!
