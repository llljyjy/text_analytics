I have dry skin (sometimes can be sensitive) so I am a little hesitant with exfoliants. Surprisingly this powder exfoliate is so different from other exfoliants I used. I like that it has a nice lather and feels quite smooth and soft. Iâ€™ll use it a couple times a week and each time my skin looks really bright and refreshed. nan
