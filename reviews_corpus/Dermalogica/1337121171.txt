Another winner from Dermalogica. I got the product complimentary from the brand for an honest review.  I use Dermalogica products daily in my skin care and this is another must for me.  I am in my late 40â€™s and puffiness is been a concern for me. This gel is perfect for use in the morning. Is very light weight with cooling feel even without storing in the fridge.  A little bit goes a very long way and applies very smoothly. In just few minutes my under-eye area feels and looks calm and de-puffed. Also absorbs pretty quickly and perfect for under makeup. 10 out of 10 and highly  recommending. A MUST FOR WOMEN OVER 40
