This serum is incredibly hydrating and makes my skin feel so youthful / soft. It is light-weight, easy-to-use, and leaves you feeling refreshed. It is not oily or heavy, and it does not have a strong scent. I use this in the morning and evening, and have noticed skin improvements after a week of use. I would recommend this serum for anyone looking to more deeply hydrate their skin.@dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica Easy-to-Use Hydrating Serum
