This is a fabulous AM moisturizer with the benefit of SPF50!!! I love that it is a 2 in 1, and it has a silky texture with a nice scent. My skin is extremely dry at the moment, and this moisturizer did an excellent job moisturizing and with no white cast. It is lightweight, smells nice, and works great under makeup. Excellent product! Another Dermalogica Win!
