This is my favorite sunscreen. The formula is so elegant and easy to work with, and it makes my skin look so healthy and luminous. It blends in very easily and the texture isn’t too heavy or greasy. It has a slightly dewy finish, which I personally love. It also is moisturizing - I have very dry skin and use this as a multitasking product as moisturizer and SPF. This veryyy minimally irritates my eyes, but that tends to happen with chemical filters. I also don’t love the smell. Neither of those things will ever deter me from using this product though!
