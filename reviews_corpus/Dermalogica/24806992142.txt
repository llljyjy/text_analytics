I received those products complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review.It has a light consistency, spreads perfectly on the skin, absorbs quickly, leaving neither stickiness nor greasiness. Fragrance free. I use the serum in the evening after cleansing and toning the skin. After a week of application, the skin is smoother, moisturized, tightened, and the complexion is even. I recommend it! Awesome!!
