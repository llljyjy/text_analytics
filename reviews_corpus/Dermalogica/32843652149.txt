I like this complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling , the powder is fine and fine, and there are small exfoliating particles in it, just add water and rub it to foam. I have acne and closed mouth on my chin, so I will focus on massaging here every time. After washing a few times, the closed mouth and acne are gone. The skin condition is very good, highly recommended love this cleaner
