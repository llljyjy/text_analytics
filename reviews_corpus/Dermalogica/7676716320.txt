I never use exfoliant but I love this stuff and it makes my skin feel sooo nice! Definitely gonna be part of my normal routine from now on. It’s not too harsh either like some exfoliants are. I have sensitive skin so this worked really well for me and I love that it’s a powder. This sample was gifted to me by Dermalogica Sampling. nan
