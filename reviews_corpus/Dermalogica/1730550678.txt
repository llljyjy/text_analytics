This stuff works miracles!! I love how my skin feels so smooth after application and looks instantly brighter and glowing. Itâ€™s surprisingly gentle which is amazing and really easy to use. I tend to prefer a chemical exfoliant but this is the true exception because it makes my skin feel incredible. This has quickly become a staple in my routine and I love to use it every Sunday to refresh my skin for the week ahead, although I definitely could use it more and not have any irritation. Would highly recommend! Baby Soft Skin
