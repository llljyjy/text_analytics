This product was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. I was lucky enough to get to try out the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant. It’s a rice based powder exfoliant that includes Papaya Enzymes, Salicylic Acid, and Phytic Acid for smoothing and brightening. I really like this exfoliant. You put some water in your hand then dump some of the powder exfoliant into it and make a thick creamy paste. Apply it to the face in a circular fashion and massage gently for 1 minute. Rinse thoroughly with warm water. Afterwards your skin feels so fresh and amazing. The more water you add the thinner it becomes, so start with the least amount of water possible and if you feel you should add more go ahead. There is a very light natural fruit scent that doesn’t linger after use. It comes off easily and makes me feel happy and excited to use it. It’s so gentle you can use daily but you can use it less often if you feel it’s too much. I would recommend to anybody wanting a great exfoliant because I feel it’s so gentle anyone could use it.
