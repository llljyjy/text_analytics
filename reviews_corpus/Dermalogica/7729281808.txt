I read about this product and was looking forward to try dermalogica microfoliant and finally got a chance to try it for a good few days complimentary, from Dermalogica Sampling. The product is so different but so much better than the ones I’ve always used earlier. For a start, it comes in powder form and you can change the consistency according to your need. The smell isn’t the best, I admit but that’s okay because it works incredibly! I started to see a good difference in my skin on the first application. It not only removes all the dead cells, but always smoothens your skin and clears it. I didn’t feel the need to use a moisturizer right away because my skin felt so smooth and so healthy right away. Would I buy the real deal? You bet! My new must have!
