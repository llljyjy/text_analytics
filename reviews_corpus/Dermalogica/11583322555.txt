I love this eye gel so much! Even though I’ve received it complimentary from Dermalogica, it works great and I’m about to purchase a second tube soon. It does reduce dark circles and puffiness under the eyes and helps to have a fresh look. And it doesn’t irritate my super sensitive skin like a bunch of other under-eye creams do. Application is easy and the formula is nice. I’m using it for 2 weeks every day as a part of my morning routine and really enjoy the results. Highly recommend. nan
