I’ve been using the Dermalogica’s Microfoliant for years! I love it because it doesn’t have harsh chunky scrubs, but rather ultra fine rice based enzymes that gently but effectively exfoliate dead skin/debris, leaving skin smooth and soft! I also love that it contains salicylic acid, which is great decongesting pores! I poly to damp skin and leave it on for a few minutes before gently moving it with damp fingertips  in circular motion Amazing exfoliant
