Dermalogica gifted me these Dermalogica Microfoliant sample packets to try complimentary in return for my honest opinion. Dermalogica Microfoliant comes in powder form and is activated by water, turning it into a gentle foamy and creamy paste that exfoliates the skin and reveals brighter smoother skin with the help of Papain Enzymes and Salicylic Acid that help get rid of excess oil, clear clogged pores and make skin feel smooth and soft. Phytic Acid, derived from rice bran, helps balance the skin tone naturally and colloidal oatmeal calms any redness and irritation, for a visibly brighter and overall more even, healthier appearance. This exfoliant is gentle enough for daily use and it left my skin feeling soft and refreshed. It’s a wonderful product, I really enjoyed using it and I would definitely recommend it! The best gentle exfoliant I’ve ever tried!
