This microfloiant is quite gentle to the skin. I love the powdery texture and how milky it gets when mixed with water. I am not the one for physical exfoliators, but Dermalogica convinced me otherwise. This doesnâ€™t damage my skin, and it is actually suitable for daily use. My skin fees smoother and brighter after using this. I was kindly gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. Great for daily use
