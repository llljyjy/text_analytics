This was my first time trying a powdered exfoliant.It was interesting. I wasn’t a huge fan of the smell. And I don’t know if powder is for me.It gets hard to measure the right amount without losing half the product once you activate it with water Maybe I just need to give it more time I’m 50/50 I did you for a week and it did make my skin feel good  This was gifted by dermologica sampling Not completely sold
