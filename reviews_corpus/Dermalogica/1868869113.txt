I received A seven day sample complimentary from Demalogica sampling. I was surprised they came in an envelope and was wondering where do I start with this. These samples came in a pack which you had to activate with water to form into lather and make it into a paste. After creating a paste  I applied into my face in the circular motion, I decided to wait five minutes to let sink in since I had some dry spots. I wanted to achieve smoother skin with this exfoliate. I washed it off and it left my face feeling smooth. This daily microfoliant exfoliants is rice based. It  brightened my face with its papaya enzymes and salicylic acid.in the future I would love to get this product and test it out for a month to see how it makes my face feel. Overall the seven day sample was worth it and I definitely recommend it, if youâ€™re looking for something different. The formula alone is worth trying. Must try powder exfoliant
