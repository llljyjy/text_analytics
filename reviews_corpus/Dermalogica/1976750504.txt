I’ve never tried a Dermalogica product that I didn’t love! I just got the mini size of this to try it out, and I’m very pleased with it! I’ve been using this in the morning and love that it’s a 2-in-1 moisturizer and SPF. Now that my skin is on the dryer side with the season changing, I really like how moisturizing this feels. Like any SPF, this does require some blending but other than that, this is a really good moisturizer/SPF option! nan
