I have been using this productÔºçcomplimentary from Dermalogica Sampling for a few days and my skin is so smooth. It is in powder form and has to be rubbed with water to create a lather. I am poor at this part because my hands are relatively small. The lather is easy to generate, I put it on my face, there is no strange smell, follow the normal face washing steps, after rinsing, I can feel the smoothness of the skin. nan
