I’ve tried a few SPF’s before and this one is definitely different (in a great way)! The formula feels like a thick lotion but applies very smooth and even on the skin, it has a traditional spf scent to it which is not my favorite but also was expected so it’s not a big deal. I was able to continue on with the rest of my skin care without it making my skin oily or feel cakey. I love that it left NO white film over my skin. My primer and foundation glided right on with this, I can’t believe I went so long without trying this! Amazing!
