I am loving this product so far! I wasn’t sure what the exfoliating powder would be like and I’ve never used a microfoliant before, but it’s sort of like a paste that I can feel gently exfoliating my skin. It’s not too harsh or aggressive, but I feel like it is really cleaning my skin. My skin definitely feels smoother and brighter from using this!
