This cleanser is a new fav! I love exfoliating cleansers because even most sensitive skin types can handle a wash off treatment like this. I love to use this as a flash mask for an elevated exfoliating experience. This has a very light, fresh, no fragrance type of scent to it. Doesn’t lather up entirely which I personally don’t mind at all! I prefer it actually when it comes to my exfoliating cleansers so I don’t risk it dripping into my eyes or mouth. Overall this is a solid, gentle yet effective exfoliating cleanser. My skin feels clean without feeling stripped or tight. Perfect for a gentle night time routine! Dermalogica is one of my favorite brands of all times, so I really trust their formulas. Truly gentle!
