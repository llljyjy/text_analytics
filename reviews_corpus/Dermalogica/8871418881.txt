I love this stuff!! It smells amazing (not perfumery but more like an essential oil) and it does a great job of breaking down my makeup. I haven’t had any issues w my skin since using and it actually does a great job of keeping my skin moisturized! I would recommend buying the smaller size to try first since it’s a bit pricey for the full size. The mini version lasts a while too! nan
