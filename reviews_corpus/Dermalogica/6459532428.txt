This is a soothing, moisturizing eye gel cream that does not cause milia or irritate my eyes. It makes the skin around my eyes feel and look smoother and it plumps up fine lines. I have always had a difficult time finding eye creams that donâ€™t irritate me, either because of their fragrances, or their are too greasy, but the texture of this one is sublime. The price is quite reasonable for such a high quality product. complimentary from Dermalogica nan
