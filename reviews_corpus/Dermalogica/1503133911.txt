I have mixed emotions on this one, which is a shame because I LOVE this brand. It’s very good at exfoliating, which is the whole point so that’s good. But I’m really not a fan of the scent. And I don’t know that I love the powder formula. It kind of reminds me of diatomaceous earth. It’s not bad, but I think I’ll stick to my usual exfoliant for now. This product was complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. Its a good exfoliant, but it’s not for me.
