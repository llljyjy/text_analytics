This product was gifted to me by Dermalogica and I just loved it like a lot. It gave my skin long lasting hydration it needed. I have used quite a few different hyaluronic acid serums earlier but out of all that this product has done wonders to my skin. My skin felt so live and gave my dry skin the best hydration it needed which lasted for a very long time. I highly recommend this product if you have dry skin like me. Do give it a try! The Best!
