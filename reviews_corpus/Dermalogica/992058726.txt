This gentle but powerful works the first time. The rice-based micro-fine powder activates, foams, once water is added and mixed in wet hands. The foam is light and easy to smooth onto my face. Within 30 seconds of light rubbing, I could feel my skin getting smoother and soft. Once I rinsed my face, my skin was visibly radiant and fresh looking.  It was baby soft! The first use was so effective that I used the rest of the packets every other day and then every three days. I didnâ€™t have any more blackheads and whiteheads to get rid of after the first week! I also really loved the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant packets because they were perfect for carrying on vacation.The trial packets were gifted by Dermalogica Sampling to try for my honest review. I 100% recommend this product. Lasting results exfoliant
