Dermatologica moisturizer has SPF 50 which is really good for mid west winters. It helped made my face feel supple as I have dry skin. I love it when moisturizers come with SPF. I applied it after cleansing and toning. The bottle with its pump feature is super easy to use. It also worked well as a makeup base with sun protection. It has squalene for that extra hydration. Love that itâ€™s vegan and cruelty free. Loved the moisturizer and SPF duo
