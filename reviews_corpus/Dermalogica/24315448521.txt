This is the second product I’ve tried from this brand and *wow* the more product I try the more I fall in love with Dermalogica! This product is soooo good, just after using it the skin feels so smooth and soft. I tend to get little bumps on the forehead and on the chin and just after a couple of applications, there are no more little bumps. This Microfoliant is very gentle, and I like using it in the shower, so I really take my time to massage it into my skin. It’s got amazing ingredients like Salicylic Acid, Rice Enzymes and Papain. I would 100% recommend if, like me, you have uneven skin tone and little bumps you want to get rid of, or if you just want to exfoliate your skin every once in a while. *WOW*
