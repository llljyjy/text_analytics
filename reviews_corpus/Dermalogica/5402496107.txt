Gifted by Dermalogica. This is my first time trying anything by the brand (aside from a mini of their spf) and I must say I’m highly impressed. I was a little nervous this would be overly exfoliating but it truly is gentle. When mixed with water it foamed up very lightly and was nice and milky all at the same time. I would use this as a first or second cleanse and could see this being used in my routine 2-3 times a week. I haven’t tried it when using other actives/exfoliating products at the same time but with how gentle it was I can’t imagine it would be bother my skin when used together. My only wish is that it came with something to measure how much to use because I have a heavy hand. I also want to note that my skin was extra sensitive today from getting filler and Botox so the fact that this didn’t irritate it or cause redness is awesome. Very nice!
