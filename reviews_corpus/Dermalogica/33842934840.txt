This sunscreen has a smooth type of feel once applied but it goes away turning serum like immediately once absorbed in. I have no issues with the texture as I take it as it’s gonna be that layer that my face needs for extra sun protection. The smell is quite fresh and just reminds me of clean type of skincare products. My skin before applying this was feeling a bit on the dry side and didn’t have much radiance to it. When I put this on I immediately took notice in the before and after how it made my skin quite dewy looking and more radiant. Overall I really do like this and will keep on using this especially since I don’t feel greasy at all! Great feeling sunscreen
