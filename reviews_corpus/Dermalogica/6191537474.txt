I love using this exfoliator! It isn’t harsh in the skin but still does a great job of clearing out my pores and leaving my skin feeling smooth. It’s claimed to be gentle enough for daily usage and I haven’t had any negative reactions so far. My skins cleared up and I can see an improvement in my overall complexion. I was gifted a sample complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. nan
