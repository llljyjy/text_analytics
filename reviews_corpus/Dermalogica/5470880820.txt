This was gifted to me by dermalogica, In all honesty it’s just okay, I feel like I wanted more exfoliation and when I mixed this with water it was too thin. It felt more like a milky cleanser. I feel like this is suited best for someone with really sensitive skin, I’m used to high end skin care and this was just okay to me Meh
