Glad I have a chance to try this daily microfoliant exfoliate. It is very convenient to use. It is in powder, so itâ€™s very easy to take especially for traveling. You just mix the powder with water then you get the foam to clean your face. It is very gentle and clean your skin very well. Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling nan
