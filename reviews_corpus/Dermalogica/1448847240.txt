I was really excited to sample Dermalogica’s Microfoliant. Getting the powder to foam up in my hands is a little cumbersome and messy, but i’ve had great results with my skin. It looks and feels super smooth and soft and brightened. No irritations since it is a rather mild exfoliant. Would buy again. Received product sample gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. Skin is soft and smooth!
