I will be using this occasionally at night when I feel that my skin needs a little bit extra medical grade help. The day after I used, I noticed that my skin was more sensitive. When I put my face in the water in the shower, I could feel it more than I typically do. I look forward to using it and I didnâ€™t have any bad side effects. I did receive this product for free, gifted by Dermalogica - Sephora. Will be using this when my skin needs more help
