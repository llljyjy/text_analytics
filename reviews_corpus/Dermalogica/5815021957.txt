This microfoliant is literally heaven sent, the exfoliant is so small and smooth it does not damage my skin but exfoliates it to perfection, it has helped dramatically with my scarring and uneven skintone and texture and I have not stopped talking about it to my friends and family, I have had so many people purchase and text me thanking me for putting them onto such an amazing product and you get SO much in the bottle especially for the price it is so worth it! I use this 1-2x a week and it has completed changed my skin for the better, I am obsessed!! The absolute best!
