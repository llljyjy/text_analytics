I bought this in November during the holiday sale, and I’m still going through the bottle. I use at least once (sometimes twice) a day, and it doesn’t irritate my skin, which gets extra sensitive, flaky, and dry in winter. Have acne prone skin and at the gym 5x a week, sweat can really break me out. Winter has always been a battle of cleansing my combo skin well enough without setting it on fire with exfoliating cleansers. It’s always been either / or - hydrated skin with a few zits here and there, or clearer skin that is very sensitive and peeling around my nose and chin. Using this causes no irritation even if I use 2x a day, and has really improved the quality of my skin texture and acne. There’s no trade off. I can confidently say it keeps breakouts at bay in a way nothing else has for me. Plus THE SOFTNESS!! I will never be without this. Worth every penny. holy grail exfoliator
