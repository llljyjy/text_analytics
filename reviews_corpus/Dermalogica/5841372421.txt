Ok so full disclosure this was a gifted product. I did love it, but I also felt it could be better. I have had these tiny bumps that boarder my jaw line/bottom of my cheeks for as long as I’ve been alive because of the dry climate I live in. Did it solve this problem, no, but it did smooth them as long as I used it twice as day without skipping a day. I will give this serum points for that because I’ve never had anything work before. I do wish the moisturizing effects lasted a bit longer, recognizing that is is just a serum, because it glides on well, smells nice and smooths my bumps. But you go through it quickly. I’d still recommend trying it, especially if u have normal skin, I think it would work really really well for those with normal / dry skin.
