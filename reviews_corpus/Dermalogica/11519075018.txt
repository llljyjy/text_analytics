I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling this daily microexfoliant. I find the exfoliant a bit too harsh for everyday but I love using it 2-3 times a week. I notice my skin being a bit smoother and having less breakouts on my skin. I also find it a less abrasive than other physical exfoliants. I would definitely purchase this. Not for everyday
