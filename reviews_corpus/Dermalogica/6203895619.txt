First of all I love that this has SPF 50! I have been trying to find a sunscreen that is SPF 50 and works well with my combination skin without leaving it greasy or with a white cast. The ones I have tried were SPF 40 or below so I was really excited to try this one as it is so important for me to protect my skin from this Texas sun. I really love it! It feels so nice on the skin, hydrating but not greasy. My makeup went on well over it and stayed put throughout the day too. It makes my skin feel supple and plump. The texture is not runny but thinner than a regular moisturizer and it feels very lightweight. It does have a soft scent to it but it’s not like a typical sunscreen smell. It’s more pleasant and I love the pump packaging it’s so convenient. So lightweight yet hydrating and plumps my skin!
