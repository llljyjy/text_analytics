I love all things Dermologica, and this product is no different. I use a retinol 2-3x a week, and this is one of the best ones I’ve tried. It doesn’t sting upon application, I wake up with glowing and clear skin, and it helps nullify any breakouts before they start. It also layers well under other products. Definitely recommend!
