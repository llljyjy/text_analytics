I was so hopeful for this. I have a ton of dermalogica products and hadn’t tried a cleanser. I didn’t like that it didn’t lather, it felt like I had to use more than needed. It also made me break out really bad. I’m grateful to be blessed with good skin, but after using this I broke out in 4 big pimples and it was awful. Not a fan
