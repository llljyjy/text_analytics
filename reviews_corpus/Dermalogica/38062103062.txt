I went to purchase a moisturizing foundation as my face felt dry with any product I use, and I wanted to get a good foundation that would not make my face look dry. The Sephora staff told me I need to follow a good skin care routine and she recommended this product along with a moisturizer. I started seeing the difference in my face after few days of usage. This is my week 3 of this product and my face is so much soft and supple. Absolutely in love with this product❤️ If you have a dry skin..your search ends here!
