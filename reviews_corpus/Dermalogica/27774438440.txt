I received 7 single-use packets of this product, complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. Iâ€™ve never used an exfoliant that starts off in powder form, you mix it with water and it creates like a paste. My expectations were so-so but I must say: I am VERY IMPRESSED with the results. So many exfoliants seem to do a lackluster job exfoliating but this product actually seemed to clean my pores, remove impurities and it improved my complexion within just a couple uses. My skin was visibly brighter after the first use and it only got better from there. I had a small mark on my cheek from when I popped a pimple a few months ago (sorry, gross, I know) and even that mark seems to have lightened. I will definitely be ordering the full-size version of this product because it actually does what it says!! Highly recommend trying it! nan
