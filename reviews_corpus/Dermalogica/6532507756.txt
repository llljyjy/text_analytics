I loved trying the Daily Microfoliant gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. My favorite thing about it has been being able to choose the consistency that I need for that day. Being able to use it as a scrub or foamy face wash depending on how much water I use. I also like to mix it with the Ultra Calming gel face wash for a really gentle scrub. Daily Microfoliant has replaced the exfoliant I was previously using. Great exfoliant
