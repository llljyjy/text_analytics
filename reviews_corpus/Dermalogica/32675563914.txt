It adds a nice boost of hydration before other products and I really do enjoy that. Application is easy also and it works well with the rest of my routine. It isn’t absolutely necessary though and I have no issue skipping this product a lot of the times. Like 90% of the times. But it is worth the purchase I just won’t be getting another bottle any time soon. I Like But I Don't Love
