I’ve tried a few of these exfoliating powders, and while I do keep one in my weekly skincare routine, I haven’t found any that are really life changing. I received this gifted by Dermologica sampling, and after getting to know it a bit have found this to be true for this product as well. On days that I need a thorough exfoliation I like to use the tiniest bit of water to make a pretty thick paste and add more water as I go along to gradually break down the powder into a frothy consistency. On days that I just want a little polish I’ll go in with more water and gently work the product around on areas that need exfoliating. I really love the smoothness this gives my skin, and it leaves behind no residue or irritation. I like to follow up with my normal routine with the addition of a nice moisturizer to keep my skin from potentially becoming dry or irritated. Id definitely recommend this if you’re looking for a little extra smoothness and are not super sensitive to exfoliating. My skin is so smooth!
