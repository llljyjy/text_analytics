The exfoliant was a great alternative for the Paula’s Choice exfoliant I normally use. I wanted to try a new exfoliant because it is always great to try something new. The scent from the product was not too strong and it felt nice after a couple of uses. Also, I was surprised about how different this exfolaint is from previous exfoliants I’ve seen and used. I would reccomend this product to people new to exfoliating as part of their skincare routine. nan
