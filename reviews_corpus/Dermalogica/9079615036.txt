I received this Awaken Peptide Eye Gel complimentary from Dermalogica to try and review.  As I age, I realize the true importance of great skincare for my eye area.   As a mom of 3 younger kids, I just can’t always get the amount of sleep that I truly need and it usually shows, especially around my eyes.  This eye gel hydrates and plumps up my under eye area and helps me look and feel more awake.  I love that this absorbs quickly and wears well under makeup.  I have yet to try a Dermalogica product that is short of amazing. I highly recommend this product and the brand as a whole. Helps me look awake even when I’m tired
