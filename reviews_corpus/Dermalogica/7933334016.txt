I’ve been wanting to try the Dermalogica daily microexfoliant for a while now. It comes out as a powder but once you add water, you’re good. The texture is smooth once you get your hands wet and the exfoliant isn’t too rough on your skin. It’s really fine and it leaves your skin so smooth and soft. I would definitely recommend the product. I did receive this sample complimentary from Dermalogica sampling. Gentle exfoliant for your skin
