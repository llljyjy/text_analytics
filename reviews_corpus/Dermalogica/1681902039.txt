Moisture in a bottle should be the name of this product because it felt so good on my skin. I really enjoyed this exfoliant because it made my dry skin feel sooooo soft. The original microexfoliant was a tad more rough and I think I actually prefer because it because it works so well! This milk exfoliant actually is more of a clay and although it worked amazing, I didn’t expect the texture to be like that. Amazing product that’s less abrasive than the original . It will work well for sensitive skin which I don’t have as well as combination skin types. Overall great product to moisturize skin while exfoliating skin very lightly. This product was complimentary from Dermalogica. I would definitely recommend to certain skins and continue to purchase the original formula. Baby’s bottom
