I was super excited to try this product!! As someone with very dry skin, I am a huge fan of hyaluronic acid serums. At first glance, this serum has a milky look to it.  The consistency when put on my face was very lightweight and smooth. It felt very hydrating and my face felt amazing afterwards. This serum definitely feels more hydrating than other serums I’ve tried. Overall I’m very happy with this amazing hydrating serum. I definitely felt a difference in hydration in glow after using this. This product was gifted to me by Dermalogica. Amazing Hydrating Serum
