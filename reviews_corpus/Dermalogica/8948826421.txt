This was my first time trying out a product that is a powder and involves having to get it wet to activate the consistency. It’s different but not mt favorite and could make a mess. It is easy to create the paste and once applied, I felt it working it’s magic! My skin has never felt so soft after using an exfoliator. ** I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for my honest opinion. ** nan
