This is a exfoliating enzyme powder that activates upon contact with water, it’s super gentle and helps to even skin tone, clear blemishes and reduce the appearance of pores. I have never had a scrub give my face such a instant glow. It leaves my skin super smooth, bright and glowing! Doesn’t strip the skin of any moisture just baby soft skin. I couldn’t recommend a product more or brand. Also this will last me forever! You only need a tiny bit of powder. So it’s definitely worth the price. *Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. Amazing exfoliant!
