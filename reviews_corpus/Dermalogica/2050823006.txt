This serum is great for my combination skin. I am a guy and there are very few reviews for men on the product so I wanted to let other guys know that this does well with combination and even acne prone skin. It has helped my skin (in combination with other products) tremendously. The only reason that I am giving this 3 stars is because every time it gets to be about 1/4 full the pump completely stops working and you have to unscrew it and tap it out. This is extremely frustrating when you have to do this for a product that costs as much as this one does. Dermalogica needs to fix this ASAP. Great Serum for combination skin, Faulty Pump.
