If you have combination acne prone skin like me, then you’ll know how difficult it is to find products that work without making your skin feel even more oily. This SPF product has been a game-changer for me!On those lazy days, I’ll only use this and I’ll have enough hydration and SPF protection.  It doesn’t leave my skin feeling oily or look shiny, and best of all it doesn’t aggravate my acne. nan
