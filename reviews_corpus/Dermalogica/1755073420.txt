Wanted to love this so bad…sadly, it doesn’t do much or enough to get me to reach for it more often.  Glad I tried the mini size though. This foams up nicely, not strong smelling (more of a muted scent).  Much prefer the Thermafoliant for a stronger exfoliating experience.   This is much milder form of exfoliate, good if you’re starting out with exfoliants. So-so
