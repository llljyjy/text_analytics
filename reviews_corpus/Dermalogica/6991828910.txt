*** Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling***I feel so bittersweet about this product. I loved the consistency and the creativeness with mixing my own cleanser. The way it foams is amazing and feels so good on the skin. However, I am not a scent of the smell! Maybe a got a bad batch, but man. I wasn’t expecting it to smell the way it did. If it had a different scent I would be sold!!!! Lol always worth a try though! Love the consistency… unsure about the fragrance.
