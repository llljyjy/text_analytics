Dermalogica never disappoints. I love that this sunscreen is SPF 50 and Age Smart because I need all the defense I can get from  wrinkles.  I have been using it in my AM routine to double both as my moisturizer and SPF.  It wears well under my makeup. Thin and I havenâ€™t had any weird pilling.  I let it soak in for at least 5 minutes tho. It smells nice too. wrinkle defense
