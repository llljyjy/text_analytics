Whenever I review skincare I always give it several weeks of use so I can actually tell how my skin responds. While you may think that this is just a regular hyaluronic acid serum, it’s so much more than that! It’s helped with my dryness, flakiness, sensitivity and also general dullness in my skin. I also have noticed my breakout activity decrease since using these as it’s really helping to keep my skin better balanced. Great on the skin alone, but I also like to put a few drops into my moisturizer for a little extra boost. I definitely will be purchasing another! #giftedbydermalogica More than a boring hyaluronic acid serum!!
