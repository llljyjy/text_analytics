No white cast! No eye stinging! For me, my preferred SPF  is chemical. This one didn’t leave me oily, there is no cast during application or after.The only con is the price- it’s a bit expensive for an SPF considering one should reapply and etc. However, I really like this. SPF moisturizer- firming, anti-aging.
