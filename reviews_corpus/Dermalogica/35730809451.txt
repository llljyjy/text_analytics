I don’t have acne, besides an occasional pimple, however I do have quite a few blackheads on my nose. I have SUPER oily skin, and this has helped SO much. I use it twice daily, and my skin is WAY less oily than usual. Plus, I’ve had less pop up pimples since using this. Combined with Tula Secret Solution, and Dermalogica Cooling Jelly (clear start line), along with SPF, I have had GLOWING skin that people have commented on! Do try!!! Great cleanser for oily skin!
