With the dry weather approaching, this cleanser has become an essential in my skincare routine. I love that it doesnâ€™t strip my skin dry like other cleansers do. It has a nice consistency to it as well that makes it very easy to apply and it leaves the skin very soft and bright! Great for winter skincare!
