I tried this out, I have very oily, sensitive, and dry skin. I’m not sure If I did this right but I didn’t get foamy consistency, just milky/runny. My skin feels significantly softer but after letting my skin dry, it made my skin feel tight. Maybe I should try out the blue bottled version but I’ll continue to try it out see how it goes so far this is my new go to for exfoliating. I love it, but made my skin feel tight.
