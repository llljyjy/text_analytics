Okay wow - these packets are insanely convenient if you’re traveling or maybe even camping? I am a material gorl that doesn’t camp but if I did... these would be perfect. But don’t underestimate the small packets - they pack a LOT of product and it’s so good! My skin loves this stuff, gifted to me by Dermalogica. Good stuff!
