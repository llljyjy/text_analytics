I remembered using Dermalogica’s Daily Microfoliant when I was in my 30s and really enjoyed it. I was wondering how it would work for my 50 something skin now and so when I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling, I was happy to test and review this again.I find that it’s a little more abrasive than my current lot of cleansers but I work around it by foaming it up with a little water in my hands first before applying it to my face for a more gentle cleanse.  It foams really well and leaves my skin feeling very clean. Still a classic after all these years!
