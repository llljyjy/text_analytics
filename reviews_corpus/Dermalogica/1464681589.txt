This is a super glowy, hydrating SPF. Like most dermalogica products this has their lavender scent but I do like it and it does not irritate my skin or eyes. Itâ€™s a thick consistency spreads easily, and leaves behind an incredible glow! If you have dry/normal skin you would love this one. I also find this looks amazing under my makeup as a glowy base. I also love the high SPF rating at 50. glowy, healthy skin
