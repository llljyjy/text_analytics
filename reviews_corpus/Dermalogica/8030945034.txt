I have not used dermalogica products in years but I was in for a pleasant surprise. After day 1 I saw and felt a visible difference on my skin texture. The powder to foam formula is very interesting and the smell is a little off. But I enjoyed how the product affected my skin. It is definitely effective. I would purchase again. I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica sampling Smooth skin!
