This has been a blessing for my sensitive skin.  Typically I have instant and significant reactions to retinol, but that is not the case with this one.  I started off using it every other night, but when I saw no adverse reaction, I started using it nightly.  It has been fantastic!  I wake up with my skin looking firmer and a lot less tired.  I am hoping over time, it will also help fade some of the sun and age spots I have.  This was given complimentary from Dermalogica. Great for sensitive skin
