This has got to be my favorite retinol product I’ve ever used! I could already see a difference in the way my fine lines, large pores and skin texture looked in less than 2 weeks. It’s lightweight and didn’t cause any irritation. I was a little worried about that because it it a high dose retinol but nope. A little also goes a long way so this bottle will last. Highly recommend. Gifted by Dermalogica Worth It!
