I love this product. I use it after targeted serums, for dark spots or brightening, and before moisturizer. My neck, décolletage, and face look and feel lush. I’ve always had a hard time with oils pilling and my sensitive skin having a reaction. But no problems with this Dermalogica product. Yes it is pricey, but my skin loves it. From Crepey to Lush
