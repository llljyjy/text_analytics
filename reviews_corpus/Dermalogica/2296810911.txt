I absolutely love everything about this moisturizer, it’s light, it doesn’t stick, great for my sensitive skin and a really nice natural scent. However, I am noticing this Fall that it’s no longer moisturizing enough for the colder weather. I’ve been using this for 2 years and I am going to try their skin smoothing cream this time around! Go to for Spring/Summer!
