I’m excited to received this retinol serum as a complimentary from Dermalogica - Sephora in exchanged for my honest review. Dermalogica is a great brand so I am looking forward to try it.The typical retinol serum I’ve tried is about 1% However, this is the first time I see 3%. The cream is light and easily absorbed into my skin. I really love this serum. I felt my skin health improved. nan
