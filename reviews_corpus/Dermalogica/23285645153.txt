I tried the product and what I love most about is that itâ€™s a mixture of a physical and chemical exfoliation. If you have any dark spots the should definitely help brighten them up. I find it leaves your skin very soft and smooth but you should definitely follow up with a moisturizer. This was gifted by Dermalogica sampling. Great product overall
