This is a great moisturizer. Not only does it protect my skin from the harmful uv rays with its broad spectrum SPF 50 but it also leaves my skin, hydrated, moisturized and feeling soft and smooth. It blends very easily. Does not leave any white cast. It’s lightweight and non-greasy on the skin. Overall, it’s an amazing product. Amazing!
