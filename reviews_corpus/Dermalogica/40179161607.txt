I really enjoyed using this product for the week! It was gifted to me by Dermalogica Sampling! I thought the single use packets were perfect for sampling and getting a good feel for how the product works. Plus it was easy to use and I didn’t feel overwhelmed or like I was wasting any product. While I haven’t noticed much of a difference, I do love how it makes my skin feel softer! My dermatologist recommended that I begin exfoliating more, so this product is just perfect! I will continue to use it and I am hopeful to see more results soon! Plus, after reading some of the other reviews, my hopes are really high that it will help with my acne! I will be looking to purchase a full-size product! Great!
