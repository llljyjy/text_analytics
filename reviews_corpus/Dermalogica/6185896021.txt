I was looking for a gentle exfoliator then i found this. I got the mini one because i want to try it out first before buying the regular size. The first time i used it boy i was impressed, my face feels smoother & clearer although it was first time using it. Iâ€™ll give it a week or so if anything happens but definitely worth the try! First time user & i fell in love.
