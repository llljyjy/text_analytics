I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling to test out. The microfoliant was incredibly easy to use and great to travel with.  I felt like it really helped keep my skin clear and removed blackheads.  I was wanting more of an exfoliating “scrub“ feel which it didn’t provide - however, it still held up to its claims! Doesn't feel like a scrub but does the same job
