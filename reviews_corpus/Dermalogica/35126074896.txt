This product is a good mechanical exfoliant since it has micro beads that won’t damaged or irritated the skin. This is a good exfoliator if you have blackheads and you want to treat them! I usually use it twice a week and that’s enough! Don’t over-exfoliate your skin please. I would recommend this product because I love how glowy my skin looked after I used it! The only reason I don’t give 5 stars to this products is only for the smell. I don’t know how to describe it but I don’t like it, however, it doesn’t bother me at the moment of using it! complimentary from Dermalogica. Great exfoliant
