I’ve been using this serum at night for a short time and it’s been great for hydration. My skin is very soft and plumped out in the mornings. Only thing i don’t love is the medicinal smell when you first put it on but it goes away very quickly. No clogged pores or breakouts, and it’s light weight enough for any skin type. If you’re looking for a great hydration serum this would be the one! Great hydration serum
