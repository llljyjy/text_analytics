I’m so grateful to have been gifted by Dermalogica Sampling for free in exchange for my review. I think the Daily Microfoliant is fine and it feels nice on my skin. I don’t know if I’ll repurchase, but I don’t have any complaints. I don’t see any significant difference in my skin, but I also already have healthy skin without any major concerns so there’s not really anything I really need to improve. Pretty good
