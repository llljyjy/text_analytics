made my skin feel so so smooth and like baby skin when i used it.  you feel the little particles exfoliating you without it being too harsh. when you add water it turns into a white paste and it is easy to see on your skin which is nice as a guide. it did get a little thick after working it into my skin for a while. wash it off well or it may leave some white remains. gifted by dermalogica sampling. i love as gentle exfoliator
