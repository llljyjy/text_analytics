The daily microfoliant was gentle on the skin and foamed up nicely which was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. I am usually not a fan of exfoliants because my skin is sensitive to such products, however this was not harsh on the skin. I would not purchase this product though because I do not use exfoliants in my skincare routine often. nan
