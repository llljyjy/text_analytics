Complimentary from Dermalogica - Iâ€™ve been enjoying this serum for my dry skin. It has a very light texture that melts into the skin. You only need a little and it immediately hydrates your skin. The hydration lasts a while too. I love using this at night and in the morning before my makeup. Great hydrating serum!
