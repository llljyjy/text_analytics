packaging.  It’s a really great exfoliant especially if your skin is sensitive or if you suffer with rosacea.  I found there was very little redness and no burning or tingling feeling afterwards.  I use this as part of my morning facial routine after I double cleanse, and because it’s so gentle, it can be used everyday.#gifted #octoly love it
