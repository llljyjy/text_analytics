Dermalogica gifted me their Awaken Peptide Eye Gel complimentary in exchange for my honest review.  This gel formula contains a blend of caffeine and active peptides to help decrease the appearance of tired, puffy eyes. It is one of the lightest under eye formulas I have ever used, and the gel seems to tighten my skin as opposed to moisturize it.  It would be great for someone who doesn’t like the feeling of product on their face as it dries almost instantly.  If you are focused on reducing puffiness and eye bags to look more awake, and don’t seek a lot extra moisture this could be a great product for you. This is not suited to my current personal needs for deep moisture, but I would have loved this in my 20s to help me look bright eyed in photos and on zoom calls. It truly eliminates under eye bags. Great at reducing puffiness!
