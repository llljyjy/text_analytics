This is my first product from Dermalogica and I am so impressed. This is a broad spectrum SPF50 which means it provides protection from both UVA and UVB rays. It comes in a pump bottle and has a creamy texture which I love. It goes on smoothly, leaves no white cast and gives a beautiful glow. It does not feel heavy but is moisturizing enough that if you have oily skin you could skip the moisturizer in summer. For my combo leaning towards dry skin, I am pairing it with a moisturizer. No White Cast SPF50
