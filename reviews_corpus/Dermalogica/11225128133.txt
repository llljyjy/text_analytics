I was gifted by Dermalogica this product and I recommend it! This serum has a thin consistency and a little goes a long way. When I have dry skin this serum hydrates my skin and I’m not as flaky anymore. It sits well with moisturizer after and definitely makes my skin more luminous. It’s a great size for serum and can see it lasting a good while. Luminous Serum
