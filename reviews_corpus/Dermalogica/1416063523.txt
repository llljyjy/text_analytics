I really enjoyed using The Daily Microfoliant by Dermalogica. I was gifted by the Dermalogica Sampling Team. I honestly felt it was a little messy at first with it being a powder.  Once I added water and applied it to my face, it was great. Nice consistency. I feel it would be gentle enough to use daily. I have sensitive skin and after the 7 day trial, my skin cleared up and looked refreshed. Awesome product and Iâ€™m glad I was able to sample this. I will continue to use this product because it worked great on my skin. Great Product!
