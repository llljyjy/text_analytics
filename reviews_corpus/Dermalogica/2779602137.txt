I honestly don’t use Dermalogica much, despite my aesthetician friend that keeps trying to push it on me! My Daily Glycolic Cleanser arrived about 4-5 days post chemical peel, and I took one for the team and decided to give it a go to see how the glycolic acid would affect my skin. (Please don’t try at home, this was just my decision and I wouldn’t want anyone to be affected if they try this on sensitive skin post-peel!) I was extremely surprised how my skin did not once tingle, sting, or have any sort of physical reaction upon using this cleanser! It was so soft actually, and extremely gentle. I tend to get clogged pores from oily skin, so exfoliating ingredient like glycolic are great for me. Days later, I’m still using and my skin is so soft, so perfected. I also really loved the packaging, and the pump dispenser that does not take up as much space as a traditional pump! Glowy smooth skin
