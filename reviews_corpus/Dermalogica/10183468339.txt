I’ve been using this product for about a week gifted by dermalogica and I’m loving how my skin feels after use. I use it in the morning and it leaves my skin feeling nice and refreshed. It has the consistency that feels slightly like a thin sunscreen and over all my skin feels less tired looks better. Skin looks nice
