Before I received this 7 days sample as a complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling, I have brought a travel size in store. I definitely would recommend if budget is not what you consider while choosing a cleanser. In my opinion, I feel this cleanser is the most gentle exfoliation cleanser did not give you greasy feeling after cleaning. It contains Papain Enzymes and acid which help remove the dead cells on your skin in a chemical way, and it does have some solid particle to smooth your skin in a physical way. I do not think you should use on a daily basis even though it  says it is gentle enough for daily use. Basically I should stop here, but this product does have some draw backs, the price is really high depend on how many I need to use for one time cleaning. I am not sure I am use it in a correct way, it does not give me much foam if I did not put enough powder in mixing with water. In deed, choose it if you have no worry about in choosing skincare products. Choose it if you can afford it
