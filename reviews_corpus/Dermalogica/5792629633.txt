This product was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling, and I must say, I ended up purchasing the full bottle shortly after the first use. When you first feel the dry texture of the Dermalogica exfoliant, it feels harsh, but as soon as you add water and mix it, turning the product into a paste like feel, it feels like a high end exfoliating facewash. The results left my skin feeling smoother and looking brighter and that was only after the first use! I’ve also been experiencing skin peeling issues and this worked to combat and restore my skin back to normal. I absolutely love how this product works and how it isn’t harsh on the skin. Definitely a staple in my self-care night routines from now on! The best skin care staple!
