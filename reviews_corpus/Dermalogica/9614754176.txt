First off, I am absolutely obsessed with this product. I have dry and sensitive skin, and usually have a hard time with exfoliants because they are irritating and leave my skin drier than before using. I did not have this issue with this product! It left my skin so soft and smooth, and did not irritate my skin at all. I love how creamy the formula is once mixed with water as well. I have never used an exfoliant like this one, and now Iâ€™m never going back! This one is a winner. Although this product was gifted by Dermalogica, I will 100% be repurchasing :) Amazing exfoliant!
