Too oily.  Hear me out.  I’ve only ever used Tatcha’s oil cleanser, which I like very much.  This one takes your makeup off just as well, but unlike Tatcha’s, you MUST use a cleanser to remove the oil from your face.  While that’s my usual practice, sometimes I just want to swipe some cotton with miscellar water across my face and be done. Not happening with this stuff. I’m sure it’s perfect for someone who’s used to this type of oil precleanse, but it’s just not for me. nan
