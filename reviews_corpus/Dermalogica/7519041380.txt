Gifted by Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review. I immediately loved reading about this when it came out and it didn’t disappoint. I love that it’s vegan, the great smell, and how amazing and soft it feels on my skin. All other exfoliators are way too harsh for my face and I finally found one that fits me so well. This got me hooked on Dermalogica products and I can’t wait to try more. 10/10 all around!! nan
