Tremendous heads up for anyone sensitive to ingredients: the INCI posted here is not the same on my box. I would recommend you check the Dermalogica website. I cannot emphasize to Sephora enough how important it is to check, double check, and triple check for accurate ingredients (I recognize they have a disclaimer, but as someone with allergies, I find this situation more upsetting)The final ingredients list includes the following essential oils: bergamot, grapefruit, lemon, sandalwood, orange. To clarify, some people will likely enjoy this smell and experience no issues.The formula is nice and hydrating otherwise, and with quite a lot going on. My skin typically responds well to the algae/lactobacillus ingredients, and I appreciate the approach of going beyond just hyaluronic acid and incorporating polyglutamic acid.Final thoughts: Iâ€™m sure many will enjoy this, but please proceed with caution if you have sensitive or allergy-prone skin!
