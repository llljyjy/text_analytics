Gifted by Dermalogica sampling. I have combination skin. I’ve struggled finding an exfoliant that cleans my skin but doesn’t strip it/leave it feeling too dry. I love it! It works really well for those who are acne-prone with fungal acne or clogged pore this product gets in deep so you’ll notice a difference the next morning. It’s gentle enough for daily use and effective enough to treat hyperpigmentation and prevent outbreaks. Good for combination skin
