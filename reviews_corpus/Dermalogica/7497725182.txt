I’m a huge fan of Dermologica products. I’ve been using their products for years. I also love their exfoliants so I was very pumped to try this one out.  I found this product to be very gentle and non-irritating. It lathered up into a nice soft foam which felt great on my face. My skin felt really clean after use. I didn’t get the same smoothness I have come to expect from their exfoliants, so if you are looking for a product similar to the daily microfoliant, this is not your product. However, if you found the others too harsh or you have sensitive skin, this product is for you. A little product goes a long way so this bottle will last you a long time. I used this product for six weeks before sharing my opinion because I wanted to make sure this review was as complete as possible. My skin is oily, acne prone with some redness and pigmentation.
