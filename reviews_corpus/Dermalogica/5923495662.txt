Dermalogica gifted me this s staple, but I’ve been using this microfoliant cleanser for awhile, and have been a staple! It’s gentle enough to use everyday, but is able to still have your skin feeling super clean after. I have sensitive dry combo skin, and this does not dry or irritate my skin. Gentle and Effective!
