This is a really elegant chemical sunscreen that is a is easy to apply, while also being moisturizing and pretty lightweight. I like that the formula includes antioxidants in the form of White Tea, as well as a polypeptide which the package says can help improve the appearance of photoaged skin. While the formula is nice, I do not like the fragrance of this (smells like cloves) and I would not purchase this with my own money because it is so expensive. I received this for free from Dermalogica in exchange for honest review. Nice Sunscreen
