Complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. This is my first time trying a product like this and am surprised at how much it worked. The powder didn’t become as pasty as I thought but I think it’s because of the amount of water. Once I applied it, I felt the gentle physical exfoliation due to the grit of the powder. My face was so smooth. I even did a little face massage with my moisturizer cause my skin was just gliding. It does look like my face is glowing a bit from the exfoliation but I think overtime, I will see the brightening benefits. Gentle physical exfoliation perfect for daily use
