My dermatologist recommended a gentle exfoliator 2wice a week for my forehead undergoing microneedling. I went to Sephora & the clerk recommended this.I bought the mini to try it out. I love it! My skin is SO soft & glows. I will be repurchasing when this is out. I like the fact that it isnâ€™t harsh like most exfoliators! nan
