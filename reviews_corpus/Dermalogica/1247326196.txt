A physical exfoliate I love using. A little goes a LONG way. Make sure to add water and rub in your palms before putting it on your face if you haven’t used it before. My face (and hands) feel so soft and fresh after using this product.  This has been a staple in my skincare. “gifted by Dermalogica Sampling“ nan
