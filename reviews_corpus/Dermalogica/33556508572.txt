I received this complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review. I am not very familiar with exfoliants as I have dry patchy skin and tend to get red sensitive spots. I used this once hoping it wouldnâ€™t irritate my skin and it didnt! I will use once a week for now but it helped my flaky skin. nan
