This is one of the best Vitamin C moisturizers I’ve tried so far. I’m quite particular with what goes into my skin and I was hesitating on the price point for awhile, but after researching the ingredients and reading reviews, I decided to give it a shot and I’m glad I did!I have Combination skin, oily T-zone with stubborn blackheads. My complexion can vary between dull & ashy or bright & glowing. This largely depends on the quality of my sleep, but good skincare definitely plays a big part in improving my skin. I’ve been using this Vitamin C moisturizer every morning (I use another hydrating moisturizer for night) and I’ve noticed my dark spots aren’t as obvious anymore, my skin looks brighter and feels well-hydrated.This does give you a tacky/sticky feeling (like some have mentioned) when you first apply it on your skin. So I mix a few drops of face oil (I use YTTP’s Superberry Hydrate oil) with the the BioLumin-C moisturizer in my palm, mix it together and apply on my face and neck. It glides on much more smoothly and my face feels wonderful. I apply my sunscreen after and everything sits in harmony on my happy face. :) Love It
