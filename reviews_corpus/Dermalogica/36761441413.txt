I love this exfoliant that I was gifted by Dermalogica because it is super gentle and has amazing ingredients! Most exfoliants I have used in the past leaves my skin burning or extremely irritated, but this exfoliant actually did the opposite leaving my skin refreshed and cleared up a minor rash I had. This product is a 10,0000/10 for me, and I recommend this for my sensitive, acne prone, combination skin girlies like me. Must Have Exfoliant!
