I was gifted by Dermalogica sampling ! I was originally a bit worried my skin was going to be irritated by this product (my skin is normally very sensitive). I will say it does do a pretty good job of clearing the skin up from breakouts however, I think super consecutive use could be a bit excessive. I tried it a few days in a row but had to give my skin a break. Pretty decent overall.
