This item was gifted by Dermalogica sampling in exchange for my honest review. First and foremost, it was rather interesting “activating” the product with water to then lather the foamy paste on your face. Unfortunately I don’t really see the product as being an exfoliator however it does certainly seem to achieve smoother, brighter skin with persistent use. The trial sample size really hasn’t provided enough product to really see if there would be continued improvement. Overall, I enjoyed trying the product. Brighter, smoother skin
