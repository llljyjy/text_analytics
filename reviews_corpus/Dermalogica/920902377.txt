Clean skin is beautiful skin. This product is still the gold standard of cleansing balms/oils. Itâ€™s the best out there for keeping your skin clean from makeup, dirt, and pollution. I look forward to using this every night because it smooths over my skin like silk and has a calming scent. There is a reason why estheticians use this product religiously on their clients. Dermalogica is one of the best skincare lines out there which is why so many spas use the line for facials. I have friends who are estheticians who use it on their own faces. If they use it, well I take it as a sign I should, too. Best cleansing oil out there. Smells great, too!
