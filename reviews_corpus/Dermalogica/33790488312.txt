I received this complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review. This is a very gentle exfoliator. I love that it has Papaya & Salicylic Acid. This didnâ€™t irritate my skin at all. It feels so soothing when massaging it on your skin. This has helped tremendously with my breakouts. Very effective!
