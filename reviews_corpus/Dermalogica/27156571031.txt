I have been testing this serum for the past several weeks, both morning and night, and am very pleased with the results! The texture of this serum is so light feels amazing on my skin and it absorbs beautifully. I can really feel my skin soak up the moisture of this serum and I love the immediate serge of hydration after each application. The texture of my skin instantly improves and is much more healthy looking and hydrated than before use. I absolutely love how it seeps deep below the skin surface to prevent hydration evaporation, and since using I have not had anymore dry patches on my skin at all! My skin has completely transformed and is so much more radiant and hydrated thanks to this serum! I absolutely recommend it!*Gifted by Dermalogica Amazing Hydration!
