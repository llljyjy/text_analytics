The Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant is a rice based powder that you mix into a paste using a small amount of water. This process releases the enzymes and salicylic acid that help to gently exfoliate dead skin. Meanwhile licorice, white tea, and phytic acid brighten and balance while allantoin and colloidal oatmeal soothe and nourish. I have used this product every day since I received it and have had no damage to my skin. On the contrary, my complexion looks radiant, I have no dry patches, and my skin is silky-soft. I have always loved a good scrub to my face, but many physical exfoliants are too harsh and damage the skin barrier. This exfoliant is different; it is just gritty enough to feel good without causing redness or irritation, and it has incredible ingredients that help give you a beautiful, healthy glow. I have quickly fallen in love with this product and plan to purchase it to use every 2-3 days (this is my personal preference). I recommend trying this product, especially if you tend to accumulate build-up in your pores or have dry, flaky skin. Definitely added to my purchase list!
