I received this product from Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for my honest review. I was really pleasantly surprised with Dermalogicaâ€™s Daily MicroFoliant. I usually need to use chemical exfoliants because physical exfoliants bother my skin. However, this was product was different. I really found that this product was gentle enough to use on a daily basis and brightened my skin. Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling! Great!
