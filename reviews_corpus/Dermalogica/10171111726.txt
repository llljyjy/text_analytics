This Dermalogica milk exfoliant has quickly become a go to for my drier skin, especially in these hot sunny summer months. It is so gentile yet effective at sloughing off dead skin cells and dirt while soothing and repairing the skins moisture barrier leaving no irritation or redness. The texture is smooth without any grittiness that typically comes in many exfoliants. It foams up very lightly into a milky consistency which feels amazing on the skin. Definitely will recommend to all fellow skincare loving friends and family. Gifted by Dermalogica. Gentile yet effective
