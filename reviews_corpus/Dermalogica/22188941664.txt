This dermalogica exfoliating powder is so refreshing. After using it for a week my skin feels softer. It it so easy to use and so convenient to take on the go .  My face does seem smoother and skin tone brighter after using this . It turns into a creamy paste with just your wet hands .  It is easy to rinse off as well . It is gentle on my skin so fine for daily use . I was gifted by Dermalogica sampling . Great for daily use !
