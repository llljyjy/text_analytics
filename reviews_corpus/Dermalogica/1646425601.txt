I’ve been a fan of Dermalogica products for a while. I have also just started getting into using Retinol products. This serum is really luxurious feeling and I like the sleek packaging. After using it for a little over a week I feel like my skin is looking really smooth, firm, and healthy. I’m looking forward to continuing to use this and seeing even more results. Received complimentary from Dermalogica - Sephora, I’m exchange for my honest review. Dermalogica
