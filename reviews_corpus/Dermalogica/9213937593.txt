@dermalogicacanada generously provided this product for use and my review. I have been a long-standing Dermalogica consumer and this moisturizer does not disappoint. I do not usually use gel moisturizers but this one seems to agree with my skin. I typically use one pump in the morning and it takes a few minutes to absorb before it loses its sheen. Once it has settled into my skin, my complexion is smooth with a natural glow. I like what this product does for my overall appearance and will purchase it in the future! #giftedbydermalogica #dermalogicacanada Nice product!!
