I wanted to love this but I couldn’t because it stripped all the oil off my face to the point where my skin hurt. I didn’t use much (about a penny size). And it did foam a bit but I’ve never had a cleanser that made my skin more dry. For reference I have combo skin so half my face is oily and half is dry. made my skin drier/hurt
