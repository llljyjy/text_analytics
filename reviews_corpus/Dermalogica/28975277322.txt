I received this product complimentary from the Dermalogica in exchange for your opinion.  My mature skin is always looking for products to keep my skin hydrated.  This is a lightweight serum and absorbs well into the skin.  This didnâ€™t leave a sticky residue which was great as I do not like a sticky serum. My skin felt hydrated and dewy after using this. I am very happy with this serum. Hydrated
