This was gifted by Dermalogica - Sephora for my honest review. I have tried out a few retinols in my 30s, some good and some doing absolutely nothing. With my oily/combo skin, I feel like I need a product that can penetrate through my oily layer to be effective. And this product does just that. A thin layer is plenty of product, and has a silly smooth texture that dries down quickly. Absolutely make sure you moisturize and use spf after using this, because I can easily see it leading to irritation as your skin accustoms to use. A penetrating retinol!
