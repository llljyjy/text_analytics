this serum was gifted by dermalogica in exchange for my honest review and boy is This serum is lovely! It really has a light texture and doesn’t irritate the skin. I get terrible redness and flaking from retinol products but this one did not cause me any issues and I can already see my skin looking smoother and plumper. I’d recommend it! A must have for sensitive skin!
