I have suffered on and off with problematic skin. Breakouts, redness, uneven tone. I’m very insecure when it comes to my skin and always feel the need to wear make up.This was gifted to me by dermalogica sampling and I have to say, since using it my skin is brighter and smoother and I’m starting to feel more confident in the way I look. I haven’t worn make up as much, but I will say that when I do my foundation goes on flawlessly. No dry patches, no flakiness. I owe that to this.I have been using it in the morning and it is extremely easy to use. I put it in my hands and wet them to form a paste then I apply it in circular motions and wash off. I feel like it’s a must to apply moisturizer afterwards, but it helps me start my day refreshed. I will be purchasing the full size of this as it has only been a week and I think with constant use my skin could look ever betterThank you dermalogica! If you suffer withuneven skin tone you NEED this!
