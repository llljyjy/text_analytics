This really does make me look more rested after about 10-15 minutes. I use a roller with it and boom! I look much more awake. It says it’s for dry skin but I’m very oily and have no issues.  It hydrates nicely too. This is a great little secret weapon for depuffing quickly in the morning or anytime really. Gifted by Dermalogica Look away in 10
