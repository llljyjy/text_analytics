I have been enjoying the Dermalogica Special Cleansing gel. It is a gel to foam cleanser that lathers up really well. I find it works well to break down makeup, but doesnâ€™t strip the skin.  It has lavender, balm mint, and aloe to hydrate, soften, and moisturize the skin.  The bottle is large and should last quite awhile. I would recommend! Gifted by Dermalogica. Excellent cleanser!
