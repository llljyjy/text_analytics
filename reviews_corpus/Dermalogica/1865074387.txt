I love Dermalogica & I had to try this awaken peptide eye gel. I like to keep it in the fridge & apply it on the mornings. I immediately saw how it helped with my puffy eyes & on those days when they look tired it helped awaken them. Of course I also saw an improvement with my fine lines.  I received complimentary from Dermalogica. You need it
