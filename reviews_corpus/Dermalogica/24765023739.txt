I received the Daily Microfoliant Exfoliator complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for my honest review. I love how easy it was to use this product. The directions are simple to follow. I just placed about half a teaspoon of powder into my wet hands. Then I rubbed them together to form a paste. I was able to apply the paste to my face in upward, circular motions. After one minute, I rinsed the exfoliator clean. I liked how I could feel the exfoliant on my skin, the tiny granules working their magic. The more I rubbed the paste onto my face, the less gritty it became. It has a light clean scent, and I instantly felt it softening my skin. The paste rinses clean, easily, and completely. When I dried my face, it looked and felt softer to the touch. It did not feel dried out or pasty. I have been using it for about a week now, and my skin looks brighter and my skin looks more even. It is gentle enough that I can use it daily. Although this was a sample for me to try for a week, I will be using it again in the future, since it had such great results. Softer, Brighter Skin
