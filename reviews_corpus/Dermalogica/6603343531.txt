The complimentary from Dermalogica microfoliant is an okay product to remove like dirt and impurities from the face. Itâ€™s not harsh on the skin and it foams up quite nicely after you add water to it. I have felt after using it that my skin feels a bit softer and looks smoother. It's a good product
