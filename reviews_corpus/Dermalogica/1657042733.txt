I am extremely picky about the cleansers I use. I’ve been using the same nighttime cleanser for at least 4-5 years and I’ve loved it. I had to opportunity to try this out, GAME CHANGER!  I’ve been using it daily for about a month and I’ve noticed a HUGE difference in my skin. It feels so smooth immediately after each wash, my skin is much smoother, less texture, less congestion, and more hydrated thanks to this cleanser. I’M HOOKED. This is going to be a permanent part of my night time skin routine. I love how gentle it is, as well as it’s calming and hydrating properties. I can’t rave enough about it!@dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica GAME CHANGER!
