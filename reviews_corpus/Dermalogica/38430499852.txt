It seems to be good. I tried it just for the first time and it feels good. I don’t know if I’d continue using it because it has Salic acid in it which is absolutely terrible for your skin. Salic acid is fantastic to get rid of acne but once you stop using the product it will make it 10x worse. Gifted by dermalogica sampling nan
