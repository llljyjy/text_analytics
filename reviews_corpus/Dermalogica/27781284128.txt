I have always issues with discoloration and texture problems of my skin. I used to be a terrible young adult with taking self care and skin care days . My skin 3 years later shows the signs but dermalogica daily microfoliant is the answer . My skin looked amazing after just after four uses. I use it only once a day for about 7 days to see the difference my dark spots have faded. My skin donâ€™t look so rough and my post acne scars are almost gone. I just worked this baby into my already daily skin care routine. So worth the try if you have discoloration or texture issues. I received this product complimentary from Demalogica Sampling and in no way has  my honest opinion been influenced by outside sources. My opinion is 100 % my own. My Skin New Bestie
