This product was gifted by dermalogica, it immediately feels super nice on the skin and absorbs very well. It doesn’t smell at all and is super lightweight. My skin also hasn’t broken out but i do feel like it should be a bit more hydrating. My skin LOOKS Hydrated hit it doesn’t feel hydrated. My skins actually glowing with this product but i do need a lotion over it. Glowing skin
