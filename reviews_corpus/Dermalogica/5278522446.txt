I bought this after watching a jackie aina video and there’s not much to rave about. I used the whole tube and didn’t see a difference in color or wrinkles around the eye area. The formula is very watery and feels sticky under the eyes once dried and the packaging is awful. You have to be very careful squeezing the tube otherwise since it’s watery it will shoot out everywhere. Didn’t feel worth the money spent. Not worth the money
