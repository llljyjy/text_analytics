This is a really nice SPF! It leaves a nice glow to the skin that lasts throughout the day. It’s very hydrating so if you have oily skin this can probably double as your moisturizer in the mornings. I also like that’s it’s SPF 50 so it offers a high amount of protection. Great moisturizer-SPF hybrid!
