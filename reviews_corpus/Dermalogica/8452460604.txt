I bought this years ago on a whim. I’ve had such oily/ acne prone skin i looked like a grease ball. somehow i feel like it toned it down?! I know you should get a gel moisturizer for oily skin, which i love those! but this is sooo good and moisturizing but not too much where you can feel it sitting on top of your skin. I’ve tried countless moisturizers from the drugstore and ulta/sephora and i would constantly break out. this is my savior and comes in a huge bottle which is a win lol! will keep on buying. Good for oily/acne prone skin!
