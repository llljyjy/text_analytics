This product is gifted by Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review. My skin loves a gentle physical exfoliation from time  to time. I usually do this twice a week. I love that this Dermalogica daily microfoliant is so gentle. My skin feels smoother, softer and looks brighter after one use! I did not experience any redness as I usually do with other physical exfoliators. Brighter skin!
