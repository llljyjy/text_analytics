Gifted by Dermalogica.  I have some pretty prominent eye bags and dark circles, so I’m always on the hunt for the best eye cream that will make the biggest difference. From the get go this one has been outstanding and I don’t say that lightly. I use about a pea size amount under each eye and pat it out using my ring finger. It firms the area without feeling tight, there’s a slight brightening effect, but overall it just really enhances the skin around your eyes. It wears great under makeup with no pilling, no patching, and is very moisturizing. Great for dry mature skin
