I really like how this feels on the skin. It was very cooling and light it also felt like it left my under eyes very refreshed and I definitely liked applying it.  Itâ€™s not super moisturizing but I also have pretty dry skin so this would be really good for a normal oily, skins also if you layer it with a more moisturizing Eye cream I think it would be great.
