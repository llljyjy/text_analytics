This product was received complimentary from Dermalogica SamplingI guess my skin really needed some exfoliation because this product really made a difference. You don’t generally see results from a product after just one use, so I was very surprised to see how good it worked.I am not a huge fan of the fact that it is a powder. Why couldn’t it be already mixed with a liquid like most exfoliating masks? I feel like this makes it a bit wasteful since it is hard to dispense the powder without getting it all over the place. Luckily, I used it while in the shower, so that made the whole thing less messy. It wasn’t difficult to mix with water, it was easy to apply and it felt good on the skin. Not too abrasive, but noticeable. I did my very best to rinse it well, or so I thought, but when I got out of the shower I noticed I still had powder particles stuck on my hairline. So I wasn’t a big fan of that part.On the other hand, my skin looked really smooth and it felt very soft and silky and brighter. Yes, it does work and the results are impressive! It made my skin really smooth!
