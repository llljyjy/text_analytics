Absolutely love the creamy, nourishing texture of this retinol serum. It’s perfect for the winter weather and it’s super plumping as well. I find this to be gentle enough but my skin is used to retinol so beginners might want to try the sandwich method first. It definitely takes a bit of time to see results (in my case acne) though but it’s a mild OTC option.*Complimentary from Dermalogica nan
