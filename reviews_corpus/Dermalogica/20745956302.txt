this is a  magic in a bottle. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and I can notice my skin get much softer, firmer, and my pores are looking smaller too but i love the most that it stay hydrated now. it does give a glowing and tightening effect on the skin and has a decent number of effective ingredient . my skin getting smoother now no more uneven texture. complimentary from Dermalogica a must if you have dry skin
