This was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling.  I found this to be a lot softer on my face compared to the other exfoliants. While it still made my face feel soft and removed all the dead skin as the others. I would recommend this if you donâ€™t want something as harsh as some of the others. Softer than other exfoliants.
