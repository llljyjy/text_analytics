Iâ€™ve used this product for 5 days and so far I love it. I use it in the shower every night. I find that the easiest way to do it because it is the powder form that you need to activate with water. Sometimes that can be messy above my sink. It made my skin look and feel much smoother. Great for sensitive skin. I would prefer is the smell was a little bit different but not a big issue. Love it!complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. - honest review Perfect for sensitive skin
