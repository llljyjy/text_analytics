My only drawback the little packages we were given in the kit tore easy and I usually like more fragrance to my skincare, it was very to use empty the clay out of the packets cup your hands let a little seep and mix together rubbing in a circular motion for a good minute and rinse off. Overall gave a nice deep clean that felt refreshing.  I love the claims how it brightens in 7 days. With great ingredients salicylic acid and papaya enzymes what helps with the bright skin phytic acid from rice bran .I would have loved more scent Good
