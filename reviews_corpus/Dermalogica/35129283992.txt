have always been a fan of Dermalogica since every product is so effective. This product is no different. I have been using the full sized bottle for a year and I still have plenty left. I recently received more complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling on top of it so I dont know will I ever be able to finish my bottle. Itâ€™s great for 1-2 times a week before makeup when your chemical exfoliate fail you. It brightens my dark spot and make my face so soft every time. Must have for skin care routine
