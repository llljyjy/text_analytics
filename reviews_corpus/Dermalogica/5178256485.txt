Really impressed with this SPF moisturizer! I am always looking for dual purpose products that cut down time getting ready in the morning and this one is a winner! It does a really great job at moisturizing my skin and also protecting it from sun damage. SPF 50 is pretty high and I am pleased with it. My skin feels soft and smooth after applying it and it melts into my skin nicely. The texture is awesome and it does not have that chemical sunscreen smell which I love! Good!
