I got a free sample of this stuff and used it for 2 nights. It felt SUPER luxurious and smelled great. I wish I had researched the ingredients before using it though, I just figured if it was Dermalogica it must be legit. EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW that the main ingredient is silicone, which is known to clog pores. I have been dealing with one of the worst breakouts of my life the last two weeks. I have at least 7 zits just on my lower face and Iâ€™m still dealing with the effects. PLEASE USE CAUTION if you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend not using this!! BE CAREFUL
