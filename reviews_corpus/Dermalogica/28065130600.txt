This utilizes Hyaluronic Acid to penetrate skin’s surface for deep hydration.Polyglutamic Acid which is the key ingredient replenishes skin’s hydration from within.An Algae Extract-infused moisturizing matrix delivers long-lasting hydration.Review: It makes my skin feel hydrated which lasts few hours. It has a nice thick formula but is not at all sticky. I feel my skin barrier has strengthened after using this serum. It is definitely my favourite with the weather changing now! I think for those with dry skin, you will definitely need additional hydration.It’s best for those with combination-oily skin. nan
