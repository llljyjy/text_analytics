I was gifted by Dermalogica and I’m surprised by this serum! Love the bottle and the applicator, and the actual product is a cloudy liquid (like a thicker hyluaronic acid serum). Super quick and easy to sink into the skin and left it extremely soft, glowy, and hydrated. Did not think I’d like this product so much. The only downside is there are a few citrus ingredients that are a potential irritant and give it a fragrance that I don’t think is necessary. But love how it makes my skin feel! Baby soft skin
