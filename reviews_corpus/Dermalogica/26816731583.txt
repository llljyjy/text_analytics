I received a sample of this product complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling for my honest review. I havenâ€™t used a physical exfoliant for a few years now, but I was surprised by how much I like this product. I like that you can tailor how thick you make the paste for your own skin needs. Even after one use, my skin felt and looked visibly smoother. I would absolutely use the full size of this. I will say, while this claims to be safe for every day use, I would personally only use it once or twice a week for my specific skin needs. A great physical exfoliant!
