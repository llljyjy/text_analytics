I buy this for my husband. He has extremely delicate and sensitive skin, often experiences allergic reactions, and on top of that, his skin is quite dry. This cream is a miracle-worker for him. Hydrates, soothes and protects his skin. I noticed that when he uses it regularly, his skin looks much better. I use it too sometimes but since I don’t have any extreme skin concerns (I’m 27 y.o. and I have combination skin, not sensitive) it works just fine for me - nothing special. I wouldn’t buy it for myself and I lean towards cheaper products like Origin, that work beautifully too. Great for sensitive skin!
