The Dermalogica daily mircofoliant is a great to use everyday! The actual product is a fine powder that you can make into a paste. I like to thin mine out with a bit more water and emulsify it with my hands. The product can lather into small bubbles and I put that all over my face. It is so gentle on the skin! This doesnâ€™t dry out my skin at all. It makes it brighter and gives me a healthy glow! Very gentle
