I received this complimentary from Dermalogica for my honest opinion.  I love that it comes in a powder so you can add water to adjust the strength. It feels really nice and calming on the skin. It leaves my face feeling smooth and brighter, since Iâ€™m buffing the dead skin away. I personally love this product and the results it gives me. Dermalogica never disappoints. Great product
