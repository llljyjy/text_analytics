I get interrupted sleep because of my baby and my eyes get puffy, I live that I can use this and it visible reduces puffiness I put it in the fridge for the extra boost. It leaves my eye area feeling smooth and hydrated and I can even apply makeup after letting it get absorbed for a few minutes. I really love this and will continue to use it for greater results.
