I like the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant Exfoliator very much. It’s comes in a powder form. You have to put some in your wet hands and then rub your hands together. It forms a nice lather that you have to put on your face in circular motions for one minute. It left my face really clean. There’s no perfume or scent to this product which I like very much. It didn’t give me any reaction (I have sensitive skin). Gifted by Dermatologica Sampling. nan
