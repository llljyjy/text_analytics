I love how this serum moisturize my skin. I use it at my bed time routine after cleansing and toning and before cream. I wish the texture felt little less sticky but if you pat it instead just rubbing around it feels good. Overall great quality product like all Dermalogica skin care I tested so far. Gifted by Dermalogica. Great product
