This is one of the Dermalogica products that worked so well for me. I received this from the company right before a series of Fraxel laser treatments and I used this one week after to rebuild my skin barrier and rehydrate my skin. It sinks in beautifully and is not tacky. I definitely recommend this. dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica Plump, hydrated skin
