I have been using this microfoliant exfoliator off and on for years. It is so easy to use- simply put a bit of the powder in your palm and mix with a bit of water to form a paste. My skin feels so smooth afterwards, without the harsh abrasion other exfoliants can cause. So gentle compared to traditional exfoliants
