This Dynamic Skin retinol from Dermalogica is a good retinol product. I use it a couple nights a week and have seen no irritation. I like the air pump bottle for easy usage. The fragrance of the product is not overwhelming and I love that it contains squalane in it as well.  gifted by Dermalogica - Sephora. Good Product
