I have been using this consistently for months and it is the best exfoliant Iâ€™ve ever used. Gets the job done but is super gentle so I can use it every morning. I typically have very dry skin, but this has not caused any type of irritation or dry, patchy breakouts that I would get previously. Consistency is key! Would recommend this product to anyone and everyone A staple in my morning routine
