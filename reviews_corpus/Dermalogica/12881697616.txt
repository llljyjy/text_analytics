I have received this Daily Microfoliant sampling as a complimentary from Dermalogica sampling. After using it for a few days my skin feels clean and fresh, also looks a little bit brighter, I haven’t noticed a huge difference but I have used it just for a couple days. Of course the fresh feeling is amazing and yes it looks a little brighter than it was before. I’m pretty sure that after using it for a couple more days I will notice more differences. Because of the great feeling after using it and the smooth look, I recommend this daily microfoliant. Smooth look
