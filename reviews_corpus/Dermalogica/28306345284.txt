Iâ€™m not too big on skincare, even though I feel like I definitely should be because its more important than makeup lowkey! But anyways this skincare exfoliant sample (gifted by Dermalogica Sampling) definitely made my experience better with skincare, I feel like it actually cleans my face as opposed to a regular facewash! The consistency is amazing as well. nan
