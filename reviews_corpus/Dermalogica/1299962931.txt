I love the foamy texture of this exfoliant. I wish that the granules were a little more fine, but that’s just a personal preference and I feel it performed well. It was easy to rinse, although I definitely think I could’ve used less than provided in the single use packets, the measured amount gave enough to also exfoliate the neck and chest. After using, I can definitely tell that my skin has a smoother texture and I have not had any irritation from over-exfoliation. I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. Well done product
