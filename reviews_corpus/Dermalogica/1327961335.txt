I have been using this product for the last 6 months as part of my nighttime skincare routine.  I don’t use it daily, but I tend use it to take the grime of the day off when I’ve been wearing heavy makeup or if I feel buildup on my skin, because it is gentle and makes my skin feel cleaner.  I don’t use more than a dime size of the powder and it’s plenty and I wet my face first so that it blends well. Besides feeling like my skin is ultra clean, I think the exfoliating helps my makeup look more smooth as well.   This product was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. Leaves skin feeling super clean
