Used this for a week straight with just moisturizer and no flaking! My skin is slightly dry, but nothing a good Hyaluronic acid serum and moisturizer can’t fix. Considering this is a 3.5% retinol complex, that’s pretty impressive.  I’ve been skipping foundation because my skin looks so good! It’s brighter, smoother, and overall more even. Results even for retinol veterans!
