I was luckily gifted a 7 day trial of this daily microfoliant complimentary from Dermalogica sampling, and am so glad I got the chance to try it! It is the right amount of surface exfoliation to leave my skin feeling smooth, without irritating my skin. I DO have cheeks that can be sometimes reactive, so I didn’t use it seven straight days, just every other day, and I felt a noticeable difference in the softness of my skin after each use! I am so glad to find this product- I will alternate with using chemical exfoliants, and I think that’s the perfect formula for me to have fresh, clear skin! Gentle but very effective!
