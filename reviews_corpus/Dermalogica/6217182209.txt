I love how this serum did brighten my under eye area while keeping it moisturized. I also enjoy the lightweight formula as it dries very quickly! I have also used it under makeup and it hasnâ€™t affected how my makeup looks or pilled. A little goes a LONG way so be careful not to squeeze too much. As far as de puffing goes, I found it to be minimal. Overall I really like this serum and would definitely recommend it nan
