I was able to try this sample gifted to me by Dermalogica, and I truly think it was amazing! The product worked to gently exfoliate my skin and leave it soft and feeling clean. I don’t feel like my skin was dried out and didn’t irritate sensitive skin. The only negative was that the powder gets everywhere if the water is strong so be careful when mixing I would definitely purchase again! Great Gentle Exfoliant
