Decent product for gentle exfoliation, however, the amount that I found I needed to use was more than I anticipated. For ’daily exfoliation’ use, it took a dime to nickel size amount of product just to feel like my skin was actually being exfoliated and not just ’washed.’ In the long run, I’d be going through a lot more product than I’d like to and that can get expensive. It’s good for a weekly face scrub, but I wouldn’t use it daily. Good to use, just not daily.
