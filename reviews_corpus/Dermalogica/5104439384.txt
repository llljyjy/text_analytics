I personally enjoy powder cleansers and this one is no exception. When mixed with water it turns into a lovely creamy lather that cleanses my face nicely. I personally use it around 2-3 times per week as a second step after my cleansing balm. Even though it has exfoliating properties, I still find it quite gentle and my face feels nice and soft after using this. This product was gifted by Dermalogica for an honest review. nan
