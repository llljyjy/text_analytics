Typically I use the Amorepacific Treatment Enzyme Peel and I LOVE that. However, I needed a smaller container for travel and decided to try this, since it seems like a similar product at a much lower price point. Unfortunately, this just doesnâ€™t match up to my beloved Amorepacific TEP. It is a very mild exfoliant so if you have super sensitive skin, you may like this. Just Okay
