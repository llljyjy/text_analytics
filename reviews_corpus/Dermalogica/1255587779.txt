While I love Dermilogica products, I developed two styes while using this product a few weeks apart. Also, after a month of use I noticed no difference in my eyes. The bags were still there, the lines just as pronounced. I’m stopping using it under my eyes because of the stye correlation. I may use it as a serum on my face because it was so expensive. It’s very watery and takes awhile to dry, too. And then your eyes look really shiny and kinda wet. Develop two styes while using this product
