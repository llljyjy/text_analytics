I haven’t really ever used Dermalogica but I have heard so many good things from friends and TikTok.  I have to say, I didn’t want to purchase the exfoliating scrub without first trying it.  So when Dermalogica gifted me these free samples I was very happy.  First off, I love the feel and freshness of the smell and it made my skin nice and gently exfoliated without being harsh and heavy on the skin.  I can see why people love it so much.  I have textured skin, acne-prone, oily to normal skin and lately I’ve been breaking out due to my own fault.  (Not spending the time to appropriately cleanse my face of makeup at night).  So my face was feeling very dirty, oily, clogged and dull.  This scrub felt like it gently washed all the dirt away and left  my pores feeling clean.  I then went and did a light scraping and it further helped get more gunk out.  But the daily exfoliant worked very well on it’s own.  My skin was already looking and feeling, brighter and happier.  I will continue to finish my samples and then I do plan on purchasing the full size.  Thank you! Adding this to my mature skincare regimen
