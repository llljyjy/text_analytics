Hello everyone I received a gifted  Dermalogica Sampling to review the  by Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant.. There were 8 disposable bags in the set. Inside is a white powder with clear scrubbing particles. When adding a few drops of water, it turns into a creamy mixture. I applied this to my face and massaged it for about a minute. A pleasant creamy mass is felt on the face. Easily washed off. The face after washing is smooth and silky. The skin is not tightened. A pleasant feeling of freshness and cleanliness. I am satisfied with the result. A good scrub
