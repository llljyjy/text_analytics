I was expecting it to be a liquid but to my surprise when I opened it, it was just powder. It was messy and the instructions weren’t very clear as to how to get it mixed but I did so in my hand. Once applied though I very much enjoyed the product! It didn’t have a strong smell and wasn’t too rough on my face as most exfoliators are. It made my skin feel very soft and clean as well as moisturized. Interesting product
