I received a few free sample packs complimentary from Dermalogica for my honest review. Iâ€™m not sure how it exfoliates since it seems to disappear as you mix it with water, but it did help my face look better only after using a few times. I had no irritation or adverse reactions.   I do like how Dermalogica uses rice in their formula. Works nice
