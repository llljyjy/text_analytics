I enjoyed being able to try this. I received samples complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling to test this for a week. It really does make my skin pop. I noticed my pores not only look cleaner- but smaller too. It was not harsh at all. It did not lather but stayed like a paste and cleaned my skin up nicely. nan
