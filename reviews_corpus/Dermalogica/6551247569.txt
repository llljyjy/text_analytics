i used this after I got sunburned. it’s a weird consistency because you mix it with water and it comes in a powder. I feel like it’s more of just a gentle cleanser for people that might have sensory issues with normal cleansers. I wouldn’t buy again because it’s expensive but I’ll probably use the whole thing. gifted by Dermalogica. nan
