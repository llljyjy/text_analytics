I was gifted by Dermalogica their Daily Microfoliant 7 Single Use Packets for review. I like how you only need a teaspoon of product. It’s formula of rice based powder makes it gentle on the skin. I still felt like I was exfoliating my skin without the scrappy feeling others give. I like how it turned into a paste when mixed with water. It made my skin softer and clearer some of my breakouts. My pores feel tighter and cleaner. I’d definitely recommend and buy this product. Most Gentle Exfoliater
