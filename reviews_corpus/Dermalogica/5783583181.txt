This product was gifted to me by Dermalogica, however my review is honest and based on my experience using the product. I just finished one of my favorite eye creams and this eye gel came in very handy. Love the texture of this eye gel - lightweight and goes into your skin right away. You can feel a nice cooling effect - tip - keep in in your fridge. A little bit goes a long way. This eye gel is very hydrating and depuffs like no other. I have been using it both at night time and love waking up with a more hydrated, firmer under eye area that is depuffed and radiant, as well as in the morning time without any problems, it does goes well with makeup. Yes, it’s a bit on the pricey side, but it’s worth it. Worth every penny
