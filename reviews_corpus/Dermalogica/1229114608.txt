This product was gifted by Dermalogica to test, honest opinions are my own.I love the Dermalogica line, full of tried and true effective products that address my needs as a 40+ year old with combo skin. The Awaken Peptide Depuffing Eye Gel is another stand out product I am happy to add to my routine. At $50+, yes I agree this is pricey but because it indeed awakens my eyes — I think it’s worth it! A little goes a long ways. I can instantly feel the gentle sensation of the caffeine, rosemary extract and peptides waking up and firming the skin around my eyes. The smallest squeeze of product provides enough coverage for under eye and around orbital bone. I love how this oil free eye gel sits wonderfully under my makeup. Makeup applies unbelievably well (hello eyeliner!) even when I don’t use primer. A definite winner from me! Eye Opener
