This sunscreen is amazing. My skin before the sunscreen was super dry and itchy and after using this my skin was moisturized, soft, and smooth. I did not need to use another moisturizer with this SPF. It did not cause me any extra oiliness and worked very well underneath my make up. It does have a light scent that reminds me of faint roses, but it is not over powering and I love the way it smells. I also get migraines and this smell did not cause me a migraine. This sunscreen did not cause me any irritation and even after washing it off my face felt so soft and smooth. The texture is creamy and silky and it sinks into the skin super fast. I highly recommend this sunscreen and I already have my mom using it. For reference, I have combination oily skin and this worked great for me. I also apply it to my neck and hands when I go outside. Holy Grail must have Spf!
