Dermalogica is a must have in my bathroom for my combination, acne prone skin! I was gifted by Dermalogica, a small supply of microfoliant to try, for my honest feedback. Little do they know, I have a stock supply of this beautiful exfoliating rice cleanser already! I use the glycolic wash and Microfoliant daily, in the shower works best for me. The microfoliant is such a gentle yet effective scrub. I was skeptical about using it daily or using a scrub in general, but it truly is gentle enough for daily use. It literally polishes my skin so that my serums and other products settle into my skin faster and easier than if I hadnâ€™t exfoliated that. It doubles as a lovely cleanser as it bubbles up into a foam but is NOT DRYING. My skin is noticeably shinier as it was actually polished! I use a retinol, so my skin cells are rapidly turning over and constantly needs a polish or a refresh each morning in the shower when my skin is supple. I will use this for as long as I can afford it! It is a pricey brand but they have impeccable products and are the opitome of gentle but effective acne products. The microfoliant lasts forrreverrrr a small amount of powder goes such a long way, I feel better about my purchase when it lasts me longer than a month!! gentle scrub with suds!
