Another fantastic product from Dermalogica! I have an extremely sensitive acne prone skin and most retinol products break me out. This retinol serum is mild enough to not cause any irritation or breakouts, my texture got smoother, and fine lines around my eyes got way less prominent. I use it every night after Dermalogica Daily Microexfoliant, my skin is perfectly clear and glowy. Iâ€™ve switched to this serum from Dr Dennis Gross retinol serum, so far these two products are the only retinol products my skin loves and tolerates.
