I’m always excited to try new products so I was excited to try this one. (Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling.)This product has decent ingredients, the only one I’m not particularly fond of is that it contains Limonene which is a fragrance (this could be an allergen to some.) I do like that it contains papain which is a papaya enzymes (they’re great for you in many ways!)Honest review of it - it feels a bit harsh for face exfoliation. Using harsh exfoliation on your face can create micro-tears. But it could just be me! I like very gentle exfoliation for my face because I have sensitive skin. If you do feel like you need a harsher exfoliating product, this would be great - however I wouldn’t recommend it for daily use as dermatologists recommend exfoliating your face only a few times a week. Careful if you have sensitive skin!
