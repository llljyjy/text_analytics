love this daily microfoliant! Since day one my skin was feeling so soft!! This microfoliant is really gentle on the skin. Smells like vitamin C when you apply it. Iâ€™m not a fan of the consistency, it comes as powder and you have to mix it with water to form a paste, I feel that waste product. But I would really recommend it because of the results.
