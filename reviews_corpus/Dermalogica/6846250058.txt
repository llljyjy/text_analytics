This was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling and I’m very impressed by this product. I’m used to using very harsh and rough sugar scrubs but this stuff is the opposite. It’s very gentle and has a soft exfoliating feel. It’s not rough at all and leaves my face feeling soft and clean. I would recommend this to my friends. Gentle and Soft
