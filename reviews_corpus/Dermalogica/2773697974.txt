This was gifted by Dermalogica, and I wasn’t expecting to love this since I was worried it would be a sort of harsh physical exfoliant, but dang was i wrong! This powder just melts in your hands into the softest, creamiest lather and I love it! It leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth but not stripped or dry. I’m excited to continue using! This is the softest and most gentle exfoliant, and of all of the daily exfoliants i have tried, this is the only one I think would actually be gentle enough for everyday use. Soft and creamy lather
