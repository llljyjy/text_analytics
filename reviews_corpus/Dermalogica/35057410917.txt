I received a complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling for review, and besides the initial mess at first with the powder and water mixing, this daily microfoliant is a dream for people like me with a lot of dead skin. My breakouts are significantly less, and my skin is glowing and vibrant. The ingredients are top tier for skin that needs a little extra help getting into clogged pores. Iâ€™m in love! 10/10!! Definitely recommended by me. Worth every penny!
