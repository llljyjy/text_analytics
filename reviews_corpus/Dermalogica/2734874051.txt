I have very oily skin even in the winter. I have always put off sunscreen for this reason. I walk a lot in the winter and know I need to protect my skin. I am so happy to say this sun screen doesn’t make my face feel oily. Doesn’t clog my pores which is another big concern and it doesn’t leave a white cast. If you suffer from acne or oily skin or both this is the one. Great for oily skin
