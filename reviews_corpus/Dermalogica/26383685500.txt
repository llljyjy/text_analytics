This was gifted to me by Dermalogica sampling. I really enjoy this product. it actually IS gentle enough for daily use. I have quite dry skin and did have some dry patches when I started using this product. They were gone in the second night of use. It leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and supple. It creates a nice foamy texture that feels smooth on the face. I have been using it all week and I love that Iâ€™ve found an exfoliant that I can use without having to discontinue other actives like retinol. Wonderful!
