I loved this exfoliant it was gentle and easy to use but still effective. Helped with uneven texture and I loved the oat smell. Not too harsh but also just right! I have combination skin and I felt like it did a really great job of getting rid of dull skin. Gifted by dermatologica Good gentle exfoliant
