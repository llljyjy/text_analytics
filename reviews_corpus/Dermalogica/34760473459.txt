I used it twice a week fully on my face and then sometimes I would do a third time but use it only on key concern areas (nose and forehead). Side note I am an esthetician and I would definitely recommend this to my clients.  I do think the way the product was made to pour out was a perfect idea. It makes it easy to use without having to worry about cross contamination or making a mess! On a scale of 1-10 on how smooth my face seemed after using the product, I would say a 9 ( 10 being super smooth.) Thank you Dermalogica, complimentary from Dermalogica Esthetician Approved
