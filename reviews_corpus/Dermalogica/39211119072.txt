This was gifted to me by Dermalogica Sampling. I was really surprised at this exfoliant! I’m not a fan of the texture of most of them but this allowed me to adjust how much water I added which made it easier for me to apply.  The amount of acne I had diminished in the week and I’ve noticed my face is looking a lot brighter! nan
