Amazing product, when i was breaking out bad last year i tried the mini size and saw so much improvement on my skinâ€¦ i got a second mini bottle and continued to use it and my skin finally got okay. Now my skin is bad again and i got the full size because i know it works like a charm for acne but i find it can be a little drying on the skin sometimes especially if used in conjunction with other exfoliating products. other than that amazing product Really good but can be a drying
