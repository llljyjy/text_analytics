I have used other exfoliates before and I think this one is definitely a gentler version. I do enjoy it for more constant use better than others and I did notice improvement in my skin by just washing my face with an gentle cleanser and following with this exfoliant and then moisturizer so definitely thrilled that I got this gifted by Dermalogica! Gentle exfoliant!
