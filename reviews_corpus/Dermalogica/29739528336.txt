I’ve used this for over a week already and I love it! It gently exfoliates my face and is really easy to use. It’s not harsh on my skin at all and it leaves it feeling SUPER smooth and fresh! I pair it with the dermalogica daily gently face cleanser and it works like a charm. Gifted by dermalogica nan
