was gifted to me Dermalogica but my opinions are my own - if you don’t have a retinal in your skin care routine regardless of your age you are missing out! This is some thing that everybody should have in there skin care regiment. Well I do not struggle with any major wrinkles I do have some fine lines and texture, I use retinol regularly at night and while it is more preventative right now I do think it works well! This is a high dose wrinkle serum with a 3.5% retinoid complex plus squalene. This feels like a pretty hi does a retinal for an over-the-counter product which is great! Dermalogica always puts out such amazing high grade skin care products. If you’re looking for a brand that’s really going to work I would highly recommend this! Amazing retinol
