This is such a unique exfoliant. I love the ingredients which are gently and great for my sensitive skin. The packaging is easy to use with a tiny pour hole. The directions were easy to follow as well. It doesn’t have a  fragrance except for a very light like coconut milk type of scent.  After use, my skin feel very smooth and soft and hydrated. I’ll definitely be incorporating this into my weekly routine! *gifted by Dermalogica So gentle and softening
