This glycolic cleanser is amazing. My skin feel so refreshed so clean and some moisturized after using it I was absolutely blown away. The texture is a thick texture that goes into a great sudsy cleanser cleanser all the dirt and grime from the day I feel like I even don’t have to double cleanse when I’m using this because my face feels so clean and refreshed. I don’t want to lose this feeling so this may be a winner for me because I only have to cleanse once. I have to say I’ve always loved cleansers I came from Dermalogica but this one is my very favorite thus far This may be my favorite cleanser
