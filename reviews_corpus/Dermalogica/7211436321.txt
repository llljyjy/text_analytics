Love this product for exfoliation! I used to use a more abrasive exfoliant and even tried an exfoliating glove but learned that the micro abrasions were causing more harm than good. This product gently exfoliates and leaves my skin feeling soft and looking glowy. I am not a huge fan of the smell but the product is so good that I’ll happily buy it again. A little goes a long way so it’s really cost effective! Gifted by dermalogica A must buy!
