I have extremely sensitive skin and in winter I easily get dermatitis flare ups so I dont use any acne fighting ingredients at all during that time and I cant even use most cleansers. My skin gets reallllly dull and my fine lines are accentuated because of that. This was the first treatment Ive used that my skin handled and didnt get irritated at all. It immediately brightened and evened out my skin tone and plumped up some fine lines. The scent isnt great, but most vitamin treatments have this citric acid smell so its not too bad considering you only use it for a short mask. I look forward to trying it on my hands and decolletage.
