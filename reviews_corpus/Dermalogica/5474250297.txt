In my opinion, I believe there are much better products similar to this one. However, it was refreshing and I did enjoy using it. I wouldn’t really recommend, though. I would much prefer something similar to this but from a different company. There was nothing bad about this at all, don’t get me wrong. I just feel like there’s much better ones out there that get the job done. This product was gifted by Dermalogica for sampling purposes. nan
