This is hands-down one of my favourite skincare products I’ve ever used. I tend to have very dry/dehydrated skin, so I’ve used pure hyaluronic acid for a long time. Circular Hydration Serum just hits *different*. My skin retains “bounce“/hydration for much longer than I’ve ever seen - and this is in Canadian winter. 10/10 would recommend. #giftedbydermalogica Most hydrating serum I've ever used
