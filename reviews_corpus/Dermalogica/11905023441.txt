This was my first cleanser from Dermalogica. I really like that it has Glycolic Acid and is still gentle on the skin. I havenâ€™t noticed any brightening effect with it yet, but it leaves my skin smooth and ready for serums. My combo skin fiance, oily skin son, and I am use it now. When looking for an active cleanser I definitely recommend this product. Worth It!
