I was able to get this product complimentary from Dermalogica sampling in exchange for an honest review. I have dry/combination skin that can easily give off such a dull look/feel and after only a few days of using this product, my skin is already visibly brighter and just all around better looking. I normally wouldnâ€™t spend this much $ on a product without trying it but after trying it, I will most likely purchase it! Definitely recommend to anyone who just needs that extra little boost to their dull looking/feeling skin! Def recommend
