This product was complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for my honest review...I have tried a few powder enzyme cleaners in the past, they were way to harsh on my sensitive skin! Dermalogica’s is fantastic...sensitive skin approved. It takes a bit of trial and error the first time, to add the perfect amount of water. I found using a dropper to be quite effective. After a week’s usage, my skin feels softer, smoother and my rough patches gone. Sensitive Skin Approved!
