Very nice hyaluronic acid serum. It’s very lightweight but I can tell it’s hydrating my skin. My skin has been really dry and irritated and it feels like a drink of water for my skin. I’ve been applying this in the morning after my vitamin c serum and before my SPF and it wears really well under makeup. Definitely recommend if you’re looking for a hydrating serum.
