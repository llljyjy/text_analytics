I’ve always loved dermalogica products and this one doesn’t disappoint. Since using this product I’ve seen a huge difference in my skin. My pores look smaller and my skin texture is alot more even.  Now that I’m getting older I’m starting to develop fine lines and since using this serum they have started to disappear. This serum layers well with my other skin care products defiantly worth the splurge  (Gifted by dermalogica) Worth the splurge
