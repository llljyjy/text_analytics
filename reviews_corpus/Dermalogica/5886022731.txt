This was gifted by Dermalogica for review. I deal with a lot of puffiness around my eyes in the morning and was so excited to try this out. I do notice that this significantly reduces my puffy eyes and makes me look more awake. My skin also feels hydrated and firm when using. I am really excited to see the long term firming results with this! This is a thin gel consistency and skinks in quickly so I can just go in with my makeup and other skincare for the day. No pilling either which is a win! nan
