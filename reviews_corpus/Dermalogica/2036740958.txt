I tried out this serum during one of the worst skin episodes I’ve had in my mid twenties and it worked wonders at restoring my skin and texture. After just a few weeks of 2x daily usage, my skin calmed down and felt balanced and restored again. Dry spots went away and it’s looking and feeling radiant as ever. *gifted by Dermalogica nan
