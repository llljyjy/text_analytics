This is my second go around using this SPF. First of all, it’s really nice to be able to use a sunscreen to protect, as well as hydrate! Combining products is always a vibe. Love that. It is also more than a moisturizer and sunscreen, because it has some really great firming ingredients, antioxidants and peptides to help improve my skin (hello AGE Smart!) AND it works well as a base / primer before applying makeup.  Would I spend a lot on a plain old sunscreen? Probably not. Would I invest in a multi-purpose skincare product that also provides adequate SPF? Absolutely. I have had really good results from this brand, so it’s no surprise this SPF is so well liked. I also feel like it makes my skin instantly appear more revived. A bit glowy without a white cast.  Definitely a beautiful, amped up, more than just SPF kind of SPF. Pretty unique. The scent is very light + mild (hardly noticeable) and the factor is 50, so that’s ideal. Amazing Age Smart Hydrating SPF
