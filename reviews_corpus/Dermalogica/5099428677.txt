I really love the scent of this product! Probably one of my favorite scents in my whole moisturizer collection. When putting this on my fresh skin, I love how smooth it is and how it is very lightweight on me. Does not have a white cast compared to other moisturizers. Felt my skin was protected and more brightened! Love the scent and lightweight!
