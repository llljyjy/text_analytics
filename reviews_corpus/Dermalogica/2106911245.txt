After using this product on what was my at the time horrible skin, I’ve decided to implement this on my 6-step skincare routine . 1. Cleansing 2. Toning 3. Exfoliating (1-2x week) 4. Serum 5. Moisturizer and lastly 6. SPF . Just by being consistent and utilizing this apart of my 6-step, I’ve noticed fewer to no breakouts, pores began to close and a brighter complex . My scars are really bad on my face from the harm done from previous generic brands but Dermalogica has helped redeem a better facial complexion and ultimately saving my skin from permanent scarring. Definitely would recommend this to anyone needing help with their acne ! Holy grail to skincare
