I bought this because I knew I was not exfoliating enough and wanted to give this one a try and to be honest I’m not impressed by this as I am about other products I have very recently tried. I don’t think it does the job the way I want it too and that’s just disappointing. I feel like with this small bottle I need to use 1/3 of it just to get some exfoliating done when the recommended amount is way less than what I’ve been using. Plus I just was not blown away by this. I could see someone with super sensitive skin liking this but it’s just not for me! Not for me
