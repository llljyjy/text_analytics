I’ve always been very skeptical about eye creams that claim to reduce puffiness but this one has been a pleasant surprise. The tube is pretty small but you only need so little. The gel is very lightweight and gets absorbed quickly. It has a very nice cooling sensation. My eyelids are puffy in the morning sometimes, some days more than others, but this get definitely decreases puffiness within 20 mins or so. It works better than any other depuffing gel I’ve ever used. It also keeps my skin around the eyes hydrated and firm. actually works
