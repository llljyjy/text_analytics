I was gifted by Dermalogica with sample packets of Daily Microfoliant Exfoliator in exchange for my honest review. This came in a powder form. It claims to give you smooth skin through the help of papaya enzymes and salicylic acid, while brigthening it through phytic acid from rice bran. Yes, this is rice based powder exfoliant. Hence, why I trust it would work as I love rice products. This is very easy to use. Just add a little bit of water to the powder, and lather to form a foamy frothy paste. Then apply in circular motion and rinse off. You can feel the microbeads and it’s very relaxing on skin. My skin felt so clean and smooth after using this. I didn’t notice any brightening yet, but probably through continuous usage. No breakouts for me too. Makes skin smooth
