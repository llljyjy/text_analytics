This cleansing oil is pretty mediocre. I have enjoyed Dermalogica products in the past, and this oil cleanser did a good job of removing make up and sunscreen but I don’t feel like I was getting much else out of it. I will say it lasted me about four months, with use once daily in the evenings. I think it’s an ok product, however way over priced for what it does and how much product you get, which is why I only gave it two stars. Definitely unlikely to re-purchase. nan
