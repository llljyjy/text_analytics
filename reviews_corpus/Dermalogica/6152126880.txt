My skin gets easily congested when I work out a lot and have found this exfoliator to be a life saver!! I like to use this 2-3 days a week to remove excess sebum and dirt that a cleanser doesn’t do. I have pretty sensitive skin and this is gentle and doesn’t bother my skin like other exfoliators I’ve tried. A staple for me!
