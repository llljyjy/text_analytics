The first couple of days using  daily microfoliant gifted by dermalogica sampling, I wasnâ€™t that sure about this product because it left my skin a little bit on the drier side. After the fifth day and noticed the big difference! I was happily surprised that my skin felt softer, had a glow and it was much clear. The acne was completely gone and my skin looked radiant. The texture of the product reminded me like the tatcha exfoliator but this one helped cleared with my acne. I am very happy and will definitely repurchase it. Multitasking exfoliator
