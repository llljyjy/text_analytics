My skin was extra dry from this summer and my makeup was looking patchy. The dermalogica daily microfoliant was perfect and just what my skin needed. This rice based powder exfoliant helped all my dry areas by making my skin feel so soft and smooth. My skin feels refreshed and brighter after using this product for 7 days. It gently exfoliated my face and my makeup looks great on my skin. I would recommend to anyone who wants smooth and brighter skin after this summer heat and sun. You won’t be dissatisfied.  “Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling.” nan
