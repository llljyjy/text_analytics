It is very smooth and gentle. I use it at night time and this is honestly my favorite retinol product I’ve used. It’s so soft on the skin, minimize the appearance of pores, and tone. It says it’s good for wrinkles so I can’t wait to try this more to see my results. The serum delivers the best benefits of a retinol while maintaining the health of the skin barrier.
