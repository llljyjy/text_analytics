I absolutely love this exfoliant! It leaves my skin so incredibly smooth, but it isn’t harsh at all. I like that it’s a powder because it’s easy to control how much product I use. It’s really simple, because you just add a little water to the powder and it’s ready to go. It’s also easier to take when traveling because it’s a powder, not a liquid, so I don’t have to worry about TSA regulations on my flights. I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica. leaves skin so smooth!
