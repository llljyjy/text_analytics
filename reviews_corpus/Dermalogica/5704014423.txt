I was gifted by Dermalogica. I love using my Daily Microfoliant, so I wanted to give this a try. I would have to say that this is as good as the original at exfoliating while it is more gentle on the skin. It makes my skin very soft immediately after one use. I highly recommend this product if you have dry sensitive skin. nan
