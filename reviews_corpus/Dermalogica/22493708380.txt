This product was gifted by Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review. Honestly I think this is a pass for me. If you really want a physical exfoliant then this is a good choice because i’s gentler than most scrubs, but it’s messy to incorporate into a routine and just adds another type of step that takes a lot of time. I prefer a chemical exfoliant. Ok but prefer different exfoliant format
