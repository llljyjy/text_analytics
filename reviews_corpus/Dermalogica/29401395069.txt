Gifted by Dermalogica. I’ve been loving Dermalogica’s Biolumin C serum! It has a light texture and fragrance that are both pleasant, as well as being formulated without artificial fragrances or colors. The product includes chia seed oil which helps prevent loss of firmness due to aging; a Vitamin C complex for brighter looking skin plus the exfoliating benefits of Lactic Acid AHA ingredient found in most potent serums on the market today. All of these ingredients work together beautifully so your face feels nourished while still having its natural beauty preserved. Would recommend! Amazing product!
