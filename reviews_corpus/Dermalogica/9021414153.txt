After using this for 2 weeks my skin has completely broken out. Mostly around my jaw line and cheeks. I tried to be patient but it is only getting worse and my skin looks awful. I gave it two stars because I loved how soft my skin felt after using it, just definitely not meant for me or my skin. A good try but not for me.
