I was very skeptical but wow, I love this product! Complimentary from Dermalogica sampling, Daily microfoliant, starts out as a white powder. Add a little water and it starts to turn to a paste, apply to wet skin and add a little more water, it turns into a very nice lather and gentle scrub. After, my skin felt so fresh, clean and smooth. After a couple days my skin started clearing up and looking better.  I highly suggest trying this wash. Iâ€™m going to have to save up and buy it. This is a must have
