Dermalogica gifted me this Daily Microfoliant Exfoliator that smooths and brightens skin in 7 days. This gentle exfoliating powder is a rice-based cleanser and exfoliator. Key ingredients:1. Papain Enzymes and Salicylic Acid - draws out excess oil, clears clogged pores, and smooths the skin2. Rice Bran-Derived Phytic Acid - gently exfoliates to visibly brighten and balance uneven skin tone3. Colloidal Oatmeal - calms skin which reduces the appearance of redness and irritationAfter cleansing, I dispensed about a half-teaspoon of Daily Microfoliant into my hands that were very wet as directed. Rubbing it in my hands created a creamy paste. Then I massaged it into my skin in circular motions for about a minute making sure to avoid my eye area. The last step was to rinse with warm water. My face started to feel smoother and look brighter after the first day. After the 7 days, my face was brighter and smoother than I have ever seen it. My pores were much clearer as well. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone even those with sensitive skin since it is very gentle. Thank you Dermalogica for these samples! A very effective and gentle exfoliant
