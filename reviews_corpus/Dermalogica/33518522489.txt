This is the best thing in my skincare routine!! I use this every morning and it causes no irritation to my sensitive skin. I cannot handle chemical exfoliates but this is perfect! My skin is glowing after a few weeks of use and I have gotten rid of almost all of my breakouts and blackheads. Since it gently exfoliates the dead skin away, my makeup goes on so smooth. I even think it is helping some with my acne scars and pigmentation. I started with the mini which lasted a month. I just bought the full size and I bet it lasts a year! Lasts forever, worth the money
