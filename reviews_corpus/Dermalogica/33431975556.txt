I’m a big fan of Dermalogica! This eye gel is very cooling and does a good job depuffing my eyes in the morning. I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica.However, I cannot layer it under my makeup because it emphasizes my lines. What I do instead is to apply it at night and again first thing in the morning while I have my coffee. I wait for the gel to get absorbed so I get the benefits, and then I remove it and follow with Dermalogica’s Multivitamin Power Firm nan
