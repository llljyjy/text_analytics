This is a very interesting mask to say the least. Provides some moisture to my skin and can be used once a week. My issue is the scent as it isnâ€™t the best smell. Leaves my face looking much better nonetheless. Creamy tan consistency, goes on and washes off easily. Other than the scent, I recommend! Gifted by Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review. Off Smell, Otherwise Nice
