This 7 day microfoliant was gifted to me by Dermalogica Sampling and made my skin extremely soft after just 1 use. The small powder filled packets are easy to use and to take traveling etc. Applying with just a little water is so simple and the only thing off for me was that it has a bit of a citrusy and vitamin smell. I will continue to use and update in 6 days.  ...But so far overall it will definitely help soften and smooth your skin since it helped mine after 1 use. I do recommend trying it out! Thanks again Dermalogica! It works try it out
