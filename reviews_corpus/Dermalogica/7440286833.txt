I love this!! It has a slight smell to it but i like it. This product is super light weight, makes my skin feel very soft, and does not have any white cast. It’s also super moisturizing. I don’t use my moisturizer when I use this product. My routine goes: cleanse —> serum —> this sunscreen. love it!!
