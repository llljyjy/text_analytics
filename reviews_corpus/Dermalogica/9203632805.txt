I love Dermalogica products, have been using their cleansing oil, micro-exfoliant, intensive moisture balance cream and the acne clearing serum for a while. My skin is acne-prone and oily with enlarged pores and red acne scars which is experiencing dryness at the same time with oiliness, and not every product works well on me. I bought this clearing oil from Dermalogica just because I was curious, and was not disappointed. Though it made my skin purging within the first 7-8 days, I got all my face covered with acne, but I didn’t stop using it and saw dramatic changes on the second week of using. My skin got glowy, smoother, with less breakouts, pores and scars are less pronounced, and even my regular foundation now looks like I used a blurring primer under it. My friends told me the same, so I’m very happy with my purchase and will definitely buy again! Game changer!
