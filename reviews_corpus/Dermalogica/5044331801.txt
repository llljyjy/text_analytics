This is such an interesting product! I’ve never tried anything like it. The package is a bottle with a small hole at the top which releases a powder into your hands - luckily I didn’t find it messy at all, it’s just the right amount. It feels basically like flour with a slightly sweet scent when applied to the face. After some massaging with wet hands, it creates a light creamy lather and feels gentle on the skin, probably the most gentle abrasiveness I’ve ever had with an exfoliant and a very clean, slightly smoother feeling of my skin when rinsed off. I’m still working on the exact right amount of product/water mix to get the optimal lather but so far I’m liking how this feels gentle enough to use daily with other actives and will also be travel friendly!
