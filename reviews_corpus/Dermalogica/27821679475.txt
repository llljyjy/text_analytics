The serum is a colourless light weight liquid, looks almost like water except it is slightly more viscous. This has been both in my AMroutine as well as PMRoutine for more than 2 weeks. It gets easily absorbed into the skin, it is non greasy and definitely leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated.#giftedbydermalogica Skin feels and looks so supple and hydrated
