I’ve tried numerous versions of this products from different brands and they’ve all been what I’d call “blah” okay but nothing special. This one took me by surprise. IPour a quarter sized amount onto my hands, wet, and use circular motions on my face to really work it in. It makes my skin feel so soft and healthy. I have extremely sensitive, acne prone, oily skin and this doesn’t irritate at all! Great for Sensitive Skin & Eyes
