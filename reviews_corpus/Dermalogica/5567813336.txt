Highly recommend dynamic skin recovery. I was looking for a moisturizer with spf. I purchased the smaller size so I can try it over a few weeks. On my first application, I thought it felt very thick in my hand before I applied it to my face. It spread very nicely and my skin felt very moisturized. I have very sensitive skin and have not had any breakouts with this product. Perfect moisturizer with spf
