One of my favorite face cleansers!! I love that this starts out as powder and becomes a “cream” once water is added. It is gentle but still exfoliating and leaves my skin/pores feeling clean but not stripped of its natural oils and dry. Also a great product to travel with since it isn’t a liquid which is just an added bonus! nan
