I got to try seven single use Daily Microfoliant facial cleanser, complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling for my authentic assessment. I ordered this product, knowing my face usually doesn’t handle any type of active exfoliating very well. I’ve never been let down by any Dermalogica products in the past! The day I got the product, I woke up with this giant acne spot on. I couldn’t wait to see what it could do against this giant painful red bump that looks like it has two heads. I’m doing this review on day four and as you can see, it’s almost invisible under makeup now! Another win for Dermalogica. Proof is in the pictures
