Ok I got the mini bcuz the price on the full size is yiiiikes and oh my god ITS SO GOOD. My skin is extremely sensitive. I’m combo/acne prone and this didn’t bother me at ALL but my face was the cleanest it’s looked in MONTHS after! I was like no freaking way. Blackheads around my nose and chin that I couldn’t get rid of were gone. Like dude.. try the mini!! I’ll see how long it lasts (to see if the full size is justifiable) but good molecules makes a $16 one I believe! LOVE
