This microfoliant has left my face feeling super smooth without being too harsh. I really enjoy mixing it myself and the whole self care aspect of that. the smell is a little odd. Almost like mixing a protein shake, but it’s not so weird or strong that it’s offensive. Definitely recommend! I tried this complimentary from Dermalogica sampling Super gentle but effective
