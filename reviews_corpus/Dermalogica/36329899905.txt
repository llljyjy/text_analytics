This was gifted by Dermalogica and is by far one of my favorite exfoliants I’ve tried. It’s gentle on my skin but gets the job done. It is easy to rinse off and leaves my skin looking brighter and smoother. I’ve been using it for a couple weeks and have already recommended it to others! I will definitely be keeping this as part of my regular skin care routine! THIS IS SO GOOD!
