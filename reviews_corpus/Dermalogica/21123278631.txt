The Dermalogica Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF50 sunscreen hits all the marks for me. I get great sun protection, the formula is not heavy on my skin, the texture is very pleasant, and the scent is subtle and barely noticeable which I love for my face. Itâ€™s also easy to reapply throughout the day. The ingrident list is also very impressive. My skin responds really well to it. Sunscreen that doesn't quit
