So far I’m very impressed with this retinol! My skin didn’t aggressively purge like I thought it would since I’ve never used a retinol before which is great! It doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry either. I will need to continue using this product for a full review but so far I’m really enjoying adding this into my routine! This product was gifted by Dermologica - Sephora. It’s a yes from me!
