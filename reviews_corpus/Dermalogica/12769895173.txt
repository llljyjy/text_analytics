I was gifted by dermalogica  a complementary sample from of their micro exfoliant and these are my thoughts: I’m not a huge fan of physical exfoliants but this one is nice, not harsh at all. I enjoyed using it and it didn’t leave my face feeling stripped or over clean so I think if works well with my dry sensitive skin. Nice
