Was not expecting the color or consistency to be like this. The color is an orange creamsicle color, but it doesn’t make my eye area look orange at all. The cream is on the thicker side, but it feels more moisturizing than other products I’ve used. There’s also no scent, so that’s a plus. Overall, it works pretty nicely, but I can’t say I’ve noticed a huge difference. nan
