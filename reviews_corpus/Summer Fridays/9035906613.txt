I got the Brown Sugar one in a set with the four different colours and this one is my favourite because of the smell!! It smells soo good. I find it smells more like toffee but smells delicious regardless. It has a nice light glossy finish and is moisturizing without feeling sticky. Itâ€™s also a lovely sheer wash of brown perfect for a minimal fall look. Smells delicious
