I am sad to say that I did not love this as much as I thought I would. I am one of the unlucky ones who seem to break out from this product. The smell doesnâ€™t bother me or anything, just how it seems to impact my skin. :( I will likely go back to Herbivoreâ€™s blue tansy oil as that one is honestly one of my favorites. Sorry SF, I wanted to love you! ðŸ˜© Halfway through bottle, wanted to love it
