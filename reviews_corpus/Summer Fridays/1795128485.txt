This has to be one of my favorite Summer Fridays lip balms. Itâ€™s so balmy/creamy and nourishes my dry lips. The scent is wonderful and the tube tip makes application so easy  The formula is non sticky, it just glides over your lips. It wears well on its own or over your favorite lipsticks. I highly recommend this lip balm! Great everyday lip balm
