I have it ALL from fancy to the most simple drugstore. I have my routine down, but there are still times the dryness gets the better of me. I get dehydrated and flaky skin; it’s really tricky to get it back to normal without further irritation. This did just that, and quickly. It feels so good, and lingers on the skin for a bit in a refreshing way. I’m slightly confused about proper layering as I usually do thin to thick…but I suppose that isn’t such an issue using this as w treatment. It’s a game changer!
