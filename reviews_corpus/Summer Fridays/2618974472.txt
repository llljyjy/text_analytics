I was excited to try this product when it first came out but wasn’t overly impressed with it. If you like gel creams I would definitely give it a try. Personally, I didn’t care for the consistency. I tend to have dry skin primarily along my forehead and I didn’t feel like this product left my skin as moisturized as I had hoped. Not a fan of the consistency
