this mask is actually super thick so I wouldn’t wear it out. I really like the end result though it leaves your skin glowing and refreshed and just rested. It doesn’t do something specific like reduce acne or reduce wrinkles it just leaves you looking more alive. I use this after my finals after I hadn’t slept for a long time and it worked really well I looked really rested even though I wasn’t rested at all !! :p Rested
