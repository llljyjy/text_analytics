At first glance I was quite wary of this lip butter because lip butters tend to be sticky, however this one is absolutely not. It’s exactly soft and buttery and incredible hydrating! I’m a fan of scent in lip products and the vanilla scent is so subtle and not artificially overwhelming. I highly recommend. Subtle and Moisturizing
