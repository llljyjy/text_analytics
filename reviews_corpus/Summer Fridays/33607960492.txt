I’m in love! It feels like smooth glossy butter, so hydrating, lasts longer than any of my other lip balms and the applicator is amazing, curves right to your lips which makes it easier to apply without a mirror. I love the tint and it smells amazing! I got it to use mainly with a lip liner on occasion so I didn’t think I’d need the clear one, but after using it a few times it has become my everyday staple, I take it everywhere! Definitely going to get the clear one now & try the other shades as well. I get the hype now. It’s beautiful on the lips, especially combined with a lip liner and/or on top of lipstick. It goes on glossy and as you wear it they become more buttery-like but not sticky & my lips are hydrated the whole time, which is a must right now with the cold weather. I’m picky with my lip balms, some of them peel and others are too sticky or don’t last long at all.. this one is perfect in my opinion & worth the money. New Holy Grail!
