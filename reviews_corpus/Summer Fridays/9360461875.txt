Absolutely loved this eye cream! Iâ€™ve had a bad experience with eye creams in the past burning or irritating my eyes but this one was super comfortable and did not sting at all. The scent is super natural and light and it sinks into my skin almost immediately after applying! I also love how it sits under my makeup. Definitely would recommend! BOMBBB!!!
