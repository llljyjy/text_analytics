I really enjoyed this product. I have hormonal acne and my face is constantly trying to overcome its next breakout. I felt that this mask really did relax my skin. The gentle exfoliation helped rub away the dead skin, and then you let the oils settle into your skin after giving it a refreshed and replenished moisturizing feeling. I rarely use a full tube/container of any particular face mask, but I used all of this and will be purchasing again. I also love the jet lag mask, which is was introduced me to Summer Fridays and this mask. nan
