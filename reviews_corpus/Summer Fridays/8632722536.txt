I was gifted by Summer Fridays but I will be providing my honest review.This lip balm feels so lux. I love how it feels on my lips. It makes my lips feel so hydrated and moisturized. I’m obsessed with the vanilla scent.I love that the scent isn’t overwhelming.It’s clear in the tube and also applies clear. I’m so glad to find a lip balm that works for my dehydrated lips. You need this!!!
