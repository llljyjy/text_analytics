Thus serum was gifted by Summer Fridays for my review. This is my first time trying this brand and I’m impressed with this serum. My skin has been really dry this winter and this is the antidote! Absorbs nicely, leaves my skin hydrated and soft. I love that it isn’t fragranced! It works well for preparing your skin before makeup, too. Great ingredients, and now I want to try more from this brand! Loving it!
