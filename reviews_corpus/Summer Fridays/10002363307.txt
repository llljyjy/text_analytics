The serum is very lightweight and not greasy or sticky at all. I have combo skin/normal skin, and I wear this both AM and PM after my toner and before my moisturizer. I’ve been spending time in Canada this winter so this isn’t enough on its own. However, excited to try this in the spring/summer months. Bonus: the packaging is nice! nan
