This is my first Summer Fridays product. I have been using it at night under my serum as instructed (I’m sure you can use it in the morning, but it just fits perfectly there for me). I have not noticed a big difference since using. My skin does have soaks it up once I apply it to my skin. However, the hydration doesn’t last as long as you would think. It doesn’t add or take away from anything. Just an added step to my nighttime routine. It also has a smell to it that kind of resembles glue, in my opinion. Added Step to Nighttime Routine
