Gifted by Summer Fridays for my honest review, first off the packaging is beautiful. It is lightweight, easily absorbed by the skin. It works great for my skin type, i have oily dry combination skin but it feels extra dry during the winter. It has a light scent which I like. Overall great product to try! nan
