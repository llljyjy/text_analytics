I have really enjoyed using this lip balm. I have really dry lips and they did a good job keeping them moisturised even in the winter. The only con is the price, there probably are cheaper products that do the exact same thing the balm does if you search around but if i don’t find such a product after finishing this lip balm i’d probably buy it again. Very moisturising
