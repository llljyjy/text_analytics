Gifted by Summer Fridays.  I actually got this at a perfect time, my lips were lightly cracked and dry and needed moisture.  I like that this lip butter is in a tube and the applicator has a curve to it, not just angled.  The curvy applicator glides easily along the lips.  This is lightly scented and does smell like vanilla.  After one day of using this lip butter, I could see and feel the improvements to my lips.  They didn’t feel so chapped and felt moisturized.  My lips were all better, no more dry or chapped lips within three days!  I use it on a daily basis and it does stay on my lips for several hours.  After having the lip butter on my lips for several hours, with my finger I just rub all around my lips removing the excess and apply a fresh layer to my lips.  Perfect for these winter months.  The consistency is also good, it’s not overly thick. My lips are better!
