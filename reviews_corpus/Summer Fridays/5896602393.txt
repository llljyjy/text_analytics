While I believe this did lighten the area under my eyes, it must have spread to my eye area, as I felt like I had something under my contacts several hours later.  Also, after several hours, I could rub my under eye area and it appeared to peel off and left residue.  Love Summer Fridays lip balm, so I was anxious to try this, but I returned.  Thank you to Sephora for your return policy! Disappointed but glad it works well for so many!
