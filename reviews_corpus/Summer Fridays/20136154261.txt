The Summer Fridays deep hydration serum is lightweight and has a silky texture. It dries down fairly quick and is initially a little tacky. After a few minutes it dries to a natural finish. I apply this on damp skin and I’m enjoying it so far. My skin feels hydrated and it’s a great way to prep your skin for makeup! Packaging is beautiful and I love the pump because you can control how much you want to apply! nan
