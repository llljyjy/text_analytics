This eye cream I have heard so much about from my friends and after reading reviews, I wasnâ€™t aware that on the side you could see who was sent this or got it for free... I dont know if it was there opinion swayed but this didnt work for me. My eye has dark circles and is very dry.  I gave two stars because of its price point and ingredients but it didnt sit well under my makeup nor did it preform.  It is my second week using this and I have yet to see results. I think this is great for a teenager starting skincare or maybe its just not for someone with my eye concerns! paid reviews, let down, not for anyone over 30
