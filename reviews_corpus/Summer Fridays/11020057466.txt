The color of this eye cream surprised me, as it reminds me of an orange creamsicle! It doesnâ€™t have any scent which is great as fragranced face products can sometimes irritate my skin. The consistency is thick and it applies on very smoothly. I tap it under my eyes and it feels very hydrating and refreshing. nan
