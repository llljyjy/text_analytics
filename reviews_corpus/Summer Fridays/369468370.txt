I wanted a sleep mask, and this one pilled up when I didn’t wash it off. I prefer YTTP dream sleep mask instead, and it’s better value. I was bummed - I wanted to love this cause the tube is convenient for travel, but it’s too expensive to keep for that purpose. Not awful, but didn’t work well enough for me
