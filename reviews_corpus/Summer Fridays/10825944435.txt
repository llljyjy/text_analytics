This was the cream I picked up after finishing my more emollient moisturizers since my skin was getting pretty congested (on my forehead). This stuff is stunning. Dewy enough and moisturizing enough for winter time (for me personally, but be mindful that I use a lot of serums). I didn’t notice any breakouts with it (knocking on the wood); pairs amazingly with Tatcha’s new toner in the green bottle. Good for combo leaning dry skin
