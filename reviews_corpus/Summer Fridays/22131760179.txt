I really enjoyed using this product, and was super impressed by the overall formula. One pump was enough to cover my entire face and neck (two felt like a bit too much), and it made my skin feel so plump and hydrated unlike any other hydrating serum I’ve used before. That being said, you definitely don’t need to spend this much for a hydrating serum. There are several budget-friendly options which are just as effective, but maybe don’t deliver as much as this one in terms of cosmetic elegance and overall experience. I wouldn’t repurchase myself given the price, but am very happy with my choice to splurge and give it a try. If it is in your budget or you’re wanting to splurge, I highly recommend! nan
