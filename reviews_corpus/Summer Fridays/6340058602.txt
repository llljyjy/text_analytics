This is my very first Summer Fridays product I’ve ever tried, and I’m in love! I live in a very dry climate and need all of the hydration I can get, and this gets the job done. The jelly-serum texture is super satisfying, and my skin seriously drinks it right up! I apply this every AM and PM before my moisturizer and I feel like it adds an extra layer of dewy hydration. If you need a double dose of hydration, this is your new favorite for sure. Dewy, Plump Skin!
