Summer Fridays gifted me the Light Aura Vitamin C + Peptide Eye Cream in exchange for my honest review and opinion. Im 100% in love, this eye cream has the consistency of a pudding, and leaves your skin feeling perfectly moisturized and not greasy. Additionally, it doesn’t rub away very easily, so you don’t have to worry about your eyes burning if you have an itch later in the day. If you have fussy skin where moisturizer either soaks in almost immediately, or just greases up and sits on the surface, this will be absolutely perfect for your skin. A added bonus is that it works amazingly well for sensitive skin. I totally recommend giving Summer Fridays Light Aura Vitamin C + Peptide Eye Cream you won’t be disappointed. Absolute game changer
