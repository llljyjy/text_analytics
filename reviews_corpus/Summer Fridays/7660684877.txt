There isn’t a time of day that I don’t like using this gloss. It gives me instant hydration without the sticky mess. It smells delicious and lasts a long time. The applicator hugs my lips comfortably and applies the perfect amount. They use great ingredients and it doesn’t go unnoticed! It really is a supreme lip gloss and I will keep it in my bag and continue to repurchase. I can’t wait to buy vanilla beige and brown sugar. Addictingly gorgeous
