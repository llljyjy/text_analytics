I just did a review on Poppy and needed to do one for my fav! I love the formula, and it is literally so buttery; I can apply this every second (poppy isn’t as buttery, I find), and the vanilla scent is so addicting! My lips feel so plumed and moisturized, and the colour is very lovely! It is not pigmented by any means, but you still get colour on your lips (depending on how pigmented your lips are). I find the shade or not that the formula is very lovely and will continue to purchase! I hope they bring back the darker shade they had during the holidays! But I love Beige Vanille! The applicator does get a tad messy around the tip, but it’s expected with a squeeze tube! Lately, I’ve been gravitating towards a squeeze tube as they are super fast to apply! Great product! And recommended as an anytime-use product, whether you’re going out or not, it’s a staple! Beige Vanille loveee :D
