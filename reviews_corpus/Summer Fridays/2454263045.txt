I have some discoloration and dark circles around my eye. I thought this would be just what I needed, but I’m not impressed. There are eye creams that are better at color correcting and brightening, and there are eye creams that are better at hydrating and smoothing. I’m going to keep this bc it’s not terrible but definitely won’t repurchase. not bad but not great
