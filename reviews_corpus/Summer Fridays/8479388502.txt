After putting this on under my eyes after cleansing my face, I felt an instant rejuvenation. I would describe this product as refreshing, thick, and ultra hydrating. Since the consistency is on the thicker side, this cream is truly hydrating and feels luxurious under the eyes. Everything about this product screams fresh and new including the almost none existing scent, which I love especially because it’s going near/under the eyes. It gives a nice firm to the eyes while bringing the nutrients needed for a healthy under eye. Overall great product and can’t wait to continue to use it! Reviving in many ways…
