Summer Fridays gifted me this lip balm on exchange for my honest review. The only way I could love this more is if it were as thick as their OG formula (metal tube.) Loved that stuff!! ðŸ’ž This is a non-sticky, buttery silky lip balm that lasts a long time on the lips and provides hydration throughout the wear. Itâ€™s nice and plumping too. Highly recommend. nan
