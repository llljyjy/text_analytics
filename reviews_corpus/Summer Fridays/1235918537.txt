Usually I can’t use Vitamin C products due to irritation but this one really works for me and doesn’t cause any irritation.  It also smells amazing and dries within a minute. I use it right after cleansing, then follow up with eye cream and moisturizer. I only use it in my morning routine and love the way it makes my skin feel.  Haven’t noticed any dark spots fading yet but I’m giving it time. Will definitely purchase again. One drop covers my entire face. Smells amazing and not irritating!
