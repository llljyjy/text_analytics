I have super reactive skin (to irritation and acne) and this is a game changer! I have been using it as my morning moisturizer during hotter months and as a serum the majority of the year. I notice a difference when I use this with redness, irritation, and hydration! I will be keeping this in my routine for sure! A PACKAGING TIP ONCE PRODUCT IS LOW: once it gets low, all you have to do is hold it up to light to find out which side the straw of the pump it is resting against and gently hit it against your hand tilted toward that side to get the product to concentrate under the little straw, then pump it out. I have been able to get aaaaalmost every drop out of it once I did that. Believe the hype!
