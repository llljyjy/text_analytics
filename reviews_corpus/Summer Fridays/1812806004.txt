Very gentle on my sensitive skin. I appreciate that it’s lightweight and not too heavy, not too thin, but a just right consistency. Also love that it’s fragrance free. When my skin is drier, or needs a little extra care after using an exfoliator, I love using this before my moisturizer. In the mornings, I just use a vitamin c serum with this after and I don’t need any other moisturizer. Only reason it isn’t 5 stars is that it doesn’t visibly reduce redness long term that I can tell. I have keratosis pilaris, giving me always red cheeks, and it doesn’t seem to help with that redness. Great for sensitive skin
