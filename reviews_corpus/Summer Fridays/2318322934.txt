I got this in the mail today and the packaging immediately broke on me. There is a lot of pressure in the tube and you have to push a decent amount to get the product out. Once I pushed down, the tube popped at the end of it. Luckily not too much product came out and I was able to fix the tube by melting the plastic at  the end of it with a lighter. The product itself is really nice. Nice scent and it is hydrating on the lips. However, the company needs to rethink the packaging. needs new packaging
