I’m giving it 3 stars bc I honestly needed something like this and this was exactly what I was looking for but… it broke me out. I have extremely sensitive skin, been on accutane, done it all, tried it all. So sad about this. Gonna have to return. If you’re not super acne prone I would give it a try because it gives you that glowwy hydration that we all want, and it looked amazing under makeup. Sad about this one:( loved but…. broke me out
