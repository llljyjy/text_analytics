I received a sample of a face oil from a different line and, while it did turn me on to oils, I thought I could find something better. This oil does an amazing job of locking in hydrating, subtly primping, and adding a dewy glow. My skin can be acne prone at times, but I haven’t had any blemishes due to this product. Compared to DE’s oil, the Summer Friday oil has a thicker consistency, but I feel it absorbs better than the thinner DE product. Compared to Saint Jane’s face oil, this SF oil doesn’t seem to calm  and even skin tone quite as well, but the texture, hydration, plumping, not to mention the price tag, makes this a clear winner between the two. As the last step in my nighttime routine, I warm a few drops of oil and press it into my skin. I also sometimes use a little on my upper cheeks before applying makeup the give it a dewy, healthy glow. Lightweight, intense moisture and a beautiful glow
