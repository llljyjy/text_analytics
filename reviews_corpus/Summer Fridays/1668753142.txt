This has helped my dry spring skin. Working out and working from home in GA caused havoc with my skin. The air in my home is dry. Combined with humidity, it’s awful. I use this during my am routine with a glow oil and sunscreen. I don’t typically like a dewy look. This gives me glow without, oily. I still use a sheer powder on my T-Zone. This will stay in rotation. Great Addition
