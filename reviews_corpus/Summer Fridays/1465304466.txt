I was a little disappointed in this product. And I hate to say this bc I loooove this company. What I look for in an eye cream is to give me firmness, tighten under my eye, moisturize and reduce the look of dark circles. This product definitely did illuminate my under eyes. Although I didnâ€™t get the firming/moisturizing that I was looking for. This being said , I am 39 and maybe this product is aimed at a younger population. Needing a little more tightening.
