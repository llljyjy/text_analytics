I received the product as a gift from Summer Fridays in exchange for my opinion. Wow, first of all, this is such a beautiful eye cream. It was my first time trying Summer Fridays and I am impressed. First thing you notice when opening is this glittery, shiny eye cream. But when you apply it on your skin, it isn’t shiny or glittery at all. It glides on so well and smooth. Eye cream isn’t strong at all so it worked well on my sensitive skin. Peptide helps make my skin appear more plump. I love that my eyes are looking glowy and dewey. nan
