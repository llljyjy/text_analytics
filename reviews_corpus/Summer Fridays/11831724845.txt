My skin loves this stuff. I’d used in the past and kinda forgot about but Since changing my contraception a year ago I’ve been breaking out really bad and I’m a face picker… my face was red blotchy blackheads oily and dry. This saved me. Pretty immediate results in terms of calming my sling and healing freshly picked spots. Long term pores cleared up and I feel like my ph is back in balance. Not too oily not to dry.
