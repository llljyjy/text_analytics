This is my first summer Fridays product and I now understand they hype. This lip butter is heavenly. It smells mildly of vanilla, it is a bit thick to give some weight but not too heavy, and it keeps my lips soft and moisturized for hours! When the gloss is off, my lips are still so soft. This goes everywhere with me now! Super soft lips!
