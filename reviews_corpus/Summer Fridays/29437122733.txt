I received the product complimentary from Summer Fridays. I like the eye cream for its vitamin C and peptide blend, and it is very hydrating and soothing. It looks orange in the bottle but doesnâ€™t have any color when applied. It does seem to have quite some glitter which makes the under eye area glowy. I feel it will be better to use before makeup. nan
