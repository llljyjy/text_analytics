I lovee this lip mask I use it over night so I could stop putting Vaseline on my lips, and I wake up with soft lips. When applied during the day it lasts about 4 hours before I have to re-apply. Only use the needed amount so it doesnâ€™t get too sticky. It smells just like vanilla cupcakes which is a plus! Supple Sweet Lips
