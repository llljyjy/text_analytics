Ordered after trying a sample.  Smells like marshmallows, thick like Vaseline but more repairative. A bit sticky at first, but so effective I donâ€™t mind.  Nice applicator as well. Will absolutely reorder - has replaced laneige sleeping mask for me. My lips tend to be picky, and chap/split easily, but have weathered the Canadian winter nicely thanks to this balm. Thick vanilla goodness
