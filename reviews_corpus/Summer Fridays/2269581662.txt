Really liking this new product from Summer Fridays! Was excited to order and it has delivered. Have been using it for about a week and it’s been a great addition to my morning routine. Price is a little high for how small the jar is however a little goes a long way. Really really easy to tap in. I’ve had thick eye creams before that are impossible to spread without stretching the skin and this eye cream is super easy to apply. No extreme scents. My favourite feature was that I noticed my under eyes look SO hydrated and hide/illuminate them. If you work from home it’s a great addition looks amazing on zoom calls haha. nan
