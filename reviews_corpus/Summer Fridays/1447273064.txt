My only gripe is bc of the work it takes to wash off (pro-tip, use the wash cloth) BUT this product makes a difference. I use after a long few days of events, drinking, little sleep, etc and this mask gives your face some life back- glowy and exfoliated- much brighter than before. I rotate between this and DEâ€™s Baby Facial when my face is in SOS mode. Just use a wash cloth to remove
