I was so excited to be able to sample a product from Summer Fridays. I’d heard such wonderful things and I wasn’t let down at all. For starters, the consistency is great, not thick at all. Perfect for an eye cream for makeup users especially. It soaks in so well so that my makeup goes on seamlessly. Immediately after use I noticed my under eye area was so moisturized and plump. I definitely plan on purchasing this. Thank you! Best eye cream I’ve tried in awhile!
