This could not have come at a better time!!NYC has been brutal lately and I have had to lay off on the acids after multiple instances of destroying my skin barrier. I love this serum because it is substantial and I feel like it does a great job at providing needed moisture to my skin and repairing the skin barrier damage I cause it. This will def be a staple for me to use interchangeably with my tretinoin and acids. I will say the price point is fairly higher than normal for me but I can feel the quality of ingredients on my skin that I think itâ€™s def worth it. Great for restoring your skin barrier!
