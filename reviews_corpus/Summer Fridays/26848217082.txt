I tried this as an everyday moisturizer and was excited about it being an oil-free gel and I have combination/oily skin. Unfortunately it was still too heavy for me and causes some breakouts (sometimes) in both summer and winter. I still like the smell of the product and the feel of it when it goes on, so I gave it three stars. I’m glad I tried it but I won’t be choosing this one again. It's ok.
