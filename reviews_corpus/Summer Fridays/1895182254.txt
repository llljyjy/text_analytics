I have very extreme combo skin(oily but also super dry). I have been using this every morning and under my makeup and my face feels soooo great! The winter usually really dries out my skin and I am finding this moisturizer to stay hydrating all day without any breakouts or anything since I have oily skin. The consistency is perfect and not too heavy like some moisturizers. I am obsessed and the whole packaging is adorable! Moisturizer of my dreams!
