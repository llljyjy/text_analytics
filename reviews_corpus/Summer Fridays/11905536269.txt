- I like this serum’s creamy gel texture because it’s lightweight for my oily-combo skin - It absorbs quickly & leaves me with a dewy and non-greasy finish- I feel that this is very consistent in plumping & softening my face with any combination of skincare products used- This isn’t overbearing in hydration as I didn’t notice any excess oil production or unwanted shine- I think this is a good base serum, especially on top of your toner/essence, because this contains ingredients with humectant properties- This serum is very easy to layer with other products & also acts as a nice hydrating primer if you use powdered foundation- Overall, I’m in favor of this launch because of how refreshing & effective the serum’s ingredients feel! I highly recommend this for acne-prone & oily-combo skin because it’s not heavy or tacky and is also great in hot/humid climates. I’m not sure if Dream Oasis is enough hydration for those with dry skin, but I can attest it’s very pleasant to layer with a full skincare routine.-Follow @sassandskincare on Instagram for more honest skincare reviews-Gifted by Summer Fridays Lightweight Gel Serum for a Dewy Glow
