The lip balm smells and tastes really good & it stays for quite some time. However, it is INCREDIBLY liquid. It’s targeted as something that should feel like “butter” (literally, the name)…. And instead it’s more like water with a little more grip. If you want more of a liquid gloss type of product then I would recommend- it’s just, that’s not what it was advertised as. Too liquid for me!
