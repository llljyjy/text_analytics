Best thing ever! I used to love this but precious packaging was so horrible that after a couple of uses, I threw it away because of it oozing out so much. But now that they have the new packing, I’m obsessed again! I love the squeeze tube they have now! The smell is just as amazing as I remembered, very warm vanilla. It’s like eating dark sugar. The lip balm is super hydrating and shiny. I use it as a night time lip balm and sometimes day time. It lasts all through the night for me! Love, love! Favorite Lip Balm
