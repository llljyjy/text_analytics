I was gifted this product by Summer Fridays for my honest review. I was very excited to try this out as I’m a huge fan of their CC Me Serum and hoped that this would be great too. First impressions: - Very light scent. Smells faintly like some kind of yogurt or cream food? Can’t place my finger on it.- Cream is shimmery!- Feels luxurious but not heavy. Very moisturizing. - Leaves my eyes tingling for a while after applying.  After 2 days of use my dark circles already appeared lighter with no product on my skin. I was impressed. The shimmer is great for brightening effect as well. But I feel that it looks a bit like I’m wearing light makeup, and I usually prefer to look like I’m not wearing any. So that’s a minor thing but it’s personal preference. I do have oily lids and find that these can move a little at end of day and sting my eyes slightly if I apply the cream too close to my lash line. But it doesn’t happen so long as I’m careful. Overall I’m very happy with this. Likely HG if it continues to perform in long term use. nan
