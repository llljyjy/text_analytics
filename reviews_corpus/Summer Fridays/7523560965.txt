The first thing I noticed when I opened this Lip Butter Balm from Summer Fridays was the AMAZING, sweet vanilla scent.  I love the way it instantly nourishes and moisturizes my lips leaving them silky soft.  The applicator tip is shaped to hug the natural curve of your lips too.  Iâ€™ve never seen one like it before.  It also makes my lips shiny like a gloss does but without any stickiness.  I know one thing for sure, I will not have dried, chapped lips this fall/winter now that I have this. Leave Lips Silky Soft
