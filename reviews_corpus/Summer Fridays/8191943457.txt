I absolutely love this mask (which I use as a moisturizer before putting on my cetaphil moisturizer), and am already on my third tube! I’ve seen a lot of complaints about the “new formula” versus the old formula, and although I first tried this product when the formula had already changed, I don’t find that it has broken me out whatsoever. I had horrible texture from using the Inkey List Salicylic Acid Cleanser and this mask (paired with Summer Fridays super amino gel cleanser), has been my HOLY GRAIL COMBO for my skincare. I have super sensitive and acne prone skin, but this product just really works well for me. Again, everyone’s skin reacts differently to products, so if you’re able to get a trial size/sample size, I would definitely try it out first before purchasing the larger sizes (as it is on the pricier side). Overall, this product really softens my skin and locks in moisture when paired with my cetaphil moisturizer and I have 0 complaints about this mask! HUGE FAN!!!!
