I loveeee this product and keep repurchasing!! The texture is so rich and creamy, and itâ€™s so gentle on my sensitive skin. I apply a generous amount at night as my last step and wake up with hydrated, radiant and glowy skin. It soothes any irritation and smoothes texture overnight. If you suffer from dry, dull skin then I suggest trying this!! The holy grail of holy grails!
