I’m liking this. I’ve used face oils before but they were more like a “dry oil“ This one I was surprised to find out has a sticky feel. But honestly, I don’t mind it. I tap it on to my skin rather than rubbing. Have I noticed any dramatic changes to my skin? - No. But I feel like it is doing it’s job. I put it on after moisturizing to sort of lock the moisture in and double down on hydration. And I feel like that is happening. I would probably repurchase this. nan
