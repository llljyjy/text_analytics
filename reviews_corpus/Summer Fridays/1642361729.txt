Love love love this serum from Summer Fridays! I like to use it on damp skin after cleansing, especially this time of year when the weather is cold and dry. It really gives my skin that extra oomph of moisture that it needs. Also sits really nicely under my other products and make up.Gifted by Summer Fridays. nan
