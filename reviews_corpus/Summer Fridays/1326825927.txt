My favorite moisturizer! My skin is sensitive and prone to breakouts, especially when trying new products. Jet Lag has never caused a problem. I was hesitant to try it because I worried it might be too heavy for my skin, but itâ€™s absolutely perfect. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling fresh and hydrated, never greasy. nan
