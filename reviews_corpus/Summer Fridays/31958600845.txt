Okay hear me out. A moisturizer, instead of a mask. Literally THE BEST MOISTURIZER YOU’ll EVER USE. I swear to you, this is amazing. Didn’t break me out at all, and it didn’t bother my sensitive skin AT ALL. I keep this on deck at all times. I use it morning and night as a moisturizer and I swear I wake up looking 5 years younger. Keeps me moisturized throughout the ENTIRE DAY! You need this, I promise. Licensed Esthetician here
