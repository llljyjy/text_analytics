I really really wanted to like this but… I’ve been trying this for a while and I think this formula is too thick for me. I prefer something juicier and lighter feeling. This had an amazing strong vanilla scent however it felt like it was like wearing carmex? It felt like it sat on top. If you have chapped lips - this would be my number one choice. Cute packaging and highly recommended for dry lips. Strong vanilla scent
