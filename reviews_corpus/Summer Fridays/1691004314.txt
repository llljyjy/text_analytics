I have been using this for about 1.5 weeks now and I haven’t noticed much difference honestly. I noticed some tingling/stinging around the eye area when I first started it and will say I have VERY sensitive skin so I don’t know that everyone would expect to feel that. I will keep using but as of now Im “meh“ about it. OK- haven't noticed much difference if any
