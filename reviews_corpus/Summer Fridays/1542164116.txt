Ok, so! I have really sensitive skin AND with combo skin that had major dry patches, under eye being one of them. I have been looking for an eye cream that wouldn’t dry out when I would bake. This is the FIRST eye cream that does that. Trust me, I have tried SO many different brands. This is the first one that I can apply in the morning and my skin still feels soft and moisturized by the end of the day, with or without make up.  As a bonus, it’s a clean product! I have become a HUGE fan of Summer Fridays products. If you have extreme combo skin like mine, where oily patches are super oily and dry patches are really dry, also try the cloud dew oil-free dew moisturizer. It basically regulates and moisturizes both extremes really well. nan
