I’m a serum junkie who always has to try something new, but I’ve now purchased this one multiple times in a row as I love it so much. I have combination skin that tends to be dry, and this offers a nice dose of hydration along with my moisturizer. It has no scent (or if it does, it’s undetectable). Plus, it has clean ingredients which is something I appreciate. I noticed a negative difference in my skin when I forgot to pack it on a week long trip. If you need an extra boost of hydration in your routine, I highly recommend trying this serum. Very hydrating
