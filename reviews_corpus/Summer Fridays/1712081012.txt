This product was gifted by Summer Fridays in exchange for my honest review. If you have dry skin, but prefer weightless hydration without the greasiness, then look no further.  You will appreciate this weightless serum!The Dream Oasis Deep Hydration Serum contains an effective combination of ingredients for hydrating your skin.  squalane- one of my favorite skincare ingredients. This helps skin maintain moisture without that greasy feeling. Typically, it’s lightweight.  glycerin- helps moisturize and soften skin…even effective in very dry skin. hyaluronic acid- another effective hydrating ingredient for the skin.  This draws in moisture and keeps it in, making skin look plump and hydrated. My thoughts:The packaging is high beautiful! I love skincare products that are packaged in glass bottles- it  adds a certain flair. I used this after cleansing my face and applying essence water but before moisturizer. I absolutely love the texture of this serum! It’s exactly the type of texture I love. It’s milky, lightweight and thin. It glides on my skin like silk! This absorbed quickly. Even after it was fully absorbed, I could still feel the moisture barrier there working for my skin. I love how this lightweight, yet amazingly hydrating, serum feels on my face. It makes my face supple, soft and hydrated.Definitely recommend! Nice texture!
