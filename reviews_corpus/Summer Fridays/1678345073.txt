I typically donâ€™t use eye creams but I was sent this one to try so I decided to give it a go and I love it! This cream is very brightening and has a smooth consistency. It absorbs well into my oily combo skin and does not feel greasy! I have dark circles under my eyes and this cream definitely blurs them. This is my new go-to eye cream! nan
