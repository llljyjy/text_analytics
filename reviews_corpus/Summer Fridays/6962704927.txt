I absolutely loveeeeeeeeee this product! I love the applicator and that it is a liquid balm! I love that even if I leave it in my hot car, it still applies beautifully and remaining the same consistency! It also smells amazing! It worked so well on my chapped lips, kept them very hydrated and I noticed a difference within a day! I will most definitely plan to repurchase and I literally just ordered the vanilla shade minutes ago! Love Love Love WOW, I love it!!
