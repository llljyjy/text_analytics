I live in the Northeast and have super sensitive skin - a combo that’s made it hard for me to find a good winter eye cream, especially one with Vitamin C. This cream is super light but ultra moisturizing and immediately cleared up some redness and dryness I was getting around my eyes from the recent drop in temperature. Will report back again after using it for a few months, but I’m already impressed! Already in Love
