Oh my goodness not good!! I got little bumps all over my face recently and I didn’t know what it was from. After reading reviews I noticed some people said this product caused this to their skin and once I stopped using it the bumps started getting better. I’m so disappointed this was not cheap and now my skin has to heal. So Disappointed
