I’m in my late 20’s so I don’t play when it comes to eye cream lol! I’ve tried a lot of creams, but this one definitely takes the cake. Not only do I love the texture of the product itself, but I love the texture when its applied too. Sometimes I’ve found eye creams can have a weird texture on skin when applied, but this was perfect! Absolute new fave, 10/10!
