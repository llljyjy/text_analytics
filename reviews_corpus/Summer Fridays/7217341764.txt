i knew i had to try this as soon as i saw that it has hyaluronic acid, squalene, and glycerin—some of my favorite ingredients in one product!! i love how lightweight yet still hydrating this is. my skin’s been drier than usual lately because of the weather so i could use all the help i can get. it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed. i’m looking forward to seeing the long-term effects.disclaimer: i received this complimentary from summer fridays. nan
