My dry skin loves this oil, all it takes is 2 drops to seal in my moisturizer and I am set all night. It feels so luxurious on my skin and since iâ€™ve started to use it in combination with a super thick moisturizer, my acne has gone down considerably. (its a great oil to help counter the drying effects of benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid fyi which has also been helping with the acne obviously) 10/10 Heavenly is absolutely correct
