I like a cream gel moisturizer for daytime use.  My skin is combination but dehydrated so I prefer a lightweight moisturizer during the day with a heavier night cream.  I saw some reviews of this product and have been using it for about a week and so far so good.  Lightweight and not sticky while giving a nice dose of hydration to my skin.  Pairs well with my daytime serum and works well under makeup.  No scent Lightweight and hydrating
