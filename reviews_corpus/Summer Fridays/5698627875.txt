Got the vanilla beige lip balm and I’ve been enjoying it a lot this past 2 weeks and my fave thing is the scent and packaging. It smells like a warm vanilla cookie and it applies is really well on the lips, the shape of the applicator is great. The formula of the product is very nice too, it doesn’t dry out the lips and it l lasts a good amount on the lips. Nice
