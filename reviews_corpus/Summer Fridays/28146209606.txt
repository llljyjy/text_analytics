With this serum, a little goes a long way. Be sure to wash your hands first before applying! I use this in the AM and PM now after I cleanse my face. I switched this out with my previous Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Serum  because of the additional hydrating ingredients of glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and squalane which help with the moisture barrier as well. I use 1 pump for my face and 1 additional pump for my neck after I cleanse my face. I have seen a difference in my skin within the one week I have been using it. It absorbs so nicely into and does not make me feel greasy. Since it absorbs well and I felt an immediate plump after using it. Overall, my skin feels smoother and looks brighter. I am able to layer my other skincare on top of this serum without pilling. I plan to continue using this serum and buying more when I run out. I recommend giving this product a try! Amazing Hydrating Serum!
