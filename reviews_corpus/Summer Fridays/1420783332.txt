I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews and after the first couple of uses (1-3) I started breaking out. I knew it was from the product because Iâ€™d get pimples in unusual places where I only used the produce (neck, temples of my forehead, etc.) I stopped using it and my skin went back to normal. I tried it again to make sure it was the product and broke out again. Would not recommend it. Especially for the price. Made me break out!
