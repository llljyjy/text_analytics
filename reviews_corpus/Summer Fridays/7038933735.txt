I love this product so much! I started using when it was colder out and layered it with a moisturizer, but now that it is warmer I use it as my final step and more like a moisturizer. it has been incredible for my skin. I love that it works well with other products and SPF, helps my dry skin and gives a nice glow. A little goes a long way too! Absolutely love this product - will keep buying
