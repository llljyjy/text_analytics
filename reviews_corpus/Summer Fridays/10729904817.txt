This eye cream does absolute wonders! It’s a perfect consistency and a little goes a long way. The amount of hydration the Ligh Aura gives you is better than any eye cream I’ve ever used, and I have tried a ton. It gives you the perfect amount of brightness and I love to use it as a base along with moisturizer for my makeup. Over time I have seen a huge improvement in the appearance of my undereye circles thanks to this!! Holy Hydration!!
