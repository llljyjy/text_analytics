I really love this Summer Fridays lip butter balm in the scent vanilla. It smells like birthday cake and vanilla ice cream to me. Its a very nice vanilla scent and smells quite accurately like natural and real vanilla beans. The scent is uplifting for me. I also like the way the balm itself is. This is very soothing and hydrating for my lips. Also the packaging is good and this is easy to apply. Its also small enough to fit in my purse or pocket. Overall, I highly recommend this. Its a great vanilla lip balm!I received this product complimentary from Summer Fridays. All opinions are my own. nan
