I’ve loved Summer Fridays ever since their Jet Lag Mask launched years ago, so I was so excited to try out this new launch! The Dream Oasis Deep Hydration Serum is incredibly lightweight and absorbs seamlessly into my skin to give it a plump, hydrated look and feel. It’s formulated with squalane, glycerin, and hyaluronic-acid, and I love that it’s oil-free for my combination skin. It also has a blend of aloe and chamomile to calm and comfort your skin! I’d definitely recommend trying this out for yourself. This was gifted by Summer Fridays. nan
