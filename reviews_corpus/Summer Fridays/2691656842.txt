I’ve been loving this product for the last month or so, and it really helps hydrate my dry skin. It’s a thicker serum (some might consider it a lightweight moisturizer) so I usually use it toward the end of my skincare routine, after I’ve put on my thinner serums. Because I have dry skin, I still need to use a moisturizer after applying this but if you’re skin is oily to combination, you may find that this is a great moisturizer! The packaging is glass, which only makes me enjoy using the product even more, and it’s easy to dispense the serum. Overall, I recommend this product and will likely repurchase. Great Addition to My Routine!
