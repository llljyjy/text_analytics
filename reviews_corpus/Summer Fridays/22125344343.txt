My skin has been pretty rough lately since my dermatologist prescribed a retinoid for my acne, but this stuff is bonkers amazing. My skin was literally peeling off my face (gross, I know) and I even had what seemed like little burns on my face. But I applied this one night and the next morning it was all almost gone. It soothed my dry patches and my acne even looks less angry. Would definitely recommend! Works wonders
